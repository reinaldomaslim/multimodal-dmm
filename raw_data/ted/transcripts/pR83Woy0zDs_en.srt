1
0:00:13.317,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a lion conservationist.

2
0:00:15.309,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Sounds cool, doesn't it?

3
0:00:17.19,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Some people may have no idea what that means.

4
0:00:20.405,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But I'm sure you've all heard about Cecil the lion.

5
0:00:23.438,000 --> 0:00:24,000
[Cecil the Lion (2002-2015)]

6
0:00:25.007,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Lion roaring)

7
0:00:31.744,000 --> 0:00:33,000
He roars no more.

8
0:00:34.044,000 --> 0:00:36,000
On the second of July, 2015,

9
0:00:36.696,000 --> 0:00:39,000
his life was cut short when he was killed by a trophy hunter.

10
0:00:41.069,000 --> 0:00:44,000
They say that you can become attached to the animals you study.

11
0:00:44.919,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That was the case for me with Cecil the lion,

12
0:00:47.665,000 --> 0:00:49,000
having known him and studied him for three years

13
0:00:49.99,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in Hwange National Park.

14
0:00:52.411,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was heartbroken at his death.

15
0:00:56.061,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But the good thing to come out of this tragedy

16
0:00:58.61,000 --> 0:01:,000
is the attention that the story brought

17
0:01:00.903,000 --> 0:01:03,000
towards the plight of threatened wild animals.

18
0:01:04.101,000 --> 0:01:06,000
After Cecil's death,

19
0:01:06.22,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I began to ask myself these questions:

20
0:01:09.046,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What if the community that lived next to Cecil the lion

21
0:01:13.057,000 --> 0:01:15,000
was involved in protecting him?

22
0:01:15.572,000 --> 0:01:2,000
What if I had met Cecil when I was 10 years old, instead of 29?

23
0:01:21.458,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Could I or my classmates have changed his fate?

24
0:01:25.212,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Many people are working to stop lions from disappearing,

25
0:01:28.95,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but very few of these people are native to these countries

26
0:01:32.641,000 --> 0:01:34,000
or from the communities most affected.

27
0:01:35.601,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But the communities that live with the lions

28
0:01:38.07,000 --> 0:01:41,000
are the ones best positioned to help lions the most.

29
0:01:42.268,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Local people should be at the forefront

30
0:01:44.625,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of the solutions to the challenges facing their wildlife.

31
0:01:48.212,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Sometimes, change can only come

32
0:01:50.331,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when the people most affected and impacted take charge.

33
0:01:54.537,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Local communities play an important role

34
0:01:56.759,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in fighting poaching and illegal wildlife trade,

35
0:01:59.965,000 --> 0:02:02,000
which are major threats affecting lions and other wildlife.

36
0:02:04.395,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Being a black African woman in the sciences,

37
0:02:07.244,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the people I meet are always curious to know

38
0:02:09.826,000 --> 0:02:11,000
if I've always wanted to be a conservationist,

39
0:02:12.49,000 --> 0:02:14,000
because they don't meet a lot of conservationists

40
0:02:14.823,000 --> 0:02:15,000
who look like me.

41
0:02:16.228,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When I was growing up,

42
0:02:17.403,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I didn't even know that wildlife conservation was a career.

43
0:02:20.8,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The first time I saw a wild animal in my home country

44
0:02:24.038,000 --> 0:02:26,000
was when I was 25 years old,

45
0:02:26.688,000 --> 0:02:28,000
even though lions and African wild dogs

46
0:02:29.165,000 --> 0:02:31,000
lived just a few miles away from my home.

47
0:02:32.815,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is quite common in Zimbabwe,

48
0:02:35.165,000 --> 0:02:37,000
as many people are not exposed to wildlife,

49
0:02:37.855,000 --> 0:02:39,000
even though it's part of our heritage.

50
0:02:40.533,000 --> 0:02:41,000
When I was growing up,

51
0:02:42.096,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I didn't even know that lions lived in my backyard.

52
0:02:46.088,000 --> 0:02:48,000
When I stepped into Savé Valley Conservancy

53
0:02:48.842,000 --> 0:02:51,000
on a cold winter morning 10 years ago

54
0:02:51.934,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to study African wild dogs for my master's research project,

55
0:02:56.142,000 --> 0:03:,000
I was mesmerized by the beauty and the tranquility that surrounded me.

56
0:03:00.701,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I felt like I had found my passion and my purpose in life.

57
0:03:04.401,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I made a commitment that day

58
0:03:06.361,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that I was going to dedicate my life to protecting animals.

59
0:03:09.742,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I think of my childhood school days in Zimbabwe

60
0:03:12.639,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the other kids I was in school with.

61
0:03:15.109,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Perhaps if we had a chance to interact with wildlife,

62
0:03:19.339,000 --> 0:03:22,000
more of my classmates would be working alongside me now.

63
0:03:23.458,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Unless the local communities want to protect and coexist with wildlife,

64
0:03:28.363,000 --> 0:03:3,000
all conservation efforts might be in vain.

65
0:03:31.616,000 --> 0:03:33,000
These are the communities that live with the wild animals

66
0:03:34.617,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in the same ecosystem

67
0:03:36.276,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and bear the cost of doing so.

68
0:03:39.109,000 --> 0:03:41,000
If they don't have a direct connection

69
0:03:41.411,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or benefit from the animals,

70
0:03:43.601,000 --> 0:03:45,000
they have no reason to want to protect them.

71
0:03:46.649,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And if local communities don't protect their wildlife,

72
0:03:49.784,000 --> 0:03:52,000
no amount of outside intervention will work.

73
0:03:53.728,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So what needs to be done?

74
0:03:56.688,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Conservationists must prioritize environmental education

75
0:04:00.173,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and help expand the community's skills to conserve their wildlife.

76
0:04:04.426,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Schoolchildren and communities must be taken to national parks,

77
0:04:08.101,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so they get a chance to connect with the wildlife.

78
0:04:11.776,000 --> 0:04:13,000
At every effort and every level,

79
0:04:14.482,000 --> 0:04:16,000
conservation must include the economies of the people

80
0:04:17.499,000 --> 0:04:19,000
who share the land with the wild animals.

81
0:04:20.872,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It is also critical that local conservationists

82
0:04:24.023,000 --> 0:04:27,000
be part of every conservation effort,

83
0:04:27.115,000 --> 0:04:31,000
if we are to build trust and really embed conservation into communities.

84
0:04:31.974,000 --> 0:04:34,000
As local conservationists, we face many hurdles,

85
0:04:35.484,000 --> 0:04:39,000
from outright discrimination to barriers because of cultural norms.

86
0:04:40.133,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But I will not give up my efforts

87
0:04:42.522,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to bring indigenous communities to this fight

88
0:04:45.089,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for the survival of our planet.

89
0:04:47.712,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I'm asking you to come and stand together with me.

90
0:04:50.783,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We must actively dismantle the hurdles we have created,

91
0:04:54.268,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which are leaving indigenous populations out of conservation efforts.

92
0:04:58.474,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I've dedicated my life to protecting lions.

93
0:05:01.641,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I know my neighbor would, too,

94
0:05:03.998,000 --> 0:05:07,000
if only they knew the animals that lived next door to them.

95
0:05:08.984,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Thank you.

96
0:05:10.182,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.024,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Paleontology,

2
0:00:14.778,000 --> 0:00:16,000
a science geared towards small children,

3
0:00:17.643,000 --> 0:00:19,000
focused on digging up dinosaurs

4
0:00:20.556,000 --> 0:00:22,000
while sporting a "Jurassic Park" costume.

5
0:00:23.188,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Skulls are popped out of the ground

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and put on display for public gawking.

7
0:00:28.204,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The relevance of this, beyond clickbait, coloring books and monster movies

8
0:00:32.975,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is unknown.

9
0:00:34.792,000 --> 0:00:35,000
No ...

10
0:00:36.357,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Wait.

11
0:00:38.801,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That's not paleontology at all.

12
0:00:41.815,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Paleontology is nothing less than the study of past life.

13
0:00:45.989,000 --> 0:00:46,000
All past life.

14
0:00:47.569,000 --> 0:00:49,000
From ancestors to alien forms.

15
0:00:50.693,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It involves fundamental questions like "Who are we?"

16
0:00:54.36,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And "How did we get here?" --

17
0:00:56.066,000 --> 0:00:58,000
using the broadest possible definition of "we":

18
0:00:59.058,000 --> 0:01:,000
life itself.

19
0:01:01.714,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Dinosaurs, a category of birds,

20
0:01:04.793,000 --> 0:01:06,000
are just a small percentage of that.

21
0:01:06.984,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:08.206,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Yet they get the most media attention.

23
0:01:11.206,000 --> 0:01:14,000
[The incredible diversity of ancient life, Dinosaurs, Paleontology]

24
0:01:14.433,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's a very accurate meme; I didn't even make this one.

25
0:01:17.275,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This is just the truth.

26
0:01:18.91,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Anyway, most of us paleontologists consider dinosaurs to be a gateway drug.

27
0:01:24.919,000 --> 0:01:26,000
There is so much cooler stuff in the fossil record,

28
0:01:27.879,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and we know so much about it.

29
0:01:30.251,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Let's go on a brief, dinosaur-free tour

30
0:01:33.268,000 --> 0:01:35,000
of the last four billion years.

31
0:01:35.506,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:36.807,000 --> 0:01:37,000
First up, genetic material.

33
0:01:38.744,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Viruses, basically, started producing proteins

34
0:01:41.91,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and wrecking their environment.

35
0:01:44.514,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The Earth was infected with life.

36
0:01:47.826,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Some of these new bacteria learned how to eat sunshine,

37
0:01:51.747,000 --> 0:01:52,000
producing oxygen,

38
0:01:53.279,000 --> 0:01:54,000
pulling in carbon from the air

39
0:01:55.271,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and destroying the iron food of other microbes

40
0:01:59.099,000 --> 0:02:,000
by turning it into rust.

41
0:02:00.788,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This went on for billions of years.

42
0:02:03.581,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Some bacteria consumed other bacteria,

43
0:02:06.748,000 --> 0:02:09,000
gaining their power to turn oxygen into energy,

44
0:02:10.447,000 --> 0:02:13,000
becoming the precursors of animals and plants.

45
0:02:13.709,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But as a result, there were climate shocks,

46
0:02:16.518,000 --> 0:02:18,000
from hot to cold and back again,

47
0:02:19.029,000 --> 0:02:23,000
which ended up turning the Earth into a snowball covered with glaciers.

48
0:02:23.538,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The technical term for this time period is "Snowball Earth."

49
0:02:27.434,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:30.307,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Seven hundred, eight hundred million years ago.

51
0:02:32.752,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Anyway, microbes banded together,

52
0:02:35.361,000 --> 0:02:37,000
creating multicellular life.

53
0:02:37.696,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Six hundred million years ago,

54
0:02:39.641,000 --> 0:02:43,000
geometric colonies appeared, sucking microbes from the water.

55
0:02:43.744,000 --> 0:02:46,000
These were soon replaced by the ancestors of modern animals.

56
0:02:48.077,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The Cambrian explosion.

57
0:02:50.466,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Lobster relatives ate other animals,

58
0:02:53.657,000 --> 0:02:55,000
capturing them using their grasping arms.

59
0:02:56.749,000 --> 0:03:,000
Armored wriggling clam worms crawled across the seafloor and into it,

60
0:03:01.479,000 --> 0:03:03,000
creating new ecosystems.

61
0:03:04.097,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Our tadpole-like ancestors flitted along ancient coastlines,

62
0:03:08.427,000 --> 0:03:11,000
while their eel-like relatives with gnashing throat teeth

63
0:03:12.022,000 --> 0:03:16,000
swam above the ice-cream cone corals of the first reefs,

64
0:03:16.425,000 --> 0:03:18,000
dodging school-bus-sized krakens

65
0:03:18.481,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and hungry sea scorpions.

66
0:03:21.139,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Plant fungus came onto land.

67
0:03:23.703,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But then the glaciers returned, killing pretty much everything.

68
0:03:27.641,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But mass extinctions open opportunities.

69
0:03:30.404,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Jawless fishes invaded the ocean,

70
0:03:32.824,000 --> 0:03:35,000
sporting points, prongs, and finally, fins.

71
0:03:36.546,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Spiders, scorpions, snails and worms came onto land.

72
0:03:41.649,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Somewhere around China, a fish developed jaws,

73
0:03:45.141,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and its descendants drove jawless fishes,

74
0:03:47.792,000 --> 0:03:49,000
sea scorpions and branching plankton

75
0:03:49.919,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to extinction.

76
0:03:51.561,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Some of these fishes,

77
0:03:52.776,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which had arm bones in their fins,

78
0:03:54.696,000 --> 0:03:55,000
sprouted fingers,

79
0:03:56.165,000 --> 0:03:58,000
seven or eight per flipper.

80
0:03:59.007,000 --> 0:04:01,000
On land, plants became trees,

81
0:04:01.276,000 --> 0:04:02,000
growing massive

82
0:04:02.68,000 --> 0:04:05,000
or spreading their spores only once before dying.

83
0:04:06.617,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But then the glaciers came back again,

84
0:04:08.982,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and it was mass extinction number two.

85
0:04:11.371,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It was the age of weird fishes and plated sea lilies.

86
0:04:15.022,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Sharks with wings.

87
0:04:16.704,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Sharks with buzz saw jaws.

88
0:04:18.633,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Sharks with fins covered in tiny teeth.

89
0:04:21.323,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Sharks with crushing tooth plates.

90
0:04:23.513,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Bony fishes that looked like modern angelfish and eels

91
0:04:26.895,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for the first time.

92
0:04:28.649,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Wetlands developed,

93
0:04:30.038,000 --> 0:04:33,000
sporting ten-foot-long millipedes and giant dragon flies.

94
0:04:33.911,000 --> 0:04:36,000
These spread across the supercontinent of Pangaea and died,

95
0:04:37.498,000 --> 0:04:38,000
creating coal,

96
0:04:39.03,000 --> 0:04:42,000
leading to a 100-million-year Ice Age.

97
0:04:42.716,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Finally, vertebrates made it onto land on a permanent basis,

98
0:04:47.026,000 --> 0:04:49,000
leading to alligator-like amphibians

99
0:04:49.383,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and saber-toothed protomammals.

100
0:04:52.367,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But then, volcanoes erupted all over Siberia,

101
0:04:56.071,000 --> 0:04:57,000
everything almost died

102
0:04:57.275,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and it was mass extinction number three.

103
0:04:59.957,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:01.111,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The day life nearly died.

105
0:05:03.307,000 --> 0:05:07,000
A single, lonely tusked mammal survived and thrived,

106
0:05:08.434,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but it was soon replaced by galloping crocodiles.

107
0:05:11.615,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In the ocean, marine reptiles,

108
0:05:14.377,000 --> 0:05:18,000
giant rafts made of the living relatives of sea urchins

109
0:05:18.853,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and armored squids, ammonoids, of every kind and form.

110
0:05:24.347,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But then, Pangaea started to split apart,

111
0:05:26.784,000 --> 0:05:27,000
forming a sea of lava

112
0:05:28.505,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that would one day become the Atlantic Ocean,

113
0:05:31.284,000 --> 0:05:33,000
spewing toxic gas into the atmosphere

114
0:05:33.72,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and mass extinction number four.

115
0:05:36.195,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:37.45,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Yeah, there's actually a lot more than these five,

117
0:05:39.822,000 --> 0:05:4,000
these are the big ones.

118
0:05:41.053,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:44.662,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So, finally, there were whale-sized fishes,

120
0:05:48.814,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and modern fishes mobbed corals,

121
0:05:50.901,000 --> 0:05:55,000
made gigantic by using their captured algae to eat sunshine.

122
0:05:56.269,000 --> 0:06:,000
Crabs, stingrays and other fishes with crushing teeth appeared,

123
0:06:00.721,000 --> 0:06:01,000
smashing shells

124
0:06:01.96,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and leading to an arms race between predators and prey.

125
0:06:05.49,000 --> 0:06:07,000
There was an explosion of marine biodiversity.

126
0:06:09.244,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Mammals climbed trees, flew

127
0:06:11.458,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and did a lot of other things that are seemingly sort of modern.

128
0:06:16.238,000 --> 0:06:2,000
They were feeding on the first flowers pollinated by the first bees.

129
0:06:20.413,000 --> 0:06:23,000
There were ecological revolutions on land and at sea,

130
0:06:24.238,000 --> 0:06:25,000
leading to the modern world.

131
0:06:26.434,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Except that an asteroid hit Mexico,

132
0:06:29.514,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and then that triggered volcanoes on the other side of the world in India,

133
0:06:33.728,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and everything almost died again.

134
0:06:36.124,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:37.61,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But -- there's always a but, because we're still here --

136
0:06:42.038,000 --> 0:06:44,000
mammals arose from the ashes,

137
0:06:44.443,000 --> 0:06:47,000
became small under extreme heat and then ever larger.

138
0:06:48.236,000 --> 0:06:5,000
There were palm trees and snakes in the Arctic.

139
0:06:50.99,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Predatory deer dogs frolicked along ancient rivers,

140
0:06:54.593,000 --> 0:06:56,000
while their relatives returned to the ocean

141
0:06:57.072,000 --> 0:07:,000
to become the first otter-like whales.

142
0:07:00.27,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Not hyenas and other sort of carnivores

143
0:07:03.754,000 --> 0:07:06,000
were chased off by giant long-necked rhinos.

144
0:07:06.863,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Everything at this point seems kind of familiar

145
0:07:09.696,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but not really.

146
0:07:11.268,000 --> 0:07:14,000
In Antarctica, an ice age started,

147
0:07:14.569,000 --> 0:07:18,000
forming the first permanent polar ice cap in two hundred million years.

148
0:07:19.268,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This dried out the rest of the world,

149
0:07:21.577,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but it allowed the rise of grasses, of rodents, of cats.

150
0:07:25.998,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Somewhere in Africa,

151
0:07:27.53,000 --> 0:07:29,000
an ape started walking across the new savannah.

152
0:07:31.002,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Oh, and there were giant saber-toothed salmon,

153
0:07:33.685,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I just have to mention that.

154
0:07:35.177,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:38.225,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So, we know all of this happened

156
0:07:41.331,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and so much more.

157
0:07:42.76,000 --> 0:07:43,000
How?

158
0:07:43.935,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Why?

159
0:07:45.165,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Paleontology is a thriving science

160
0:07:47.84,000 --> 0:07:51,000
at the intersection of multiple other fields and technologies.

161
0:07:52.398,000 --> 0:07:54,000
There is no bigger data than the fossil record,

162
0:07:55.152,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and we mine every bit of it.

163
0:07:57.136,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We use CAT scans,

164
0:07:58.453,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we use isotopes,

165
0:07:59.826,000 --> 0:08:,000
we use genomes,

166
0:08:01.374,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we use robots,

167
0:08:02.72,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we use mathematical simulations

168
0:08:04.807,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and all kinds of analytics.

169
0:08:07.173,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We maximize all of it so that we can understand the past

170
0:08:10.994,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and how evolution works.

171
0:08:13.049,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It also lets us make predictions for the future.

172
0:08:16.073,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What will happen after the next mass extinction?

173
0:08:18.851,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What weird things will show up?

174
0:08:21.307,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Will mammals get smaller again?

175
0:08:23.712,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Will there even be mammals?

176
0:08:26.831,000 --> 0:08:27,000
In sum,

177
0:08:28.379,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we have learned a lot about dinosaurs.

178
0:08:32.236,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But there's so much left to learn

179
0:08:33.862,000 --> 0:08:37,000
from the other 99.9 percent of things that have ever lived.

180
0:08:38.434,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And that's paleontology.

181
0:08:40.99,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Thank you.

182
0:08:42.212,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Applause and cheers)

0:00:15.974,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When I was considering a career in the art world,

3
0:00:20.091,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I took a course in London,

4
0:00:23.385,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian

5
0:00:27.838,000 --> 0:00:3,000
called Pietro, who drank too much,

6
0:00:31.799,000 --> 0:00:36,000
smoked too much and swore much too much.

7
0:00:37.288,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But he was a passionate teacher,

8
0:00:40.464,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I remember one of our earlier classes with him,

9
0:00:43.506,000 --> 0:00:45,000
he was projecting images on the wall,

10
0:00:45.854,000 --> 0:00:47,000
asking us to think about them,

11
0:00:48.747,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and he put up an image of a painting.

12
0:00:51.273,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It was a landscape with figures, semi-dressed,

13
0:00:54.968,000 --> 0:00:56,000
drinking wine. There was a nude woman

14
0:00:57.756,000 --> 0:01:,000
in the lower foreground, and on the hillside in the back,

15
0:01:01.132,000 --> 0:01:05,000
there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus,

16
0:01:05.146,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and he said, "What is this?"

17
0:01:07.495,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And I -- no one else did, so I put up my hand, and I said,

18
0:01:10.772,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."

19
0:01:14.133,000 --> 0:01:16,000
He said, "It's a what?"

20
0:01:16.786,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.

21
0:01:18.38,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."

22
0:01:22.455,000 --> 0:01:24,000
He said, "It's a what?"

23
0:01:25.178,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I said, "It's a Bacchanal by Titian." (Laughter)

24
0:01:28.262,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He said, "You boneless bookworm!

25
0:01:31.607,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It's a fucking orgy!"

26
0:01:34.15,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:37.221,000 --> 0:01:39,000
As I said, he swore too much.

28
0:01:39.573,000 --> 0:01:42,000
There was an important lesson for me in that.

29
0:01:43.105,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Pietro was suspicious of formal art training,

30
0:01:46.933,000 --> 0:01:49,000
art history training, because he feared

31
0:01:50.865,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that it filled people up with jargon, and then they just

32
0:01:54.627,000 --> 0:01:58,000
classified things rather than looking at them,

33
0:01:59.306,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary,

34
0:02:04.065,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and he wanted us to use our eyes,

35
0:02:07.069,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and he was especially evangelical about this message,

36
0:02:10.579,000 --> 0:02:12,000
because he was losing his sight.

37
0:02:13.082,000 --> 0:02:17,000
He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects.

38
0:02:17.441,000 --> 0:02:2,000
What is it? How is it made? Why was it made?

39
0:02:20.987,000 --> 0:02:22,000
How is it used?

40
0:02:23.754,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And these were important lessons to me when

41
0:02:25.923,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I subsequently became a professional art historian.

42
0:02:29.221,000 --> 0:02:33,000
My kind of eureka moment came a few years later,

43
0:02:33.944,000 --> 0:02:38,000
when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe,

44
0:02:39.041,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and of course it was very much discussed in terms of

45
0:02:42.689,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the paintings and the sculptures

46
0:02:45.073,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and the architecture of the day.

47
0:02:48.381,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But as I began to read historical documents

48
0:02:52.218,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and contemporary descriptions,

49
0:02:55.333,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I found there was a kind of a missing component,

50
0:02:58.495,000 --> 0:03:03,000
for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries.

51
0:03:03.581,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages

52
0:03:07.477,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and, really, well into the 18th century,

53
0:03:10.409,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and it was pretty apparent why.

54
0:03:12.903,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Tapestries were portable. You could roll them up,

55
0:03:15.898,000 --> 0:03:17,000
send them ahead of you, and in the time

56
0:03:18.543,000 --> 0:03:21,000
it took to hang them up, you could transform a cold,

57
0:03:22.061,000 --> 0:03:26,000
dank interior into a richly colored setting.

58
0:03:26.183,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas

59
0:03:31.11,000 --> 0:03:34,000
on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes

60
0:03:34.767,000 --> 0:03:36,000
with whom they wanted to be associated,

61
0:03:37.469,000 --> 0:03:39,000
or even themselves,

62
0:03:39.527,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and in addition to that, tapestries were hugely expensive.

63
0:03:44.925,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They required scores of highly skilled weavers

64
0:03:48.594,000 --> 0:03:5,000
working over extended periods of time

65
0:03:51.43,000 --> 0:03:54,000
with very expensive materials -- the wools, the silks,

66
0:03:55.231,000 --> 0:03:57,000
even gold and silver thread.

67
0:03:58.068,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So, all in all, in an age when the visual image

68
0:04:02.806,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent

69
0:04:08.158,000 --> 0:04:11,000
form of propaganda.

70
0:04:11.803,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Well, I became a tapestry historian.

71
0:04:15.831,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In due course, I ended up as a curator

72
0:04:18.835,000 --> 0:04:21,000
at the Metropolitan Museum, because I saw the Met

73
0:04:22.391,000 --> 0:04:25,000
as one of the few places where I could organize

74
0:04:26.103,000 --> 0:04:29,000
really big exhibitions about the subject

75
0:04:29.658,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I cared so passionately about.

76
0:04:32.999,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And in about 1997, the then-director Philippe de Montebello

77
0:04:37.385,000 --> 0:04:4,000
gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition

78
0:04:40.728,000 --> 0:04:45,000
for 2002. We normally have these very long lead-in times.

79
0:04:46.308,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question

80
0:04:49.799,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car.

81
0:04:53.204,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They have to be wound on huge rollers,

82
0:04:56.668,000 --> 0:04:59,000
shipped in oversized freighters.

83
0:05:00.63,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Some of them are so big we had, to get them into the museum,

84
0:05:03.257,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we had to take them up the great steps at the front.

85
0:05:07.953,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We thought very hard about how to present this

86
0:05:12.638,000 --> 0:05:15,000
unknown subject to a modern audience:

87
0:05:16.246,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the dark colors to set off the colors that remained

88
0:05:19.216,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in objects that were often faded;

89
0:05:22.017,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread;

90
0:05:26.236,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the labeling.

91
0:05:27.7,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You know, we live in an age where we are so used

92
0:05:30.504,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to television images and photographs,

93
0:05:33.516,000 --> 0:05:38,000
a one-hit image. These were big, complex things,

94
0:05:38.563,000 --> 0:05:42,000
almost like cartoons with multiple narratives.

95
0:05:43.028,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We had to draw our audience in, get them to slow down,

96
0:05:46.258,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to explore the objects.

97
0:05:49.183,000 --> 0:05:53,000
There was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night,

98
0:05:53.333,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying,

99
0:05:56.721,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"This is going to be a bomb."

100
0:05:59.836,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But in reality, in the course of the coming weeks and months,

101
0:06:04.106,000 --> 0:06:09,000
hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show.

102
0:06:09.693,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The exhibition was designed to be an experience,

103
0:06:14.338,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs.

104
0:06:17.496,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So I want you to use your imaginations,

105
0:06:20.495,000 --> 0:06:23,000
thinking of these wall-high objects,

106
0:06:24.041,000 --> 0:06:26,000
some of them 10 meters wide,

107
0:06:26.156,000 --> 0:06:31,000
depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies

108
0:06:31.175,000 --> 0:06:35,000
who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today,

109
0:06:35.744,000 --> 0:06:39,000
thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth

110
0:06:39.95,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in pursuit of wild boars and deer,

111
0:06:43.09,000 --> 0:06:48,000
violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism.

112
0:06:48.94,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time,

113
0:06:53.102,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and all the little boys, they kind of -- you know, they were little boys,

114
0:06:56.939,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and then the thing that caught their attention

115
0:06:59.76,000 --> 0:07:02,000
was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog

116
0:07:02.869,000 --> 0:07:04,000
pooping in the foreground — (Laughter) —

117
0:07:05.534,000 --> 0:07:08,000
kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist.

118
0:07:09.216,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And you can just imagine them.

119
0:07:11.69,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw

120
0:07:15.063,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that these weren't just old faded tapestries.

121
0:07:18.143,000 --> 0:07:22,000
These were images of the world in the past,

122
0:07:22.634,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and that it was the same for our audience.

123
0:07:25.55,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And for me as a curator, I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little.

124
0:07:31.107,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Through this experience that could only be created

125
0:07:34.257,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in a museum, I'd opened up the eyes of my audience --

126
0:07:38.34,000 --> 0:07:42,000
historians, artists, press, the general public --

127
0:07:42.481,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to the beauty of this lost medium.

128
0:07:47.157,000 --> 0:07:5,000
A few years later, I was invited to be the director

129
0:07:50.731,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of the museum, and after I got over that --

130
0:07:53.846,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" --

131
0:07:59.357,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that

132
0:08:04.737,000 --> 0:08:07,000
curated museum experience.

133
0:08:08.016,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We live in an age of ubiquitous information,

134
0:08:11.623,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and sort of "just add water" expertise,

135
0:08:15.682,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but there's nothing that compares with the presentation

136
0:08:19.724,000 --> 0:08:22,000
of significant objects in a well-told narrative,

137
0:08:23.608,000 --> 0:08:28,000
what the curator does, the interpretation of a complex,

138
0:08:28.668,000 --> 0:08:32,000
esoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity

139
0:08:33.179,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of the subject, that makes it -- unpacks it

140
0:08:36.262,000 --> 0:08:38,000
for a general audience.

141
0:08:38.429,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And that, to me, today, is now the challenge and the fun

142
0:08:41.956,000 --> 0:08:45,000
of my job, supporting the vision of my curators,

143
0:08:46.939,000 --> 0:08:49,000
whether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords,

144
0:08:50.292,000 --> 0:08:55,000
early Byzantine artifacts, Renaissance portraits,

145
0:08:55.376,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or the show we heard mentioned earlier,

146
0:08:58.45,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the McQueen show, with which we enjoyed

147
0:09:01.465,000 --> 0:09:03,000
so much success last summer.

148
0:09:04.276,000 --> 0:09:06,000
That was an interesting case.

149
0:09:06.777,000 --> 0:09:11,000
In the late spring, early summer of 2010, shortly after

150
0:09:11.951,000 --> 0:09:13,000
McQueen's suicide,

151
0:09:14.863,000 --> 0:09:18,000
our curator of costume, Andrew Bolton, came to see me,

152
0:09:19.119,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and said, "I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen,

153
0:09:22.354,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and now is the moment. We have to, we have to do it fast."

154
0:09:26.912,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career

155
0:09:31.649,000 --> 0:09:34,000
with a small team of designers and managers

156
0:09:35.103,000 --> 0:09:39,000
who were very protective of his legacy,

157
0:09:39.245,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but Andrew went to London and worked with them

158
0:09:41.079,000 --> 0:09:44,000
over the summer and won their confidence, and that of

159
0:09:44.809,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the designers who created his amazing fashion shows,

160
0:09:48.904,000 --> 0:09:52,000
which were works of performance art in their own right,

161
0:09:53.518,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and we proceeded to do something at the museum,

162
0:09:56.017,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I think, we've never done before.

163
0:09:58.237,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It wasn't just your standard installation.

164
0:10:01.254,000 --> 0:10:05,000
In fact, we ripped down the galleries to recreate

165
0:10:05.444,000 --> 0:10:1,000
entirely different settings, a recreation of his first studio,

166
0:10:10.856,000 --> 0:10:12,000
a hall of mirrors,

167
0:10:13.729,000 --> 0:10:15,000
a curiosity box,

168
0:10:16.257,000 --> 0:10:19,000
a sunken ship, a burned-out interior,

169
0:10:19.617,000 --> 0:10:22,000
with videos and soundtracks that ranged from

170
0:10:22.909,000 --> 0:10:25,000
operatic arias to pigs fornicating.

171
0:10:26.642,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And in this extraordinary setting, the costumes

172
0:10:31.603,000 --> 0:10:36,000
were like actors and actresses, or living sculptures.

173
0:10:37.037,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It could have been a train wreck.

174
0:10:39.216,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue

175
0:10:43.675,000 --> 0:10:46,000
at Christmas, but because of the way that Andrew

176
0:10:47.298,000 --> 0:10:5,000
connected with the McQueen team, he was channeling

177
0:10:51.291,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen,

178
0:10:54.715,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and the show was quite transcendant,

179
0:10:57.522,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and it became a phenomenon in its own right.

180
0:11:00.294,000 --> 0:11:02,000
By the end of the show, we had people queuing

181
0:11:02.808,000 --> 0:11:05,000
for four or five hours to get into the show,

182
0:11:06.31,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but no one really complained.

183
0:11:08.937,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I heard over and over again, "Wow, that was worth it.

184
0:11:12.015,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It was a such a visceral, emotive experience."

185
0:11:16.094,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Now, I've described two very immersive exhibitions,

186
0:11:20.351,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but I also believe that collections, individual objects,

187
0:11:25.76,000 --> 0:11:27,000
can also have that same power.

188
0:11:27.965,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The Met was set up not as a museum of American art,

189
0:11:31.849,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but of an encyclopedic museum,

190
0:11:34.954,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and today, 140 years later, that vision

191
0:11:39.769,000 --> 0:11:42,000
is as prescient as ever,

192
0:11:42.907,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because, of course, we live in a world of crisis,

193
0:11:46.53,000 --> 0:11:48,000
of challenge, and we're exposed to it

194
0:11:49.163,000 --> 0:11:52,000
through the 24/7 newsreels.

195
0:11:52.312,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations,

196
0:11:57.172,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of.

197
0:12:01.552,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Whether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria,

198
0:12:05.881,000 --> 0:12:07,000
it's in our galleries that we can explain

199
0:12:08.591,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and give greater understanding.

200
0:12:10.663,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I mean, our new Islamic galleries are a case in point,

201
0:12:14.148,000 --> 0:12:19,000
opened 10 years, almost to the week, after 9/11.

202
0:12:19.828,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I think for most Americans, knowledge of the Islamic world

203
0:12:24.262,000 --> 0:12:27,000
was pretty slight before 9/11, and then it was thrust upon us

204
0:12:28.113,000 --> 0:12:32,000
in one of America's darkest hours,

205
0:12:32.206,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and the perception was through the polarization

206
0:12:34.88,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of that terrible event.

207
0:12:37.534,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Now, in our galleries, we show 14 centuries

208
0:12:41.754,000 --> 0:12:45,000
of the development of different Islamic cultures

209
0:12:46.207,000 --> 0:12:48,000
across a vast geographic spread,

210
0:12:48.946,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and, again, hundreds of thousands of people have come

211
0:12:52.973,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to see these galleries since they opened last October.

212
0:12:58.148,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I'm often asked, "Is digital media replacing the museum?"

213
0:13:05.254,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection

214
0:13:09.131,000 --> 0:13:12,000
of that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong,

215
0:13:12.571,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I'm a huge advocate of the Web.

216
0:13:15.846,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences

217
0:13:19.265,000 --> 0:13:24,000
around the globe, but nothing replaces the authenticity

218
0:13:24.666,000 --> 0:13:3,000
of the object presented with passionate scholarship.

219
0:13:31.253,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Bringing people face to face with our objects

220
0:13:35.856,000 --> 0:13:38,000
is a way of bringing them face to face with people

221
0:13:39.303,000 --> 0:13:43,000
across time, across space, whose lives may have been

222
0:13:43.869,000 --> 0:13:47,000
very different to our own, but who, like us,

223
0:13:48.437,000 --> 0:13:53,000
had hopes and dreams, frustrations and achievements

224
0:13:53.467,000 --> 0:13:56,000
in their lives. And I think this is a process

225
0:13:56.646,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that helps us better understand ourselves,

226
0:14:00.399,000 --> 0:14:05,000
helps us make better decisions about where we're going.

227
0:14:05.907,000 --> 0:14:1,000
The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world,

228
0:14:11.309,000 --> 0:14:15,000
awe-inspiring, like a medieval cathedral.

229
0:14:15.453,000 --> 0:14:17,000
From there, you can walk in any direction

230
0:14:17.734,000 --> 0:14:2,000
to almost any culture.

231
0:14:20.965,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries

232
0:14:23.361,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and I watch our visitors coming in.

233
0:14:26.436,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Some of them are comfortable. They feel at home.

234
0:14:30.528,000 --> 0:14:32,000
They know what they're looking for.

235
0:14:33.138,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place.

236
0:14:37.594,000 --> 0:14:4,000
They feel that the institution is elitist.

237
0:14:40.748,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism.

238
0:14:46.943,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind,

239
0:14:50.891,000 --> 0:14:56,000
where they're prepared to be a little bit lost, to explore,

240
0:14:57.048,000 --> 0:15:,000
to see the unfamiliar in the familiar,

241
0:15:00.87,000 --> 0:15:04,000
or to try the unknown.

242
0:15:05.339,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Because for us, it's all about bringing them face to face

243
0:15:09.68,000 --> 0:15:11,000
with great works of art,

244
0:15:12.605,000 --> 0:15:16,000
capturing them at that moment of discomfort,

245
0:15:17.005,000 --> 0:15:2,000
when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone,

246
0:15:20.501,000 --> 0:15:25,000
your Blackberry, but to create a zone

247
0:15:25.904,000 --> 0:15:3,000
where their curiosity can expand.

248
0:15:31.01,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture

249
0:15:34.574,000 --> 0:15:35,000
that reminds you of a friend,

250
0:15:36.564,000 --> 0:15:4,000
or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry,

251
0:15:40.844,000 --> 0:15:43,000
or, to bring it back to my tutor Pietro,

252
0:15:44.254,000 --> 0:15:46,000
those dancing figures

253
0:15:46.931,000 --> 0:15:48,000
who are indeed knocking back the wine,

254
0:15:49.718,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and that nude figure in the left foreground.

255
0:15:53.208,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Wow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality.

256
0:16:01.553,000 --> 0:16:06,000
In that moment, our scholarship can tell you

257
0:16:07.175,000 --> 0:16:1,000
that this is a bacchanal,

258
0:16:10.489,000 --> 0:16:13,000
but if we're doing our job right,

259
0:16:13.64,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and you've checked the jargon at the front door,

260
0:16:17.376,000 --> 0:16:19,000
trust your instinct.

261
0:16:20.244,000 --> 0:16:23,000
You know it's an orgy.

262
0:16:23.416,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Thank you. (Applause)

263
0:16:26.734,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Applause)

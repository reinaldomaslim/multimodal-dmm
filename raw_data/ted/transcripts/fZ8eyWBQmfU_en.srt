1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So magic is a very introverted field.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
While scientists regularly publish their latest research,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That's true even amongst peers.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research,

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or art as a form of R&D for humanity,

7
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
then how could a cyber illusionist like myself

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
share his research?

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And about three years ago,

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I started an exercise

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in openness and inclusiveness

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
by reaching out into the open-source software community

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to create new digital tools for magic --

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
tools that could eventually be shared with other artists

16
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to start them off further on in the process

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and to get them to the poetry faster.

18
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.

19
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's an augmented reality

20
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
projection tracking and mapping system,

21
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or a digital storytelling tool.

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you.

23
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So let's give this a try.

24
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I'm going to use it

25
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to give you my take

26
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
on the stuff of life.

27
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Music)

29
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.

30
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Wake up.

31
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Hey.

32
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Come on.

33
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Music)

34
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Please.

35
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Music)

36
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Come on.

37
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Ah, sorry about that.

38
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Forgot this.

39
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Music)

40
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Give it another try.

41
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Okay.

42
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
He figured out the system.

43
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Music)

44
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

45
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Applause)

46
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Music)

47
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Uh oh.

48
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Music)

49
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
All right. Let's try this.

50
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Come on.

51
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Music)

52
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

53
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Music)

54
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Hey.

55
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Music)

56
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You heard her, go ahead.

57
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

58
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Applause)

59
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Bye-bye.

60
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
we don't understand as much as we think we do.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'd like to begin with four questions.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
That's an in-joke, by the way.

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But these four questions, actually,

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers,

9
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of audiences of science educators --

10
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
so that's science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds,

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better

12
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.

13
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So the first question, and you might want to write this down,

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper

15
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.

16
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?

17
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,

18
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
right? Where does all this stuff come from?

19
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Knocks)

20
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb

21
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?

22
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw

23
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,

24
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
if you had to do it? Or would you just say,

25
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that's actually not possible?

26
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?

27
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,

28
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but why? And finally, would you be able to --

29
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and you can sort of scribble it, if you like --

30
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
scribble a plan diagram of the solar system,

31
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
showing the shape of the planets' orbits?

32
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Would you be able to do that?

33
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And if you can, just scribble a pattern.

34
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,

35
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as teachers often think, but actually from common sense,

36
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
from experience of the world around them,

37
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
from all the things that go on between them and their peers,

38
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.

39
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,

40
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads

41
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?

42
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I'm not quite sure how he died, actually.

44
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Was he beheaded in the end, or hung?

45
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,

47
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and you haven't been conferring, and so on.

48
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,

49
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but maybe not in this instance.

50
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,

51
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.

52
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,

53
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,

54
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,

55
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and say that actually, it comes out of the ground.

56
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,

57
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
filling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.

58
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But, actually, we don't do that.

59
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The mass of this comes out of the air.

60
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.

61
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I passed them really well, but I still came out of school

62
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
thinking that that stuff came out of the ground.

63
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?

64
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Yes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.

65
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, I have some rather bad news,

66
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,

67
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room,

68
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
so I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion,

69
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers

70
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
go to MIT on graduation day.

71
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away

72
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
from here, and you wouldn't mind too much,

73
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but it sort of works the same way in Britain

74
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and in the West Coast of the USA.

75
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions

76
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.

77
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And so, there's a whole lot of people saying,

78
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.

79
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
That's very surprising to me." And those are science graduates.

80
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And we intercut it with, "We are the premier science university in the world,"

81
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
because of British-like hubris.

82
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And when we gave graduate engineers that question,

84
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they said it couldn't be done.

85
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,

86
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and said, "Can you do it?" They couldn't do it. Right?

87
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,

88
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.

89
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money

90
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for teaching people -- we might as well get it right.

91
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And there are also some societal reasons

92
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening

93
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation

94
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,

95
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,

96
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

97
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
That's what plants actually do for a living.

98
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:

99
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice

100
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
if we don't understand that kind of thing.

101
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.

102
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.

103
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,

104
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
if you've only seen a circuit diagram,

105
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.

106
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?

107
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,

108
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,

109
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and it happens pretty early on.

110
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
By extension, we think to ourselves, "Why it's hotter in summer than in winter

111
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
must be because we're closer to the Sun."

112
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I promise you that most of you will have got that.

113
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Oh, you're all shaking your heads,

114
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.

115
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Other ones are kind of going like this. All right.

116
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun

117
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.

118
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.

119
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?

120
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,

121
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we're further from the Sun in summer,

122
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.

123
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
OK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.

124
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
If you believe, as most of you probably do,

125
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,

126
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
you must have drawn an ellipse.

127
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Right? That would explain it, right?

128
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Except, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse,

129
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
have you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?"

130
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer

131
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and we've got winter, and what --

132
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,

133
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,

134
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,

135
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.

136
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.

137
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?

138
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.

139
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I hope you notice the coincidence here.

140
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,

141
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits

142
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
caused by our experiences as children?

143
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,

144
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to show that it's not really like that?

145
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?

146
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's a plan, looking down from above.

147
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But, no, look what I found in the textbooks.

148
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,

149
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
from websites, educational websites --

150
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and almost anything you pick up is like that.

151
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring

152
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to have a load of concentric circles,

153
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,

154
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
isn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,

155
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
if you've got that misconception in your head, then that

156
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.

157
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So you've -- it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.

158
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So, these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models.

159
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,

160
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look --

161
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and scientists do it, constantly -- we look for evidence

162
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able

163
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.

164
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.

165
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science

166
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France

167
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.

168
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,

169
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
there's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional --

170
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up

171
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
from under the sheets in that scene in "Annie Hall,"

172
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and said, "God, that's so professional." And that you don't --

173
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,

174
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation --

175
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I'll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Exploratorium,

176
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
where all the things that -- the demonstrations, and so on,

177
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
are made out of everyday objects that children can understand,

178
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
it's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.

179
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And I know that if the graduates at MIT

180
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire

181
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,

182
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they would have learned how it actually works,

183
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.

184
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So good interpretation is more about

185
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?

186
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And things that -- where there isn't an extra barrier

187
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of a piece of glass or machined titanium,

188
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and it all looks fantastic, OK?

189
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And the Exploratorium does that really, really well.

190
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,

191
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.

192
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So, children are not empty vessels, OK?

193
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So, as "Monty Python" would have it,

194
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,

195
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but this is -- children are not empty vessels.

196
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
They come with their own ideas and their own theories,

197
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,

198
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
right? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas

199
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
of how the world and universe operates, either.

200
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.

201
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
For example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover

202
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of the whole population into digital technology [for television].

203
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And it's one of the difficult things

204
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,

205
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
it's quite difficult to shift those.

206
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have

207
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
as children persist into adulthood.

208
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good.

209
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better

210
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?

211
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling,

212
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,

213
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.

214
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And we collude. We design tests,

215
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?

216
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.

217
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
OK? We collude, and actually if you --

218
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
if someone had designed a test for me

219
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
when I was doing my biology exams,

220
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to really understand, to see whether I'd understood

221
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together

222
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and seeing it go blue,

223
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,

224
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
then I might have done better at science.

225
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.

226
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Your homework is -- you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift?

227
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
An obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.

228
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And the second question to that then is,

229
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.

230
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?

231
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.

232
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.

233
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Laughter)

234
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I've always wanted to say that in this country.

235
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Laughter)

236
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,

237
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,

238
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,

239
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,

240
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
it's just part of learning that's important.

241
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Thank you very much.

242
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Now -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.

243
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.921,000 --> 0:00:15,000
You know, my friends, I look at this photograph

2
0:00:16.198,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I have to ask myself,

3
0:00:18.667,000 --> 0:00:2,000
you know, I think I've seen this somewhere before.

4
0:00:21.657,000 --> 0:00:23,000
People marching in the street for justice.

5
0:00:24.903,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But I know it's not the same photograph that I would have seen,

6
0:00:28.378,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because I wouldn't take my oath to be a police officer until 1989.

7
0:00:33.315,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And I've been in the business for over 25 years.

8
0:00:36.673,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And identifying as an African-American woman,

9
0:00:39.069,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I know things have gotten better.

10
0:00:41.268,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But even as I learned about public safety,

11
0:00:43.715,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I wondered if what I was doing on the street

12
0:00:46.684,000 --> 0:00:48,000
was hurting or harming the community.

13
0:00:49.323,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I often wondered if, you know, how did they perceive me,

14
0:00:53.704,000 --> 0:00:54,000
this woman in uniform?

15
0:00:56.204,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But there is one thing that I knew.

16
0:00:57.912,000 --> 0:01:,000
I knew there was a way that we could do this, probably, different or better.

17
0:01:01.939,000 --> 0:01:05,000
A way that preserved dignity and guaranteed justice.

18
0:01:06.883,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But I also knew that police could not do it alone.

19
0:01:11.267,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's the coproduction of public safety.

20
0:01:15.251,000 --> 0:01:17,000
There is a lot of history with us.

21
0:01:18.83,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You know, we know loss.

22
0:01:26.049,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The relationship between

23
0:01:27.32,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the African American community and the police is a painful one.

24
0:01:32.005,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Often filled with mistrust.

25
0:01:34.847,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It has been studied by social scientists,

26
0:01:37.927,000 --> 0:01:4,000
it has been studied by government,

27
0:01:41.006,000 --> 0:01:45,000
all both promising, you know, hopeful new ways and long-term fixes.

28
0:01:46.593,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But all we want is to be safe.

29
0:01:48.899,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And our safety is intertwined.

30
0:01:51.59,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And that we know, in order to have great relationships

31
0:01:54.162,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and relationships built on trust,

32
0:01:56.772,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that we're going to have to have communication.

33
0:01:59.657,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And in this advent and this text of the world that we've got going on,

34
0:02:05.014,000 --> 0:02:07,000
trying to do this with social media,

35
0:02:07.307,000 --> 0:02:09,000
it's a very difficult thing to do.

36
0:02:10.464,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We also have to examine our current policing practices,

37
0:02:13.761,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and we have to set those things aside that no longer serve us.

38
0:02:16.893,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So, in New York, that meant "stop, question and frisk."

39
0:02:19.934,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That meant really holding up the numbers as opposed to relationships.

40
0:02:25.673,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And it really didn't allow the officers the opportunity

41
0:02:28.508,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to get to know the community in which they serve.

42
0:02:32.704,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But you see, there is a better way.

43
0:02:35.996,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And we know -- it's called coproduction.

44
0:02:39.702,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So in the 1970s, Elinor Ostrom came up with this theory,

45
0:02:43.583,000 --> 0:02:45,000
really called coproduction, and this is how it works.

46
0:02:46.696,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You bring people into the space that come with separate expertise,

47
0:02:50.903,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and you also come with new ideas and lived experience,

48
0:02:54.98,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and you produce a new knowledge.

49
0:02:57.391,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And when you produce that new knowledge,

50
0:02:59.575,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and you apply this theory to public safety,

51
0:03:02.448,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you produce a new type of public safety.

52
0:03:05.657,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so, in New York, it feels like this.

53
0:03:10.291,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It is called building relationships, literally one block at a time.

54
0:03:16.293,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And it's "Build the Block."

55
0:03:17.762,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So this is how it works.

56
0:03:19.524,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You go to buildtheblock.nyc, you put in your address.

57
0:03:23.974,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And up pops location, date and time of your neighborhood meeting.

58
0:03:29.378,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The important part of this is you've got to go to the meeting.

59
0:03:32.434,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And once you go to that meeting,

60
0:03:34.585,000 --> 0:03:36,000
there, of course, will be NYPD,

61
0:03:37.18,000 --> 0:03:4,000
along with officers and other community members.

62
0:03:41.062,000 --> 0:03:44,000
What's important about bringing, now, the lived experience into this space

63
0:03:44.56,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to produce new knowledge

64
0:03:46.336,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is that we have to have a new way of delivering it.

65
0:03:49.217,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So the new way of delivering it

66
0:03:50.831,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is through what we call neighborhood coordinating officers, or NCOs.

67
0:03:55.196,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And so, also in this meeting are the NCOs,

68
0:03:58.649,000 --> 0:04:,000
the what we call 911 response cars,

69
0:04:01.585,000 --> 0:04:03,000
sector cars, detectives,

70
0:04:04.514,000 --> 0:04:07,000
all of us working together to collaborate in this new way

71
0:04:07.993,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to reduce crime.

72
0:04:10.707,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And what's interesting about this is that we know that it works.

73
0:04:14.77,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So, for example, in Washington Heights.

74
0:04:17.212,000 --> 0:04:2,000
At a community meeting, there was a bar, up in Washington Heights,

75
0:04:20.347,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and the neighbors were complaining about outcry and noises.

76
0:04:23.315,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So in their conversations with their NCO,

77
0:04:26.434,000 --> 0:04:28,000
they talked about, you know, sound barriers,

78
0:04:28.784,000 --> 0:04:3,000
different ways to sort of approach this.

79
0:04:31.235,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Is there a different way we can direct traffic?

80
0:04:33.466,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And of course now they have relatively quieter bar nights.

81
0:04:37.966,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So, another issue that always comes up in neighborhoods is speeding.

82
0:04:41.514,000 --> 0:04:43,000
How many of you in here have ever had a speeding ticket?

83
0:04:44.187,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Raise your hand.

84
0:04:45.363,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Oh, higher, come on!

85
0:04:46.529,000 --> 0:04:48,000
There's more than that, this is New York.

86
0:04:48.698,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So those are other issues that brought to the NCO.

87
0:04:51.516,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Speeding -- what the NCOs do

88
0:04:53.304,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is they collaborate with the Department of Transportation,

89
0:04:56.063,000 --> 0:05:,000
they look at issues such as speed bumps and signage and all types of things.

90
0:05:00.667,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And when we come together to create this different type of policing,

91
0:05:04.445,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it also feels different.

92
0:05:07.818,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The coproduction of public safety also means

93
0:05:10.267,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that officers need to understand

94
0:05:12.117,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the history and the power of their uniforms.

95
0:05:15.458,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They're going to have to set aside old historical narratives

96
0:05:18.29,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that do not serve them well.

97
0:05:20.22,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And that means they have to learn about implicit bias.

98
0:05:23.204,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Implicit biases are shortcuts the brain makes

99
0:05:26.166,000 --> 0:05:27,000
without us really knowing it.

100
0:05:27.927,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They're stereotypes that often influence our decision making.

101
0:05:32.434,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And so, you can imagine,

102
0:05:33.695,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for police officers who have to make split-second decisions

103
0:05:37.085,000 --> 0:05:4,000
can be a very detrimental decision-making point.

104
0:05:41.147,000 --> 0:05:45,000
That's why the NYPD, along with other departments throughout the United States,

105
0:05:45.909,000 --> 0:05:48,000
are training all of their officers in implicit bias.

106
0:05:49.472,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They have to understand that learning about their implicit biases,

107
0:05:54.552,000 --> 0:05:58,000
having good training, tactics and deescalation

108
0:05:58.735,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and understanding how it impacts your decision making

109
0:06:01.934,000 --> 0:06:02,000
makes us all safer.

110
0:06:04.958,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We also know how officers are treated inside the organization

111
0:06:08.411,000 --> 0:06:11,000
impacts how they're going to behave with the community at large.

112
0:06:12.212,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This is critical.

113
0:06:13.839,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Especially if you want to have a new way forward.

114
0:06:17.291,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And we know that we have to care for those folks that are on the frontline.

115
0:06:21.973,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And they have to recognize their own trauma.

116
0:06:24.997,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And in order to do that, us as leaders have to lift them up

117
0:06:28.779,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and let them know that the narratives of being strong men and women --

118
0:06:32.097,000 --> 0:06:35,000
you can set those aside, and it's OK to say you need help.

119
0:06:35.652,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And we do that by providing peer support,

120
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
employee assistance, mental health services.

121
0:06:41.307,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We make sure all of those things are in place,

122
0:06:43.549,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because without it --

123
0:06:44.966,000 --> 0:06:47,000
it's a critical component to the coproduction of public safety.

124
0:06:49.704,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Equally as important is that we also have social issues

125
0:06:52.657,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that are often laid at the feet of law enforcement.

126
0:06:55.649,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So, for example, mental health and education.

127
0:06:59.763,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Historically, we've been pulled into those spaces

128
0:07:02.541,000 --> 0:07:05,000
where we have not necessarily provided public safety

129
0:07:06.311,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but have enforced long, historical legislative racial desegregation.

130
0:07:13.069,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We have to own our part in history.

131
0:07:16.672,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But we also have to have those folks at the table

132
0:07:19.553,000 --> 0:07:22,000
when we're talking about how do we move forward with coproduction.

133
0:07:24.297,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But understanding this,

134
0:07:25.965,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we also have to understand that we need to have voices come to us

135
0:07:30.806,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in a different way.

136
0:07:32.998,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We also have to recognize

137
0:07:34.666,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that the community may not be willing or ready

138
0:07:37.95,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to come to the table to have the conversation.

139
0:07:40.982,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And that's OK.

140
0:07:42.498,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We have to be able to accept that.

141
0:07:45.252,000 --> 0:07:48,000
By acknowledging it, it also means that we care for the community's health

142
0:07:48.755,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and for their resiliency as well.

143
0:07:50.886,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's another key component.

144
0:07:53.633,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We also have to acknowledge

145
0:07:55.007,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that there are those folks that are in our community that are here --

146
0:07:58.276,000 --> 0:07:59,000
they do want to do us harm.

147
0:08:00.419,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We also have to recognize that we have community members

148
0:08:03.523,000 --> 0:08:07,000
who did not get the benefits of a long-ago dream.

149
0:08:09.18,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We also have to acknowledge

150
0:08:10.895,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that we have put faith in a system that sometimes is broken,

151
0:08:14.217,000 --> 0:08:16,000
hoping that it would give us solutions for better.

152
0:08:18.486,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But we cannot walk away.

153
0:08:21.177,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Because there is a better way.

154
0:08:24.101,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And we know this because the NYPD's neighborhood policing philosophy

155
0:08:29.126,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is grounded in the coproduction of public safety.

156
0:08:33.554,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And in order for us to move forward together,

157
0:08:36.085,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with our family, our friends and for our health,

158
0:08:39.927,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we have to make sure that we focus this way.

159
0:08:43.617,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And in order to do that,

160
0:08:45.196,000 --> 0:08:49,000
there are three fundamental ideologies that we must all agree to.

161
0:08:49.95,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Are you ready?

162
0:08:51.679,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Oh, I'm sorry, one more time -- are you ready?

163
0:08:53.871,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Audience: Yes!

164
0:08:55.076,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Tracie Keesee: Now, that's better, alright.

165
0:08:57.109,000 --> 0:09:,000
The first one: There's no more wallowing in the why.

166
0:09:00.982,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We know why.

167
0:09:04.244,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We must move forward together. There's no more us versus them.

168
0:09:08.819,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Number two:

169
0:09:10.811,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We must embrace the lived experience and our histories,

170
0:09:15.97,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and we must make sure we never go back to a place where we cannot move forward.

171
0:09:21.82,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And number three:

172
0:09:23.955,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We must also make sure

173
0:09:26.304,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that truth and telling facts is painful.

174
0:09:32.48,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But we also know that no action is no longer acceptable.

175
0:09:37.274,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And agree?

176
0:09:38.836,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Audience: Yes.

177
0:09:40.011,000 --> 0:09:42,000
TK: Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you, do you agree?

178
0:09:42.387,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Audience: Yes!

179
0:09:43.561,000 --> 0:09:44,000
TK: So we do know there is a better way.

180
0:09:45.506,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And the better way is the coproduction of public safety.

181
0:09:49.101,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Thank you.

182
0:09:50.291,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

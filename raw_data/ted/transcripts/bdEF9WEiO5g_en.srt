0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Now, since this is TEDGlobal,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who can tell me what this is called in French?

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
"vielle à roue."

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And in Spanish, "zanfona."

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that uses a crank to turn a wheel

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to produce music.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It has three different kinds of strings.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The first string is the drone string,

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The second string is a melody string,

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.

18
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And the third string is pretty innovative.

19
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's also the only instrument

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that uses this kind of technique.

21
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.

22
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure,

23
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it makes a sound like a barking dog.

24
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So all of this is pretty innovative,

25
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
if you consider

26
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago

27
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and it took two people to play it;

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
one to turn the crank,

29
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and another person -- yes -- to play the melody

30
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.

31
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.

32
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So, one person could actually play

33
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and almost -- this is pretty heavy --

34
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
carry the hurdy-gurdy.

35
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries

36
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
in mostly dance music

37
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because of the uniqueness of the melody

38
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
combined with the acoustic boombox here.

39
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music --

40
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
traditional folk music,

41
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
dance, contemporary

42
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and world music --

43
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in the U.K., in France, in Spain

44
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and in Italy.

45
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].

46
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's made by specialized luthiers,

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
also in Europe.

48
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And it's very difficult to tune.

49
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So without further ado, would you like to hear it?

50
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Audience: Yes.)

51
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it? (Audience: Yes!)

52
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
CP: Okay.

53
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
There I go.

54
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'd like to sing in Basque,

55
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live,

56
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in the region in France and Spain.

57
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Music)

58
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
[Basque]

59
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Music)

60
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Thank you.

61
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Applause)

62
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This is a song that I wrote

63
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
based on traditional Basque rhythms.

64
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.

65
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Music)

66
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Thank you. Thank you.

67
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Applause)

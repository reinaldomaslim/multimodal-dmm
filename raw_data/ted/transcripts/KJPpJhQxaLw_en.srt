1
0:00:13.447,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives?

2
0:00:19.65,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.

3
0:00:23.01,000 --> 0:00:25,000
They provide half the oxygen we breathe.

4
0:00:25.856,000 --> 0:00:26,000
They moderate our climate.

5
0:00:27.875,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And they provide jobs and medicine and food

6
0:00:32.001,000 --> 0:00:36,000
including 20 percent of protein to feed the entire world population.

7
0:00:38.151,000 --> 0:00:4,000
People used to think that the oceans were so vast

8
0:00:40.692,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that they wouldn't be affected by human activities.

9
0:00:44.025,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well today I'm going to tell you about a serious reality

10
0:00:47.336,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that is changing our oceans called ocean acidification,

11
0:00:52.183,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or the evil twin of climate change.

12
0:00:55.72,000 --> 0:01:,000
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide

13
0:01:01.167,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that we have emitted to the atmosphere?

14
0:01:03.79,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now this is just another great service provided by the oceans

15
0:01:07.453,000 --> 0:01:09,000
since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases

16
0:01:10.347,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that's causing climate change.

17
0:01:13.13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But as we keep pumping more and more and more

18
0:01:17.192,000 --> 0:01:19,000
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere

19
0:01:19.85,000 --> 0:01:21,000
more is dissolving into the oceans.

20
0:01:22.623,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And this is what's changing our ocean chemistry.

21
0:01:27.17,000 --> 0:01:29,000
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,

22
0:01:29.583,000 --> 0:01:31,000
it undergoes a number of chemical reactions.

23
0:01:32.24,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now lucky for you,

24
0:01:33.43,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I don't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today.

25
0:01:37.208,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But I'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean,

26
0:01:40.557,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the seawater pH goes down.

27
0:01:43.55,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity.

28
0:01:48.168,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And this whole process is called ocean acidification.

29
0:01:52.724,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And it's happening alongside climate change.

30
0:01:56.176,000 --> 0:02:,000
Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades.

31
0:02:00.818,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This figure is an important time series in Hawaii,

32
0:02:03.516,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide,

33
0:02:08.436,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.

34
0:02:11.062,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And this is directly as a result of human activities.

35
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide

36
0:02:19.216,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean

37
0:02:22.398,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which you can see is increasing at the same rate

38
0:02:25.382,000 --> 0:02:28,000
as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began.

39
0:02:28.747,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry.

40
0:02:31.779,000 --> 0:02:33,000
As more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean,

41
0:02:34.63,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the seawater pH has gone down,

42
0:02:37.371,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity.

43
0:02:43.005,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now in Ireland, scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification --

44
0:02:47.1,000 --> 0:02:49,000
scientists at the Marine Institute and NUI Galway.

45
0:02:50.044,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And we, too, are seeing acidification at the same rate

46
0:02:54.218,000 --> 0:02:57,000
as these main ocean time-series sites around the world.

47
0:02:57.686,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So it's happening right at our doorstep.

48
0:03:01.39,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now I'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data

49
0:03:04.573,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to monitor a changing ocean.

50
0:03:07.009,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter.

51
0:03:10.089,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So as you can imagine, in the North Atlantic

52
0:03:12.253,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions --

53
0:03:14.969,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness,

54
0:03:17.627,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but we are collecting some very valuable data.

55
0:03:20.412,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So we lower this instrument over the side of the ship,

56
0:03:23.316,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom

57
0:03:25.777,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that can tell us information about the surrounding water,

58
0:03:28.475,000 --> 0:03:3,000
such as temperature or dissolved oxygen.

59
0:03:31.27,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles.

60
0:03:35.252,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So we start at the bottom, which can be over four kilometers deep

61
0:03:38.529,000 --> 0:03:39,000
just off our continental shelf,

62
0:03:40.632,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface.

63
0:03:44.695,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We take the seawater back on the deck,

64
0:03:47.091,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and then we can either analyze them on the ship

65
0:03:49.495,000 --> 0:03:52,000
or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters.

66
0:03:52.987,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But why should we care?

67
0:03:54.471,000 --> 0:03:58,000
How is ocean acidification going to affect all of us?

68
0:04:00.574,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well, here are the worrying facts.

69
0:04:04.597,000 --> 0:04:09,000
There has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percent

70
0:04:10.424,000 --> 0:04:14,000
since pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities.

71
0:04:15.471,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions,

72
0:04:19.851,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of 170 percent

73
0:04:26.208,000 --> 0:04:28,000
by the end of this century.

74
0:04:29.533,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I mean this is within our children's lifetime.

75
0:04:33.325,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This rate of acidification is 10 times faster

76
0:04:38.968,000 --> 0:04:44,000
than any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years.

77
0:04:45.88,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So our marine life have never, ever experienced

78
0:04:50.276,000 --> 0:04:52,000
such a fast rate of change before.

79
0:04:53.371,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So we literally could not know how they're going to cope.

80
0:04:58.855,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago,

81
0:05:03.466,000 --> 0:05:05,000
which was much slower than what we're seeing today.

82
0:05:06.6,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species.

83
0:05:12.711,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So is that what we're headed for?

84
0:05:15.09,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Well, maybe.

85
0:05:16.851,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well

86
0:05:20.368,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but many are showing a negative response.

87
0:05:24.906,000 --> 0:05:28,000
One of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases,

88
0:05:29.247,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease.

89
0:05:34.31,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now these ions are basically the building blocks

90
0:05:37.246,000 --> 0:05:39,000
for many marine species to make their shells,

91
0:05:40.579,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for example crabs or mussels, oysters.

92
0:05:45.594,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Another example are corals.

93
0:05:47.752,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They also need these carbonate ions in seawater

94
0:05:50.958,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs.

95
0:05:56.187,000 --> 0:05:58,000
As ocean acidity increases

96
0:05:58.599,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease,

97
0:06:02.282,000 --> 0:06:06,000
these species first find it more difficult to make their shells.

98
0:06:07.051,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve.

99
0:06:12.035,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This here is a pteropod, it's called a sea butterfly.

100
0:06:15.336,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And it's an important food source in the ocean for many species,

101
0:06:18.772,000 --> 0:06:21,000
from krill to salmon right up to whales.

102
0:06:23.208,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The shell of the pteropod was placed into seawater

103
0:06:26.747,000 --> 0:06:29,000
at a pH that we're expecting by the end of this century.

104
0:06:31.024,000 --> 0:06:36,000
After only 45 days at this very realistic pH,

105
0:06:36.86,000 --> 0:06:4,000
you can see the shell has almost completely dissolved.

106
0:06:41.375,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain --

107
0:06:45.644,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and right onto our dinner plates.

108
0:06:48.294,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I mean who here likes shellfish? Or salmon?

109
0:06:52.502,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Or many other fish species

110
0:06:54.155,000 --> 0:06:56,000
whose food source in the ocean could be affected?

111
0:06:57.946,000 --> 0:06:58,000
These are cold-water corals.

112
0:06:59.932,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And did you know we actually have cold-water corals in Irish waters,

113
0:07:03.49,000 --> 0:07:04,000
just off our continental shelf?

114
0:07:05.843,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And they support rich biodiversity, including some very important fisheries.

115
0:07:10.676,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's projected that by the end of this century,

116
0:07:14.046,000 --> 0:07:19,000
70 percent of all known cold-water corals in the entire ocean

117
0:07:20.397,000 --> 0:07:24,000
will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure.

118
0:07:28.67,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The last example I have are these healthy tropical corals.

119
0:07:32.892,000 --> 0:07:36,000
They were placed in seawater at a pH we're expecting by the year 2100.

120
0:07:39.304,000 --> 0:07:44,000
After six months, the coral has almost completely dissolved.

121
0:07:45.99,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now coral reefs support

122
0:07:48.426,000 --> 0:07:54,000
25 percent of all marine life in the entire ocean.

123
0:07:55.69,000 --> 0:07:56,000
All marine life.

124
0:07:57.888,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So you can see: ocean acidification is a global threat.

125
0:08:02.858,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I have an eight-month-old baby boy.

126
0:08:05.8,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Unless we start now to slow this down,

127
0:08:09.823,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I dread to think what our oceans will look like when he's a grown man.

128
0:08:15.52,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We will see acidification.

129
0:08:17.65,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We have already put too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

130
0:08:22.85,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But we can slow this down.

131
0:08:25.916,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We can prevent the worst-case scenario.

132
0:08:30.57,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The only way of doing that

133
0:08:32.833,000 --> 0:08:35,000
is by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions.

134
0:08:36.83,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is important for both you and I, for industry, for governments.

135
0:08:41.42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We need to work together, slow down global warming

136
0:08:45.32,000 --> 0:08:47,000
slow down ocean acidification

137
0:08:47.9,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and help to maintain a healthy ocean and a healthy planet

138
0:08:52.659,000 --> 0:08:55,000
for our generation and for generations to come.

139
0:08:57.144,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in 18 minutes.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That's 300 million years per minute.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of planet Mars.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This is fly-by, Mariner IV.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It was taken in 1965.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
When this picture appeared,

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that well-known scientific journal,

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The New York Times, wrote in its editorial,

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"Mars is uninteresting.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's a dead world. NASA should not spend

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
any time or effort studying Mars anymore."

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Fortunately, our leaders in Washington

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
at NASA headquarters knew better

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and we began a very extensive study

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of the red planet.

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
One of the key questions in all of science,

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Is there life outside of Earth?"

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I believe that Mars is the most likely target

21
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
for life outside the Earth.

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'm going to show you in a few minutes

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
some amazing measurements that suggest

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
there may be life on Mars.

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But let me start with a Viking photograph.

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Viking was developed and managed at the

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
NASA Langley Research Center.

29
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976.

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We had four spacecraft, two around Mars,

31
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
two on the surface --

32
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
an amazing accomplishment.

33
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This is the first photograph taken from

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the surface of any planet.

35
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is a Viking Lander photograph

36
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of the surface of Mars.

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And yes, the red planet is red.

38
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Mars is half the size of the Earth,

39
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water,

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the land area on Mars

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
is comparable to the land area on Earth.

42
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.

43
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We have obtained topographic measurements

44
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
of the surface of Mars. We understand

45
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the elevation differences.

46
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We know a lot about Mars.

47
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system,

48
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Olympus Mons.

49
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Mars has the Grand Canyon

50
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of the solar system, Valles Marineris.

51
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Very, very interesting planet.

52
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Mars has the largest

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
impact crater in the solar system,

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Hellas Basin.

55
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is 2,000 miles across.

56
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
If you happened to be on Mars

57
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when this impactor hit,

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it was a really bad day on Mars.

59
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This is Olympus Mons.

61
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is bigger than the state of Arizona.

62
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Volcanoes are important, because volcanoes

63
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
produce atmospheres and they produce oceans.

64
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We're looking at Valles Marineris,

65
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the largest canyon in the solar system,

66
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
superimposed on a map of the United States,

67
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
3,000 miles across.

68
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
One of the most intriguing features about Mars,

69
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the National Academy of Science says

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is why certain areas of Mars

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
are so highly magnetized.

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We call this crustal magnetism.

74
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
There are regions on Mars, where, for some reason --

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we don't understand why at this point --

76
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the surface is very, very highly magnetized.

77
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Is there water on Mars?

78
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The answer is no, there is no liquid water

79
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
on the surface of Mars today.

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But there is intriguing evidence

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that suggests that the early history of Mars

82
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
there may have been rivers

83
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and fast flowing water.

84
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Today Mars is very very dry.

85
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We believe there's some water in the polar caps,

86
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.

87
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Here are some recent images.

88
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This is from Spirit and Opportunity.

89
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
These images that show at one time,

90
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.

91
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Why is water important? Water is important

92
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because if you want life you have to have water.

93
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Water is the key ingredient

94
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.

95
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Here is some picture of Antarctica

96
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and a picture of Olympus Mons,

97
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
very similar features, glaciers.

98
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So, this is frozen water.

99
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This is ice water on Mars.

100
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It has not been seen publicly.

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This is European space agency

103
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars

104
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and in the middle of the crater

105
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we have liquid water, we have ice.

106
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Very intriguing photograph.

107
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We now believe that in the early history of Mars,

108
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
which is 4.6 billion years ago,

109
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.

110
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Mars had rivers, Mars had lakes,

111
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.

112
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,

113
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and this area in blue,

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
which shows a depression of about four miles,

115
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
was the ancient ocean area

116
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
on the surface of Mars.

117
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?

118
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Well, we have an idea.

119
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago

120
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
from a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.

121
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Sub-surface water on Mars,

122
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
frozen in the form of ice.

123
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,

124
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it means 16 percent by weight.

125
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior

126
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
contains frozen water, or ice.

127
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So, there is a lot of water below the surface.

128
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement,

129
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,

130
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
was released earlier this year

131
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in the magazine Science.

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,

133
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
CH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.

134
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.

135
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Why is methane important?

136
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Because on Earth, almost all --

137
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
99.9 percent -- of the methane

138
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is produced by living systems,

139
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
not little green men, but microscopic life

140
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
below the surface or at the surface.

141
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We now have evidence

142
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,

143
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
a gas that, on Earth,

144
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is biogenic in origin,

145
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
produced by living systems.

146
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.

147
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And this is the terrain it appears over,

148
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we know from geological studies

149
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.

150
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
In fact, the Earth and Mars

151
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
are both 4.6 billion years old.

152
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.

153
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The reason there is a billion-year gap

154
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in our geological understanding

155
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is because of plate tectonics,

156
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The crust of the Earth has been recycled.

157
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We have no geological record prior

158
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
for the first billion years.

159
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That record exists on Mars.

160
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And this terrain that we're looking at

161
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
dates back to 4.6 billion years

162
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
when Earth and Mars were formed.

163
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It was a Tuesday.

164
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is a map that shows

166
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.

167
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Here is Viking I, Viking II.

168
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This is Opportunity. This is Spirit.

169
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,

170
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we just put two years ago.

171
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers

172
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
have gone to the northern hemisphere.

173
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
That's because the northern hemisphere

174
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is the region of the ancient

175
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
ocean basin.

176
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
There aren't many craters.

177
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And that's because the water protected the basin

178
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.

179
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But look in the southern hemisphere.

180
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,

181
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
there are volcanic craters.

182
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Here's Hellas Basin,

183
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
a very very different place, geologically.

184
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very

185
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
rough terrain area.

186
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
What is the best way to unravel

187
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the mysteries on Mars that exist?

188
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We asked this question 10 years ago.

189
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We invited 10 of the top Mars scientists

190
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to the Langley Research Center for two days.

191
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We addressed on the board

192
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the major questions that have not been answered.

193
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And we spent two days deciding

194
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
how to best answer this question.

195
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And the result of our meeting

196
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.

197
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.

198
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
There's a model of ARES here.

199
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
This is a 20-percent scale model.

200
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.

201
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
If any place in the world

202
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
can build an airplane to fly on Mars,

203
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it's the Langley Research Center,

204
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
for almost 100 years

205
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
a leading center of aeronautics in the world.

206
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We fly about a mile above the surface.

207
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We cover hundreds of miles,

208
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and we fly about 450 miles an hour.

209
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We can do things that rovers can't do

210
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and landers can't do:

211
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;

212
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we fly over valleys;

213
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we can fly over surface magnetism,

214
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the polar caps, subsurface water;

215
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and we can search for life on Mars.

216
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But, of equal importance,

217
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,

218
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we transmit that journey,

219
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,

220
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we transmit those images back to Earth.

221
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And our goal is to inspire the American public

222
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
who is paying for this mission through tax dollars.

223
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But more important we will

224
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
inspire the next generation of scientists,

225
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
technologists, engineers and mathematicians.

226
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And that's a critical area of national security

227
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and economic vitality, to make sure

228
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we produce the next generation

229
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.

230
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This is what ARES looks like

231
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
as it flies over Mars.

232
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We preprogram it.

233
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We will fly where the methane is.

234
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We will have instruments aboard the plane

235
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.

236
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We will look for methane

237
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as well as other gasses

238
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
produced by living systems.

239
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,

240
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because we can measure the gradient where it comes from,

241
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and there, we can direct the next mission

242
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to land right in that area.

243
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
How do we transport an airplane to Mars?

244
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
In two words, very carefully.

245
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars,

246
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we put it in a spacecraft

247
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and we send it to Mars.

248
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The problem is the spacecraft's

249
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
largest diameter is nine feet;

250
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.

251
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
How do we get it to Mars?

252
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We fold it,

253
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and we transport it in a spacecraft.

254
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And we have it in something called an aeroshell.

255
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
This is how we do it.

256
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And we have a little video that describes the sequence.

257
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Video: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one.

258
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Main engine start, and liftoff.

259
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Joel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

260
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
This is the spacecraft taking nine months

261
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to get to Mars.

262
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It enters the atmosphere of Mars.

263
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
A lot of heating,

264
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
frictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour.

265
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
A parachute opens up to slow it down.

266
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The thermal tiles fall off.

267
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.

268
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It unfolds.

269
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The rocket engine begins.

270
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We believe that in a one-hour flight

271
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
we can rewrite the textbook on Mars

272
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere,

273
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
looking for gases of biogenic origin,

274
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
looking for gases of volcanic origin,

275
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
studying the surface, studying the magnetism

276
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
on the surface, which we don't understand,

277
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
as well as about a dozen other areas.

278
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Practice makes perfect.

279
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
How do we know we can do it?

280
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Because we have tested ARES model,

281
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels

282
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years,

283
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
under Mars conditions.

284
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And, of equal importance

285
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere,

286
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
at 100,000 feet,

287
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
which is comparable to the density and pressure

288
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly.

289
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles,

290
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
you fly 37,000 feet.

291
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We do our tests at 100,000 feet.

292
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I want to show you one of our tests.

293
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This is a half-scale model.

294
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
This is a high-altitude helium balloon.

295
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This is over Tilamook, Oregon.

296
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We put the folded airplane on the balloon --

297
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
it took about three hours to get up there --

298
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and then we released it on command

299
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
at 103,000 feet,

300
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.

301
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And we've done

302
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
high-altitude and low-altitude tests,

303
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
just to perfect this technique.

304
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We're ready to go.

305
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I have a scale model here.

306
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But we have a full-scale model

307
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.

308
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters

309
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

310
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to cover the costs.

311
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk

312
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
for this mission.

313
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing.

314
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
This is the ARES team;

315
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
we have about 150 scientists, engineers;

316
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

317
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Goddard Space Flight Center,

318
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities

319
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and corporations in developing this.

320
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center.

321
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And let me conclude by saying

322
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
not too far from here,

323
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
right down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina,

324
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
a little more than 100 years ago

325
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
history was made

326
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.

327
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
We are on the verge right now

328
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to make the first flight of an airplane

329
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
outside the Earth's atmosphere.

330
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We are prepared to fly this on Mars,

331
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
rewrite the textbook about Mars.

332
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
If you're interested in more information,

333
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
we have a website that describes this exciting

334
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.

335
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:12.746,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The first time I cried underwater

2
0:00:15.194,000 --> 0:00:16,000
was in 2008,

3
0:00:16.761,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the island of Curaçao,

4
0:00:18.362,000 --> 0:00:19,000
way down in the southern Caribbean.

5
0:00:20.668,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's beautiful there.

6
0:00:22.344,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was studying these corals for my PhD,

7
0:00:25.294,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and after days and days of diving on the same reef,

8
0:00:27.7,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I had gotten to know them as individuals.

9
0:00:29.753,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I had made friends with coral colonies --

10
0:00:32.248,000 --> 0:00:33,000
totally a normal thing to do.

11
0:00:35.08,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart and ripped off their skin,

12
0:00:39.8,000 --> 0:00:43,000
leaving little bits of wounded tissue that would have a hard time healing,

13
0:00:44.313,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and big patches of dead skeleton that would get overgrown by algae.

14
0:00:48.201,000 --> 0:00:5,000
When I saw this damage for the first time,

15
0:00:50.249,000 --> 0:00:51,000
stretching all the way down the reef,

16
0:00:52.083,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear

17
0:00:53.964,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I cried.

18
0:00:55.384,000 --> 0:00:57,000
If a coral could die that fast,

19
0:00:57.765,000 --> 0:00:58,000
how could a reef ever survive?

20
0:01:00.174,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And why was I making it my job to try to fight for them?

21
0:01:03.672,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I never heard another scientist tell that kind of story

22
0:01:06.728,000 --> 0:01:07,000
until last year.

23
0:01:08.623,000 --> 0:01:1,000
A scientist in Guam wrote,

24
0:01:10.652,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"I cried right into my mask,"

25
0:01:12.223,000 --> 0:01:14,000
seeing the damage on the reefs.

26
0:01:15.469,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Then a scientist in Australia wrote,

27
0:01:17.434,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"I showed my students the results of our coral surveys,

28
0:01:20.455,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and we wept."

29
0:01:22.716,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Crying about corals is having a moment, guys.

30
0:01:25.388,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:26.546,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And that's because reefs in the Pacific

32
0:01:28.514,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are losing corals faster than we've ever seen before.

33
0:01:31.689,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Because of climate change,

34
0:01:32.985,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the water is so hot for so long in the summers,

35
0:01:35.818,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that these animals can't function normally.

36
0:01:38.494,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They're spitting out the colored algae that lives in their skin,

37
0:01:41.546,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and the clear bleached tissue that's left usually starves to death

38
0:01:46.635,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and then rots away.

39
0:01:48.944,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae.

40
0:01:51.781,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is happening over an unbelievable scale.

41
0:01:54.128,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The Northern Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds of its corals last year

42
0:01:58.288,000 --> 0:02:,000
over a distance of hundreds of miles,

43
0:02:00.867,000 --> 0:02:01,000
then bleached again this year,

44
0:02:02.693,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the bleaching stretched further south.

45
0:02:05.824,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Reefs in the Pacific are in a nosedive right now,

46
0:02:08.162,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and no one knows how bad it's going to get,

47
0:02:10.725,000 --> 0:02:11,000
except ...

48
0:02:12.118,000 --> 0:02:13,000
over in the Caribbean where I work,

49
0:02:14.081,000 --> 0:02:16,000
we've already been through the nosedive.

50
0:02:16.519,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Reefs there have suffered through centuries of intense human abuse.

51
0:02:20.764,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We kind of already know how the story goes.

52
0:02:23.283,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And we might be able to help predict what happens next.

53
0:02:27.774,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Let's consult a graph.

54
0:02:32.442,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Since the invention of scuba,

55
0:02:33.847,000 --> 0:02:35,000
scientists have measured the amount of coral on the seafloor,

56
0:02:36.852,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and how it's changed through time.

57
0:02:39.216,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And after centuries of ratcheting human pressure,

58
0:02:41.701,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.

59
0:02:44.774,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Some reefs lost their corals very quickly.

60
0:02:49.065,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Some reefs lost their corals more slowly,

61
0:02:52.533,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but kind of ended up in the same place.

62
0:02:55.55,000 --> 0:02:56,000
OK, so far this is not going very well.

63
0:02:58.064,000 --> 0:03:,000
But some reefs in the Caribbean --

64
0:03:00.351,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the ones best protected

65
0:03:02.268,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and the ones a little further from humans --

66
0:03:05.006,000 --> 0:03:08,000
they managed to hold onto their corals.

67
0:03:09.227,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Give us a challenge.

68
0:03:11.909,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero.

69
0:03:16.11,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The second time I cried underwater

70
0:03:18.62,000 --> 0:03:21,000
was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.

71
0:03:22.054,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It was the calmest day of the year,

72
0:03:23.762,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but it's always pretty sketchy diving there.

73
0:03:26.155,000 --> 0:03:28,000
My boyfriend and I swam against the waves.

74
0:03:28.275,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I watched my compass so we could find our way back out,

75
0:03:30.973,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and he watched for sharks,

76
0:03:32.627,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and after 20 minutes of swimming that felt like an hour,

77
0:03:35.507,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we finally dropped down to the reef,

78
0:03:37.247,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and I was so shocked,

79
0:03:38.83,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I was so happy

80
0:03:40.5,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that my eyes filled with tears.

81
0:03:43.219,000 --> 0:03:47,000
There were corals 1,000 years old lined up one after another.

82
0:03:48.996,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They had survived the entire history of European colonialism in the Caribbean,

83
0:03:53.706,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and for centuries before that.

84
0:03:57.465,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I never knew what a coral could do when it was given a chance to thrive.

85
0:04:02.66,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The truth is that even as we lose so many corals,

86
0:04:06.067,000 --> 0:04:09,000
even as we go through this massive coral die-off,

87
0:04:09.147,000 --> 0:04:1,000
some reefs will survive.

88
0:04:11.732,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Some will be ragged on the edge,

89
0:04:13.41,000 --> 0:04:14,000
some will be beautiful.

90
0:04:15.911,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And by protecting shorelines and giving us food to eat

91
0:04:18.626,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and supporting tourism,

92
0:04:20.399,000 --> 0:04:23,000
they will still be worth billions and billions of dollars a year.

93
0:04:24.043,000 --> 0:04:26,000
The best time to protect a reef was 50 years ago,

94
0:04:26.658,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but the second-best time is right now.

95
0:04:31.115,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Even as we go through bleaching events,

96
0:04:33.09,000 --> 0:04:35,000
more frequent and in more places,

97
0:04:35.657,000 --> 0:04:37,000
some corals will be able to recover.

98
0:04:38.792,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We had a bleaching event in 2010 in the Caribbean

99
0:04:41.668,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that took off big patches of skin on boulder corals like these.

100
0:04:46.172,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This coral lost half of its skin.

101
0:04:48.809,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But if you look at the side of this coral a few years later,

102
0:04:53.06,000 --> 0:04:55,000
this coral is actually healthy again.

103
0:04:55.432,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's doing what a healthy coral does.

104
0:04:57.753,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It's making copies of its polyps,

105
0:04:59.875,000 --> 0:05:,000
it's fighting back the algae

106
0:05:01.354,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and it's reclaiming its territory.

107
0:05:04.195,000 --> 0:05:05,000
If a few polyps survive,

108
0:05:05.384,000 --> 0:05:06,000
a coral can regrow;

109
0:05:06.581,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it just needs time and protection and a reasonable temperature.

110
0:05:11.188,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Some corals can regrow in 10 years --

111
0:05:13.021,000 --> 0:05:14,000
others take a lot longer.

112
0:05:14.768,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But the more stresses we take off them locally --

113
0:05:17.443,000 --> 0:05:2,000
things like overfishing, sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution,

114
0:05:21.461,000 --> 0:05:23,000
dredging, coastal construction --

115
0:05:23.93,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the better they can hang on as we stabilize the climate,

116
0:05:26.824,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and the faster they can regrow.

117
0:05:29.766,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And as we go through the long, tough and necessary process

118
0:05:33.528,000 --> 0:05:35,000
of stabilizing the climate of planet Earth,

119
0:05:36.157,000 --> 0:05:38,000
some new corals will still be born.

120
0:05:39.143,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is what I study in my research.

121
0:05:41.498,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We try to understand how corals make babies,

122
0:05:44.069,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and how those babies find their way to the reef,

123
0:05:46.767,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and we invent new methods to help them survive

124
0:05:49.093,000 --> 0:05:5,000
those early, fragile life stages.

125
0:05:51.904,000 --> 0:05:54,000
One of my favorite coral babies of all time

126
0:05:54.929,000 --> 0:05:56,000
showed up right after Hurricane Omar.

127
0:05:56.963,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's the same species I was studying before the storm,

128
0:05:59.678,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but you almost never see babies of this species --

129
0:06:02.134,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's really rare.

130
0:06:03.373,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This is actually an endangered species.

131
0:06:06.219,000 --> 0:06:09,000
In this photo, this little baby coral, this little circle of polyps,

132
0:06:09.739,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is a few years old.

133
0:06:11.616,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Like its cousins that bleach,

134
0:06:13.109,000 --> 0:06:14,000
it's fighting back the algae.

135
0:06:14.969,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And like its cousins on the north shore,

136
0:06:16.918,000 --> 0:06:19,000
it's aiming to live for 1,000 years.

137
0:06:21.018,000 --> 0:06:23,000
What's happening in the world and in the ocean

138
0:06:23.892,000 --> 0:06:24,000
has changed our time horizon.

139
0:06:26.457,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We can be incredibly pessimistic on the short term,

140
0:06:29.52,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and mourn what we lost

141
0:06:30.859,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and what we really took for granted.

142
0:06:34.028,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But we can still be optimistic on the long term,

143
0:06:36.802,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and we can still be ambitious about what we fight for

144
0:06:39.304,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and what we expect from our governments,

145
0:06:42.426,000 --> 0:06:43,000
from our planet.

146
0:06:44.364,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Corals have been living on planet Earth for hundreds of millions of years.

147
0:06:48.118,000 --> 0:06:5,000
They survived the extinction of the dinosaurs.

148
0:06:50.335,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They're badasses.

149
0:06:52.189,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:53.69,000 --> 0:06:57,000
An individual coral can go through tremendous trauma and fully recover

151
0:06:58.253,000 --> 0:07:,000
if it's given a chance and it's given protection.

152
0:07:02.042,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Corals have always been playing the long game,

153
0:07:05.539,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and now so are we.

154
0:07:07.612,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Thanks very much.

155
0:07:08.789,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause)

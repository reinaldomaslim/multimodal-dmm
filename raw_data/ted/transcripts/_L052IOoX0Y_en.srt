2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Usually I like working in my shop,

3
0:00:17.885,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river,

4
0:00:22.218,000 --> 0:00:24,000
then I just love it.

5
0:00:24.258,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water,

6
0:00:27.589,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers.

7
0:00:30.468,000 --> 0:00:32,000
You have no idea how much time I spend.

8
0:00:33.4,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This is the "Double Raindrop."

9
0:00:35.427,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Of all my sculptures, it's the most talkative.

10
0:00:43.69,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It adds together the interference pattern

11
0:00:46.702,000 --> 0:00:49,000
from two raindrops that land near each other.

12
0:00:49.981,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Instead of expanding circles, they're expanding hexagons.

13
0:01:00.205,000 --> 0:01:04,000
All the sculptures move by mechanical means.

14
0:01:10.15,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave?

15
0:01:14.385,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on.

16
0:01:35.904,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Eight hundred two-liter soda bottles --

17
0:01:39.37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
oh yea.

18
0:01:41.114,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:53.519,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Four hundred aluminum cans.

20
0:01:59.777,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Tule is a reed that's native to California,

21
0:02:02.537,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious.

22
0:02:21.095,000 --> 0:02:23,000
A single drop of rain

23
0:02:24.043,000 --> 0:02:26,000
increasing amplitude.

24
0:02:48.143,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip.

25
0:03:03.523,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This adds together four different waves.

26
0:03:06.398,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths

27
0:03:09.319,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and increase the single.

28
0:03:12.667,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The mechanism that drives it has nine motors

29
0:03:15.608,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and about 3,000 pulleys.

30
0:03:27.776,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Four hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave.

31
0:03:32.433,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Transferred to a larger scale --

32
0:03:35.272,000 --> 0:03:38,000
actually a lot larger, with a lot of help --

33
0:03:38.35,000 --> 0:03:41,000
14,064 bicycle reflectors --

34
0:03:42.117,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a 20-day install.

35
0:04:04.943,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Connected" is a collaboration

36
0:04:06.635,000 --> 0:04:09,000
with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek.

37
0:04:10.439,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Strings attached to dancers.

38
0:04:13.78,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This is very early rehearsal footage,

39
0:04:16.202,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but the finished work's on tour

40
0:04:18.564,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks.

41
0:04:27.399,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A pair of helices and 40 wooden slats.

42
0:04:53.031,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Take your finger and draw this line.

43
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Summer, fall, winter, spring,

44
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
noon, dusk, dark, dawn.

45
0:05:06.497,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Have you ever seen those stratus clouds

46
0:05:09.76,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that go in parallel stripes across the sky?

47
0:05:12.433,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud

48
0:05:15.028,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer?

49
0:05:18.625,000 --> 0:05:2,000
What if every seemingly isolated object

50
0:05:21.458,000 --> 0:05:24,000
was actually just where the continuous wave of that object

51
0:05:25.302,000 --> 0:05:28,000
poked through into our world?

52
0:05:28.783,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The Earth is neither flat nor round.

53
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It's wavy.

54
0:05:37.583,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It sounds good, but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth,

55
0:05:43.081,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I'll tell you why.

56
0:05:44.639,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever.

57
0:05:46.635,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And I'm just going to come out and say it:

58
0:05:48.718,000 --> 0:05:51,000
My daughter is not a wave.

59
0:05:52.253,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And you might say, "Surely, Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back,

60
0:05:56.833,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the cycles of hunger and eating,

61
0:05:59.593,000 --> 0:06:01,000
waking and sleeping, laughing and crying

62
0:06:02.433,000 --> 0:06:04,000
would emerge as pattern."

63
0:06:05.044,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But I would say, "If I did that,

64
0:06:07.671,000 --> 0:06:1,000
too much would be lost."

65
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This tension between the need to look deeper

66
0:06:15.889,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and the beauty and immediacy of the world,

67
0:06:18.843,000 --> 0:06:21,000
where if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for,

68
0:06:22.545,000 --> 0:06:25,000
this tension is what makes the sculptures move.

69
0:06:25.616,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And for me, the path between these two extremes

70
0:06:28.127,000 --> 0:06:3,000
takes the shape of a wave.

71
0:06:30.862,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Let me show you one more.

72
0:07:15.36,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Thank you very much. Thanks.

73
0:07:18.789,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Applause)

74
0:07:20.97,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Thanks.

75
0:07:22.202,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Applause)

76
0:07:26.666,000 --> 0:07:27,000
June Cohen: Looking at each of your sculptures,

77
0:07:28.439,000 --> 0:07:3,000
they evoke so many different images.

78
0:07:30.867,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves,

79
0:07:33.402,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math.

80
0:07:36.287,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Is there an actual inspiration behind each one?

81
0:07:38.791,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it?

82
0:07:42.347,000 --> 0:07:45,000
RM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation --

83
0:07:45.487,000 --> 0:07:47,000
like literally two raindrops falling,

84
0:07:48.302,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and just watching that pattern is so stunning.

85
0:07:51.177,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff.

86
0:07:56.881,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I like working with my hands.

87
0:07:59.425,000 --> 0:08:01,000
There's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood

88
0:08:01.635,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and trying to make it move.

89
0:08:03.385,000 --> 0:08:04,000
JC: And does it ever change?

90
0:08:05.135,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Do you think you're designing one thing,

91
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and then when it's produced it looks like something else?

92
0:08:08.01,000 --> 0:08:11,000
RM: The "Double Raindrop" I worked on for nine months,

93
0:08:11.468,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and when I finally turned it on,

94
0:08:13.825,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I actually hated it.

95
0:08:17.468,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The very moment I turned it on, I hated it.

96
0:08:21.593,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It was like a really deep-down gut reaction, and I wanted to throw it out.

97
0:08:24.941,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I happened to have a friend who was over,

98
0:08:27.085,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and he said, "Why don't you just wait."

99
0:08:29.097,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And I waited, and the next day I liked it a bit better,

100
0:08:33.466,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the next day I liked it a bit better, and now I really love it.

101
0:08:36.427,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes,

102
0:08:41.093,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and two, it does not look like as expected.

103
0:08:43.635,000 --> 0:08:45,000
JC: The relationship evolves over time.

104
0:08:46.052,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us.

105
0:08:46.927,000 --> 0:08:48,000
RM: Thanks. (JC: Thank you, Reuben.)

106
0:08:49.814,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Applause)

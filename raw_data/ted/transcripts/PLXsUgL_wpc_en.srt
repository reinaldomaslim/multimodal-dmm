1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is very strange for me, because I’m not used to doing this:

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I usually stand on the other side of the light,

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The previous speaker has, I think,

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
really painted a very good background as to

6
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,

7
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and trying to find the answer to the big questions.

8
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this,

9
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
feels like -- there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,

10
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know,

11
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?

12
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What have you done with so many years of being away?

13
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.

14
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?

15
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And we expected huge masterpieces!"

16
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces

17
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything --

18
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
just in a reduced, small version.

19
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In a way, I feel like that.

20
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I feel like I’m coming home to talk about

21
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
what I’ve been away doing for 20 years.

22
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about:

23
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
a handful of films -- nothing much,

24
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
two feature films and a handful of short films.

25
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, we’ll go with the first piece.

26
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Video) Woman: "I destroy lives," mum said.

27
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I love her, you know.

28
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
She’s not even my real mum.

29
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
My real mum and dad dumped me

30
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and fucked off back to Nigeria.

31
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The devil is in me, Court.

32
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Court: Sleep.

33
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Woman: Have you ever been?

34
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Court: Where?

35
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Woman: Nigeria.

36
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Court: Never.

37
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
My mum wanted to,

38
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
couldn’t afford it.

39
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Woman: Wish I could.

40
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I have this feeling I’d be happy there.

41
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Why does everyone get rid of me?

42
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Court: I don't want to get rid of you.

43
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Woman: You don't need me.

44
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You’re just too blind to see it now.

45
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Boy: What do you do all day?

46
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Marcus: Read.

47
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Boy: Don't you get bored?

48
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And how come you ain't got a job anyway?

49
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Marcus: I am retired.

50
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Boy: So?

51
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.

52
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.

53
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Marcus: Because I do what I like?

54
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.

55
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.

56
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.

57
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.

58
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Marcus: You’re a rapper, am I right?

59
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Boy: Yeah.

60
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Marcus: A modern day poet.

61
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Boy: Yeah, you could say that.

62
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Marcus: So what do you talk about?

63
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Boy: What's that supposed to mean?

64
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?

65
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Boy: Reality, man.

66
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Marcus: Whose reality?

67
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Boy: My fuckin' reality.

68
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Marcus: Tell me about your reality.

69
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.

70
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just --

71
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.

72
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Marcus: With an AK-47?

73
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.

74
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?

75
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.

76
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities,

77
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.

78
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Boy: See man, you’re just taking the piss out of me now.

79
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Marcus: The Panthers.

80
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Boy: Panthers?

81
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit,

82
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.

83
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Fuckin’ wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?

84
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Director 1: I saw his last film.

85
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Épuise, right?

86
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Woman 1: Yes.

87
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.

88
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Epuisé -- tired, exhausted, fed up.

89
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Director 2: Can you not shut up?

90
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Now, you talk straight to me, what’s wrong with my films?

91
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Let’s go.

92
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
W1: They suck.

93
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Woman 2: They suck? What about yours?

94
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
What, what, what, what about, what?

95
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
What do you think about your movie?

96
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
D1: My movies, they are OK, fine.

97
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.

98
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

99
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood

100
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to go and film something real?

101
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You make people fuckin' sleep.

102
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Dream about bullshit.

103
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Applause)

104
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is

105
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
totally trying to capture what cinema is for me,

106
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.

107
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria,

108
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.

109
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.

110
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.

111
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.

112
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I've been away 20 years in total.

113
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And so it’s really --

114
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,

115
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship,

116
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.

117
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So, for this girl to have these dreams

118
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.

119
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,

120
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because you just need something to hold on to,

121
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
especially in a society where you feel alienated.

122
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man

123
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,

124
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,

125
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and his reality.

126
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about --

127
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,

128
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say,

129
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?

130
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And what would a child --

131
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think,

132
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?

133
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
What happens with that?

134
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
What, of course, happens with that is violence,

135
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which we see when we talk about the ghettos

136
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,

137
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and which eventually, when channeled, becomes,

138
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots --

139
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
like the one in France two years ago, where I live,

140
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well,

141
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
France is a liberal society."

142
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But I lived in England for 18 years.

143
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually

144
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
thrown back 20 years, living in France.

145
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:

146
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?

147
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends --

148
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.

149
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I suppose that will take me to my last piece --

150
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
what cinema means for me.

151
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966,

152
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years

153
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and it was three years of war.

154
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
So that whole thing,

155
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.

156
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.

157

The injection made us not to have mind.

0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
God will forgive us.

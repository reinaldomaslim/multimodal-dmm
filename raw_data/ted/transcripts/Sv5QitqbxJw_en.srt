1
0:00:12.798,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, here's a prediction.

2
0:00:15.346,000 --> 0:00:17,000
If we get our cities right,

3
0:00:17.586,000 --> 0:00:19,000
we just might survive the 21st century.

4
0:00:22.579,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We get them wrong,

5
0:00:24.094,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and we're done for.

6
0:00:26.307,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Cities are the most extraordinary experiment in social engineering

7
0:00:29.655,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that we humans have ever come up with.

8
0:00:32.006,000 --> 0:00:33,000
If you live in a city,

9
0:00:33.378,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and even if you live in a slum --

10
0:00:35.591,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which 20 percent of the world's urban population does --

11
0:00:38.444,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you're likely to be healthier, wealthier, better educated

12
0:00:41.23,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and live longer than your country cousins.

13
0:00:44.411,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There's a reason why three million people are moving to cities

14
0:00:48.093,000 --> 0:00:49,000
every single week.

15
0:00:49.877,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Cities are where the future happens first.

16
0:00:53.664,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They're open, they're creative, they're dynamic, they're democratic,

17
0:00:57.181,000 --> 0:00:58,000
they're cosmopolitan,

18
0:00:58.356,000 --> 0:00:59,000
they're sexy.

19
0:01:00.353,000 --> 0:01:04,000
They're the perfect antidote to reactionary nationalism.

20
0:01:06.415,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But cities have a dark side.

21
0:01:09.013,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They take up just three percent of the world's surface area,

22
0:01:12.103,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but they account for more than 75 percent of our energy consumption,

23
0:01:15.533,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and they emit 80 percent of our greenhouse gases.

24
0:01:19.855,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There are hundreds of thousands of people who die in our cities

25
0:01:24.08,000 --> 0:01:25,000
every single year from violence,

26
0:01:25.953,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and millions more who are killed as a result of car accidents

27
0:01:29.086,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and pollution.

28
0:01:30.639,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In Brazil, where I live,

29
0:01:32.747,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we've got 25 of the 50 most homicidal cities on the planet.

30
0:01:37.497,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And a quarter of our cities have chronic water shortages --

31
0:01:40.868,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and this, in a country with 20 percent of the known water reserves.

32
0:01:45.329,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So cities are dual-edged.

33
0:01:47.674,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Part of the problem is that,

34
0:01:49.075,000 --> 0:01:52,000
apart from a handful of megacities in the West and the Far East,

35
0:01:52.458,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we don't know that much about the thousands of cities

36
0:01:55.836,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia,

37
0:01:58.239,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where 90 percent of all future population growth is set to take place.

38
0:02:03.026,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So why this knowledge gap?

39
0:02:05.537,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Well, part of the problem

40
0:02:06.964,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is that we still see the world through the lens of nation-states.

41
0:02:11.02,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We're still locked in a 17th-century paradigm

42
0:02:15.255,000 --> 0:02:17,000
of parochial national sovereignty.

43
0:02:18.606,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And yet, in the 1600's,

44
0:02:19.849,000 --> 0:02:21,000
when nation-states were really coming into their own,

45
0:02:22.462,000 --> 0:02:24,000
less than one percent of the world's population

46
0:02:24.839,000 --> 0:02:25,000
resided in a city.

47
0:02:26.315,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Today, it's 54 percent.

48
0:02:28.603,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And by 2050, it will be closer to 70 percent.

49
0:02:33.109,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So the world has changed.

50
0:02:34.84,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We have these 193 nation-states,

51
0:02:38.464,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but we have easily as many cities that are beginning to rival them

52
0:02:41.898,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in power and influence.

53
0:02:43.453,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Just look at New York.

54
0:02:44.93,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The Big Apple has 8.5 million people

55
0:02:47.765,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and an annual budget of 80 billion dollars.

56
0:02:51.026,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Its GDP is 1.5 trillion,

57
0:02:53.773,000 --> 0:02:56,000
which puts it higher than Argentina and Australia,

58
0:02:57.454,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Nigeria and South Africa.

59
0:03:00.189,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Its roughly 40,000 police officers

60
0:03:02.734,000 --> 0:03:05,000
means it has one of the largest police departments in the world,

61
0:03:05.758,000 --> 0:03:07,000
rivaling all but the largest nation-states.

62
0:03:09.653,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But cities like New York

63
0:03:11.698,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or São Paulo

64
0:03:12.904,000 --> 0:03:13,000
or Johannesburg

65
0:03:14.148,000 --> 0:03:15,000
or Dhaka

66
0:03:15.339,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or Shanghai --

67
0:03:16.536,000 --> 0:03:18,000
they're punching above their weight economically,

68
0:03:18.921,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but below their weight politically.

69
0:03:21.131,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And that's going to have to change.

70
0:03:23.005,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Cities are going to have to find their political voice

71
0:03:25.697,000 --> 0:03:26,000
if we want to change things.

72
0:03:28.131,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, I want to talk to you a little bit about the risks

73
0:03:31.198,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that cities are facing --

74
0:03:32.439,000 --> 0:03:33,000
some of the big mega-risks.

75
0:03:33.765,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I'm also going to talk to you briefly about some of the solutions.

76
0:03:36.987,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I'm going to do this using a big data visualization

77
0:03:39.459,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that was developed with Carnegie Mellon's CREATE Lab and my institute,

78
0:03:42.946,000 --> 0:03:43,000
along with many, many others.

79
0:03:44.564,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I want you to first imagine the world not as made up of nation-states,

80
0:03:47.966,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but as made up of cities.

81
0:03:50.041,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What you see here is every single city

82
0:03:52.35,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with a population of a quarter million people or more.

83
0:03:56.002,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, without going into technical detail,

84
0:03:58.025,000 --> 0:04:,000
the redder the circle, the more fragile that city is,

85
0:04:00.813,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and the bluer the circle, the more resilient.

86
0:04:03.58,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Fragility occurs when the social contract comes unstuck.

87
0:04:07.634,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And what we tend to see is a convergence of multiple kinds of risks:

88
0:04:11.078,000 --> 0:04:12,000
income inequality,

89
0:04:12.381,000 --> 0:04:13,000
poverty,

90
0:04:14.098,000 --> 0:04:15,000
youth unemployment,

91
0:04:15.912,000 --> 0:04:16,000
different issues around violence,

92
0:04:17.775,000 --> 0:04:2,000
even exposure to droughts, cyclones and earthquakes.

93
0:04:22.515,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now obviously, some cities are more fragile than others.

94
0:04:26.966,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The good news, if there is any,

95
0:04:29.075,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is that fragility is not a permanent condition.

96
0:04:31.775,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Some cities that were once the most fragile cities in the world,

97
0:04:35.145,000 --> 0:04:36,000
like Bogotá in Colombia

98
0:04:36.56,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or Ciudad Juárez in Mexico,

99
0:04:38.176,000 --> 0:04:4,000
have now fallen more around the national average.

100
0:04:41.845,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The bad news is that fragility is deepening,

101
0:04:44.284,000 --> 0:04:47,000
especially in those parts of the world that are most vulnerable,

102
0:04:47.411,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in North Africa, the Middle East,

103
0:04:49.069,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in South Asia and Central Asia.

104
0:04:51.516,000 --> 0:04:55,000
There, we're seeing fragility rising way beyond scales we've ever seen before.

105
0:04:56.945,000 --> 0:04:59,000
When cities become too fragile they can collapse,

106
0:05:00.087,000 --> 0:05:01,000
tip over and fail.

107
0:05:01.54,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And when that happens,

108
0:05:02.894,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we have explosive forms of migration:

109
0:05:05.936,000 --> 0:05:06,000
refugees.

110
0:05:07.767,000 --> 0:05:1,000
There are more than 22 million refugees in the world today,

111
0:05:12.281,000 --> 0:05:15,000
more than at any other time since the second world war.

112
0:05:17.512,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, there's not one refugee crisis;

113
0:05:19.947,000 --> 0:05:2,000
there are multiple refugee crises.

114
0:05:21.798,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And contrary to what you might read in the news,

115
0:05:24.163,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the vast majority of refugees aren't fleeing from poor countries

116
0:05:27.275,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to wealthy countries,

117
0:05:28.468,000 --> 0:05:3,000
they're moving from poor cities into even poorer cities --

118
0:05:31.478,000 --> 0:05:32,000
often, cities nearby.

119
0:05:33.815,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Every single dot on this map represents an agonizing story

120
0:05:38.226,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of struggle and survival.

121
0:05:40.038,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But I want to briefly tell you about what's not on that map,

122
0:05:42.872,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and that's internal displacement.

123
0:05:44.835,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There are more than 36 million people who have been internally displaced

124
0:05:48.667,000 --> 0:05:49,000
around the world.

125
0:05:49.859,000 --> 0:05:51,000
These are people living in refugee-like conditions,

126
0:05:52.378,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but lacking the equivalent international protection and assistance.

127
0:05:55.797,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And to understand their plight,

128
0:05:57.413,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I want to zoom in briefly on Syria.

129
0:06:01.523,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Syria suffered one of the worst droughts in its history between 2007 and 2010.

130
0:06:06.202,000 --> 0:06:09,000
More than 75 percent of its agriculture and 85 percent of its livestock

131
0:06:10.168,000 --> 0:06:11,000
were wiped out.

132
0:06:11.644,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And in the process, over a million people moved into cities

133
0:06:14.707,000 --> 0:06:16,000
like Aleppo, Damascus and Homs.

134
0:06:17.832,000 --> 0:06:19,000
As food prices began to rise,

135
0:06:19.889,000 --> 0:06:21,000
you also had equivalent levels of social unrest.

136
0:06:23.384,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And when the regime of President Assad began cracking down,

137
0:06:26.812,000 --> 0:06:28,000
you had an explosion of refugees.

138
0:06:30.347,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You also had over six million internally displaced people,

139
0:06:33.571,000 --> 0:06:35,000
many of whom when on to become refugees.

140
0:06:35.961,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And they didn't just move to neighboring countries like Jordan

141
0:06:39.045,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or Lebanon or Turkey.

142
0:06:41.172,000 --> 0:06:43,000
They also moved up north towards Western Europe.

143
0:06:44.69,000 --> 0:06:47,000
See, over 1.4 million Syrians made the perilous journey

144
0:06:48.49,000 --> 0:06:5,000
through the Mediterranean and up through Turkey

145
0:06:51.237,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to find their way into two countries, primarily:

146
0:06:53.626,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Germany and Sweden.

147
0:06:57.048,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Now, climate change --

148
0:06:58.49,000 --> 0:07:,000
not just drought, but also sea level rise,

149
0:07:01.224,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is probably one of the most severe existential threats

150
0:07:04.193,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that cities face.

151
0:07:05.508,000 --> 0:07:08,000
That's because two-thirds of the world's cities are coastal.

152
0:07:10.156,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Over 1.5 billion people live in low-lying, flood-prone coastal areas.

153
0:07:15.981,000 --> 0:07:17,000
What you see here is a map that shows sea level rise

154
0:07:18.882,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in relation to changes in temperature.

155
0:07:21.953,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Climate scientists predict that we're going to see

156
0:07:24.385,000 --> 0:07:26,000
anywhere between three and 30 feet of sea level rise

157
0:07:26.946,000 --> 0:07:27,000
this side of the century.

158
0:07:28.522,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And it's not just low island nation-states that are going to suffer --

159
0:07:31.88,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Kiribati or the Maldives or the Solomons or Sri Lanka --

160
0:07:35.244,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and they will suffer,

161
0:07:36.916,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but also massive cities like Dhaka,

162
0:07:39.542,000 --> 0:07:4,000
like Hong Kong,

163
0:07:40.79,000 --> 0:07:41,000
like Shanghai.

164
0:07:42.074,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Cities of 10, 20, 30 million people or more

165
0:07:45.149,000 --> 0:07:48,000
are literally going to be wiped off the face of this earth.

166
0:07:48.984,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They're going to have to adapt, or they're going to die.

167
0:07:52.683,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I want to take you also all the way over to the West,

168
0:07:55.264,000 --> 0:07:58,000
because this isn't just a problem in Asia or Africa or Latin America,

169
0:07:58.579,000 --> 0:07:59,000
this is a problem also in the West.

170
0:08:00.42,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This is Miami.

171
0:08:01.6,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Many of you know Miami is one of the wealthiest cities

172
0:08:04.195,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in the United States;

173
0:08:05.372,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it's also one of the most flood-prone.

174
0:08:07.234,000 --> 0:08:1,000
That's been made painfully evident by natural disasters throughout 2017.

175
0:08:10.688,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But Miami is built on porous limestone -- a swamp.

176
0:08:13.12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
There's no way any kind of flood barrier

177
0:08:15.12,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is going to keep the water from seeping in.

178
0:08:17.48,000 --> 0:08:18,000
As we scroll back,

179
0:08:18.71,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and we look across the Caribbean and along the Gulf,

180
0:08:21.426,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we begin to realize

181
0:08:22.604,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that those cities that have suffered worst from natural crises --

182
0:08:25.744,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Port-au-Prince, New Orleans, Houston --

183
0:08:28.772,000 --> 0:08:3,000
as severe and as awful as those situations have been,

184
0:08:31.395,000 --> 0:08:33,000
they're a dress rehearsal for what's to come.

185
0:08:34.855,000 --> 0:08:35,000
No city is an island.

186
0:08:36.56,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Every city is connected to its rural hinterland

187
0:08:38.84,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in complex ways --

188
0:08:40.016,000 --> 0:08:42,000
often, in relation to the production of food.

189
0:08:42.842,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I want to take you to the northern part of the Amazon, in Rondônia.

190
0:08:46.24,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is one of the world's largest terrestrial carbon sinks,

191
0:08:49.145,000 --> 0:08:51,000
processing millions of carbon every single year.

192
0:08:51.431,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What you see here is a single road over a 30-year period.

193
0:08:54.3,000 --> 0:08:57,000
On either side you see land being cleared for pasture, for cattle,

194
0:08:58.189,000 --> 0:09:,000
but also for soy and sugar production.

195
0:09:00.981,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You're seeing deforestation on a massive scale.

196
0:09:04.673,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The red area here implies a net loss of forest over the last 14 years.

197
0:09:09.854,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The blue, if you could see it -- there's not much --

198
0:09:12.425,000 --> 0:09:14,000
implies there's been an incremental gain.

199
0:09:15.275,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now, as grim and gloomy as the situation is -- and it is --

200
0:09:19.32,000 --> 0:09:2,000
there is a little bit of hope.

201
0:09:21.366,000 --> 0:09:22,000
See, the Brazilian government,

202
0:09:22.882,000 --> 0:09:24,000
from the national to the state to the municipal level,

203
0:09:25.473,000 --> 0:09:28,000
has also introduced a whole range -- a lattice -- of parks and protected areas.

204
0:09:29.314,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And while not perfect, and not always limiting encroachment,

205
0:09:32.314,000 --> 0:09:34,000
they have served to tamp back deforestation.

206
0:09:35.791,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The same applies not just in Brazil but all across the Americas,

207
0:09:39.043,000 --> 0:09:41,000
into the United States, Canada and around the world.

208
0:09:41.595,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So let's talk about solutions.

209
0:09:44.917,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Despite climate denial at the highest levels,

210
0:09:48.413,000 --> 0:09:49,000
cities are taking action.

211
0:09:50.246,000 --> 0:09:53,000
You know, when the US pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement,

212
0:09:53.689,000 --> 0:09:56,000
hundreds of cities in the United States and thousands more around the world

213
0:09:57.347,000 --> 0:09:59,000
doubled down on their climate commitments.

214
0:10:00.005,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

215
0:10:06.924,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And when the White House cracked down on so-called "undocumented migrants"

216
0:10:11.385,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in sanctuary cities,

217
0:10:12.604,000 --> 0:10:14,000
hundreds of cities and counties and states sat up in defiance

218
0:10:15.591,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and refused to enact that order.

219
0:10:17.706,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Applause)

220
0:10:22.033,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So cities are and can take action.

221
0:10:25.731,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But we're going to need to see a lot more of it,

222
0:10:28.597,000 --> 0:10:29,000
especially in the global south.

223
0:10:30.547,000 --> 0:10:33,000
You see, parts of Africa and Latin America are urbanizing

224
0:10:34.361,000 --> 0:10:35,000
before they industrialize.

225
0:10:35.737,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They're growing at three times the global average

226
0:10:38.211,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in terms their population.

227
0:10:40.532,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And this is putting enormous strain on infrastructure and services.

228
0:10:44.514,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now, there is a golden opportunity.

229
0:10:48.134,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It's a small opportunity but a golden one: in the next 10 to 20 years,

230
0:10:51.483,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to really start designing in principles of resilience into our cities.

231
0:10:55.051,000 --> 0:10:57,000
There's not one single way of doing this,

232
0:10:57.54,000 --> 0:10:59,000
but there are a number of ways that are emerging.

233
0:11:00.357,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And I've spoken with hundreds of urban planners,

234
0:11:02.994,000 --> 0:11:03,000
development specialists,

235
0:11:04.452,000 --> 0:11:06,000
architects and civic activists,

236
0:11:06.844,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and a number of recurring principles keep coming out.

237
0:11:09.511,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I just want to pass on six.

238
0:11:12.186,000 --> 0:11:14,000
First: cities need a plan

239
0:11:15.001,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and a strategy to implement it.

240
0:11:16.898,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I mean, it sounds crazy,

241
0:11:18.141,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but the vast majority of world cities don't actually have a plan

242
0:11:21.272,000 --> 0:11:22,000
or a vision.

243
0:11:22.451,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically.

244
0:11:25.809,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I mean, every city wants to be creative,

245
0:11:27.842,000 --> 0:11:29,000
happy, liveable, resilient --

246
0:11:30.232,000 --> 0:11:31,000
who doesn't?

247
0:11:31.534,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The challenge is, how do you get there?

248
0:11:33.428,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And urban governance plays a key role.

249
0:11:35.692,000 --> 0:11:38,000
You could do worse than take a page from the book of Singapore.

250
0:11:38.74,000 --> 0:11:41,000
In 1971, Singapore set a 50-year urban strategy

251
0:11:42.003,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and renews it every five years.

252
0:11:45.189,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What Singapore teaches us is not just the importance of continuity,

253
0:11:48.744,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but also the critical role of autonomy and discretion.

254
0:11:52.747,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Cities need the power to be able to issue debt,

255
0:11:55.796,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to raise taxes,

256
0:11:57.034,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to zone effectively,

257
0:11:58.209,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to build affordable housing.

258
0:12:01.095,000 --> 0:12:05,000
What cities need is nothing less than a devolution revolution,

259
0:12:05.522,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and this is going to require renegotiating the terms of the contract

260
0:12:08.762,000 --> 0:12:09,000
with a nation-state.

261
0:12:10.765,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Second:

262
0:12:12.063,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you've got to go green.

263
0:12:13.778,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Cities are already leading global decarbonization efforts.

264
0:12:16.865,000 --> 0:12:18,000
They're investing in congestion pricing schemes,

265
0:12:19.151,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in climate reduction emission targets,

266
0:12:21.5,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in biodiversity, in parks and bikeways and walkways

267
0:12:25.484,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and everything in between.

268
0:12:26.767,000 --> 0:12:29,000
There's an extraordinary menu of options they have to choose from.

269
0:12:29.944,000 --> 0:12:3,000
One of the great things is,

270
0:12:31.262,000 --> 0:12:34,000
cities are already investing heavily in renewables -- in solar and wind --

271
0:12:34.807,000 --> 0:12:37,000
not just in North America, but especially in Western Europe and parts of Asia.

272
0:12:38.564,000 --> 0:12:4,000
There are more than 8,000 cities right now in the world today

273
0:12:41.491,000 --> 0:12:42,000
with solar plants.

274
0:12:42.685,000 --> 0:12:46,000
There are 300 cities that have declared complete energy autonomy.

275
0:12:46.908,000 --> 0:12:48,000
One of my favorite stories comes from Medellín,

276
0:12:49.335,000 --> 0:12:52,000
which invested in a municipal hydroelectric plant,

277
0:12:52.492,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which doesn't only service its local needs,

278
0:12:54.744,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but allows the city to sell excess energy back onto the national grid.

279
0:12:58.091,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And it's not alone.

280
0:12:59.283,000 --> 0:13:01,000
There are a thousand other cities just like it.

281
0:13:02.389,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Third: invest in integrated and multi-use solutions.

282
0:13:06.956,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The most successful cities are those that are going to invest in solutions

283
0:13:10.549,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that don't solve just one problem, but that solve multiple problems.

284
0:13:13.808,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Take the case of integrated public transport.

285
0:13:17.704,000 --> 0:13:18,000
When done well --

286
0:13:19.042,000 --> 0:13:2,000
rapid bus transit,

287
0:13:20.451,000 --> 0:13:21,000
light rail,

288
0:13:21.818,000 --> 0:13:23,000
bikeways, walkways, boatways --

289
0:13:24.247,000 --> 0:13:27,000
these can dramatically reduce emissions and congestion.

290
0:13:28.297,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But they can do a lot more than that.

291
0:13:30.178,000 --> 0:13:31,000
They can improve public health.

292
0:13:31.877,000 --> 0:13:32,000
They can reduce dispersion.

293
0:13:33.545,000 --> 0:13:34,000
They can even increase safety.

294
0:13:36.109,000 --> 0:13:37,000
A great example of this comes from Seoul.

295
0:13:38.128,000 --> 0:13:41,000
You see, Seoul's population doubled over the last 30 years,

296
0:13:42.133,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but the footprint barely changed.

297
0:13:44.353,000 --> 0:13:45,000
How?

298
0:13:45.778,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Well, 75 percent of Seoul's residents get to work

299
0:13:48.637,000 --> 0:13:49,000
using what's been described as

300
0:13:50.1,000 --> 0:13:52,000
one of the most extraordinary public transport systems

301
0:13:52.698,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in the world.

302
0:13:53.873,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And Seoul used to be car country.

303
0:13:56.859,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Next, fourth:

304
0:13:59.53,000 --> 0:14:01,000
build densely but also sustainably.

305
0:14:03.057,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The death of all cities is the sprawl.

306
0:14:06.667,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Cities need to know how to build resiliently,

307
0:14:08.866,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but also in a way that's inclusive.

308
0:14:11.095,000 --> 0:14:14,000
This is a picture right here of Dallas-Fort Worth.

309
0:14:14.87,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And what you see is its population also doubled over the last 30 years.

310
0:14:19.832,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But as you can see, it spread into edge cities and suburbia

311
0:14:22.986,000 --> 0:14:23,000
as far as the eye can see.

312
0:14:25.121,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Cities need to know when not to build,

313
0:14:27.355,000 --> 0:14:29,000
so as not to reproduce urban sprawl

314
0:14:29.71,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and slums of downward accountability.

315
0:14:32.377,000 --> 0:14:33,000
The problem with Dallas-Forth Worth is

316
0:14:34.361,000 --> 0:14:38,000
just five percent of its residents get to work using public transport -- five.

317
0:14:39.142,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Ninety-five percent use cars,

318
0:14:40.624,000 --> 0:14:43,000
which partly explains why it's got some of the longest commuting times

319
0:14:44.063,000 --> 0:14:45,000
in North America.

320
0:14:45.388,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Singapore, by contrast, got it right.

321
0:14:47.477,000 --> 0:14:48,000
They built vertically

322
0:14:48.668,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and built in affordable housing to boot.

323
0:14:51.989,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Fifth: steal.

324
0:14:54.987,000 --> 0:14:56,000
The smartest cities are nicking, pilfering, stealing,

325
0:14:57.628,000 --> 0:14:58,000
left, right and center.

326
0:14:58.812,000 --> 0:14:59,000
They don't have time to waste.

327
0:15:00.32,000 --> 0:15:01,000
They need tomorrow's technology today,

328
0:15:02.327,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and they're going to leapfrog to get there.

329
0:15:04.356,000 --> 0:15:05,000
This is New York,

330
0:15:05.535,000 --> 0:15:07,000
but it's not just New York that's doing a lot of stealing,

331
0:15:08.393,000 --> 0:15:1,000
it's Singapore, it's Seoul, it's Medellín.

332
0:15:10.481,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The urban renaissance is only going to be enabled

333
0:15:12.842,000 --> 0:15:14,000
when cities start borrowing from one another.

334
0:15:15.041,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And finally: work in global coalitions.

335
0:15:18.008,000 --> 0:15:21,000
You know, there are more than 200 inner-city coalitions in the world today.

336
0:15:21.672,000 --> 0:15:22,000
There are more city coalitions

337
0:15:23.243,000 --> 0:15:25,000
than there are coalitions for nation-states.

338
0:15:26.272,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Just take a look at the Global Parliament of Mayors,

339
0:15:28.799,000 --> 0:15:29,000
set up by the late Ben Barber,

340
0:15:30.272,000 --> 0:15:32,000
who was driving an urban rights movement.

341
0:15:32.337,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Or consider the C40,

342
0:15:33.855,000 --> 0:15:36,000
a marvelous network of cities that has gathered thousands together

343
0:15:37.29,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to deliver clean energy.

344
0:15:39.092,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Or look at the World Economic Forum,

345
0:15:40.879,000 --> 0:15:41,000
which is developing smart city protocols.

346
0:15:42.9,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Or the 100 Resilient Cities initiative,

347
0:15:44.806,000 --> 0:15:46,000
which is leading a resilience revival.

348
0:15:47.945,000 --> 0:15:5,000
ICLEI, UCLG, Metropolis --

349
0:15:51.45,000 --> 0:15:53,000
these are the movements of the future.

350
0:15:54.151,000 --> 0:15:56,000
What they all realize is that when cities work together,

351
0:15:56.961,000 --> 0:15:57,000
they can amplify their voice,

352
0:15:59.499,000 --> 0:16:01,000
not just on the national stage, but on the global stage.

353
0:16:02.518,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And with a voice comes, potentially, a vote --

354
0:16:05.445,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and then maybe even a veto.

355
0:16:09.19,000 --> 0:16:12,000
When nation-states default on their national sovereignty,

356
0:16:12.705,000 --> 0:16:13,000
cities have to step up.

357
0:16:14.611,000 --> 0:16:15,000
They can't wait.

358
0:16:15.787,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And they don't need to ask for permission.

359
0:16:17.993,000 --> 0:16:19,000
They can exert their own sovereignty.

360
0:16:21.037,000 --> 0:16:23,000
They understand that the local and the global

361
0:16:23.192,000 --> 0:16:24,000
have really, truly come together,

362
0:16:24.818,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that we live in a global, local world,

363
0:16:26.698,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and we need to adjust our politics accordingly.

364
0:16:29.371,000 --> 0:16:32,000
As I travel around the world and meet mayors and civic leaders,

365
0:16:32.503,000 --> 0:16:35,000
I'm amazed by the energy, enthusiasm and effectiveness

366
0:16:35.853,000 --> 0:16:36,000
they bring to their work.

367
0:16:37.688,000 --> 0:16:38,000
They're pragmatists.

368
0:16:39.196,000 --> 0:16:4,000
They're problem-solvers.

369
0:16:40.754,000 --> 0:16:41,000
They're para-diplomats.

370
0:16:43.009,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And in this moment of extraordinary international uncertainty,

371
0:16:47.116,000 --> 0:16:49,000
when our multilateral institutions are paralyzed

372
0:16:49.648,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and our nation-states are in retreat,

373
0:16:51.741,000 --> 0:16:55,000
cities and their leaders are our new 21st-century visionaries.

374
0:16:57.254,000 --> 0:17:,000
They deserve -- no, they have a right to -- a seat at the table.

375
0:17:01.82,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Thank you.

376
0:17:03.073,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Applause)

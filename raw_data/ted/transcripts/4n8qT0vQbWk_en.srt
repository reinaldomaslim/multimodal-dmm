1
0:00:13.364,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I just met you on a bus,

2
0:00:16.637,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and we would really like to get to know each other,

3
0:00:19.078,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but I've got to get off at the next stop,

4
0:00:21.564,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so you're going to tell me three things about yourself

5
0:00:26.331,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that just define you as a person,

6
0:00:29.911,000 --> 0:00:3,000
three things about yourself

7
0:00:31.689,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that will help me understand who you are,

8
0:00:35.298,000 --> 0:00:38,000
three things that just get to your very essence.

9
0:00:39.292,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And what I'm wondering

10
0:00:42.37,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is, of those three things,

11
0:00:45.659,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is any one of them

12
0:00:47.649,000 --> 0:00:52,000
surviving some kind of trauma?

13
0:00:52.673,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Cancer survivor, rape survivor,

14
0:00:58.37,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Holocaust survivor, incest survivor.

15
0:01:03.487,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves

16
0:01:06.931,000 --> 0:01:08,000
by our wounds?

17
0:01:09.462,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And where I have seen this survivor identity

18
0:01:13.938,000 --> 0:01:15,000
have the most consequences

19
0:01:16.426,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is in the cancer community.

20
0:01:18.979,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I've been around this community for a long time,

21
0:01:21.713,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because I've been a hospice and a hospital chaplain

22
0:01:24.907,000 --> 0:01:27,000
for almost 30 years.

23
0:01:28.204,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center

24
0:01:33.937,000 --> 0:01:35,000
when I received the news that

25
0:01:36.242,000 --> 0:01:39,000
my mother had breast cancer.

26
0:01:39.677,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And then five days later,

27
0:01:41.859,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I received the news that I had breast cancer.

28
0:01:47.326,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My mother and I can be competitive —

29
0:01:49.959,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter) —

30
0:01:51.747,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but I was really not trying to compete with her on this one.

31
0:01:56.179,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And in fact, I thought, well,

32
0:01:58.204,000 --> 0:01:59,000
if you have to have cancer,

33
0:02:00.139,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it's pretty convenient to be working

34
0:02:01.86,000 --> 0:02:02,000
at a place that treats it.

35
0:02:03.371,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But this is what I heard from a lot of outraged people.

36
0:02:06.068,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What?

37
0:02:07.53,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You're the chaplain.

38
0:02:09.45,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You should be immune.

39
0:02:11.74,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Like, maybe I should have just gotten off

40
0:02:13.817,000 --> 0:02:15,000
with a warning instead of an actual ticket,

41
0:02:16.112,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because I'm on the force.

42
0:02:19.88,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So I did get my treatment at the cancer center where I worked,

43
0:02:22.855,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which was amazingly convenient,

44
0:02:25.376,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I had chemotherapy

45
0:02:27.615,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in,

46
0:02:30.325,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and so before I say another word, let me just say right now,

47
0:02:32.45,000 --> 0:02:36,000
this is the fake one. (Laughter)

48
0:02:37.224,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I have found that I need to get that out of the way,

49
0:02:40.437,000 --> 0:02:41,000
because I'll see somebody go

50
0:02:42.211,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Oh, I know it's this one."

51
0:02:44.428,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And then I'll move or I'll gesture and they'll go,

52
0:02:46.892,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"No, it's that one."

53
0:02:49.445,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So now you know.

54
0:02:51.616,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I learned a lot being a patient,

55
0:02:53.753,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and one of the surprising things was

56
0:02:55.275,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that only a small part of the cancer experience

57
0:02:59.382,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is about medicine.

58
0:03:01.474,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Most of it is about feelings and faith

59
0:03:05.827,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and losing and finding your identity

60
0:03:08.46,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and discovering strength

61
0:03:10.038,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and flexibility you never even knew you had.

62
0:03:13.96,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's about realizing that

63
0:03:16.289,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the most important things in life are

64
0:03:19.359,000 --> 0:03:22,000
not things at all, but relationships,

65
0:03:22.44,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty

66
0:03:26.506,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and learning that the way to get out of almost anything

67
0:03:29.945,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is to say, "I have cancer."

68
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So the other thing I learned was that

69
0:03:36.773,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I don't have to take on "cancer survivor"

70
0:03:40.227,000 --> 0:03:41,000
as my identity,

71
0:03:42.195,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but, boy, are there powerful forces

72
0:03:45.814,000 --> 0:03:48,000
pushing me to do just that.

73
0:03:49.36,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, don't, please, misunderstand me.

74
0:03:53.678,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Cancer organizations

75
0:03:55.637,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and the drive for early screening

76
0:03:57.617,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and cancer awareness and cancer research

77
0:04:00.271,000 --> 0:04:02,000
have normalized cancer,

78
0:04:02.386,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and this is a wonderful thing.

79
0:04:03.71,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We can now talk about cancer

80
0:04:05.794,000 --> 0:04:06,000
without whispering.

81
0:04:07.572,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We can talk about cancer and we can support one another.

82
0:04:12.09,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But sometimes, it feels

83
0:04:15.176,000 --> 0:04:16,000
like people go a little overboard

84
0:04:16.574,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and they start telling us how we're going to feel.

85
0:04:21.779,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So about a week after my surgery,

86
0:04:25.322,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we had a houseguest.

87
0:04:28.202,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That was probably our first mistake.

88
0:04:30.95,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And keep in mind that

89
0:04:32.471,000 --> 0:04:33,000
at this point in my life

90
0:04:34.141,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I had been a chaplain for over 20 years,

91
0:04:37.763,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and issues like dying and death

92
0:04:40.086,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and the meaning of life,

93
0:04:41.642,000 --> 0:04:44,000
these are all things I'd been yakking about forever.

94
0:04:44.82,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So at dinner that night,

95
0:04:47.32,000 --> 0:04:49,000
our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head,

96
0:04:50.056,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and say, "You know, Deb,

97
0:04:52.861,000 --> 0:04:56,000
now you're really going to learn what's important.

98
0:04:57.01,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Yes, you are going to make some big changes

99
0:04:59.707,000 --> 0:05:,000
in your life,

100
0:05:01.077,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and now you're going to start thinking about your death.

101
0:05:04.725,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Yep, this cancer is your wakeup call."

102
0:05:10.52,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, these are golden words

103
0:05:13.175,000 --> 0:05:14,000
coming from someone who is speaking about

104
0:05:15.154,000 --> 0:05:17,000
their own experience,

105
0:05:17.573,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but when someone is telling you

106
0:05:19.949,000 --> 0:05:21,000
how you are going to feel,

107
0:05:22.342,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it's instant crap.

108
0:05:24.388,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The only reason I did not kill him

109
0:05:27.292,000 --> 0:05:28,000
with my bare hands

110
0:05:29.283,000 --> 0:05:33,000
was because I could not lift my right arm.

111
0:05:33.378,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But I did say a really bad word to him,

112
0:05:37.596,000 --> 0:05:39,000
followed by a regular word, that —

113
0:05:40.497,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Laughter) —

114
0:05:41.72,000 --> 0:05:44,000
made my husband say, "She's on narcotics."

115
0:05:45.238,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:47.196,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And then after my treatment, it just felt like

117
0:05:49.69,000 --> 0:05:52,000
everyone was telling me what my experience was going to mean.

118
0:05:52.973,000 --> 0:05:54,000
"Oh, this means you're going to be doing the walk."

119
0:05:55.765,000 --> 0:05:56,000
"Oh, this means you're coming to the luncheon."

120
0:05:57.389,000 --> 0:05:58,000
"This means you're going to be wearing

121
0:05:58.651,000 --> 0:06:,000
the pink ribbon and the pink t-shirt

122
0:06:01.042,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and the headband and the earrings

123
0:06:02.904,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and the bracelet and the panties."

124
0:06:06.64,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Panties. No, seriously, google it.

125
0:06:09.869,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:11.92,000 --> 0:06:13,000
How is that raising awareness?

127
0:06:14.011,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Only my husband should be seeing my panties.

128
0:06:16.078,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:17.747,000 --> 0:06:21,000
He's pretty aware of cancer already.

130
0:06:22.158,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It was at that point where I felt like, oh my God,

131
0:06:25.302,000 --> 0:06:28,000
this is just taking over my life.

132
0:06:28.452,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And that's when I told myself, claim your experience.

133
0:06:33.424,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Don't let it claim you.

134
0:06:37.086,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We all know that

135
0:06:39.194,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the way to cope with trauma, with loss,

136
0:06:43.316,000 --> 0:06:45,000
with any life-changing experience,

137
0:06:45.741,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is to find meaning.

138
0:06:47.891,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But here's the thing:

139
0:06:50.128,000 --> 0:06:51,000
No one can tell us

140
0:06:51.795,000 --> 0:06:53,000
what our experience means.

141
0:06:54.531,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We have to decide what it means.

142
0:06:57.82,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And it doesn't have to be some gigantic,

143
0:06:59.952,000 --> 0:07:01,000
extroverted meaning.

144
0:07:01.959,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We don't all have to start a foundation

145
0:07:04.47,000 --> 0:07:06,000
or an organization or write a book

146
0:07:06.622,000 --> 0:07:08,000
or make a documentary.

147
0:07:09.502,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Meaning can be quiet

148
0:07:12.449,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and introverted.

149
0:07:14.62,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Maybe we make one small decision about our lives

150
0:07:20.548,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that can bring about big change.

151
0:07:25.626,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Many years ago, I had a patient,

152
0:07:27.566,000 --> 0:07:29,000
just a wonderful young man

153
0:07:29.571,000 --> 0:07:31,000
who was loved by the staff,

154
0:07:32.306,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and so it was something of a shock to us to realize

155
0:07:35.19,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that he had no friends.

156
0:07:38.974,000 --> 0:07:4,000
He lived by himself,

157
0:07:41.28,000 --> 0:07:45,000
he would come in for chemotherapy by himself,

158
0:07:45.308,000 --> 0:07:46,000
he would receive his treatment,

159
0:07:47.253,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and then he'd walk home alone.

160
0:07:50.984,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And I even asked him. I said, "Hey,

161
0:07:52.748,000 --> 0:07:54,000
how come you never bring a friend with you?"

162
0:07:55.489,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And he said, "I don't really have any friends."

163
0:08:00.208,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But he had tons of friends on the infusion floor.

164
0:08:02.469,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We all loved him, and people were going in and out of his room all the time.

165
0:08:06.845,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So at his last chemo,

166
0:08:09.804,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we sang him the song

167
0:08:11.131,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and we put the crown on his head and we blew the bubbles,

168
0:08:13.898,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and then I asked him, I said,

169
0:08:16.339,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"So what are you going to do now?"

170
0:08:20.795,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And he answered,

171
0:08:22.605,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"Make friends."

172
0:08:24.238,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And he did.

173
0:08:26.35,000 --> 0:08:29,000
He started volunteering and he made friends there,

174
0:08:29.904,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and he began going to a church and he made friends there,

175
0:08:32.59,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and at Christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment,

176
0:08:35.55,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and the place was filled with his friends.

177
0:08:40.667,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Claim your experience.

178
0:08:42.91,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Don't let it claim you.

179
0:08:44.559,000 --> 0:08:48,000
He decided that the meaning of his experience

180
0:08:49.431,000 --> 0:08:52,000
was to know the joy of friendship,

181
0:08:53.198,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and then learn to make friends.

182
0:08:57.806,000 --> 0:09:,000
So what about you?

183
0:09:01.792,000 --> 0:09:03,000
How are you going to find meaning

184
0:09:04.145,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in your crappy experience?

185
0:09:06.592,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It could be a recent one,

186
0:09:08.483,000 --> 0:09:09,000
or it could be one that you've been carrying around

187
0:09:10.454,000 --> 0:09:13,000
for a really long time.

188
0:09:14.345,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's never too late to change what it means,

189
0:09:18.855,000 --> 0:09:2,000
because meaning is dynamic.

190
0:09:21.11,000 --> 0:09:22,000
What it means today

191
0:09:22.771,000 --> 0:09:23,000
may not be what it means a year from now,

192
0:09:24.698,000 --> 0:09:26,000
or 10 years from now.

193
0:09:27.541,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's never too late to become someone other

194
0:09:30.151,000 --> 0:09:33,000
than simply a survivor.

195
0:09:33.672,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Hear how static that word sounds?

196
0:09:36.996,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Survivor.

197
0:09:38.913,000 --> 0:09:42,000
No movement, no growth.

198
0:09:43.304,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Claim your experience.

199
0:09:45.191,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Don't let it claim you, because if you do,

200
0:09:47.812,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I believe you will become trapped,

201
0:09:50.973,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you will not grow, you will not evolve.

202
0:09:56.915,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But of course, sometimes it's not outside pressures

203
0:10:00.393,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that cause us to take on that identity of survivor.

204
0:10:04.764,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Sometimes we just like the perks.

205
0:10:08.657,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Sometimes there's a payoff.

206
0:10:12.165,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But then we get stuck.

207
0:10:15.9,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now, one of the first things I learned

208
0:10:17.711,000 --> 0:10:21,000
as a chaplain intern was the three C's

209
0:10:21.817,000 --> 0:10:23,000
of the chaplain's job:

210
0:10:24.208,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Comfort, clarify and, when necessary, confront

211
0:10:31.17,000 --> 0:10:33,000
or challenge.

212
0:10:33.325,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now, we all pretty much love the comforting

213
0:10:35.271,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and the clarifying.

214
0:10:37.128,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The confronting, not so much.

215
0:10:42.07,000 --> 0:10:43,000
One of the other things that I loved

216
0:10:44.064,000 --> 0:10:46,000
about being a chaplain was

217
0:10:46.522,000 --> 0:10:5,000
seeing patients a year, or even several years

218
0:10:50.995,000 --> 0:10:51,000
after their treatment, because

219
0:10:52.836,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it was just really cool to see how they had changed

220
0:10:55.536,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and how their lives had evolved

221
0:10:57.752,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and what had happened to them.

222
0:10:59.642,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So I was thrilled one day

223
0:11:02.162,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic

224
0:11:04.61,000 --> 0:11:07,000
from a patient who I had seen the year before,

225
0:11:08.191,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and she was there with her two adult daughters,

226
0:11:10.665,000 --> 0:11:14,000
who I also knew, for her one year follow-up exam.

227
0:11:14.924,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So I got down to the lobby, and they were ecstatic

228
0:11:18.461,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because she had just gotten all of her test results back

229
0:11:20.712,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and she was NED: No Evidence of Disease.

230
0:11:26.9,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead.

231
0:11:31.657,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So they were ecstatic, we sat down to visit,

232
0:11:37.15,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and it was so weird, because

233
0:11:39.957,000 --> 0:11:42,000
within two minutes, she started retelling me the story

234
0:11:43.839,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of her diagnosis and her surgery and her chemo,

235
0:11:48.369,000 --> 0:11:51,000
even though, as her chaplain, I saw her every week,

236
0:11:51.837,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and so I knew this story.

237
0:11:54.728,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And she was using words like suffering,

238
0:11:57.77,000 --> 0:12:,000
agony, struggle.

239
0:12:01.765,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And she ended her story with,

240
0:12:04.379,000 --> 0:12:08,000
"I felt crucified."

241
0:12:09.173,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And at that point, her two daughters got up and said,

242
0:12:11.837,000 --> 0:12:14,000
"We're going to go get coffee."

243
0:12:15.749,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And they left.

244
0:12:18.89,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Tell me three things about yourself before the next stop.

245
0:12:21.725,000 --> 0:12:23,000
People were leaving the bus before she even got

246
0:12:24.481,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to number two or number three.

247
0:12:29.858,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So I handed her a tissue,

248
0:12:33.345,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and I gave her a hug,

249
0:12:36.642,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and then, because I really cared for this woman,

250
0:12:40.152,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I said,

251
0:12:42.238,000 --> 0:12:44,000
"Get down off your cross."

252
0:12:44.544,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And she said, "What?"

253
0:12:48.81,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And I repeated, "Get down off your cross."

254
0:12:54.224,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And to her credit, she could talk about her reasons

255
0:12:58.869,000 --> 0:13:03,000
for embracing and then clinging to this identity.

256
0:13:03.988,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It got her a lot of attention.

257
0:13:06.01,000 --> 0:13:09,000
People were taking care of her for a change.

258
0:13:09.115,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But now, it was having the opposite effect.

259
0:13:12.81,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It was pushing people away.

260
0:13:15.293,000 --> 0:13:18,000
People kept leaving to get coffee.

261
0:13:19.04,000 --> 0:13:22,000
She felt crucified by her experience,

262
0:13:22.941,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but she didn't want to let that crucified self die.

263
0:13:29.163,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Now, perhaps you are thinking

264
0:13:32.08,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I was a little harsh with her,

265
0:13:35.03,000 --> 0:13:37,000
so I must tell you that

266
0:13:37.138,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I was speaking out of my own experience.

267
0:13:40.83,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Many, many years before,

268
0:13:43.674,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I had been fired from a job that I loved,

269
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and I would not stop talking about my innocence

270
0:13:50.716,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt,

271
0:13:54.12,000 --> 0:13:55,000
until finally, just like this woman,

272
0:13:55.25,000 --> 0:13:57,000
people were walking away from me,

273
0:13:57.291,000 --> 0:14:,000
until I finally realized

274
0:14:00.527,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I wasn't just processing my feelings,

275
0:14:04.399,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I was feeding them.

276
0:14:07.107,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I didn't want to let that crucified self die.

277
0:14:11.17,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But we all know that with any resurrection story,

278
0:14:16.592,000 --> 0:14:18,000
you have to die first.

279
0:14:19.22,000 --> 0:14:2,000
The Christian story,

280
0:14:21.043,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb

281
0:14:24.315,000 --> 0:14:26,000
before he was resurrected.

282
0:14:26.81,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And I believe that for us,

283
0:14:28.648,000 --> 0:14:3,000
being in the tomb

284
0:14:30.78,000 --> 0:14:33,000
means doing our own deep inner work

285
0:14:34.766,000 --> 0:14:36,000
around our wounds

286
0:14:37.47,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and allowing ourselves to be healed.

287
0:14:41.943,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We have to let that crucified self die

288
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
so that a new self, a truer self,

289
0:14:48.604,000 --> 0:14:5,000
is born.

290
0:14:50.986,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We have to let that old story go

291
0:14:53.844,000 --> 0:14:57,000
so that a new story, a truer story,

292
0:14:57.991,000 --> 0:15:,000
can be told.

293
0:15:01.03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you.

294
0:15:06.573,000 --> 0:15:08,000
What if there were no survivors,

295
0:15:09.154,000 --> 0:15:11,000
meaning, what if people decided

296
0:15:11.95,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to just claim their trauma as an experience

297
0:15:14.82,000 --> 0:15:18,000
instead of taking it on as an identity?

298
0:15:18.99,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Maybe it would be the end of being

299
0:15:20.992,000 --> 0:15:22,000
trapped in our wounds

300
0:15:23.35,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and the beginning of amazing

301
0:15:26.904,000 --> 0:15:29,000
self-exploration and discovery and growth.

302
0:15:30.83,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves

303
0:15:35.625,000 --> 0:15:37,000
by who we have become

304
0:15:38.205,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and who we are becoming.

305
0:15:42.375,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So perhaps survivor was not

306
0:15:48.146,000 --> 0:15:53,000
one of the three things that you would tell me.

307
0:15:53.353,000 --> 0:15:54,000
No matter.

308
0:15:54.67,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I just want you all to know that

309
0:15:56.91,000 --> 0:16:,000
I am really glad that we are on this bus together,

310
0:16:01.223,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and this is my stop.

311
0:16:05.119,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Applause)

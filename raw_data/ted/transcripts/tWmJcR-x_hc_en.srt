1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
require a certain kind of intellectual activity,

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because you are always comparing the variation

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with the theme that you hold in your mind.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You might say that the theme is nature

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and everything that follows is a variation on the subject.

7
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was asked, I guess about six years ago,

8
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to do a series of paintings

9
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.

10
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And it was very difficult for me to imagine

11
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
how to paint pictures that were based on Piero

12
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature --

13
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca

14
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.

15
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And that was enormously liberating to me.

16
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation,

17
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations

18
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
based on a work by Piero,

19
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro,"

20
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who faces his consort, Battista.

21
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject,

22
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I did the following series of drawings.

23
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That's the real Piero della Francesca --

24
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
one of the greatest portraits in human history.

25
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And these, I'll just show these without comment.

26
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro,

27
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance,

28
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."

29
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
He apparently lost an eye in battle,

30
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
which is why he is always shown in profile.

31
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And this is Battista.

32
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit --

33
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.

34
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Whoops! Passed each other.

35
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero,

36
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" --

37
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.

38
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And now, four large panels:

39
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
this is upper left;

40
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
upper right;

41
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
lower left;

42
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
lower right.

43
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.

44
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with

45
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
there doesn't seem to be an argument there.

46
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
On another subject --

47
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter) --

48
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I was driving in the country one day with my wife,

49
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I saw this sign,

50
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."

51
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And she said, "What are you talking about?"

52
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive,

53
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage,

54
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and since most people are so suspicious of garages,

55
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and know that they're going to be ripped off,

56
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they use the word 'reliable.'

57
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But everybody says they're reliable.

58
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But, reliable Dutchman" --

59
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter) --

60
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"Fantastic!"

61
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman --

62
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore --

63
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but as soon as you hear Dutchman,

64
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike,

65
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.

66
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."

67
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this,

68
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."

69
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

70
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Or even "French."

71
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

72
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.

73
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

74
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.

75
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach,

76
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes --

77
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."

78
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And so he did.

79
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/

80
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Alike fantastic if too new or old/

81
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Be not the first by whom the new are tried/

82
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."

83
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I could make nothing of that.

84
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I really struggled with this one.

85
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea,

86
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big,

87
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow,

88
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.

89
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So I took another crack at it --

90
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you've got to keep it moving --

91
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper

92
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I pasted them down on an ugly board.

93
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I thought that something would come out of it,

94
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope"

95
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because it's by Alexander Pope,

96
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but I sort of made a mess out of it,

97
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.

98
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So, it was going nowhere.

99
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem,

100
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I write down things that I know about it.

101
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But you can see the beginning of an idea there,

102
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."

103
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That's what happens.

104
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
There's a relationship between the old and the new;

105
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the new emerges from the context of the old.

106
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And then I did some variations of it,

107
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.

108
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I had this other version which had something interesting about it

109
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.

110
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N,

111
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
even though they were very fragmentary

112
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and there wasn't a lot of information in it.

113
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Then I got the words "new" and "old"

114
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.

115
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

116
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I was really desperate at this point.

117
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of,

118
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose

119
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and I put them together.

120
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It says "dreams" at the top.

121
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.

122
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA

123
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."

124
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But, to my credit,

125
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
I was so embarrassed about doing that

126
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that I never submitted this sketch.

127
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.

128
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting,

129
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but it does have something

130
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.

131
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be,

132
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.

133
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts --

134
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"If you have to explain it, it ain't working."

135
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"

136
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

137
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.

138
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.

139
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.

140
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This one generates no imagery at all."

141
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?

142
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Which is something you never want to do professionally.

143
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.

144
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What's the heart of this poem?

145
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.

146
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?

147
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I guess one could reduce the idea further

148
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old,

149
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
like this."

150
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And then I show you a little drawing --

151
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?

152
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Well, I found a way to use it.

153
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So, there's that little alternative over there,

154
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself --

155
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
"but more didactic than visual.

156
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace,

157
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a kind of dance where each defines the other."

158
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And then more self-questioning -- "Am I being simple-minded?

159
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?

160
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
There's a significant difference.

161
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This could be embarrassing.

162
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.

163
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"

164
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

165
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.

166
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience,

167
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.

168
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And as you know, you have to have a front.

169
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I mean -- you've got to be confident;

170
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?

171
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So that's one thing,

172
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.

173
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That can be a big contribution.

174
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one;

175
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
you get the big one

176
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and if you don't like that, how about the little one?

177
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

178
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And that too is a relatively new idea.

179
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And here's just a series of experiments

180
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?

181
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Now, this is a little illusion.

182
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
That poster is not folded.

183
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It's not folded, that's a photograph

184
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and it's cut on the diagonal.

185
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.

186
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And here,

187
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
a very peculiar poster because,

188
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer,

189
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
it won't sit still in the space.

190
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front,

191
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and then it shifts.

192
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.

193
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
But, we don't have time.

194
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

195
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And then an experiment --

196
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
a little bit about the nature of perspective,

197
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective,

198
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape --

199
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is seen frontally.

200
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And another piece for the art directors' club

201
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.

202
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.

203
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it,

204
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive

205
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and I didn't want to be embarrassed,

206
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
so I worked very hard on this.

207
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea --

208
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system

209
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster,

210
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
all of which had a different idea of what art is.

211
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is"

212
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and trying to determine what art was.

213
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."

214
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And as soon as I said that,

215
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever,"

216
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.

217
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.

218
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster,

219
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in case you don't get it.

220
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Laughter)

221
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Now this says, "Note to the viewer:

222
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman --

223
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.

224
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation,

225
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
surrealism has become banal,

226
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
a shadow of its former self.

227
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
The phrase 'Art is whatever'

228
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making --

229
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.

230
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster

231
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,'

232
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
hidden in the word 'whatever.'

233
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined:

234
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing,

235
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and the shape of the thing.

236
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Whatever."

237
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Applause)

238
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
OK.

239
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Applause)

240
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And the one that I did not submit,

241
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
which I still like,

242
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I wanted to use the same phrase.

243
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari

244
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
on letterforms some years ago --

245
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.

246
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And that idea stuck in my head.

247
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.

248
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.

249
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
But what really happens is that you read it as:

250
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
"Art is whatever remains."

251
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Thank you.

252
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Applause)

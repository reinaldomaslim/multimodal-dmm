1
0:00:12.844,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.

2
0:00:15.461,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It was this wild place full of color and life,

3
0:00:19.812,000 --> 0:00:22,000
home to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures.

4
0:00:23.056,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain

5
0:00:25.498,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.

6
0:00:28.726,000 --> 0:00:3,000
As a marine biologist turned photographer,

7
0:00:30.765,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I've spent most of my career looking for places

8
0:00:33.609,000 --> 0:00:36,000
as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.

9
0:00:37.479,000 --> 0:00:38,000
As you can see,

10
0:00:38.654,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.

11
0:00:41.304,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But the first time I truly went underwater,

12
0:00:43.344,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was about 10 years old.

13
0:00:44.769,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I can still vividly remember furiously finning

14
0:00:47.44,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef.

15
0:00:50.939,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And when I finally managed to grab hold of it,

16
0:00:53.131,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish

17
0:00:56.24,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in all colors of the rainbow.

18
0:00:58.213,000 --> 0:01:,000
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.

19
0:01:00.84,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Thomas Peschak

20
0:01:02.229,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Conservation Photographer

21
0:01:04.991,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In my 40 years on this planet,

22
0:01:06.665,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I've had the great privilege to explore

23
0:01:08.547,000 --> 0:01:1,000
some of its most incredible seascapes

24
0:01:10.659,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for National Geographic Magazine

25
0:01:12.671,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the Save Our Seas Foundation.

26
0:01:14.322,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks

27
0:01:17.462,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.

28
0:01:20.679,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales

29
0:01:23.655,000 --> 0:01:24,000
feeding just feet away from me

30
0:01:25.29,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.

31
0:01:28.138,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles

32
0:01:31.099,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in the Mozambique Channel.

33
0:01:32.461,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.

34
0:01:36.209,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child

35
0:01:38.986,000 --> 0:01:4,000
are becoming harder and harder to find.

36
0:01:41.702,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They are becoming more compressed

37
0:01:43.821,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and more threatened.

38
0:01:45.691,000 --> 0:01:47,000
As we humans continue to maintain our role

39
0:01:48.269,000 --> 0:01:5,000
as the leading predator on earth,

40
0:01:50.634,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand.

41
0:01:55.077,000 --> 0:01:58,000
For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience

42
0:01:58.273,000 --> 0:02:,000
out of their indifference with disturbing images.

43
0:02:00.606,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And while this approach has merits,

44
0:02:02.53,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I have come full circle.

45
0:02:04.368,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I believe that the best way for me to effect change

46
0:02:07.011,000 --> 0:02:08,000
is to sell love.

47
0:02:08.632,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts

48
0:02:10.703,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and as a photographer,

49
0:02:12.212,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I have the rare opportunity

50
0:02:14.046,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to reveal animals and entire ecosystems

51
0:02:16.392,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface.

52
0:02:19.457,000 --> 0:02:21,000
You can't love something and become a champion for it

53
0:02:22.266,000 --> 0:02:24,000
if you don't know it exists.

54
0:02:24.425,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Uncovering this -- that is the power of conservation photography.

55
0:02:29.154,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Music)

56
0:02:32.561,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I've visited hundreds of marine locations,

57
0:02:35.385,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but there are a handful of seascapes

58
0:02:37.335,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that have touched me incredibly deeply.

59
0:02:40.928,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The first time I experienced that kind of high

60
0:02:43.67,000 --> 0:02:44,000
was about 10 years ago,

61
0:02:45.087,000 --> 0:02:47,000
off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.

62
0:02:47.946,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And every June and July,

63
0:02:49.316,000 --> 0:02:51,000
enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards

64
0:02:51.749,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run.

65
0:02:54.098,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And boy, do those fish have good reason to run.

66
0:02:56.731,000 --> 0:03:,000
In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators.

67
0:03:01.044,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Common dolphins hunt together

68
0:03:02.926,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal

69
0:03:05.871,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and they create bait balls.

70
0:03:07.299,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface

71
0:03:11.011,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and then they rush in to dine

72
0:03:12.603,000 --> 0:03:14,000
on this pulsating and movable feast.

73
0:03:15.438,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Close behind are sharks.

74
0:03:17.258,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, most people believe

75
0:03:18.437,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies,

76
0:03:20.838,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.

77
0:03:23.634,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively.

78
0:03:27.829,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed

79
0:03:31.435,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut,

80
0:03:35.197,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or a mouth full of water.

81
0:03:36.681,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run,

82
0:03:40.746,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I know they don't see me as prey.

83
0:03:42.836,000 --> 0:03:45,000
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest

84
0:03:46.063,000 --> 0:03:47,000
at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.

85
0:03:49.785,000 --> 0:03:51,000
From the shores of Africa we travel east,

86
0:03:52.738,000 --> 0:03:54,000
across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean

87
0:03:54.863,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.

88
0:03:58.779,000 --> 0:04:,000
And during the stormy southwest monsoon,

89
0:04:01.341,000 --> 0:04:03,000
manta rays from all across the archipelago

90
0:04:03.675,000 --> 0:04:06,000
travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.

91
0:04:06.952,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Armies of crustaceans,

92
0:04:08.159,000 --> 0:04:1,000
most no bigger than the size of your pupils,

93
0:04:10.397,000 --> 0:04:13,000
are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.

94
0:04:14.185,000 --> 0:04:16,000
When plankton concentrations become patchy,

95
0:04:16.992,000 --> 0:04:17,000
manta rays feed alone

96
0:04:18.202,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and they somersault themselves backwards again and again,

97
0:04:20.938,000 --> 0:04:22,000
very much like a puppy chasing its own tail.

98
0:04:23.757,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Music)

99
0:04:27.011,000 --> 0:04:29,000
However, when plankton densities increase,

100
0:04:29.528,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains,

101
0:04:33.751,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line

102
0:04:37.099,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after.

103
0:04:41.912,000 --> 0:04:42,000
As plankton levels peak in the bay,

104
0:04:43.832,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the mantas swim closer and closer together

105
0:04:46.061,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding.

106
0:04:48.852,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And as they swirl in tight formation,

107
0:04:51.146,000 --> 0:04:52,000
this multi-step column of mantas

108
0:04:52.841,000 --> 0:04:55,000
creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton

109
0:04:56.742,000 --> 0:04:58,000
right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.

110
0:04:59.574,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays

111
0:05:03.94,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is truly unforgettable.

112
0:05:06.881,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Music)

113
0:05:54.248,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When I first photographed Hanifaru,

114
0:05:55.953,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the site enjoyed no protection

115
0:05:57.539,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and was threatened by development.

116
0:05:59.186,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust,

117
0:06:01.313,000 --> 0:06:02,000
my images eventually helped Hanifaru

118
0:06:03.218,000 --> 0:06:05,000
become a marine-protected area.

119
0:06:05.669,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands,

120
0:06:07.769,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they once hunted these manta rays

121
0:06:09.463,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to make traditional drums from their skins.

122
0:06:12.111,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions

123
0:06:15.81,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy

124
0:06:18.111,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in excess of 8 million dollars every single year.

125
0:06:23.182,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I have always wanted to travel back in time

126
0:06:25.555,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to an era where maps were mostly blank

127
0:06:28.169,000 --> 0:06:29,000
or they read, "There be dragons."

128
0:06:30.122,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls

129
0:06:33.73,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in the western Indian Ocean.

130
0:06:35.446,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets,

131
0:06:38.691,000 --> 0:06:41,000
diving into these waters is a poignant reminder

132
0:06:42.049,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of what our oceans once looked like.

133
0:06:44.501,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Very few people have heard of Bassas da India,

134
0:06:47.154,000 --> 0:06:5,000
a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel.

135
0:06:51.202,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier

136
0:06:54.369,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground

137
0:06:57.069,000 --> 0:06:58,000
for Galapagos sharks.

138
0:06:58.608,000 --> 0:07:02,000
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.

139
0:07:03.239,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder

140
0:07:05.882,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and more abundant at night.

141
0:07:08.072,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Music)

142
0:07:16.179,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Never before have I encountered

143
0:07:18.076,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.

144
0:07:21.373,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Capturing and sharing moments like this --

145
0:07:25.48,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that reminds me why I chose my path.

146
0:07:29.488,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Earlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine

147
0:07:33.27,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in Baja California.

148
0:07:34.912,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side

149
0:07:37.673,000 --> 0:07:38,000
lies San Ignacio Lagoon,

150
0:07:39.136,000 --> 0:07:41,000
a critical calving ground for gray whales.

151
0:07:41.674,000 --> 0:07:45,000
For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter,

152
0:07:45.964,000 --> 0:07:47,000
where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed,

153
0:07:48.4,000 --> 0:07:5,000
leaving only a few hundred survivors.

154
0:07:50.698,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Today the descendents of these same whales

155
0:07:53.392,000 --> 0:07:54,000
nudge their youngsters to the surface

156
0:07:55.279,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to play and even interact with us.

157
0:07:59.247,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Music)

158
0:08:08.577,000 --> 0:08:12,000
This species truly has made a remarkable comeback.

159
0:08:14.568,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,

160
0:08:17.563,000 --> 0:08:18,000
a sleepy fishing village.

161
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse.

162
0:08:22.718,000 --> 0:08:24,000
In 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities

163
0:08:25.202,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.

164
0:08:27.478,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous.

165
0:08:31.055,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In 2005, after only a single decade of protection,

166
0:08:35.349,000 --> 0:08:39,000
scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.

167
0:08:39.866,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But don't take my word for it -- come with me.

168
0:08:42.301,000 --> 0:08:44,000
On a single breath, swim with me in deep,

169
0:08:45.063,000 --> 0:08:48,000
into one of the largest and densest schools of fish

170
0:08:48.119,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I have ever encountered.

171
0:08:51.485,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Music)

172
0:09:03.135,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We all have the ability to be creators of hope.

173
0:09:05.993,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And through my photography,

174
0:09:07.945,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans.

175
0:09:11.432,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience

176
0:09:14.891,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in the face of 7.3 billion people.

177
0:09:18.901,000 --> 0:09:19,000
My hope is that in the future,

178
0:09:20.742,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I will have to search much, much harder

179
0:09:22.716,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to make photographs like this,

180
0:09:24.925,000 --> 0:09:26,000
while creating images that showcase

181
0:09:27.034,000 --> 0:09:3,000
our respectful coexistence with the ocean.

182
0:09:30.077,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.

183
0:09:34.836,000 --> 0:09:36,000
To thrive and survive in my profession,

184
0:09:37.135,000 --> 0:09:39,000
you really have to be a hopeless optimist.

185
0:09:40.152,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I always operate on the assumption

186
0:09:42.197,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that the next great picture that will effect change

187
0:09:45.326,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is right around the corner,

188
0:09:47.153,000 --> 0:09:49,000
behind the next coral head,

189
0:09:49.51,000 --> 0:09:5,000
inside the next lagoon

190
0:09:51.136,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or possibly, in the one after it.

191
0:09:54.673,000 --> 0:09:56,000

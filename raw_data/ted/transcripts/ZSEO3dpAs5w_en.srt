1
0:00:13.28,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What does it mean to be a witness?

2
0:00:17.56,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Why is it important to bear witness

3
0:00:20.4,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to people's suffering,

4
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:25,000
especially when those people are isolated from us?

5
0:00:27.44,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And what happens when we turn away?

6
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Three years ago, I traveled to the Central African Republic

7
0:00:35.68,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to report on its ongoing war.

8
0:00:38.92,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'd heard warnings of massacres

9
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in the country's jungles and deserts,

10
0:00:45.44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but no one could locate these massacres

11
0:00:48.24,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or tell me who was killed, or when.

12
0:00:53.52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I drove into this war

13
0:00:56.2,000 --> 0:00:57,000
with little information.

14
0:00:58.64,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I witnessed scenes that were tragic and unreal,

15
0:01:03.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and only at the end did I realize

16
0:01:06.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that I had witnessed the slow preparation of ethnic cleansing.

17
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The Central African Republic is a country of about five million people

18
0:01:18.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the size of Texas

19
0:01:19.6,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the center of Africa.

20
0:01:22.24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The country has known chronic violence since French colonial rule ended in 1960.

21
0:01:28.44,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The war I reported on

22
0:01:30.4,000 --> 0:01:32,000
was between the minority Muslim government,

23
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:34,000
called the Seleka,

24
0:01:35.92,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and citizen militias,

25
0:01:38.08,000 --> 0:01:39,000
mostly Christian,

26
0:01:39.88,000 --> 0:01:4,000
called the anti-balaka.

27
0:01:44.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The first sign of the impending cleansing

28
0:01:47.4,000 --> 0:01:49,000
was the breakdown of trust within communities.

29
0:01:52.04,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Three days after I arrived in the country,

30
0:01:54.96,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I watched the small city of Gaga be abandoned.

31
0:01:59.56,000 --> 0:02:,000
A battle was about to break out.

32
0:02:02.28,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And to save themselves,

33
0:02:03.96,000 --> 0:02:06,000
many people were working as government spies,

34
0:02:07.88,000 --> 0:02:1,000
identifying friends and neighbors

35
0:02:11.32,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to be killed.

36
0:02:14.96,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Cities and towns,

37
0:02:17.24,000 --> 0:02:19,000
any place with humans, had become unsafe.

38
0:02:22.12,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So people moved to the jungle.

39
0:02:25.96,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I felt strangely isolated

40
0:02:29.24,000 --> 0:02:33,000
as pigs and livestock moved into the empty homes.

41
0:02:36.08,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In a war zone,

42
0:02:37.6,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you know that you are near the killing when people have left.

43
0:02:42.8,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The war moved across the jungle and reached Gaga,

44
0:02:45.56,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and I was surrounded by the thunder of bombs.

45
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Government forces drove into the jungle to attack a town sheltering a militia.

46
0:02:56.56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I rode on motorcycle for hours,

47
0:02:59.08,000 --> 0:03:01,000
crossing jungle streams and tall elephant grass,

48
0:03:03.28,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but I only got to the town

49
0:03:05.32,000 --> 0:03:06,000
after the government had burned it

50
0:03:07.2,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and its people were gone.

51
0:03:10.4,000 --> 0:03:11,000
To see if I could speak to someone,

52
0:03:12.12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I shouted out that I was a friend, that I would not hurt them.

53
0:03:16.68,000 --> 0:03:18,000
A woman in a red shirt ran out of the forest.

54
0:03:21.4,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Others cautiously emerged from the trees

55
0:03:24.56,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and asked, "Est-ce les gens savent?"

56
0:03:28.2,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"Do people know?"

57
0:03:30.96,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The question surprised me.

58
0:03:32.8,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Their children were hungry and sick,

59
0:03:35.28,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but they didn't ask for food or medicine.

60
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:39,000
They asked me,

61
0:03:40.12,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"Do people know what is happening to us?"

62
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I felt helpless as I wrote down their question.

63
0:03:49.68,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And I became determined

64
0:03:52.96,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that this moment in their lives

65
0:03:56.28,000 --> 0:03:57,000
should not be forgotten.

66
0:03:59.48,000 --> 0:04:01,000
In bearing witness to their crisis,

67
0:04:01.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I felt a small communion with these people.

68
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:11,000
From far away, this war had felt like a footnote in world news.

69
0:04:13.12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
As a witness,

70
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the war felt like history unfolding.

71
0:04:18.84,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The government denied that it was committing any violence,

72
0:04:22.4,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but I continually drove through towns

73
0:04:25.44,000 --> 0:04:27,000
where people described government massacres

74
0:04:28.44,000 --> 0:04:3,000
from a day or a week before.

75
0:04:33.24,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I felt overwhelmed

76
0:04:35.48,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and tried to calm myself.

77
0:04:38.28,000 --> 0:04:4,000
As I reported on these massacres,

78
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I bought and ate

79
0:04:43.52,000 --> 0:04:45,000
little sweets,

80
0:04:45.56,000 --> 0:04:49,000
seeking the familiar comfort of their taste.

81
0:04:51.88,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Central Africans ate these sweets

82
0:04:54.04,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to ease their hunger,

83
0:04:56.56,000 --> 0:05:,000
leaving a trail of thousands of plastic wrappers as they fled.

84
0:05:02.68,000 --> 0:05:05,000
On the few radio stations still operating in the country,

85
0:05:06.68,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I mostly heard pop music.

86
0:05:10.68,000 --> 0:05:12,000
As the war mounted,

87
0:05:12.72,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we received less information about the massacres.

88
0:05:16.36,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It became easier to feel a sense of normalcy.

89
0:05:24.08,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I witnessed the effect of this missing information.

90
0:05:28.56,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Two weeks later, I slowly and anxiously

91
0:05:32.48,000 --> 0:05:35,000
drove into an isolated militia headquarters,

92
0:05:35.68,000 --> 0:05:36,000
a town called PK100.

93
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Here, Christian fighters told me

94
0:05:41.64,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that all Muslims were foreigners,

95
0:05:44.2,000 --> 0:05:46,000
evil and allied with the government.

96
0:05:47.92,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They likened Muslims to animals.

97
0:05:52.48,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Without neutral observers or media

98
0:05:55.6,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to counter this absurd narrative,

99
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
it became the single narrative in these camps.

100
0:06:02.6,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The militias began to hunt down Muslims,

101
0:06:05.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and emptied the capital, Bangui,

102
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of nearly 140,000 Muslims

103
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in just a few months.

104
0:06:14.76,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Most of the killing and fleeing of Muslims went unrecorded by witnesses.

105
0:06:22.64,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I'm telling you about my reporting in the Central African Republic,

106
0:06:27.04,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but I still ask myself why I went there.

107
0:06:31.08,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Why put myself at risk?

108
0:06:34.6,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I do this work

109
0:06:35.92,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because I feel that ignored people in all our communities

110
0:06:41.36,000 --> 0:06:43,000
tell us something important

111
0:06:43.4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
about who we are.

112
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
When information is missing,

113
0:06:50.28,000 --> 0:06:53,000
people have the power to manipulate reality.

114
0:06:55.32,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Without witnesses,

115
0:06:57.56,000 --> 0:07:,000
we would believe that those thousands of massacred people are still alive,

116
0:07:02.28,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that those hundreds of burned homes are still standing.

117
0:07:06.36,000 --> 0:07:07,000
A war zone can pass

118
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
for a mostly peaceful place

119
0:07:10.32,000 --> 0:07:11,000
when no one is watching.

120
0:07:14.08,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And a witness can become precious,

121
0:07:17.68,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and their gaze most necessary,

122
0:07:20.48,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when violence passes silently,

123
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
unseen and unheard.

124
0:07:27.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Thank you.

125
0:07:29.2,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Applause)

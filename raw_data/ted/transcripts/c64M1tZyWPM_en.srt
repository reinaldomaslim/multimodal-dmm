1
0:00:12.408,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So imagine that a plane is about to crash

2
0:00:18.17,000 --> 0:00:2,000
with 250 children and babies,

3
0:00:20.971,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and if you knew how to stop that, would you?

4
0:00:24.39,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now imagine

5
0:00:26.361,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that 60 planes full of babies under five

6
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
crash every single day.

7
0:00:33.21,000 --> 0:00:34,000
That's the number of kids

8
0:00:34.982,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that never make it to their fifth birthday.

9
0:00:37.307,000 --> 0:00:4,000
6.6 million children

10
0:00:40.547,000 --> 0:00:43,000
never make it to their fifth birthday.

11
0:00:44.138,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Most of these deaths are preventable,

12
0:00:46.594,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and that doesn't just make me sad,

13
0:00:48.562,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it makes me angry,

14
0:00:50.258,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and it makes me determined.

15
0:00:52.616,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Diarrhea and pneumonia

16
0:00:54.506,000 --> 0:00:55,000
are among the top two killers

17
0:00:56.322,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of children under five,

18
0:00:58.64,000 --> 0:01:,000
and what we can do to prevent these diseases

19
0:01:00.896,000 --> 0:01:02,000
isn't some smart,

20
0:01:03.076,000 --> 0:01:05,000
new technological innovations.

21
0:01:05.993,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's one of the world's oldest inventions:

22
0:01:10.872,000 --> 0:01:13,000
a bar of soap.

23
0:01:14.397,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Washing hands with soap,

24
0:01:15.829,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a habit we all take for granted,

25
0:01:18.2,000 --> 0:01:2,000
can reduce diarrhea by half,

26
0:01:20.484,000 --> 0:01:23,000
can reduce respiratory infections by one third.

27
0:01:24.14,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Handwashing with soap

28
0:01:25.911,000 --> 0:01:26,000
can have an impact

29
0:01:27.56,000 --> 0:01:32,000
on reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,

30
0:01:32.587,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and most recently in the case of cholera

31
0:01:34.977,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and Ebola outbreak,

32
0:01:37.667,000 --> 0:01:38,000
one of the key interventions

33
0:01:39.358,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is handwashing with soap.

34
0:01:42.176,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school.

35
0:01:45.431,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It stops babies from dying.

36
0:01:48.254,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Handwashing with soap

37
0:01:50.127,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is one of the most cost-effective

38
0:01:52.924,000 --> 0:01:54,000
ways of saving children's lives.

39
0:01:55.47,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It can save over 600,000 children every year.

40
0:01:59.126,000 --> 0:02:01,000
That's the equivalent of stopping

41
0:02:02.09,000 --> 0:02:03,000
10 jumbo jets

42
0:02:04.07,000 --> 0:02:05,000
full of babies and children

43
0:02:05.998,000 --> 0:02:07,000
from crashing every single day.

44
0:02:08.709,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty

45
0:02:11.133,000 --> 0:02:14,000
useful public health intervention.

46
0:02:14.415,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So now just take a minute.

47
0:02:17.365,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I think you need to get to know the person next to you.

48
0:02:19.301,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Why don't you just shake their hands.

49
0:02:21.249,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Please shake their hands.

50
0:02:23.493,000 --> 0:02:24,000
All right, get to know each other.

51
0:02:24.793,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They look really pretty.

52
0:02:26.328,000 --> 0:02:27,000
All right.

53
0:02:28.101,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So what if I told you

54
0:02:30.399,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that the person whose hands you just shook

55
0:02:32.984,000 --> 0:02:33,000
actually didn't wash their hands

56
0:02:34.692,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when they were coming out of the toilet? (Laughter)

57
0:02:37.35,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They don't look so pretty anymore, right?

58
0:02:40.68,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.

59
0:02:43.836,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Well, statistics are actually showing

60
0:02:45.501,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that four people out of five

61
0:02:47.917,000 --> 0:02:49,000
don't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet,

62
0:02:50.525,000 --> 0:02:51,000
globally.

63
0:02:52.213,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And the same way,

64
0:02:54.483,000 --> 0:02:56,000
we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,

65
0:02:57.227,000 --> 0:02:59,000
running water, and soap available,

66
0:02:59.677,000 --> 0:03:,000
it's the same thing in the countries

67
0:03:01.611,000 --> 0:03:04,000
where child mortality is really high.

68
0:03:04.985,000 --> 0:03:06,000
What is it? Is there no soap?

69
0:03:07.299,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Actually, soap is available.

70
0:03:09.548,000 --> 0:03:12,000
In 90 percent of households in India,

71
0:03:13.203,000 --> 0:03:15,000
94 percent of households in Kenya,

72
0:03:15.883,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you will find soap.

73
0:03:17.363,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Even in countries where soap is the lowest,

74
0:03:21.2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.

75
0:03:24.779,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So why is it?

76
0:03:26.006,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Why aren't people washing their hands?

77
0:03:28.939,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Why is it that Mayank,

78
0:03:31.323,000 --> 0:03:33,000
this young boy that I met in India,

79
0:03:33.59,000 --> 0:03:34,000
isn't washing his hands?

80
0:03:35.335,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Well, in Mayank's family,

81
0:03:37.947,000 --> 0:03:39,000
soap is used for bathing,

82
0:03:40.379,000 --> 0:03:41,000
soap is used for laundry,

83
0:03:42.371,000 --> 0:03:44,000
soap is used for washing dishes.

84
0:03:45.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
His parents think sometimes

85
0:03:47.107,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it's a precious commodity,

86
0:03:48.671,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so they'll keep it in a cupboard.

87
0:03:50.938,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.

88
0:03:53.692,000 --> 0:03:55,000
On average, in Mayank's family,

89
0:03:56.242,000 --> 0:03:58,000
they will use soap for washing hands

90
0:03:58.314,000 --> 0:03:59,000
once a day

91
0:03:59.765,000 --> 0:04:01,000
at the very best, and sometimes

92
0:04:02.13,000 --> 0:04:04,000
even once a week for washing hands with soap.

93
0:04:05.115,000 --> 0:04:07,000
What's the result of that?

94
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Children pick up disease

95
0:04:09.195,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in the place that's supposed to love them

96
0:04:10.87,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and protect them the most, in their homes.

97
0:04:15.778,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Think about where you learned to wash your hands.

98
0:04:18.326,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Did you learn to wash your hands at home?

99
0:04:21.13,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Did you learn to wash your hands in school?

100
0:04:23.906,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I think behavioral scientists will tell you

101
0:04:26.386,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that it's very difficult to change the habits

102
0:04:28.925,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that you have had early in life.

103
0:04:33.81,000 --> 0:04:35,000
However, we all copy what everyone else does,

104
0:04:36.607,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and local cultural norms are something

105
0:04:39.331,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that shape how we change our behavior,

106
0:04:42.642,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and this is where the private sector comes in.

107
0:04:45.418,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Every second in Asia and Africa,

108
0:04:49.218,000 --> 0:04:51,000
111 mothers

109
0:04:52.14,000 --> 0:04:55,000
will buy this bar to protect their family.

110
0:04:55.858,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Many women in India will tell you

111
0:04:57.898,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they learned all about hygiene, diseases,

112
0:05:00.124,000 --> 0:05:03,000
from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.

113
0:05:03.87,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Iconic brands like this one

114
0:05:05.745,000 --> 0:05:06,000
have a responsibility to do good

115
0:05:07.633,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in the places where they sell their products.

116
0:05:10.114,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,

117
0:05:13.289,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that allows us to keep talking about

118
0:05:15.729,000 --> 0:05:18,000
handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers.

119
0:05:19.545,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Big businesses and brands can change

120
0:05:22.817,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and shift those social norms

121
0:05:24.969,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and make a difference for those habits

122
0:05:26.881,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that are so stubborn.

123
0:05:29.061,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Think about it:

124
0:05:30.319,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Marketeers spend all their time

125
0:05:33.824,000 --> 0:05:37,000
making us switch from one brand to the other.

126
0:05:38.18,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And actually, they know how to transform

127
0:05:41.17,000 --> 0:05:44,000
science and facts into compelling messages.

128
0:05:44.203,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Just for a minute, imagine

129
0:05:46.099,000 --> 0:05:48,000
when they put all their forces behind

130
0:05:48.84,000 --> 0:05:5,000
a message as powerful as handwashing with soap.

131
0:05:51.79,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The profit motive is transforming health outcomes

132
0:05:54.749,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in this world.

133
0:05:56.627,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But it's been happening for centuries:

134
0:05:58.446,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894

135
0:06:01.979,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in Victorian England

136
0:06:03.715,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to actually combat cholera.

137
0:06:05.987,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Last week, I was in Ghana

138
0:06:08.291,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with the minister of health,

139
0:06:09.83,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because if you don't know,

140
0:06:11.049,000 --> 0:06:13,000
there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.

141
0:06:13.706,000 --> 0:06:15,000
A hundred and eighteen years later,

142
0:06:15.842,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the solution is exactly the same:

143
0:06:17.762,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It's about ensuring that they have access

144
0:06:20.258,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to this bar of soap,

145
0:06:21.674,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and that they're using it,

146
0:06:23.419,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because that's the number one way

147
0:06:25.379,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to actually stop cholera from spreading.

148
0:06:28.61,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I think this drive for profit

149
0:06:31.01,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is extremely powerful,

150
0:06:32.881,000 --> 0:06:33,000
sometimes more powerful than

151
0:06:34.341,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the most committed charity or government.

152
0:06:37.636,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Government is doing what they can,

153
0:06:39.438,000 --> 0:06:42,000
especially in terms of the pandemics

154
0:06:42.813,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and epidemics such as cholera,

155
0:06:45.35,000 --> 0:06:46,000
or Ebola at the moment,

156
0:06:46.805,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but with competing priorities.

157
0:06:49.345,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The budget is not always there.

158
0:06:51.85,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And when you think about this,

159
0:06:53.713,000 --> 0:06:55,000
you think about what is required

160
0:06:55.82,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to make handwashing a daily habit,

161
0:06:58.141,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it requires sustained funding

162
0:07:01.962,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to refine this behavior.

163
0:07:05.07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
In short, those that fight for public health

164
0:07:09.503,000 --> 0:07:11,000
are actually dependent upon the soap companies

165
0:07:12.267,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to keep promoting handwashing with soap.

166
0:07:15.263,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We have friends like USAID,

167
0:07:18.505,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap,

168
0:07:21.81,000 --> 0:07:23,000
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,

169
0:07:23.97,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Plan, WaterAid,

170
0:07:25.539,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that all believe

171
0:07:27.046,000 --> 0:07:3,000
for a win-win-win partnership.

172
0:07:30.761,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Win for the public sector,

173
0:07:32.746,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because we help them reach their targets.

174
0:07:35.821,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Win for the private sector,

175
0:07:38.209,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because we build new generations

176
0:07:39.623,000 --> 0:07:4,000
of future handwashers.

177
0:07:41.42,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And most importantly,

178
0:07:43.633,000 --> 0:07:45,000
win for the most vulnerable.

179
0:07:46.24,000 --> 0:07:48,000
On October 15,

180
0:07:48.296,000 --> 0:07:5,000
we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.

181
0:07:50.648,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Schools, communities,

182
0:07:52.368,000 --> 0:07:53,000
our friends in the public sector

183
0:07:54.248,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and our friends in the private sector —

184
0:07:56.864,000 --> 0:07:58,000
yes, on that day even our competitors,

185
0:07:59.144,000 --> 0:08:,000
we all join hands to celebrate

186
0:08:01.13,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the world's most important

187
0:08:03.112,000 --> 0:08:05,000
public health intervention.

188
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
What's required,

189
0:08:06.385,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and again where the private sector can make a huge difference,

190
0:08:09.121,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is coming up with this big, creative thinking

191
0:08:12.887,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that drives advocacy.

192
0:08:15.128,000 --> 0:08:17,000
If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,

193
0:08:17.791,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we've created great films

194
0:08:20.77,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that bring the message of handwashing with soap

195
0:08:22.856,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to the everyday person

196
0:08:24.551,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in a way that can relate to them.

197
0:08:27.127,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We've had over 30 million views.

198
0:08:28.887,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Most of these discussions are still happening online.

199
0:08:31.414,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I urge you to take five minutes

200
0:08:32.886,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and look at those films.

201
0:08:36.943,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I come from Mali,

202
0:08:38.472,000 --> 0:08:4,000
one of the world's poorest countries.

203
0:08:40.815,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation

204
0:08:43.551,000 --> 0:08:45,000
was around social justice.

205
0:08:45.729,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I trained in Europe's premier school of public health.

206
0:08:49.257,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I think I'm probably one of the only women

207
0:08:50.985,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in my country with this high degree in health,

208
0:08:54.426,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and the only one

209
0:08:55.91,000 --> 0:08:58,000
with a doctorate in handwashing with soap.

210
0:08:59.512,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:01.248,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Applause)

212
0:09:07.872,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Nine years ago, I decided,

213
0:09:10.223,000 --> 0:09:12,000
with a successful public health career in the making,

214
0:09:13.136,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that I could make the biggest impact coming,

215
0:09:16.664,000 --> 0:09:19,000
selling and promoting the world's best invention

216
0:09:19.695,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in public health: soap.

217
0:09:22.23,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We run today the world's largest

218
0:09:24.359,000 --> 0:09:25,000
handwashing program

219
0:09:25.73,000 --> 0:09:27,000
by any public health standards.

220
0:09:28.308,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We've reached over 183 million people

221
0:09:31.78,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in 16 countries.

222
0:09:34.97,000 --> 0:09:35,000
My team and I have the ambition

223
0:09:36.806,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to reach one billion by 2020.

224
0:09:40.564,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Over the last four years,

225
0:09:42.758,000 --> 0:09:44,000
business has grown double digits,

226
0:09:45.486,000 --> 0:09:46,000
whilst child mortality has reduced

227
0:09:47.423,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in all the places where soap use has increased.

228
0:09:51.845,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It may be uncomfortable for some to hear —

229
0:09:54.15,000 --> 0:09:56,000
business growth and lives saved

230
0:09:56.405,000 --> 0:09:59,000
somehow equated in the same sentence —

231
0:09:59.918,000 --> 0:10:,000
but it is that business growth

232
0:10:01.837,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that allows us to keep doing more.

233
0:10:04.133,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Without it, and without talking about it,

234
0:10:06.877,000 --> 0:10:1,000
we cannot achieve the change that we need.

235
0:10:10.925,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Last week, my team and I

236
0:10:13.11,000 --> 0:10:16,000
spent time visiting mothers

237
0:10:16.406,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that have all experienced the same thing:

238
0:10:18.917,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the death of a newborn.

239
0:10:21.349,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful

240
0:10:24.349,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and more painful.

241
0:10:27.262,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This one is from Myanmar.

242
0:10:29.894,000 --> 0:10:31,000
She had the most beautiful smile,

243
0:10:31.9,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the smile, I think, that life gives you

244
0:10:34.11,000 --> 0:10:36,000
when you've had a second chance.

245
0:10:36.497,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Her son, Myo, is her second one.

246
0:10:39.831,000 --> 0:10:4,000
She had a daughter

247
0:10:41.735,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who passed away at three weeks,

248
0:10:44.127,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and we know that the majority

249
0:10:46.48,000 --> 0:10:47,000
of children that actually die

250
0:10:47.82,000 --> 0:10:48,000
die in the first month of their life,

251
0:10:49.686,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and we know that if we give a bar of soap

252
0:10:52.554,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to every skilled birth attendant,

253
0:10:54.814,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and that if soap is used before touching the babies,

254
0:10:57.364,000 --> 0:10:58,000
we can reduce and make a change

255
0:10:58.606,000 --> 0:11:,000
in terms of those numbers.

256
0:11:00.65,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And that's what inspires me,

257
0:11:02.518,000 --> 0:11:04,000
inspires me to continue in this mission,

258
0:11:04.75,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to know that I can equip her

259
0:11:07.134,000 --> 0:11:08,000
with what's needed

260
0:11:08.939,000 --> 0:11:09,000
so that she can do

261
0:11:10.79,000 --> 0:11:12,000
the most beautiful job in the world:

262
0:11:12.854,000 --> 0:11:14,000
nurturing her newborn.

263
0:11:14.98,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And next time you think of a gift

264
0:11:17.285,000 --> 0:11:19,000
for a new mom and her family,

265
0:11:19.375,000 --> 0:11:21,000
don't look far: buy her soap.

266
0:11:22.165,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's the most beautiful invention in public health.

267
0:11:25.373,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I hope you will join us

268
0:11:27.749,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and make handwashing part of your daily lives

269
0:11:30.701,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and our daily lives

270
0:11:32.405,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and help more children like Myo

271
0:11:34.629,000 --> 0:11:35,000
reach their fifth birthday.

272
0:11:35.757,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Thank you.

273
0:11:38.164,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Applause)

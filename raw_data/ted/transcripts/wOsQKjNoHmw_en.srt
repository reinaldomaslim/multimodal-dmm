1
0:00:12.809,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Currently, most refugees live in the cities

2
0:00:17.929,000 --> 0:00:19,000
rather than in the refugee camps.

3
0:00:22.133,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We represent over 60 percent

4
0:00:25.982,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of the number of refugees globally.

5
0:00:31.442,000 --> 0:00:34,000
With the majority of refugees living in urban areas,

6
0:00:36.617,000 --> 0:00:4,000
there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and new thinking.

7
0:00:43.363,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Rather than wasting money on building walls,

8
0:00:49.668,000 --> 0:00:53,000
it would be better to spend on programs

9
0:00:53.712,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to help refugees to help themselves.

10
0:00:55.994,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Applause)

11
0:01:02.736,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We always have to leave behind all our possessions.

12
0:01:08.94,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But not our skills and knowledge.

13
0:01:13.352,000 --> 0:01:16,000
If allowed to live a productive life,

14
0:01:17.641,000 --> 0:01:19,000
refugees can help themselves

15
0:01:20.609,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and contribute to the development of their host country.

16
0:01:26.748,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was born in the city called Bukavu,

17
0:01:29.882,000 --> 0:01:3,000
South Kivu,

18
0:01:31.707,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

19
0:01:35.359,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I am the fifth-born in a family of 12 children.

20
0:01:40.723,000 --> 0:01:44,000
My father, a mechanic by profession,

21
0:01:44.915,000 --> 0:01:46,000
worked very hard to send me to school.

22
0:01:49.32,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Just like other young people,

23
0:01:52.995,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I had a lot of plans and dreams.

24
0:01:56.756,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I wanted to complete my studies,

25
0:01:59.616,000 --> 0:02:,000
get a nice job,

26
0:02:01.554,000 --> 0:02:03,000
marry and have my own children

27
0:02:04.355,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and support my family.

28
0:02:07.124,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But this didn't happen.

29
0:02:11.871,000 --> 0:02:17,000
War in my homeland forced me to flee to Uganda in 2008,

30
0:02:18.546,000 --> 0:02:19,000
nine years ago.

31
0:02:22.085,000 --> 0:02:27,000
My family joined a steady exodus of refugees

32
0:02:27.3,000 --> 0:02:29,000
who settled in Uganda's capital, Kampala.

33
0:02:32.147,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In my country,

34
0:02:35.038,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I lived already in the city,

35
0:02:37.839,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we felt Kampala was much better than a refugee camp.

36
0:02:46.046,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Refugees in the cities

37
0:02:48.72,000 --> 0:02:51,000
have always been denied international assistance,

38
0:02:54.322,000 --> 0:02:59,000
even after their recognition by UNHCR in 1997.

39
0:03:01.157,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In addition to the poverty problem we were confronted with

40
0:03:07.466,000 --> 0:03:09,000
as the local urban poor,

41
0:03:10.546,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we were facing challenges due to our refugee status,

42
0:03:14.299,000 --> 0:03:16,000
such as a language barrier.

43
0:03:17.315,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In Congo, the official language is French.

44
0:03:21.592,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But in Uganda, it is English.

45
0:03:25.282,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We didn't have access to education and health.

46
0:03:29.427,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We were exposed to harassment,

47
0:03:33.434,000 --> 0:03:37,000
exploitation, intimidation and discrimination.

48
0:03:39.308,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Humanitarian organizations mostly focused

49
0:03:43.463,000 --> 0:03:45,000
on the formal settlement in rural areas,

50
0:03:46.998,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and there was nothing in place for us.

51
0:03:52.529,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But we didn't want handouts.

52
0:03:56.148,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We wanted to work and support ourselves.

53
0:04:00.752,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I joined my other two colleagues in exile

54
0:04:04.093,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and set up an organization to support other refugees.

55
0:04:08.655,000 --> 0:04:12,000
YARID -- Young African Refugees for Integral Development --

56
0:04:13.935,000 --> 0:04:17,000
began as a conversation within the Congolese community.

57
0:04:19.585,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We asked the community

58
0:04:21.767,000 --> 0:04:25,000
how they could organize themselves to solve these challenges.

59
0:04:27.514,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The YARID programs for support evolve in stages,

60
0:04:32.75,000 --> 0:04:36,000
progressing from soccer community, to English language

61
0:04:37.648,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to sewing livelihoods.

62
0:04:41.655,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The soccer changed the energy

63
0:04:46.269,000 --> 0:04:48,000
of unemployed youth

64
0:04:48.593,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and connected people from different communities.

65
0:04:53.173,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The free English classes

66
0:04:55.284,000 --> 0:04:59,000
help empower people to engage with the Ugandan community,

67
0:04:59.815,000 --> 0:05:03,000
allowing them to get to know their neighbors and sell wares.

68
0:05:05.584,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The vocational training program offers livelihood skills,

69
0:05:11.006,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and with them, important opportunities for economic self-reliance.

70
0:05:16.101,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We've seen so many families

71
0:05:20.228,000 --> 0:05:22,000
become self-sustaining.

72
0:05:23.698,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We've seen who no longer needs our help.

73
0:05:28.69,000 --> 0:05:32,000
As YARID's programs have expanded,

74
0:05:33.72,000 --> 0:05:37,000
it has included an increasing range of nationalities --

75
0:05:39.093,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Congolese, Rwandan, Burundian,

76
0:05:43.942,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Somalis, Ethiopian, South Sudanese.

77
0:05:47.347,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Today, YARID has supported over 3,000 refugees across Kampala

78
0:05:53.671,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and continues supporting more.

79
0:05:55.35,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Applause)

80
0:05:59.974,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Refugees want empowerment, not handouts.

81
0:06:06.006,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We know our community better than anyone.

82
0:06:10.173,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We understand the challenges and opportunities we face

83
0:06:15.022,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to become self-reliant.

84
0:06:17.683,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I know better than anyone

85
0:06:20.603,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that initiatives created by refugees work.

86
0:06:24.77,000 --> 0:06:27,000
They need to be internationally recognized and supported.

87
0:06:29.624,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Give us the support we deserve,

88
0:06:32.475,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and we will pay you back with interest.

89
0:06:34.879,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Thank you so much.

90
0:06:36.243,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Applause)

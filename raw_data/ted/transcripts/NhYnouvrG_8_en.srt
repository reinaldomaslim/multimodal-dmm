2
0:00:16.048,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What I want to do this afternoon

3
0:00:17.675,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is something a little different than what's scheduled.

4
0:00:20.54,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Foreign policy, you can figure that out

5
0:00:22.486,000 --> 0:00:25,000
by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody,

6
0:00:25.52,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but — (Laughter) —

7
0:00:27.354,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I want to talk about young people and structure,

8
0:00:30.916,000 --> 0:00:31,000
young people and structure.

9
0:00:32.883,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This was last Wednesday afternoon

10
0:00:35.131,000 --> 0:00:37,000
at a school in Brooklyn, New York,

11
0:00:37.635,000 --> 0:00:39,000
at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.

12
0:00:40.569,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.

13
0:00:44.406,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They were around me in three directions.

14
0:00:46.873,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority.

15
0:00:49.669,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You'll notice that the building is rather austere.

16
0:00:51.514,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's an old New York school building, nothing fancy.

17
0:00:55.645,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They still have old blackboards and whatnot.

18
0:00:58.176,000 --> 0:01:,000
And there are about 300 kids in this school,

19
0:01:00.767,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and the school's been going now for four years,

20
0:01:03.419,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and they're about to graduate their first class.

21
0:01:06.373,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Twenty-two people are graduating,

22
0:01:08.444,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and all 22 are going to college.

23
0:01:10.687,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They all come from homes where there is, for the most part,

24
0:01:13.427,000 --> 0:01:15,000
just one person in the home,

25
0:01:15.95,000 --> 0:01:17,000
usually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it,

26
0:01:18.856,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and they come here for their education

27
0:01:21.343,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and for their structure.

28
0:01:22.756,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now I had this picture taken, and it was put up

29
0:01:25.564,000 --> 0:01:27,000
on my Facebook page last week,

30
0:01:28.057,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and somebody wrote in,

31
0:01:29.691,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?"

32
0:01:34.677,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And then they said, "But he looks good." (Laughter)

33
0:01:39.048,000 --> 0:01:41,000
He does look good, because kids need structure,

34
0:01:41.758,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and the trick I play in all of my school appearances

35
0:01:45.264,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids,

36
0:01:48.163,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I then invite them to ask questions,

37
0:01:50.347,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and when they raise their hands, I say, "Come up,"

38
0:01:52.212,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I make them come up and stand in front of me.

39
0:01:54.551,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I make them stand at attention like a soldier.

40
0:01:56.665,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Put your arms straight down at your side,

41
0:01:58.447,000 --> 0:02:01,000
look up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead,

42
0:02:01.899,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear.

43
0:02:05.334,000 --> 0:02:08,000
No slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff.

44
0:02:08.591,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:09.962,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And this young man, his name is -- his last name Cruz --

46
0:02:13.227,000 --> 0:02:16,000
he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral.

47
0:02:17.064,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:19.251,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So people think I'm being unkind to this kid.

49
0:02:21.994,000 --> 0:02:22,000
No, we're having a little fun.

50
0:02:23.638,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And the thing about it, I've done this for years,

51
0:02:26.052,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the younger they are, the more fun it is.

52
0:02:29.212,000 --> 0:02:31,000
When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group,

53
0:02:32.152,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I have to figure out how to keep them quiet.

54
0:02:34.031,000 --> 0:02:36,000
You know that they'll always start yakking.

55
0:02:36.034,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And so I play a little game with them

56
0:02:37.639,000 --> 0:02:38,000
before I make them stand at attention.

57
0:02:39.211,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I say, "Now listen. In the army,

58
0:02:41.484,000 --> 0:02:43,000
when we want you to pay attention,

59
0:02:43.812,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we have a command. It's called 'at ease.'

60
0:02:46.997,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up.

61
0:02:50.571,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Do you understand?"

62
0:02:51.709,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.""Let's practice. Everybody start chatting."

63
0:02:56.574,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, "At ease!"

64
0:02:59.871,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"Huh!" (Laughter)

65
0:03:03.376,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"Yes, General. Yes, General."

66
0:03:05.898,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Try it with your kids. See if it works. (Laughter)

67
0:03:08.301,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I don't think so.

68
0:03:11.354,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously

69
0:03:14.368,000 --> 0:03:15,000
from my military experience.

70
0:03:16.09,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Because for the majority of my adult life,

71
0:03:19.519,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them.

72
0:03:23.579,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And we would bring them into the army,

73
0:03:26.024,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and the first thing we would do is to put them

74
0:03:28.473,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in an environment of structure, put them in ranks,

75
0:03:32.56,000 --> 0:03:33,000
make them all wear the same clothes,

76
0:03:33.983,000 --> 0:03:35,000
cut all their hair off so they look alike,

77
0:03:36.477,000 --> 0:03:38,000
make sure that they are standing in ranks.

78
0:03:38.681,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We teach them how to go right face, left face,

79
0:03:40.461,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so they can obey instructions and know

80
0:03:42.378,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the consequences of not obeying instructions.

81
0:03:45.306,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It gives them structure.

82
0:03:46.771,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant.

83
0:03:50.951,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And they hate him.

84
0:03:52.825,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them,

85
0:03:55.173,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and telling them to do all kinds of awful things.

86
0:03:59.022,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But then the most amazing thing happens over time.

87
0:04:02.026,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Once that structure is developed,

88
0:04:05.052,000 --> 0:04:08,000
once they understand the reason for something,

89
0:04:08.27,000 --> 0:04:12,000
once they understand, "Mama ain't here, son.

90
0:04:12.276,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy.

91
0:04:16.096,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And that's just the way it is. You got that, son?

92
0:04:18.708,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Yeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers:

93
0:04:21.546,000 --> 0:04:23,000
yes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.

94
0:04:23.942,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Don't start telling me why you didn't do something.

95
0:04:26.105,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir."

96
0:04:28.757,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"You didn't shave.""But sir —"

97
0:04:29.88,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning.

98
0:04:33.135,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I'm telling you you didn't shave."

99
0:04:34.875,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"No excuse, sir.""Attaboy, you're learning fast."

100
0:04:38.081,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them

101
0:04:40.469,000 --> 0:04:42,000
once you put them in that structure.

102
0:04:42.923,000 --> 0:04:46,000
In 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature.

103
0:04:47.781,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeant

104
0:04:50.898,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and they never forget the drill sergeant.

105
0:04:52.796,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They come to respect him.

106
0:04:55.431,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect

107
0:04:59.346,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in the lives of our children.

108
0:05:01.377,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I spend a lot of time with youth groups,

109
0:05:03.35,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I say to people, "When does the education process begin?"

110
0:05:06.641,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We're always talking about, "Let's fix the schools.

111
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools.

112
0:05:12.067,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Let's get it all online."

113
0:05:15.008,000 --> 0:05:18,000
That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer.

114
0:05:18.314,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school

115
0:05:21.576,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with.

116
0:05:26.184,000 --> 0:05:28,000
When does the learning process begin? Does it begin in first grade?

117
0:05:29.053,000 --> 0:05:31,000
No, no, it begins the first time

118
0:05:31.236,000 --> 0:05:33,000
a child in a mother's arms

119
0:05:33.917,000 --> 0:05:35,000
looks up at the mother

120
0:05:36.681,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and says, "Oh, this must be my mother.

121
0:05:40.045,000 --> 0:05:42,000
She's the one who feeds me.

122
0:05:42.418,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Oh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there,

123
0:05:44.624,000 --> 0:05:46,000
she takes care of me.

124
0:05:47.138,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's her language I will learn."

125
0:05:50.161,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And at that moment they shut out all the other languages

126
0:05:52.91,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that they could be learning at that age,

127
0:05:55.266,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but by three months, that's her.

128
0:05:58.215,000 --> 0:06:,000
And if the person doing it, whether it's the mother

129
0:06:00.535,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or grandmother, whoever's doing it,

130
0:06:02.528,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that is when the education process begins.

131
0:06:04.742,000 --> 0:06:05,000
That's when language begins.

132
0:06:06.47,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That's when love begins. That's when structure begins.

133
0:06:08.719,000 --> 0:06:1,000
That's when you start to imprint on the child

134
0:06:11.207,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that "you are special,

135
0:06:13.425,000 --> 0:06:16,000
you are different from every other child in the world.

136
0:06:16.614,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And we're going to read to you."

137
0:06:18.698,000 --> 0:06:2,000
A child who has not been read to

138
0:06:20.769,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is in danger when that child gets to school.

139
0:06:22.913,000 --> 0:06:24,000
A child who doesn't know his or her colors

140
0:06:24.973,000 --> 0:06:27,000
or doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes,

141
0:06:27.987,000 --> 0:06:28,000
doesn't know how to do those things,

142
0:06:29.386,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and doesn't know how to do something that

143
0:06:32.056,000 --> 0:06:34,000
goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind.

144
0:06:34.932,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Mind your manners! Mind your adults! Mind what you're saying!

145
0:06:38.82,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This is the way children are raised properly.

146
0:06:42.343,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along

147
0:06:45.138,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and they're, much to the distress of my children,

148
0:06:49.231,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them.

149
0:06:53.907,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school.

150
0:06:59.132,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And I'm working at all the energy I have

151
0:07:01.391,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to sort of communicate this message that

152
0:07:03.721,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we need preschool, we need Head Start,

153
0:07:07.6,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we need prenatal care.

154
0:07:10.12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The education process begins even before the child is born,

155
0:07:14.335,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and if you don't do that, you're going to have difficulty.

156
0:07:17.043,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities

157
0:07:19.457,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and so many of our schools where kids are coming

158
0:07:22.502,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to first grade and their eyes are blazing,

159
0:07:24.813,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go,

160
0:07:28.424,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and then they realize they're not like the other first graders

161
0:07:31.825,000 --> 0:07:35,000
who know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.

162
0:07:36.289,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And by the third grade, the kids who didn't have

163
0:07:38.983,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that structure and minding in the beginning

164
0:07:43.129,000 --> 0:07:44,000
start to realize they're behind, and what do they do?

165
0:07:45.039,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They act it out. They act it out, and they're on their way

166
0:07:48.36,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts.

167
0:07:51.446,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's predictable.

168
0:07:53.31,000 --> 0:07:55,000
If you're not at the right reading level at third grade,

169
0:07:56.276,000 --> 0:08:,000
you are a candidate for jail at age 18,

170
0:08:00.353,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and we have the highest incarceration rate

171
0:08:02.59,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life.

172
0:08:05.518,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The last chapter in my book is called

173
0:08:07.734,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"The Gift of a Good Start."

174
0:08:10.645,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life.

175
0:08:14.337,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I was privileged to have that kind of good start.

176
0:08:17.04,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I was not a great student.

177
0:08:18.931,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I was a public school kid in New York City,

178
0:08:21.599,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and I didn't do well at all.

179
0:08:24.239,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript

180
0:08:28.051,000 --> 0:08:3,000
from kindergarten through college.

181
0:08:30.494,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I wanted it when I was writing my first book.

182
0:08:32.764,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I wanted to see if my memory was correct,

183
0:08:34.803,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and, my God, it was. (Laughter)

184
0:08:38.078,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Straight C everywhere.

185
0:08:40.866,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And I finally bounced through high school,

186
0:08:43.307,000 --> 0:08:45,000
got into the City College of New York

187
0:08:45.386,000 --> 0:08:48,000
with a 78.3 average, which I shouldn't have been allowed in with,

188
0:08:49.026,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and then I started out in engineering,

189
0:08:51.765,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and that only lasted six months. (Laughter)

190
0:08:54.323,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And then I went into geology, "rocks for jocks." This is easy.

191
0:08:58.336,000 --> 0:09:,000
And then I found ROTC.

192
0:09:00.338,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing,

193
0:09:04.272,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way.

194
0:09:08.166,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.

195
0:09:12.152,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I say to young kids everywhere, as you're growing up

196
0:09:14.82,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and as this structure is being developed inside of you,

197
0:09:17.421,000 --> 0:09:2,000
always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing,

198
0:09:20.457,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and when you find those two things together, man, you got it.

199
0:09:23.594,000 --> 0:09:25,000
That's what's going on. And that's what I found.

200
0:09:25.958,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.

201
0:09:28.612,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I'd been there four and a half going on five years,

202
0:09:30.413,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and my grades were not doing particularly well,

203
0:09:34.823,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.

204
0:09:37.965,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And so they said, "But he does so well in ROTC.

205
0:09:40.879,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Look, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else."

206
0:09:44.229,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And so they said, "Look, let's take his ROTC grades

207
0:09:48.585,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens."

208
0:09:52.031,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And they did, and it brought me up to 2.0. (Laughter)

209
0:09:58.747,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Yep. (Laughter) (Applause)

210
0:10:02.481,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They said, "It's good enough for government work.

211
0:10:05.53,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again."

212
0:10:09.028,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So they shipped me off to the army,

213
0:10:10.88,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and lo and behold, many years later,

214
0:10:14.548,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. (Laughter)

215
0:10:18.854,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So, I tell young people everywhere,

216
0:10:22.056,000 --> 0:10:26,000
it ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life

217
0:10:26.247,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that determines where you end up in life,

218
0:10:29.858,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and you are blessed to be living in a country that,

219
0:10:32.543,000 --> 0:10:35,000
no matter where you start, you have opportunities

220
0:10:35.729,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so long as you believe in yourself,

221
0:10:38.433,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you believe in the society and the country,

222
0:10:41.424,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and you believe that you can self-improve

223
0:10:44.843,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and educate yourself as you go along.

224
0:10:47.254,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And that's the key to success.

225
0:10:49.487,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But it begins with the gift of a good start.

226
0:10:52.837,000 --> 0:10:54,000
If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids,

227
0:10:55.31,000 --> 0:10:58,000
if we don't invest at the earliest age,

228
0:10:58.988,000 --> 0:11:,000
we're going to be running into difficulties.

229
0:11:01.73,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall

230
0:11:05.996,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and almost 50 percent of our minority population

231
0:11:08.718,000 --> 0:11:11,000
living in low-income areas,

232
0:11:12.192,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because they're not getting the gift of a good start.

233
0:11:14.973,000 --> 0:11:17,000
My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family,

234
0:11:18.951,000 --> 0:11:21,000
a good family, but having a family that said to me,

235
0:11:22.506,000 --> 0:11:25,000
"Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats

236
0:11:26.453,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in 1920 and 1924.

237
0:11:29.815,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day.

238
0:11:33.99,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose

239
0:11:37.516,000 --> 0:11:41,000
or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out."

240
0:11:41.896,000 --> 0:11:44,000
If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people

241
0:11:44.947,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that, "You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out,"

242
0:11:47.416,000 --> 0:11:49,000
they'd said, "We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid."

243
0:11:50.073,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

244
0:11:56.431,000 --> 0:11:58,000
They had expectations for all of the cousins

245
0:11:58.957,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx,

246
0:12:02.54,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but they had more than just expectations for us.

247
0:12:05.699,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They stuck into our hearts like a dagger

248
0:12:09.61,000 --> 0:12:13,000
a sense of shame: "Don't you shame this family."

249
0:12:14.472,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Sometimes I would get in trouble,

250
0:12:16.135,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and my parents were coming home,

251
0:12:17.978,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen,

252
0:12:21.459,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and I would sit there saying to myself, "Okay, look,

253
0:12:23.67,000 --> 0:12:27,000
take the belt and hit me, but, God, don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again."

254
0:12:28.445,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It devastated me when my mother did that to me.

255
0:12:31.202,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And I also had this extended network.

256
0:12:33.366,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe,

257
0:12:36.354,000 --> 0:12:37,000
a family, a community.

258
0:12:38.235,000 --> 0:12:42,000
In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings.

259
0:12:42.459,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers,

260
0:12:44.315,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but there were these tenement buildings,

261
0:12:46.236,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and these women were always hanging out one of the windows,

262
0:12:49.449,000 --> 0:12:5,000
leaning on a pillow.

263
0:12:51.071,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They never left. (Laughter)

264
0:12:53.83,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I, so help me God, I grew up walking those streets,

265
0:12:56.864,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and they were always there.

266
0:12:58.346,000 --> 0:13:,000
They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter)

267
0:13:01.22,000 --> 0:13:03,000
They never did anything.

268
0:13:03.766,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But what they did was keep us in play.

269
0:13:06.479,000 --> 0:13:08,000
They kept us in play.

270
0:13:08.765,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And they didn't care

271
0:13:11.023,000 --> 0:13:15,000
whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general,

272
0:13:15.77,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and they never expected any generals in the family,

273
0:13:18.863,000 --> 0:13:21,000
as long as you got an education and then you got a job.

274
0:13:22.723,000 --> 0:13:23,000
"Don't give us any of that self-actualization stuff.

275
0:13:24.714,000 --> 0:13:26,000
You get a job and get out of the house.

276
0:13:27.529,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We don't have time to waste for that.

277
0:13:30.007,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys."

278
0:13:33.582,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And so, it's so essential that we kind of put this culture

279
0:13:39.104,000 --> 0:13:43,000
back into our families, all families.

280
0:13:43.386,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And it is so important that all of you here today

281
0:13:46.721,000 --> 0:13:48,000
who are successful people,

282
0:13:49.397,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren,

283
0:13:53.952,000 --> 0:13:54,000
it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back

284
0:13:55.69,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and find kids like Mr. Cruz

285
0:13:58.341,000 --> 0:14:01,000
who can make it if you give them the structure,

286
0:14:01.711,000 --> 0:14:02,000
if you reach back and help, if you mentor,

287
0:14:03.698,000 --> 0:14:05,000
if you invest in boys and girls clubs,

288
0:14:06.072,000 --> 0:14:07,000
if you work with your school system,

289
0:14:07.963,000 --> 0:14:08,000
make sure it's the best school system,

290
0:14:09.237,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem,

291
0:14:14.06,000 --> 0:14:16,000
not just downtown Montessori on the West Side.

292
0:14:16.882,000 --> 0:14:2,000
All of us have to have a commitment to do that.

293
0:14:21.035,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And we're not just investing in the kids.

294
0:14:23.685,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We're investing in our future.

295
0:14:25.738,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We're going to be a minority-majority country

296
0:14:28.559,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in one more generation.

297
0:14:30.552,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority.

298
0:14:33.921,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority.

299
0:14:36.501,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders

300
0:14:38.732,000 --> 0:14:4,000
of this great country of ours,

301
0:14:41.684,000 --> 0:14:44,000
a country that is like no other,

302
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
a country that amazes me every single day,

303
0:14:46.845,000 --> 0:14:48,000
a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other.

304
0:14:49.465,000 --> 0:14:51,000
That's how the system's supposed to work.

305
0:14:52.437,000 --> 0:14:55,000
It's a country of such contrasts, but it's a nation of nations.

306
0:14:56.016,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We touch every nation. Every nation touches us.

307
0:15:00.012,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We are a nation of immigrants.

308
0:15:01.697,000 --> 0:15:04,000
That's why we need sound immigration policy.

309
0:15:04.841,000 --> 0:15:07,000
It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy

310
0:15:08.076,000 --> 0:15:11,000
to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation,

311
0:15:11.159,000 --> 0:15:13,000
or we can send back home with an education

312
0:15:13.312,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to help their people rise up out of poverty.

313
0:15:16.693,000 --> 0:15:19,000
One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love

314
0:15:20.536,000 --> 0:15:21,000
of going to my hometown of New York

315
0:15:21.933,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day

316
0:15:23.727,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by

317
0:15:26.208,000 --> 0:15:27,000
from all over the world.

318
0:15:27.662,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners

319
0:15:31.3,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler.

320
0:15:34.686,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Gotta have a dirty water dog. (Laughter)

321
0:15:37.837,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And no matter where I am or what I'm doing,

322
0:15:40.817,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I've got to do that.

323
0:15:42.092,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I even did it when I was Secretary of State.

324
0:15:44.757,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria

325
0:15:47.658,000 --> 0:15:5,000
— (Laughter) —

326
0:15:50.738,000 --> 0:15:53,000
be walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street

327
0:15:54.049,000 --> 0:15:56,000
looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler.

328
0:15:56.36,000 --> 0:15:58,000
In those days, I had five bodyguards around me

329
0:15:58.559,000 --> 0:16:,000
and three New York City police cars would roll alongside

330
0:16:01.453,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue. (Laughter)

331
0:16:06.273,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And I would order the hot dog from the guy,

332
0:16:07.941,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around

333
0:16:10.387,000 --> 0:16:11,000
at the bodyguards and the police cars --

334
0:16:12.064,000 --> 0:16:14,000
"I've got a green card! I've got a green card!" (Laughter)

335
0:16:14.146,000 --> 0:16:18,000
"It's okay, it's okay."

336
0:16:18.482,000 --> 0:16:2,000
But now I'm alone. I'm alone.

337
0:16:20.93,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing.

338
0:16:23.721,000 --> 0:16:25,000
But I gotta have my hot dog.

339
0:16:26.383,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening

340
0:16:30.147,000 --> 0:16:32,000
down by Columbus Circle.

341
0:16:32.447,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And the scene repeats itself so often.

342
0:16:35.302,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I'll go up and ask for my hot dog,

343
0:16:38.656,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and the guy will fix it, and as he's finishing,

344
0:16:41.018,000 --> 0:16:43,000
he'll say, "I know you. I see you on television.

345
0:16:43.72,000 --> 0:16:44,000
You're, well, you're General Powell."

346
0:16:45.614,000 --> 0:16:47,000
"Yes, yes.""Oh ... "

347
0:16:48.304,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I hand him the money.

348
0:16:49.455,000 --> 0:16:53,000
"No, General. You can't pay me. I've been paid.

349
0:16:54.38,000 --> 0:16:57,000
America has paid me. I never forget where I came from.

350
0:16:58.143,000 --> 0:17:01,000
But now I'm an American. Sir, thank you."

351
0:17:01.333,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I accept the generosity, continue up the street,

352
0:17:03.601,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and it washes over me, my God,

353
0:17:05.83,000 --> 0:17:09,000
it's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago.

354
0:17:09.848,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So we are still that magnificent country,

355
0:17:12.035,000 --> 0:17:14,000
but we are fueled by young people coming up

356
0:17:14.81,000 --> 0:17:17,000
from every land in the world,

357
0:17:17.814,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and it is our obligation as contributing citizens

358
0:17:21.341,000 --> 0:17:22,000
to this wonderful country of ours

359
0:17:23.127,000 --> 0:17:26,000
to make sure that no child gets left behind.

360
0:17:26.274,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Thank you very much.

361
0:17:28.352,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Applause)

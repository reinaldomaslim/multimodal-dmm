1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to start here.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This is a hand-lettered sign

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that appeared in a mom and pop bakery

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The store owned one of those machines

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that can print on plates of sugar.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And kids could bring in drawings

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and have the store print a sugar plate

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
for the top of their birthday cake.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
was cartoon characters.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But it turns out to be illegal

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
onto a plate of sugar.

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And it's a copyright violation.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And policing copyright violations

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for children's birthday cakes

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
was such a hassle

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that the College Bakery said,

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"You know what, we're getting out of that business.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
If you're an amateur,

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you don't have access to our machine anymore.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
If you want a printed sugar birthday cake,

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you have to use one of our prefab images --

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
only for professionals."

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So there's two bills in Congress right now.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's from the Senate.

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
PIPA is short for PROTECTIP,

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
which is itself short for

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Preventing Real Online Threats

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to Economic Creativity

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and Theft of Intellectual Property --

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because the congressional aides who name these things

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
have a lot of time on their hands.

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And what SOPA and PIPA want to do

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is they want to do this.

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They want to raise the cost

42
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of copyright compliance

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to the point where people simply get out of the business

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of offering it as a capability to amateurs.

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now the way they propose to do this

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is to identify sites

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that are substantially infringing on copyright --

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
although how those sites are identified

49
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is never fully specified in the bills --

50
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and then they want to remove them from the domain name system.

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
They want to take them out of the domain name system.

52
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now the domain name system

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
into the kinds of addresses

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
machines expect --

56
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
74.125.226.212.

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now the problem with this model of censorship,

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of identifying a site

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and then trying to remove it from the domain name system,

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is that it won't work.

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now the reason it won't work

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or you can make it a clickable link

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and you'll still go to Google.

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So the policing layer

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
around the problem

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
becomes the real threat of the act.

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that won't accomplish its stated goals,

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you have to understand a little bit about the back story.

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the back story is this:

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
SOPA and PIPA, as legislation,

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
were drafted largely by media companies

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that were founded in the 20th century.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The 20th century was a great time to be a media company,

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If you were making a TV show,

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it only had to be better

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
than the two other shows

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that were on at the same time --

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which is a very low threshold

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of competitive difficulty.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Which meant

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that if you fielded average content,

89
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you got a third of the U.S. public for free --

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
tens of millions of users

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
for simply doing something

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that wasn't too terrible.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is like having a license to print money

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and a barrel of free ink.

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that scarcity started to get eroded --

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I don't mean by digital technology;

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I mean by analog technology.

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders,

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
even the humble Xerox machine

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
created new opportunities

103
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for us to behave in ways

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that astonished the media business.

105
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Because it turned out

106
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we're not really couch potatoes.

107
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We don't really like to only consume.

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We do like to consume,

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but every time one of these new tools came along,

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it turned out we also like to produce

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and we like to share.

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And this freaked the media businesses out --

113
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
it freaked them out every time.

114
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Jack Valenti, who was the head lobbyist

115
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for the Motion Picture Association of America,

116
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder

117
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to Jack the Ripper

118
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and poor, helpless Hollywood

119
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to a woman at home alone.

120
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
That was the level of rhetoric.

121
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And so the media industries

122
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
begged, insisted, demanded

123
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that Congress do something.

124
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And Congress did something.

125
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
By the early 90s, Congress passed the law

126
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that changed everything.

127
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act

128
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
of 1992.

129
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,

130
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
look, if people are taping stuff off the radio

131
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and then making mixtapes for their friends,

132
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that is not a crime. That's okay.

133
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Taping and remixing

134
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and sharing with your friends is okay.

135
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,

136
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that's not okay.

137
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But this taping business,

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
fine, let it go.

139
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And they thought that they clarified the issue,

140
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because they'd set out a clear distinction

141
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
between legal and illegal copying.

142
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.

143
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They had wanted Congress

144
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to outlaw copying full-stop.

145
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,

146
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
the media businesses gave up on the idea

147
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because it was clear

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that if Congress was acting in their framework,

150
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they might actually increase the rights of citizens

151
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to participate in our own media environment.

152
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So they went for plan B.

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It took them a while to formulate plan B.

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Plan B appeared in its first full-blown form

155
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in 1998 --

156
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

157
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.

158
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But the main thrust of the DMCA

159
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
was that it was legal to sell you

160
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
uncopyable digital material --

161
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,

163
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"Like handing out water

164
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that wasn't wet."

165
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Bits are copyable. That's what computers do.

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation.

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So in order to fake the ability

168
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to sell uncopyable bits,

169
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the DMCA also made it legal

170
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to force you to use systems

171
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that broke the copying function of your devices.

172
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Every DVD player and game player

173
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and television and computer you brought home --

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it --

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
could be broken by the content industries,

176
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.

177
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And to make sure you didn't realize,

178
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or didn't enact their capabilities

179
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
as general purpose computing devices,

180
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they also made it illegal

181
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
for you to try to reset

182
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the copyability of that content.

183
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The DMCA marks the moment

184
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
when the media industries

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
gave up on the legal system

186
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying

187
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and simply tried to prevent copying

188
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
through technical means.

189
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but in this one domain, limiting sharing,

191
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
it has mostly not worked.

192
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the main reason it hasn't worked

193
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful

194
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
than anyone imagined.

195
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The mixtape, the fanzine,

196
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now

197
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
with the Internet.

198
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We are in a world

199
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
where most American citizens

200
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
over the age of 12

201
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
share things with each other online.

202
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We share written things, we share images,

203
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we share audio, we share video.

204
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.

205
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.

206
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Some of the stuff we share

207
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
is stuff we've made out of what we've found,

208
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and all of it horrifies those industries.

209
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So PIPA and SOPA

210
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
are round two.

211
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But where the DMCA was surgical --

212
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we want to go down into your computer,

213
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,

214
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and prevent it from doing

215
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
what they said it would do at the store --

216
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
PIPA and SOPA are nuclear

217
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world

218
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and censor content.

219
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Now the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,

220
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is you need to take out anybody

221
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
pointing to those IP addresses.

222
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
You need to take them out of search engines,

223
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you need to take them out of online directories,

224
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you need to take them out of user lists.

225
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet

226
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
are not Google and Yahoo,

227
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they're us,

228
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we're the people getting policed.

229
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Because in the end,

230
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the real threat

231
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA

232
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is our ability to share things with one another.

233
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing

234
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is taking a centuries-old legal concept,

235
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
innocent until proven guilty,

236
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and reversing it --

237
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
guilty until proven innocent.

238
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
You can't share

239
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
until you show us

240
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that you're not sharing something

241
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
we don't like.

242
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Suddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegal

243
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
falls affirmatively on us

244
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and on the services

245
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that might be offering us any new capabilities.

246
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And if it costs even a dime

247
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to police a user,

248
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that will crush a service

249
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
with a hundred million users.

250
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So this is the Internet they have in mind.

251
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Imagine this sign everywhere --

252
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery,

253
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
imagine it says YouTube

254
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and Facebook and Twitter.

255
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Imagine it says TED,

256
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
because the comments can't be policed

257
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
at any acceptable cost.

258
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The real effects of SOPA and PIPA

259
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
are going to be different than the proposed effects.

260
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The threat, in fact,

261
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is this inversion of the burden of proof,

262
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
where we suddenly

263
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
are all treated like thieves

264
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
at every moment we're given the freedom to create,

265
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to produce or to share.

266
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And the people who provide those capabilities to us --

267
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs --

268
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are in the business

269
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
of having to police us,

270
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or being on the hook for contributory infringement.

271
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
There's two things you can do

272
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to help stop this --

273
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
a simple thing and a complicated thing,

274
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
an easy thing and a hard thing.

275
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The simple thing, the easy thing, is this:

276
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
if you're an American citizen,

277
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
call your representative, call your senator.

278
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
When you look at

279
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
the people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,

280
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
people who've co-signed on PIPA,

281
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
what you see is that they have cumulatively received

282
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
millions and millions of dollars

283
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
from the traditional media industries.

284
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
You don't have millions and millions of dollars,

285
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but you can call your representatives,

286
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and you can remind them that you vote,

287
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and you can ask not to be treated like a thief,

288
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and you can suggest that you would prefer

289
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that the Internet not be broken.

290
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And if you're not an American citizen,

291
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
you can contact American citizens that you know

292
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and encourage them to do the same.

293
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Because this seems like a national issue,

294
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but it is not.

295
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
These industries will not be content

296
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
with breaking our Internet.

297
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
If they break it, they will break it for everybody.

298
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
That's the easy thing.

299
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
That's the simple thing.

300
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The hard thing is this:

301
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
get ready, because more is coming.

302
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,

303
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which was purposed last year, which did not pass.

304
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And all of this goes back

305
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to the failure of the DMCA

306
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to disallow sharing as a technical means.

307
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,

308
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
which horrified those industries.

309
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Because the whole business

310
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law

311
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and then gathering evidence and proving that,

312
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that turns out to be really inconvenient.

313
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
"We'd prefer not to do that,"

314
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
says the content industries.

315
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And what they want is not to have to do that.

316
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
They don't want legal distinctions

317
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
between legal and illegal sharing.

318
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They just want the sharing to go away.

319
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
PIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies,

320
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
they're not events.

321
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
They're the next turn of this particular screw,

322
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
which has been going on 20 years now.

323
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And if we defeat these, as I hope we do,

324
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
more is coming.

325
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Because until we convince Congress

326
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that the way to deal with copyright violation

327
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,

328
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence

329
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies

330
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that goes on in democratic societies.

331
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
That's the way to handle this.

332
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
In the meantime,

333
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the hard thing to do is to be ready.

334
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.

335
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Time Warner has called

336
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and they want us all back on the couch,

337
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
just consuming --

338
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
not producing, not sharing --

339
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and we should say, "No."

340
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Thank you.

341
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000

1
0:00:12.519,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Why do we think

2
0:00:14.423,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance,

3
0:00:19.738,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and stories by women are thought to be merely about women?

4
0:00:26.633,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My grandmother left school when she was 12.

5
0:00:29.396,000 --> 0:00:3,000
She had 14 children.

6
0:00:32.176,000 --> 0:00:33,000
My mother left school when she was 15.

7
0:00:34.091,000 --> 0:00:35,000
She was a secretary.

8
0:00:35.516,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I graduated from university to become a theater director,

9
0:00:39.298,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people I'll never meet

10
0:00:43.481,000 --> 0:00:45,000
fought for women to have rights,

11
0:00:45.753,000 --> 0:00:48,000
get the vote, get education, have progress.

12
0:00:48.918,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And I'm determined to do the same, and obviously you are, too.

13
0:00:52.527,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Why not?

14
0:00:53.728,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:55.309,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So I started a festival called WOW, Women of the World, seven years ago,

16
0:00:59.045,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and it's now in 20 countries across five continents.

17
0:01:02.073,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And one of those countries is Somaliland in Africa.

18
0:01:05.448,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I traveled there last year,

19
0:01:07.687,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and part of the joy I had in going there was going to these caves.

20
0:01:14.542,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The Laas Geel caves.

21
0:01:16.742,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world.

22
0:01:22.819,000 --> 0:01:27,000
These paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.

23
0:01:28.93,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Art:

24
0:01:30.383,000 --> 0:01:33,000
what humanity has done ever since it evolved.

25
0:01:34.17,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's how we speak about ourselves,

26
0:01:36.317,000 --> 0:01:37,000
how we understand our identity,

27
0:01:38.278,000 --> 0:01:39,000
how we look at our surroundings,

28
0:01:40.05,000 --> 0:01:43,000
who we find out about each other

29
0:01:43.145,000 --> 0:01:45,000
because of the meaning of our lives.

30
0:01:45.379,000 --> 0:01:46,000
That's what art is for.

31
0:01:47.791,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So look at this little picture.

32
0:01:49.777,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I think it's a little girl.

33
0:01:51.747,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I thought it was a bit like me when I was a little girl.

34
0:01:55.015,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I thought, well, who painted this joyful, youthful figure?

35
0:01:59.206,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I asked the curator of the caves.

36
0:02:01.334,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I said, "Tell me about the men and women who painted these."

37
0:02:04.876,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And he looked at me absolutely askance, and he said,

38
0:02:08.377,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"Women didn't paint these pictures."

39
0:02:11.061,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I said, "Well, it was 11,000 years ago."

40
0:02:13.589,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I said, "How do you know?"

41
0:02:15.072,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:17.623,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And he said, "Women don't do these things.

43
0:02:21.378,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Men made these marks. Women don't."

44
0:02:26.367,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, I wasn't really surprised,

45
0:02:30.161,000 --> 0:02:34,000
because that's an attitude that I've seen continuously

46
0:02:34.243,000 --> 0:02:36,000
all my life as a theater maker.

47
0:02:38.372,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We are told that divine knowledge comes down through the masculine,

48
0:02:44.206,000 --> 0:02:48,000
whether it be to the imam, the priest, the rabbi, the holy man.

49
0:02:49.241,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Similarly, we're told that creative genius resides in the masculine,

50
0:02:54.561,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that it is the masculine

51
0:02:56.331,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that will be able to tell us about who we really are,

52
0:02:59.42,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that the masculine will tell the universal story

53
0:03:02.511,000 --> 0:03:03,000
on behalf of all of us,

54
0:03:04.422,000 --> 0:03:08,000
whereas women artists will really just talk about women's experiences,

55
0:03:09.021,000 --> 0:03:12,000
women's issues only really relevant to women

56
0:03:12.421,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and of passing interest to men --

57
0:03:15.423,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and really only some men.

58
0:03:17.729,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And it's that conviction,

59
0:03:20.024,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that that we are taught,

60
0:03:21.429,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that I think colors so much of whether we're prepared to believe

61
0:03:25.253,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that women's stories really matter.

62
0:03:27.778,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And unless we're prepared to believe that women's stories really matter,

63
0:03:31.349,000 --> 0:03:33,000
then women's rights don't really matter,

64
0:03:34.363,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and then change can't really come.

65
0:03:38.696,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I want to tell you about two examples of stories

66
0:03:43.43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that are thought to be of universal importance:

67
0:03:46.392,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"E.T." and "Hamlet."

68
0:03:49.172,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:52.307,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So I took my two children when they were little --

70
0:03:55.597,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Caroline was eight and Robby was five --

71
0:03:58.871,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to see "E.T."

72
0:04:00.462,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And it's a fantastic story of this little alien

73
0:04:03.871,000 --> 0:04:04,000
who ends up in an American family

74
0:04:05.846,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with a mum, two brothers and a sister,

75
0:04:09.079,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but he wants to go home.

76
0:04:11.54,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Not only that, but some really bad scientists

77
0:04:14.184,000 --> 0:04:16,000
want to do some experiments on him,

78
0:04:16.582,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and they're looking for him.

79
0:04:18.813,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So the children have a plot.

80
0:04:20.893,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They decide they're going to take him back to his spaceship

81
0:04:23.754,000 --> 0:04:24,000
as soon as they can,

82
0:04:24.929,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and they plop him in a bicycle basket,

83
0:04:26.827,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and off they ride.

84
0:04:28.193,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But unfortunately, the baddies have found out, and they're catching up

85
0:04:32.113,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and they've got sirens and they've got their guns,

86
0:04:34.494,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they've got the loud-hailers, it's terribly frightening,

87
0:04:37.192,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and they're closing up on the children,

88
0:04:39.136,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and the children are never going to make it.

89
0:04:41.256,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And then all of a sudden, magically, the bikes fly up in the air,

90
0:04:45.373,000 --> 0:04:46,000
over the clouds,

91
0:04:46.936,000 --> 0:04:47,000
over the moon,

92
0:04:48.148,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and they're going to save "E.T."

93
0:04:51.214,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So I turn to see my children's faces,

94
0:04:53.516,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and Robby is enraptured, he's there with them, he's saving E.T.,

95
0:04:58.01,000 --> 0:04:59,000
he's a happy boy.

96
0:04:59.89,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I turn to Caroline, and she's crying her eyes out.

97
0:05:03.686,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And I said, "What's the matter?"

98
0:05:05.255,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And she said, "Why can't I save E.T.? Why can't I come?"

99
0:05:11.242,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And then all of a sudden I realized:

100
0:05:13.625,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they weren't children;

101
0:05:15.677,000 --> 0:05:16,000
they were boys --

102
0:05:17.575,000 --> 0:05:19,000
all boys.

103
0:05:19.664,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And Caroline, who had invested so much in E.T.,

104
0:05:22.665,000 --> 0:05:24,000
well, she wasn't invited to save him,

105
0:05:24.859,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and she felt humiliated and spurned.

106
0:05:28.232,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So I wrote to Steven Spielberg --

107
0:05:30.005,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

108
0:05:36.197,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and I said, "I don't know if you understand

109
0:05:38.771,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the psychological importance of what's happened,

110
0:05:41.174,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and are you prepared to pay for the therapy bills?"

111
0:05:43.698,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:45.136,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Twenty years later, I haven't had a word back from him,

113
0:05:48.132,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but I'm still hopeful.

114
0:05:49.594,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:51.228,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But I thought it was interesting,

116
0:05:52.856,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because if you read reviews of what he intended with E.T.,

117
0:05:55.752,000 --> 0:05:56,000
he says very specifically,

118
0:05:57.567,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"I wanted the world to understand

119
0:06:00.093,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that we should love and embrace difference."

120
0:06:03.324,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But somehow he didn't include the idea of girls' difference

121
0:06:07.97,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in this thinking.

122
0:06:09.686,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He thought he was writing a story about all humanity.

123
0:06:14.02,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Caroline thought he was marginalizing

124
0:06:16.122,000 --> 0:06:17,000
half of humanity.

125
0:06:17.575,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He thought he was writing a story about human goodness;

126
0:06:20.683,000 --> 0:06:24,000
she thought he was writing a lad's heroic adventure.

127
0:06:25.848,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And this is common.

128
0:06:28.332,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication,

129
0:06:33.477,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but of course, how could they be?

130
0:06:35.453,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They are writing from male experience through male's eyes.

131
0:06:41.851,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We have to have a look at this ourselves.

132
0:06:44.093,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We have to be prepared to go back through all our books and our films,

133
0:06:47.793,000 --> 0:06:48,000
all our favorite things,

134
0:06:49.154,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and say, "Actually, this is written by a male artist --

135
0:06:52.008,000 --> 0:06:53,000
not an artist.

136
0:06:54.02,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We have to see that so many of these stories

137
0:06:56.448,000 --> 0:06:58,000
are written through a male perspective.

138
0:06:58.608,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Which is fine,

139
0:07:00.569,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but then females need to have 50 percent of the rights

140
0:07:04.091,000 --> 0:07:06,000
for the stage, the film, the novel,

141
0:07:06.669,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the place of creativity.

142
0:07:09.381,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Let me talk about "Hamlet."

143
0:07:11.204,000 --> 0:07:12,000
To be or not to be.

144
0:07:12.921,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That is the question.

145
0:07:14.818,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But it's not my question.

146
0:07:16.607,000 --> 0:07:19,000
My question is: Why was I taught as a young woman

147
0:07:20.38,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that this was the quintessential example of human dilemma

148
0:07:24.761,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and human experience?

149
0:07:26.481,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's a marvelous story,

150
0:07:27.841,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but actually, it's about a young man fearful that he won't be able to make it

151
0:07:33.201,000 --> 0:07:35,000
as a powerful figure in a male world

152
0:07:35.89,000 --> 0:07:37,000
unless he takes revenge for his father's murder.

153
0:07:39.372,000 --> 0:07:43,000
He talks a great deal to us about suicide being an option,

154
0:07:44.074,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but the reality is that the person who actually commits suicide, Ophelia,

155
0:07:48.767,000 --> 0:07:5,000
after she's been humiliated and abused by him,

156
0:07:51.289,000 --> 0:07:54,000
never gets a chance to talk to the audience about her feelings.

157
0:07:54.489,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And then when he's finished with Ophelia, he turns on his mum,

158
0:07:57.455,000 --> 0:08:,000
because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle

159
0:08:00.778,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and enjoy sex.

160
0:08:02.014,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:04.075,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It is a great story,

162
0:08:06.187,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but it is a story about male conflict, male dilemma, male struggle.

163
0:08:11.957,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But I was told this was the story of human beings,

164
0:08:16.173,000 --> 0:08:19,000
despite the fact that it only had two women in it.

165
0:08:19.24,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And unless I reeducate myself,

166
0:08:21.825,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I am always going to think

167
0:08:23.574,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that women's stories matter less than men's.

168
0:08:27.986,000 --> 0:08:28,000
A woman could have written "Hamlet,"

169
0:08:29.745,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but she would have written it differently,

170
0:08:31.856,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and it wouldn't have had global recognition.

171
0:08:34.488,000 --> 0:08:36,000
As the writer Margaret Atwood says,

172
0:08:36.583,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"When a man writes about doing the dishes,

173
0:08:39.093,000 --> 0:08:4,000
it's realism.

174
0:08:41.199,000 --> 0:08:43,000
When a woman writes about doing it,

175
0:08:43.344,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it's an unfortunate genetic disposition."

176
0:08:45.883,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:47.116,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now, this is not just something that belongs to then.

178
0:08:50.974,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I mean, when I was a young girl,

179
0:08:52.798,000 --> 0:08:54,000
wanting desperately to be a theater director,

180
0:08:55.446,000 --> 0:08:57,000
this is what my male lecturer said to me:

181
0:08:58.309,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"Well, there are three women directors in Britain," he said, "Jude."

182
0:09:02.405,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian, there's Joan Littlewood, who's retired,

183
0:09:06.536,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and there's Buzz Goodbody, who's just killed herself.

184
0:09:09.34,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So, which of those three would you like to be?"

185
0:09:11.62,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:12.697,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now, leaving aside the disgusting slur on gay women,

187
0:09:17.307,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.

188
0:09:20.176,000 --> 0:09:23,000
He thought it was silly that I wanted to be a director.

189
0:09:23.959,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And I told my friend Marin Alsop, the conductor, and she said,

190
0:09:26.954,000 --> 0:09:28,000
"Oh yes, well, my music teacher said exactly the same.

191
0:09:29.727,000 --> 0:09:31,000
He said, 'Women don't conduct.'"

192
0:09:32.524,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But all these years later, we've made our mark.

193
0:09:35.271,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You think, "Well, it'll be different now."

194
0:09:37.525,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I'm afraid it's not different now.

195
0:09:40.043,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The current head of the Paris Conservatoire

196
0:09:43.512,000 --> 0:09:46,000
said recently, "It takes great physical strength

197
0:09:46.963,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to conduct a symphony,

198
0:09:48.468,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and women are too weak."

199
0:09:49.943,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:51.42,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The artist George Baselitz said,

201
0:09:53.383,000 --> 0:09:55,000
"Well, the fact is women can't paint.

202
0:09:55.694,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Well -- they can't paint very well."

203
0:09:58.014,000 --> 0:10:,000
The writer V.S. Naipaul said two years ago,

204
0:10:00.426,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"I can read two paragraphs and know immediately if it's written by a woman,

205
0:10:04.042,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and I just stop reading, because it's not worthy of me."

206
0:10:06.767,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Audience: Whoa!

207
0:10:09.209,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And it goes on.

208
0:10:12.817,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We have to find a way

209
0:10:14.829,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of stopping young girls and women

210
0:10:17.497,000 --> 0:10:19,000
feeling not only that their story doesn't matter,

211
0:10:20.362,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but they're not allowed to be the storyteller.

212
0:10:24.481,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Because once you feel that you can't stand in the central space

213
0:10:28.088,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and speak on behalf of the world,

214
0:10:31.12,000 --> 0:10:36,000
you will feel that you can offer your goods up to a small, select group.

215
0:10:36.219,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You will tend to do smaller work on smaller stages,

216
0:10:39.759,000 --> 0:10:41,000
your economic power will be less,

217
0:10:41.816,000 --> 0:10:43,000
your reach of audiences will be less,

218
0:10:44.312,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and your credit will be less as an artist.

219
0:10:49.377,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And we do finally give artists these incredible, prominent spaces

220
0:10:54.656,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in the world,

221
0:10:55.844,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because they are our storytellers.

222
0:10:57.607,000 --> 0:11:,000
Now, why should it matter to you if you're not an artist?

223
0:11:00.76,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Supposing you're an accountant or an entrepreneur or a medic

224
0:11:04.029,000 --> 0:11:05,000
or a scientist:

225
0:11:05.22,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Should you care about women artists?

226
0:11:07.846,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Absolutely, you must,

227
0:11:09.926,000 --> 0:11:12,000
because as you can see from the cave paintings,

228
0:11:13.362,000 --> 0:11:14,000
all civilizations,

229
0:11:15.067,000 --> 0:11:17,000
all of humanity

230
0:11:17.925,000 --> 0:11:2,000
have relied upon artists to tell the human story,

231
0:11:21.905,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and if the human story is finally told by men,

232
0:11:25.198,000 --> 0:11:26,000
take my word for it,

233
0:11:26.958,000 --> 0:11:27,000
it will be about men.

234
0:11:29.491,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So let's make a change.

235
0:11:32.199,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Let's make a change to all our institutions,

236
0:11:34.425,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and not just in the West.

237
0:11:35.724,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Don't forget -- this message of incapability of women

238
0:11:40.167,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to hold creative genius

239
0:11:42.216,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is being told to girls and women in Nigeria, in China, in Russia,

240
0:11:47.154,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in Indonesia.

241
0:11:48.341,000 --> 0:11:5,000
All over the world, girls and women are being told

242
0:11:51.074,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that they can't finally hold the idea of creative inspiration.

243
0:11:56.951,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And I want to ask you:

244
0:11:58.624,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Do you believe that?

245
0:12:00.362,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Do you believe that women can be a creative genius?

246
0:12:04.988,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Applause and cheers)

247
0:12:10.751,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Well then, please go forward,

248
0:12:12.436,000 --> 0:12:14,000
support women artists,

249
0:12:14.71,000 --> 0:12:15,000
buy their work,

250
0:12:16.208,000 --> 0:12:18,000
insist that their voices are heard,

251
0:12:18.5,000 --> 0:12:21,000
find platforms on which their voices will be made.

252
0:12:22.5,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And remember this:

253
0:12:24.311,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that in a sense, if we're going to get past this moment

254
0:12:27.614,000 --> 0:12:3,000
of a world where we know that we are unequal,

255
0:12:31.49,000 --> 0:12:34,000
it's artists who have to imagine a different world.

256
0:12:34.711,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I'm calling on all artists, women and men,

257
0:12:38.345,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to imagine a gender-equal world.

258
0:12:42.146,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Let's paint it. Let's draw it.

259
0:12:44.353,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Let's write about it. Let's film it.

260
0:12:46.172,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And if we could imagine it,

261
0:12:48.082,000 --> 0:12:51,000
then we would have the energy and the stamina

262
0:12:51.586,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to work towards it.

263
0:12:53.622,000 --> 0:12:55,000
When I see this little girl,

264
0:12:55.7,000 --> 0:12:57,000
11,000 years ago,

265
0:12:57.764,000 --> 0:13:,000
I want to know that the little girl now

266
0:13:01.249,000 --> 0:13:04,000
can stand there and think she's entitled to her dreams,

267
0:13:04.557,000 --> 0:13:06,000
she's entitled to her destiny

268
0:13:06.871,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and she's entitled to speak on behalf of the whole world,

269
0:13:11.097,000 --> 0:13:12,000
be recognized for it

270
0:13:12.945,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and applauded.

271
0:13:14.619,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Thank you.

272
0:13:15.829,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
among the smartest of the smart.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
There's a Jewish saying that I love.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth

7
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
about our common humanity.

8
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
All stories interest me, and some haunt me

9
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
until I end up writing them.

10
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Certain themes keep coming up:

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
freedom.

13
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I'm aware of the mystery around us,

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so I write about coincidences, premonitions,

15
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.

16
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In the last 20 years I have published a few books,

17
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,

18
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.

19
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,

20
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.

21
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.

23
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,

24
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
of the opening ceremony,

25
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
called me and said that I had been selected

26
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to be one of the flag-bearers.

27
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity

28
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.

29
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium

30
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
without a walker.

31
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I was told that this was no laughing matter.

33
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This would be the first time

34
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that only women would carry the Olympic flag.

35
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Five women, representing five continents,

36
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and three Olympic gold medal winners.

37
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
My first question was, naturally,

38
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
what was I going to wear?

39
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
A uniform, she said,

41
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and asked for my measurements.

42
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
My measurements.

43
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,

44
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
looking like the Michelin Man.

45
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
By the middle of February,

47
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds

48
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.

49
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.

50
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.

51
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,

52
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
can determine the result of a race or a game.

53
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.

54
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.

55
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It is all about passion.

56
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters

57
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
announcing the slogan of the Olympics.

58
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?

59
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.

60
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That is what I need for my characters in my books:

61
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a passionate heart.

62
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,

63
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.

64
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
People like all of you in this room.

65
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.

66
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They only make good former spouses.

68
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Applause)

70
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:

71
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.

72
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Also, two women with passionate hearts:

73
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya

74
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,

75
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
she has changed the soil, the weather,

76
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
in some places in Africa, and of course

77
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the economic conditions in many villages.

78
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately

79
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
against child prostitution.

80
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.

81
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that

82
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.

83
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five,

84
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
15 clients per day,

85
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.

86
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
In the green room I received my uniform.

87
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,

88
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but it was far from the Michelin Man suit

89
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.

90
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I looked like a refrigerator.

91
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,

93
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the universal symbol of beauty and passion.

94
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.

95
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.

96
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?

97
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I don't know.

98
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"

99
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,

100
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and I don't make old people's noises."

101
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So, there you have some free advice

103
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
from one of the most beautiful women on earth.

104
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,

105
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
no talking to yourselves, no farting.

106
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Well, she didn't say that exactly.

108
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
At some point around midnight,

110
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
we were summoned to the wings of the stadium,

111
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --

112
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
by the way, the same music that starts here,

113
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the Aida March.

114
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,

115
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
not counting the poofy hair.

116
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,

118
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind

119
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,

121
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
so that my head was actually under the damn flag.

122
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.

124
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos

125
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.

126
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
A place where most men would love to be.

128
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Applause)

130
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The best four minutes of my entire life

131
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
were those in the Olympic stadium.

132
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
My husband is offended when I say this --

133
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
although I have explained to him that what we do in private

134
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
usually takes less than four minutes --

135
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
-- so he shouldn't take it personally.

137
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,

138
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
because I don't want to forget them

139
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
when old age destroys my brain cells.

140
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --

141
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
passion.

142
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So here's a tale of passion.

143
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp

144
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
for Tutsi refugees in Congo.

145
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world

146
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
are women and girls.

147
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We can call this place in Congo a death camp,

148
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.

149
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The protagonists of this story

150
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.

151
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
She's pregnant and a widow.

152
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Soldiers have forced her to watch

153
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
as her husband was tortured and killed.

154
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,

155
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.

156
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Two tiny little boys.

157
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,

158
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and ties it with her own hair.

159
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
She names the twins after the camp's commanders

160
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea

161
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because her milk cannot sustain them.

162
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,

163
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,

164
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
even when they hold a gun to her head.

165
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months,

166
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart

167
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,

168
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,

169
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,

170
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
where they're now living and thriving.

171
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.

172
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women

173
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
like Rose Mapendo.

174
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.

175
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I look around and I see them everywhere.

176
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I have worked with women and for women all my life.

177
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I know them well.

178
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,

179
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.

180
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --

181
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
although the term had not reached Chile yet,

182
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.

183
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay

185
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.

186
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,

187
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I was able to deliver two.

188
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

189
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,

190
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.

191
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?

192
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,

193
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world

194
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
who are still forced into premature marriage,

195
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
prostitution, forced labor --

196
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.

197
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.

198
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They have no education and no freedom.

199
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.

200
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
For most Western young women of today,

201
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
being called a feminist is an insult.

202
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you

203
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that it never stopped me from flirting,

204
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.

205
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Feminism is not dead, by no means.

207
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It has evolved. If you don't like the term,

208
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
change it, for Goddess' sake.

209
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;

210
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the name doesn't matter,

211
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.

212
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.

213
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.

214
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The year is 2005.

215
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist

216
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer

217
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
during her three-week vacation.

218
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
She's prepared to clean teeth,

219
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,

220
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.

221
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Outside, there is a line of women

222
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
who have waited several hours to be treated.

223
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The first patient is in excruciating pain

224
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because she has several rotten molars.

225
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.

226
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.

227
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
She risks a lot and she's terrified.

228
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
She doesn't even have the proper instruments,

229
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.

230
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.

231
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.

232
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.

233
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.

234
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,

235
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.

236
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.

237
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.

238
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.

239
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Jenny is horrified at what she has done,

240
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but then the translator explains

241
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.

242
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home

243
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
in time to prepare dinner for him.

244
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Millions of women live like this today.

245
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They are the poorest of the poor.

246
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor,

247
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
they own less than one percent of the world's assets.

248
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
They are paid less than men for the same work

249
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable

250
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
because they have no economic independence,

251
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and they are constantly threatened by exploitation,

252
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
violence and abuse.

253
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It is a fact that giving women education, work,

254
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the ability to control their own income,

255
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
inherit and own property, benefits the society.

256
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
If a woman is empowered,

257
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
her children and her family will be better off.

258
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
If families prosper, the village prospers,

259
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and eventually so does the whole country.

260
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.

261
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren

262
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because they have cut and sold the trees.

263
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them,

264
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
drop by drop.

265
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,

266
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.

267
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The poorest and most backward societies

268
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
are always those that put women down.

269
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments

270
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and also by philanthropy.

271
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
For every dollar given to a women's program,

272
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
20 dollars are given to men's programs.

273
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Women are 51 percent of humankind.

274
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Empowering them will change everything --

275
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
more than technology and design and entertainment.

276
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I can promise you that women working together --

277
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
linked, informed and educated --

278
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.

279
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,

280
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.

281
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.

282
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
What kind of world do we want?

283
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.

284
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?

285
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
We want a world where life is preserved

286
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and the quality of life is enriched for everybody,

287
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
not only for the privileged.

288
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings

289
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
at the UC Berkeley library.

290
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
No museum or gallery in the United States,

291
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,

292
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
has dared to show the paintings because the theme

293
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
is the Abu Ghraib prison.

294
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,

295
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
in the voluminous Botero style.

296
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind

297
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
or my heart.

298
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
What I fear most is power with impunity.

299
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.

300
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
In our species, the alpha males define reality,

301
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality

302
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and follow the rules.

303
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,

304
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and in this case, the trickle-down effect,

305
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
which does not work in economics, works perfectly.

306
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.

307
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.

308
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --

309
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
a woman or a child.

310
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many

311
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
through gender, income, race, and class.

312
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes

313
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
in our civilization.

314
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But for real change, we need feminine energy

315
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
in the management of the world.

316
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
We need a critical number of women in positions of power,

317
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.

318
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.

319
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.

320
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Laughter)

321
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs

322
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and legendary breasts.

323
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts

324
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.

325
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I want to make this world good.

326
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Not better, but to make it good.

327
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --

328
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.

329
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves

330
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and get to work, passionately,

331
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
in creating an almost perfect world.

332
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Thank you.

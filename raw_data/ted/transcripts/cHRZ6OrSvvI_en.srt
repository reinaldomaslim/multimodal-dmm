1
0:00:12.693,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When you grow up in a developing country like India, as I did,

2
0:00:17.754,000 --> 0:00:22,000
you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources

3
0:00:23.107,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and find creative ways to reuse what you already have.

4
0:00:28.127,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Take Mansukh Prajapati, a potter in India.

5
0:00:32.435,000 --> 0:00:37,000
He has created a fridge made entirely of clay

6
0:00:37.977,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that consumes no electricity.

7
0:00:40.275,000 --> 0:00:43,000
He can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days.

8
0:00:44.13,000 --> 0:00:48,000
That's a cool invention, literally.

9
0:00:48.68,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In Africa, if you run out of your cell phone battery, don't panic.

10
0:00:52.906,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You will find some resourceful entrepreneurs

11
0:00:55.92,000 --> 0:00:57,000
who can recharge your cell phone using bicycles.

12
0:00:58.565,000 --> 0:01:,000
And since we are in South America,

13
0:01:00.698,000 --> 0:01:03,000
let's go to Lima in Peru,

14
0:01:03.842,000 --> 0:01:05,000
a region with high humidity

15
0:01:06.466,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that receives only one inch of rainfall each year.

16
0:01:11.23,000 --> 0:01:17,000
An engineering college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard

17
0:01:18.124,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water,

18
0:01:24.787,000 --> 0:01:28,000
generating over 90 liters of water every day.

19
0:01:29.664,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The Peruvians are amazing.

20
0:01:31.751,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They can literally create water out of thin air.

21
0:01:36.432,000 --> 0:01:38,000
For the past seven years,

22
0:01:38.476,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs

23
0:01:42.252,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in India, China, Africa and South America, and they keep amazing me.

24
0:01:48.84,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Many of them did not go to school.

25
0:01:52.041,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They don't invent stuff in big R&D labs.

26
0:01:55.517,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The street is the lab.

27
0:01:59.48,000 --> 0:02:,000
Why do they do that?

28
0:02:01.059,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted,

29
0:02:04.526,000 --> 0:02:05,000
like capital and energy,

30
0:02:06.367,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and basic services like healthcare and education

31
0:02:09.315,000 --> 0:02:12,000
are also scarce in those regions.

32
0:02:12.958,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When external resources are scarce, you have to go within yourself

33
0:02:18.945,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to tap the most abundant resource, human ingenuity,

34
0:02:22.905,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources.

35
0:02:29.7,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In India, we call it Jugaad.

36
0:02:33.986,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Jugaad is a Hindi word

37
0:02:36.162,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that means an improvised fix, a clever solution born in adversity.

38
0:02:42.19,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Jugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect,

39
0:02:46.824,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but they create more value at lower cost.

40
0:02:50.353,000 --> 0:02:53,000
For me, the entrepreneurs who will create Jugaad solutions

41
0:02:53.812,000 --> 0:02:54,000
are like alchemists.

42
0:02:55.786,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They can magically transform adversity into opportunity,

43
0:02:59.849,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and turn something of less value into something of high value.

44
0:03:05.35,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In other words, they mastered the art of doing more with less,

45
0:03:12.318,000 --> 0:03:16,000
which is the essence of frugal innovation.

46
0:03:17.287,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Frugal innovation is the ability to create more economic and social value

47
0:03:22.917,000 --> 0:03:25,000
using fewer resources.

48
0:03:26.277,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Frugal innovation is not about making do; it's about making things better.

49
0:03:33.238,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now I want to show you how, across emerging markets,

50
0:03:38.21,000 --> 0:03:42,000
entrepreneurs and companies are adopting frugal innovation on a larger scale

51
0:03:43.109,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to cost-effectively deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people

52
0:03:47.565,000 --> 0:03:51,000
who may have little income but very high aspirations.

53
0:03:52.96,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Let's first go to China,

54
0:03:55.18,000 --> 0:03:59,000
where the country's largest I.T. service provider, Neusoft,

55
0:03:59.197,000 --> 0:04:01,000
has developed a telemedicine solution

56
0:04:02.03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients

57
0:04:06.722,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in Chinese villages.

58
0:04:08.553,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This solution is based on simple-to-use medical devices

59
0:04:13.198,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics.

60
0:04:18.355,000 --> 0:04:22,000
China desperately needs these frugal medical solutions

61
0:04:22.37,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because by 2050 it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens.

62
0:04:29.568,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now let's go to Kenya,

63
0:04:32.516,000 --> 0:04:37,000
a country where half the population uses M-Pesa, a mobile payment solution.

64
0:04:38.507,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This is a great solution for the African continent

65
0:04:41.247,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because 80 percent of Africans don't have a bank account,

66
0:04:45.332,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but what is exciting is that M-Pesa is now becoming the source

67
0:04:50.031,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of other disruptive business models in sectors like energy.

68
0:04:54.65,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Take M-KOPA, the home solar solution that comes literally in a box

69
0:05:00.468,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that has a solar rooftop panel, three LED lights,

70
0:05:05.463,000 --> 0:05:08,000
a solar radio, and a cell phone charger.

71
0:05:08.687,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The whole kit, though, costs 200 dollars, which is too expensive for most Kenyans,

72
0:05:14.915,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable.

73
0:05:20.858,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Today, you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just 35 dollars,

74
0:05:27.011,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and then pay off the rest by making a daily micro-payment of 45 cents

75
0:05:32.398,000 --> 0:05:34,000
using your mobile phone.

76
0:05:34.79,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Once you've made 365 micro-payments, the system is unlocked,

77
0:05:39.713,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and you own the product and you start receiving clean, free electricity.

78
0:05:45.958,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is an amazing solution for Kenya,

79
0:05:48.28,000 --> 0:05:51,000
where 70 percent of people live off the grid.

80
0:05:52.94,000 --> 0:05:55,000
This shows that with frugal innovation

81
0:05:56.128,000 --> 0:06:,000
what matters is that you take what is most abundant, mobile connectivity,

82
0:06:01.12,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to deal with what is scarce, which is energy.

83
0:06:06.191,000 --> 0:06:1,000
With frugal innovation, the global South is actually catching up

84
0:06:10.761,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and in some cases even leap-frogging the North.

85
0:06:14.288,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Instead of building expensive hospitals, China is using telemedicine

86
0:06:19.48,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to cost-effectively treat millions of patients,

87
0:06:23.109,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and Africa, instead of building banks and electricity grids,

88
0:06:27.799,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is going straight to mobile payments and distributed clean energy.

89
0:06:33.116,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Frugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the North.

90
0:06:39.875,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I live in Silicon Valley,

91
0:06:41.521,000 --> 0:06:44,000
where we keep chasing the next big technology thing.

92
0:06:44.934,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Think of the iPhone 5, 6, then 7, 8.

93
0:06:49.578,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Companies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R&D,

94
0:06:53.967,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products,

95
0:06:58.431,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to differentiate their brands from competition,

96
0:07:01.767,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and they charge customers more money for new features.

97
0:07:05.854,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So the conventional business model in the West is more for more.

98
0:07:13.225,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But sadly, this more for more model is running out of gas, for three reasons:

99
0:07:18.744,000 --> 0:07:22,000
First, a big portion of customers in the West

100
0:07:22.89,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because of the diminishing purchasing power,

101
0:07:25.872,000 --> 0:07:27,000
can no longer afford these expensive products.

102
0:07:28.702,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Second, we are running out of natural water and oil.

103
0:07:33.82,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In California, where I live, water scarcity is becoming a big problem.

104
0:07:37.721,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And third, most importantly,

105
0:07:40.338,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because of the growing income disparity

106
0:07:42.713,000 --> 0:07:45,000
between the rich and the middle class in the West,

107
0:07:45.773,000 --> 0:07:48,000
there is a big disconnect between existing products and services

108
0:07:49.191,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and basic needs of customers.

109
0:07:51.372,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Do you know that today,

110
0:07:53.27,000 --> 0:07:57,000
there are over 70 million Americans today who are underbanked,

111
0:07:58.036,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because existing banking services

112
0:08:01.358,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are not designed to address their basic needs.

113
0:08:05.616,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The prolonged economic crisis in the West is making people think

114
0:08:09.508,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that they are about to lose the high standard of living

115
0:08:12.782,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and face deprivation.

116
0:08:15.638,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West

117
0:08:20.096,000 --> 0:08:23,000
is if we learn to do more with less.

118
0:08:23.597,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The good news is, that's starting to happen.

119
0:08:26.635,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation

120
0:08:30.15,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to create affordable products for Western consumers.

121
0:08:34.515,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Let me give you two examples.

122
0:08:36.945,000 --> 0:08:37,000
When I first saw this building,

123
0:08:38.718,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I told myself it's some kind of postmodern house.

124
0:08:41.875,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Actually, it's a small manufacturing plant set up by Grameen Danone,

125
0:08:47.123,000 --> 0:08:5,000
a joint venture between Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus

126
0:08:50.579,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and the food multinational Danone

127
0:08:52.515,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to make high-quality yogurt in Bangladesh.

128
0:08:55.83,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This factory is 10 percent the size of existing Danone factories

129
0:08:59.774,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and cost much less to build.

130
0:09:02.536,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I guess you can call it a low-fat factory.

131
0:09:06.07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now this factory, unlike Western factories that are highly automated,

132
0:09:10.76,000 --> 0:09:16,000
relies a lot on manual processes in order to generate jobs for local communities.

133
0:09:17.493,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Danone was so inspired by this model

134
0:09:19.769,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that combines economic efficiency and social sustainability,

135
0:09:23.749,000 --> 0:09:27,000
they are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well.

136
0:09:28.121,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, when you see this example,

137
0:09:30.123,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you might be thinking, "Well, frugal innovation is low tech."

138
0:09:33.917,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Actually, no.

139
0:09:35.56,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Frugal innovation is also about making high tech

140
0:09:38.782,000 --> 0:09:41,000
more affordable and more accessible to more people.

141
0:09:41.963,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Let me give you an example.

142
0:09:43.787,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In China, the R&D engineers of Siemens Healthcare

143
0:09:46.993,000 --> 0:09:5,000
have designed a C.T. scanner that is easy enough to be used

144
0:09:51.986,000 --> 0:09:54,000
by less qualified health workers, like nurses and technicians.

145
0:09:55.709,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This device can scan more patients on a daily basis,

146
0:09:59.517,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and yet consumes less energy,

147
0:10:01.792,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which is great for hospitals, but it's also great for patients

148
0:10:05.713,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because it reduces the cost of treatment by 30 percent

149
0:10:10.406,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent.

150
0:10:14.052,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market,

151
0:10:17.674,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but now it's selling like hotcakes in the U.S. and Europe,

152
0:10:21.691,000 --> 0:10:26,000
where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost.

153
0:10:28.122,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But the frugal innovation revolution

154
0:10:30.584,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in the West is actually led by creative entrepreneurs

155
0:10:34.833,000 --> 0:10:36,000
who are coming up with amazing solutions

156
0:10:36.992,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to address basic needs in the U.S. and Europe.

157
0:10:40.175,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Let me quickly give you three examples of startups

158
0:10:43.377,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that personally inspire me.

159
0:10:45.049,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The first one happens to be launched by my neighbor in Silicon Valley.

160
0:10:48.657,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's called gThrive.

161
0:10:50.506,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers

162
0:10:54.337,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that farmers can stick in different parts of the field

163
0:10:57.146,000 --> 0:11:,000
and start collecting detailed information like soil conditions.

164
0:11:01.07,000 --> 0:11:06,000
This dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy

165
0:11:06.085,000 --> 0:11:1,000
while improving quality of the products and the yields,

166
0:11:10.335,000 --> 0:11:14,000
which is a great solution for California, which faces major water shortage.

167
0:11:14.964,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It pays for itself within one year.

168
0:11:17.463,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Second example is Be-Bound, also in Silicon Valley,

169
0:11:21.108,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that enables you to connect to the Internet

170
0:11:23.732,000 --> 0:11:27,000
even in no-bandwidth areas where there's no wi-fi or 3G or 4G.

171
0:11:28.681,000 --> 0:11:29,000
How do they do that?

172
0:11:30.164,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They simply use SMS, a basic technology, but that happens to be the most reliable

173
0:11:36.568,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and most widely available around the world.

174
0:11:38.97,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Three billion people today with cell phones can't access the Internet.

175
0:11:42.28,000 --> 0:11:46,000
This solution can connect them to the Internet in a frugal way.

176
0:11:46.788,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And in France, there is a startup calle Compte Nickel,

177
0:11:53.174,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store

178
0:11:57.167,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products:

179
0:12:01.486,000 --> 0:12:05,000
an international bank account number and an international debit card.

180
0:12:05.716,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They charge a flat annual maintenance fee of just 20 Euros.

181
0:12:10.256,000 --> 0:12:12,000
That means you can do all banking transactions --

182
0:12:12.558,000 --> 0:12:14,000
send and receive money, pay with your debit card --

183
0:12:14.953,000 --> 0:12:16,000
all with no additional charge.

184
0:12:17.321,000 --> 0:12:2,000
This is what I call low-cost banking without the bank.

185
0:12:21.222,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Amazingly, 75 percent of the customers using this service

186
0:12:25.665,000 --> 0:12:29,000
are the middle-class French who can't afford high banking fees.

187
0:12:30.463,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Now, I talked about frugal innovation, initially pioneered in the South,

188
0:12:34.875,000 --> 0:12:36,000
now being adopted in the North.

189
0:12:36.965,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Ultimately, we would like to see

190
0:12:39.333,000 --> 0:12:41,000
developed countries and developing countries

191
0:12:41.678,000 --> 0:12:44,000
come together and co-create frugal solutions

192
0:12:44.743,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that benefit the entire humanity.

193
0:12:47.135,000 --> 0:12:49,000
The exciting news is that's starting to happen.

194
0:12:49.923,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Let's go to Nairobi to find that out.

195
0:12:52.547,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams.

196
0:12:56.167,000 --> 0:12:58,000
When I first saw them, I thought, "Holy cow."

197
0:12:59.082,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Literally, because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi.

198
0:13:04.258,000 --> 0:13:05,000
To ease the situation,

199
0:13:06.186,000 --> 0:13:12,000
the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic,

200
0:13:12.707,000 --> 0:13:16,000
which initially was designed by the Japanese engineers.

201
0:13:17.25,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Unlike in the West, Megaffic doesn't rely on roadside sensors,

202
0:13:22.424,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which are very expensive to install in Nairobi.

203
0:13:24.702,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Instead they process images, traffic data,

204
0:13:28.397,000 --> 0:13:33,000
collected from a small number of low-resolution webcams in Nairobi streets,

205
0:13:34.026,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and then they use analytic software to predict congestion points,

206
0:13:38.216,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and they can SMS drivers alternate routes to take.

207
0:13:42.117,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Granted, Megaffic is not as sexy as self-driving cars,

208
0:13:46.459,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B

209
0:13:51.446,000 --> 0:13:54,000
at least 20 percent faster.

210
0:13:54.696,000 --> 0:14:,000
And earlier this year, UCLA Health launched its Global Lab for Innovation,

211
0:14:01.412,000 --> 0:14:05,000
which seeks to identify frugal healthcare solutions anywhere in the world

212
0:14:06.087,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that will be at least 20 percent cheaper than existing solutions in the U.S.

213
0:14:11.474,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and yet more effective.

214
0:14:13.584,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It also tries to bring together innovators from North and South

215
0:14:18.339,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to cocreate affordable healthcare solutions for all of humanity.

216
0:14:24.027,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world,

217
0:14:28.3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but the question is, how do you go about adopting frugal innovation?

218
0:14:32.328,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Well, I gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world

219
0:14:35.923,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that I want to share with you

220
0:14:37.669,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that you can apply in your own organization

221
0:14:39.94,000 --> 0:14:41,000
to do more with less.

222
0:14:42.649,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The first principle is: Keep it simple.

223
0:14:46.829,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Don't create solutions to impress customers.

224
0:14:49.87,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Make them easy enough to use and widely accessible,

225
0:14:53.121,000 --> 0:14:56,000
like the C.T. scanner we saw in China.

226
0:14:56.128,000 --> 0:15:,000
Second principle: Do not reinvent the wheel.

227
0:15:00.319,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Try to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available,

228
0:15:04.405,000 --> 0:15:07,000
like using mobile telephony to offer clean energy

229
0:15:08.399,000 --> 0:15:11,000
or Mom and Pop stores to offer banking services.

230
0:15:12.091,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Third principle is: Think and act horizontally.

231
0:15:16.381,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Companies tend to scale up vertically

232
0:15:19.567,000 --> 0:15:22,000
by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses,

233
0:15:23.097,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity,

234
0:15:27.253,000 --> 0:15:31,000
you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain

235
0:15:32.052,000 --> 0:15:34,000
with smaller manufacturing and distribution units,

236
0:15:34.906,000 --> 0:15:38,000
like Grameen Bank has shown.

237
0:15:39.164,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity.

238
0:15:44.379,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The North is now learning to do more and better with less

239
0:15:48.684,000 --> 0:15:51,000
as it faces resource constraints.

240
0:15:51.958,000 --> 0:15:56,000
As an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States,

241
0:15:57.321,000 --> 0:16:03,000
my hope is that we transcend this artificial North-South divide

242
0:16:03.702,000 --> 0:16:05,000
so that we can harness the collective ingenuity

243
0:16:06.043,000 --> 0:16:08,000
of innovators from around the world

244
0:16:08.397,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to cocreate frugal solutions

245
0:16:11.021,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world,

246
0:16:15.479,000 --> 0:16:17,000
while preserving our precious planet.

247
0:16:18.358,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Thank you very much.

248
0:16:20.448,000 --> 0:16:23,000
(Applause)

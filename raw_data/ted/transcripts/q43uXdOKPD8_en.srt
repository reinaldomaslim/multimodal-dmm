1
0:00:12.359,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi. I am an architect.

2
0:00:14.008,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I am the only architect in the world

3
0:00:16.456,000 --> 0:00:19,000
making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,

4
0:00:19.772,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and this exhibition is the first one I did

5
0:00:22.338,000 --> 0:00:23,000
using paper tubes.

6
0:00:23.846,000 --> 0:00:27,000
1986, much, much longer before people started talking

7
0:00:28.271,000 --> 0:00:32,000
about ecological issues and environmental issues,

8
0:00:32.474,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I just started testing the paper tube

9
0:00:35.764,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in order to use this as a building structure.

10
0:00:38.499,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building,

11
0:00:43.652,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but this is much stronger than I expected,

12
0:00:46.15,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and also it's very easy to waterproof,

13
0:00:48.362,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and also, because it's industrial material,

14
0:00:50.257,000 --> 0:00:52,000
it's also possible to fireproof.

15
0:00:52.96,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.

16
0:00:56.793,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This is the first temporary building made out of paper.

17
0:00:59.8,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters],

18
0:01:03.87,000 --> 0:01:04,000
there are only 12 tubes with a diameter

19
0:01:05.512,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.

20
0:01:08.282,000 --> 0:01:1,000
As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.

21
0:01:10.902,000 --> 0:01:12,000
In case you're finished with toilet paper,

22
0:01:13.553,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter)

23
0:01:15.873,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So it's very useful.

24
0:01:18.265,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.

25
0:01:22.304,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I was asked to design the building,

26
0:01:24.923,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.

27
0:01:27.717,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes,

28
0:01:32.205,000 --> 0:01:33,000
recyclable paper.

29
0:01:33.932,000 --> 0:01:35,000
My goal of the design is not when it's completed.

30
0:01:36.902,000 --> 0:01:38,000
My goal was when the building was demolished,

31
0:01:38.986,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because each country makes a lot of pavilions

32
0:01:42.962,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste,

33
0:01:46.062,000 --> 0:01:5,000
so my building has to be reused or recycled.

34
0:01:50.743,000 --> 0:01:52,000
After, the building was recycled.

35
0:01:52.846,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So that was the goal of my design.

36
0:01:55.492,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Then I was very lucky to win the competition

37
0:01:58.58,000 --> 0:02:,000
to build the second Pompidou Center in France

38
0:02:01.238,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in the city of Metz.

39
0:02:02.713,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Because I was so poor,

40
0:02:04.209,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I wanted to rent an office in Paris,

41
0:02:06.376,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but I couldn't afford it,

42
0:02:07.893,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so I decided to bring my students to Paris

43
0:02:09.934,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris

44
0:02:13.45,000 --> 0:02:14,000
by ourselves.

45
0:02:14.685,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints

46
0:02:18.014,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to complete the 35-meter-long office.

47
0:02:22.099,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.

48
0:02:25.133,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

49
0:02:29.004,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Thank you. I had one big problem.

50
0:02:31.391,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Because we were part of the exhibition,

51
0:02:33.745,000 --> 0:02:36,000
even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.

52
0:02:37.049,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That was the problem.

53
0:02:39.252,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.

54
0:02:42.02,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's a very popular museum now,

55
0:02:43.974,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and I created a big monument for the government.

56
0:02:47.14,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But then I was very disappointed

57
0:02:49.039,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at my profession as an architect,

58
0:02:51.635,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because we are not helping, we are not working for society,

59
0:02:55.663,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but we are working for privileged people,

60
0:02:58.907,000 --> 0:03:01,000
rich people, government, developers.

61
0:03:02.099,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They have money and power.

62
0:03:04.619,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Those are invisible.

63
0:03:06.416,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So they hire us to visualize their power and money

64
0:03:10.244,000 --> 0:03:12,000
by making monumental architecture.

65
0:03:12.477,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That is our profession, even historically it's the same,

66
0:03:14.642,000 --> 0:03:16,000
even now we are doing the same.

67
0:03:16.994,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society,

68
0:03:20.318,000 --> 0:03:23,000
even though there are so many people

69
0:03:24.32,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who lost their houses by natural disasters.

70
0:03:27.212,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.

71
0:03:30.255,000 --> 0:03:32,000
For example, earthquakes never kill people,

72
0:03:33.24,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but collapse of the buildings kill people.

73
0:03:35.413,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That's the responsibility of architects.

74
0:03:37.453,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Then people need some temporary housing,

75
0:03:39.19,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but there are no architects working there

76
0:03:40.852,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because we are too busy working for privileged people.

77
0:03:44.512,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So I thought, even as architects,

78
0:03:48.391,000 --> 0:03:52,000
we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.

79
0:03:53.147,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We can make it better.

80
0:03:54.939,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So that is why I started working in disaster areas.

81
0:03:58.972,000 --> 0:04:01,000
1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.

82
0:04:02.698,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.

83
0:04:05.43,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Over two million people became refugees.

84
0:04:07.928,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp

85
0:04:11.679,000 --> 0:04:13,000
organized by the U.N.

86
0:04:13.913,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They're so poor, and they are freezing

87
0:04:17.207,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with blankets during the rainy season,

88
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
In the shelters built by the U.N.,

89
0:04:22.085,000 --> 0:04:24,000
they were just providing a plastic sheet,

90
0:04:24.391,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.

91
0:04:28.54,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But over two million people cut trees.

92
0:04:30.306,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It just became big, heavy deforestation

93
0:04:33.097,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and an environmental problem.

94
0:04:34.83,000 --> 0:04:37,000
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.

95
0:04:38.06,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Very expensive, they throw them out for money,

96
0:04:40.347,000 --> 0:04:41,000
then cutting trees again.

97
0:04:42.273,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation

98
0:04:46.294,000 --> 0:04:48,000
using these recycled paper tubes

99
0:04:48.454,000 --> 0:04:5,000
because this is so cheap and also so strong,

100
0:04:51.387,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.

101
0:04:54.134,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test

102
0:04:57.095,000 --> 0:05:02,000
for the durability and moisture and termites, so on.

103
0:05:02.801,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan,

104
0:05:07.381,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we had a big earthquake.

105
0:05:09.174,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Nearly 7,000 people were killed,

106
0:05:11.686,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the city like this Nagata district,

107
0:05:14.677,000 --> 0:05:17,000
all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.

108
0:05:17.995,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees

109
0:05:21.936,000 --> 0:05:23,000
suffering and gathering at a Catholic church --

110
0:05:24.531,000 --> 0:05:25,000
all the building was totally destroyed.

111
0:05:26.45,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests,

112
0:05:29.951,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"

113
0:05:32.569,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?

114
0:05:35.709,000 --> 0:05:37,000
After a fire, what are you proposing?"

115
0:05:37.818,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.

116
0:05:41.446,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I started commuting to Kobe,

117
0:05:43.328,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I met the society of Vietnamese people.

118
0:05:45.957,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets

119
0:05:48.624,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in the park.

120
0:05:49.905,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So I proposed to rebuild. I raised -- did fundraising.

121
0:05:53.147,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I made a paper tube shelter for them,

122
0:05:55.703,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and in order to make it easy to be built by students

123
0:05:58.661,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and also easy to demolish,

124
0:06:00.244,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I used beer crates as a foundation.

125
0:06:03.453,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose,

126
0:06:06.043,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because at that time, the Asahi beer company

127
0:06:08.763,000 --> 0:06:1,000
made their plastic beer crates red,

128
0:06:10.775,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.

129
0:06:13.189,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The color coordination is very important.

130
0:06:15.507,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And also I still remember, we were expecting

131
0:06:18.7,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate,

132
0:06:21.055,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but it came empty. (Laughter)

133
0:06:22.949,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So I remember it was so disappointing.

134
0:06:26.341,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So during the summer with my students,

135
0:06:28.579,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we built over 50 units of the shelters.

136
0:06:30.765,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.

137
0:06:33.536,000 --> 0:06:35,000
He said, "As long as you collect money by yourself,

138
0:06:35.827,000 --> 0:06:37,000
bring your students to build, you can do it."

139
0:06:38.081,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.

140
0:06:40.564,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It was meant to stay there for three years,

141
0:06:44.062,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.

142
0:06:47.36,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake,

143
0:06:51.169,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and we proposed to donate this church,

144
0:06:55.119,000 --> 0:06:56,000
so we dismantled them,

145
0:06:56.72,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.

146
0:06:58.965,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.

147
0:07:02.589,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So this building became a permanent building.

148
0:07:05.08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?

149
0:07:09.729,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Even a building made in paper

150
0:07:11.662,000 --> 0:07:14,000
can be permanent as long as people love it.

151
0:07:15.192,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Even a concrete building can be very temporary

152
0:07:17.488,000 --> 0:07:19,000
if that is made to make money.

153
0:07:19.505,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake,

154
0:07:22.215,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.

155
0:07:26.365,000 --> 0:07:29,000
2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.

156
0:07:30.219,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake

157
0:07:34.3,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.

158
0:07:37.981,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China,

159
0:07:43.432,000 --> 0:07:45,000
nearly 70,000 people were killed,

160
0:07:46.358,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and also especially many of the schools were destroyed

161
0:07:49.443,000 --> 0:07:52,000
because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.

162
0:07:52.893,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.

163
0:07:55.861,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.

164
0:07:59.647,000 --> 0:08:01,000
In one month, we completed nine classrooms,

165
0:08:02.508,000 --> 0:08:03,000
over 500 square meters.

166
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.

167
0:08:08.632,000 --> 0:08:13,000
In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.

168
0:08:14.096,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And this is a very interesting photo:

169
0:08:16.448,000 --> 0:08:18,000
former Prime Minister Berlusconi

170
0:08:19.165,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso --

171
0:08:23.583,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.

172
0:08:27.464,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And they are very kind, affording my model.

173
0:08:32.426,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall,

174
0:08:36.825,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because L'Aquila is very famous for music

175
0:08:39.269,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and all the concert halls were destroyed,

176
0:08:40.694,000 --> 0:08:42,000
so musicians were moving out.

177
0:08:42.826,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So I proposed to the mayor,

178
0:08:44.253,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.

179
0:08:46.488,000 --> 0:08:48,000
He said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it."

180
0:08:49.434,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And I was very lucky.

181
0:08:50.617,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit,

182
0:08:52.918,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and our former prime minister came,

183
0:08:55.024,000 --> 0:08:58,000
so they helped us to collect money,

184
0:08:58.229,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government

185
0:09:01.072,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to rebuild this temporary auditorium.

186
0:09:03.959,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake,

187
0:09:08.679,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but it's impossible to fly over,

188
0:09:10.27,000 --> 0:09:13,000
so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country,

189
0:09:13.287,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to drive six hours to get to Haiti

190
0:09:16.202,000 --> 0:09:19,000
with the local students in Santo Domingo

191
0:09:19.493,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.

192
0:09:22.946,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.

193
0:09:26.559,000 --> 0:09:27,000
After the earthquake and tsunami,

194
0:09:28.434,000 --> 0:09:31,000
people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.

195
0:09:32.221,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But look at this. There's no privacy.

196
0:09:34.122,000 --> 0:09:36,000
People suffer mentally and physically.

197
0:09:36.989,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So we went there to build partitions

198
0:09:40.38,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with all the student volunteers with paper tubes,

199
0:09:43.643,000 --> 0:09:47,000
just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.

200
0:09:47.874,000 --> 0:09:49,000
However, some of the facility authority

201
0:09:50.39,000 --> 0:09:52,000
doesn't want us to do it, because, they said,

202
0:09:52.437,000 --> 0:09:55,000
simply, it's become more difficult to control them.

203
0:09:55.634,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But it's really necessary to do it.

204
0:09:58.116,000 --> 0:10:,000
They don't have enough flat area to build

205
0:10:00.621,000 --> 0:10:03,000
standard government single-story housing like this one.

206
0:10:03.906,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Look at this. Even civil government is doing

207
0:10:06.156,000 --> 0:10:1,000
such poor construction of the temporary housing,

208
0:10:10.285,000 --> 0:10:16,000
so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking,

209
0:10:16.816,000 --> 0:10:19,000
so I thought, we have to make multi-story building

210
0:10:20.085,000 --> 0:10:23,000
because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.

211
0:10:23.11,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.

212
0:10:28.04,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village

213
0:10:31.671,000 --> 0:10:32,000
in Miyagi.

214
0:10:32.991,000 --> 0:10:36,000
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].

215
0:10:37.377,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I used the shipping container

216
0:10:40.103,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and also the students helped us to make

217
0:10:42.556,000 --> 0:10:44,000
all the building furniture

218
0:10:45.354,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to make them comfortable,

219
0:10:47.046,000 --> 0:10:49,000
within the budget of the government

220
0:10:49.321,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but also the area of the house is exactly the same,

221
0:10:53.23,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but much more comfortable.

222
0:10:54.37,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Many of the people want to stay here forever.

223
0:10:57.502,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I was very happy to hear that.

224
0:11:00.064,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.

225
0:11:04.001,000 --> 0:11:07,000
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened,

226
0:11:07.848,000 --> 0:11:08,000
also they had a big earthquake,

227
0:11:09.353,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and many Japanese students were also killed,

228
0:11:11.914,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and the most important cathedral of the city,

229
0:11:14.233,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.

230
0:11:17.004,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.

231
0:11:21.102,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So this is under construction.

232
0:11:23.389,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And I'd like to keep building monuments

233
0:11:26.729,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that are beloved by people.

234
0:11:28.959,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Thank you very much.

235
0:11:30.398,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Applause)

236
0:11:32.334,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Thank you. (Applause)

237
0:11:35.067,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

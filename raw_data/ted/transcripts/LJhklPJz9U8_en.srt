1
0:00:12.448,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm going to go off script

2
0:00:13.715,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and make Chris quite nervous here

3
0:00:15.766,000 --> 0:00:17,000
by making this audience participation.

4
0:00:18.114,000 --> 0:00:21,000
All right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right.

5
0:00:21.297,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand

6
0:00:23.741,000 --> 0:00:27,000
if you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex.

7
0:00:27.797,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Could be the neighbors, hotel room,

8
0:00:30.348,000 --> 0:00:32,000
your parents. Sorry.

9
0:00:32.355,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Okay. Pretty much everybody.

10
0:00:34.107,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now raise your hand if the man was making

11
0:00:35.934,000 --> 0:00:38,000
more noise than the woman.

12
0:00:39.363,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I see one guy there.

13
0:00:41.676,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It doesn't count if it was you, sir.

14
0:00:43.923,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:44.938,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay.

16
0:00:48.448,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Sitting next to a loud guy.

17
0:00:50.524,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now what does this tell us?

18
0:00:52.148,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It tells us that human beings

19
0:00:53.994,000 --> 0:00:54,000
make noise when they have sex,

20
0:00:55.362,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and it's generally the woman who makes more noise.

21
0:00:57.488,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is known as female copulatory vocalization

22
0:01:00.542,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to the clipboard crowd.

23
0:01:01.965,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I wasn't even going to mention this,

24
0:01:03.596,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here,

25
0:01:06.537,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and she is the world's most famous

26
0:01:09.141,000 --> 0:01:1,000
female copulatory vocalizer.

27
0:01:11.09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So I thought, got to talk about that.

28
0:01:13.49,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We'll get back to that a little bit later.

29
0:01:16.203,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Let me start by saying human beings

30
0:01:18.168,000 --> 0:01:2,000
are not descended from apes,

31
0:01:20.269,000 --> 0:01:22,000
despite what you may have heard. We are apes.

32
0:01:22.501,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo

33
0:01:25.337,000 --> 0:01:28,000
than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant,

34
0:01:28.717,000 --> 0:01:31,000
as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books.

35
0:01:31.915,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos

36
0:01:36.11,000 --> 0:01:37,000
than chimps and bonobos are related

37
0:01:37.611,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to any other primate --

38
0:01:39.273,000 --> 0:01:41,000
gorillas, orangutans, what have you.

39
0:01:41.549,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So we're extremely closely related to them,

40
0:01:44.796,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and as you'll see in terms of our behavior,

41
0:01:47.222,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we've got some relationship as well.

42
0:01:49.589,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So what I'm asking today, the question

43
0:01:51.508,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I want to explore with you today is,

44
0:01:54.57,000 --> 0:01:58,000
what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?

45
0:01:58.738,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, since Darwin's day there's been

46
0:02:00.956,000 --> 0:02:01,000
what Cacilda and I have called

47
0:02:02.458,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the standard narrative of human sexual evolution,

48
0:02:05.144,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and you're all familiar with it,

49
0:02:06.698,000 --> 0:02:08,000
even if you haven't read this stuff.

50
0:02:09.261,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The idea is that, as part of human nature,

51
0:02:12.329,000 --> 0:02:13,000
from the beginning of our species' time,

52
0:02:14.318,000 --> 0:02:18,000
men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential

53
0:02:18.812,000 --> 0:02:21,000
by providing them with certain goods and services.

54
0:02:22.207,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status,

55
0:02:25.877,000 --> 0:02:27,000
protection, things like that.

56
0:02:28.508,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And in exchange, women have offered fidelity,

57
0:02:30.843,000 --> 0:02:32,000
or at least a promise of fidelity.

58
0:02:33.221,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship.

59
0:02:37.491,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA, according to this vision. Right?

60
0:02:43.434,000 --> 0:02:46,000
What Cacilda and I have argued is that no,

61
0:02:47.371,000 --> 0:02:49,000
this economic relationship,

62
0:02:49.812,000 --> 0:02:5,000
this oppositional relationship,

63
0:02:51.637,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is actually an artifact of agriculture,

64
0:02:54.262,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest.

65
0:02:57.938,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Anatomically modern human beings

66
0:03:00.105,000 --> 0:03:02,000
have been around for about 200,000 years,

67
0:03:03.104,000 --> 0:03:06,000
so we're talking about five percent, at most,

68
0:03:06.726,000 --> 0:03:09,000
of our time as a modern, distinct species.

69
0:03:10.414,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So before agriculture,

70
0:03:13.948,000 --> 0:03:15,000
before the agricultural revolution,

71
0:03:15.953,000 --> 0:03:17,000
it's important to understand that human beings

72
0:03:18.064,000 --> 0:03:21,000
lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are

73
0:03:21.398,000 --> 0:03:24,000
characterized wherever they're found in the world

74
0:03:24.414,000 --> 0:03:28,000
by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism.

75
0:03:29.005,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They not only share things,

76
0:03:30.873,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they demand that things be shared:

77
0:03:33.382,000 --> 0:03:35,000
meat, shelter, protection, all these things

78
0:03:35.641,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that were supposedly being traded to women

79
0:03:38.65,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for their sexual fidelity, it turns out,

80
0:03:41.48,000 --> 0:03:43,000
are shared widely among these societies.

81
0:03:44.21,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now I'm not saying that our ancestors

82
0:03:46.398,000 --> 0:03:47,000
were noble savages, and I'm not saying

83
0:03:48.359,000 --> 0:03:5,000
modern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either.

84
0:03:51.155,000 --> 0:03:53,000
What I'm saying is that this is simply

85
0:03:53.166,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the best way to mitigate risk

86
0:03:55.606,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in a foraging context.

87
0:03:57.536,000 --> 0:04:,000
And there's really no argument about this among anthropologists.

88
0:04:00.652,000 --> 0:04:04,000
All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality.

89
0:04:05.216,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So we've argued that human sexuality

90
0:04:07.651,000 --> 0:04:11,000
has essentially evolved, until agriculture,

91
0:04:12.135,000 --> 0:04:15,000
as a way of establishing and maintaining

92
0:04:15.281,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the complex, flexible social systems, networks,

93
0:04:19.007,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that our ancestors were very good at,

94
0:04:21.918,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and that's why our species has survived so well.

95
0:04:26.534,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now, this makes some people uncomfortable,

96
0:04:28.751,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and so I always need to take a moment in these talks

97
0:04:31.136,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to say, listen,

98
0:04:32.98,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous,

99
0:04:35.623,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers.

100
0:04:37.958,000 --> 0:04:39,000
There were no strangers. Right?

101
0:04:39.984,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers.

102
0:04:41.828,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You've known these people your entire life.

103
0:04:43.817,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So I'm saying, yes, there were overlapping sexual relationships,

104
0:04:47.276,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships

105
0:04:51.583,000 --> 0:04:54,000
going on at any given moment in their adult lives.

106
0:04:54.97,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers.

107
0:04:57.373,000 --> 0:05:,000
I'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with.

108
0:05:00.484,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I'm not saying there was no pair-bonding going on.

109
0:05:03.389,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive.

110
0:05:06.475,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous --

111
0:05:10.159,000 --> 0:05:12,000
my parents, for example, have been married

112
0:05:12.497,000 --> 0:05:14,000
for 52 years monogamously,

113
0:05:15.005,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad,

114
0:05:17.367,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I don't want to hear about it—

115
0:05:19.714,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying

116
0:05:22.106,000 --> 0:05:23,000
there's anything wrong with this.

117
0:05:23.662,000 --> 0:05:25,000
What I'm saying is that to argue

118
0:05:25.821,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that our ancestors were sexual omnivores

119
0:05:30.495,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is no more a criticism of monogamy

120
0:05:32.782,000 --> 0:05:35,000
than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores

121
0:05:36.25,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is a criticism of vegetarianism.

122
0:05:39.573,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You can choose to be a vegetarian,

123
0:05:41.454,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but don't think that just because you've made that decision,

124
0:05:44.198,000 --> 0:05:46,000
bacon suddenly stops smelling good.

125
0:05:46.99,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Okay? So this is my point.

126
0:05:49.677,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:52.028,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That one took a minute to sink in, huh?

128
0:05:55.649,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Now, in addition to being a great genius,

129
0:05:57.979,000 --> 0:05:59,000
a wonderful man, a wonderful husband,

130
0:06:00.044,000 --> 0:06:01,000
a wonderful father, Charles Darwin

131
0:06:01.824,000 --> 0:06:05,000
was also a world-class Victorian prude.

132
0:06:05.936,000 --> 0:06:06,000
All right? He was perplexed

133
0:06:07.876,000 --> 0:06:09,000
by the sexual swellings of certain primates,

134
0:06:10.486,000 --> 0:06:11,000
including chimps and bonobos,

135
0:06:12.029,000 --> 0:06:14,000
because these sexual swellings tend to provoke

136
0:06:14.567,000 --> 0:06:16,000
many males to mate with the females.

137
0:06:17.159,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So he couldn't understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing

138
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond, right?

139
0:06:24.259,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this,

140
0:06:26.698,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but chimps and bonobos mate

141
0:06:28.646,000 --> 0:06:29,000
one to four times per hour

142
0:06:30.3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
with up to a dozen males per day

143
0:06:33.716,000 --> 0:06:35,000
when they have their sexual swellings.

144
0:06:36.332,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings

145
0:06:38.987,000 --> 0:06:39,000
through 40 percent, roughly,

146
0:06:40.789,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of their menstrual cycle,

147
0:06:42.674,000 --> 0:06:44,000
bonobos 90 percent,

148
0:06:45.374,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and humans are among the only species on the planet

149
0:06:48.796,000 --> 0:06:5,000
where the female is available for sex

150
0:06:50.898,000 --> 0:06:51,000
throughout the menstrual cycle,

151
0:06:52.886,000 --> 0:06:54,000
whether she's menstruating, whether she's post-menopausal,

152
0:06:55.63,000 --> 0:06:56,000
whether she's already pregnant.

153
0:06:56.941,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is vanishingly rare among mammals.

154
0:07:00.785,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality.

155
0:07:04.578,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, Darwin ignored the reflections

156
0:07:07.253,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of the sexual swelling in his own day,

157
0:07:10.821,000 --> 0:07:13,000
as scientists tend to do sometimes.

158
0:07:14.452,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So what we're talking about is sperm competition.

159
0:07:16.957,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now the average human ejaculate has about 300 million sperm cells,

160
0:07:20.367,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so it's already a competitive environment.

161
0:07:22.797,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The question is whether these sperm are competing against other men's sperm

162
0:07:26.03,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or just their own.

163
0:07:27.815,000 --> 0:07:29,000
There's a lot to talk about in this chart.

164
0:07:29.921,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The one thing I'll call your attention to right away

165
0:07:32.096,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human.

166
0:07:36.138,000 --> 0:07:39,000
That indicates female copulatory vocalization.

167
0:07:39.439,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Just look at the numbers.

168
0:07:41.041,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The average human has sex

169
0:07:43.237,000 --> 0:07:46,000
about 1,000 times per birth.

170
0:07:46.879,000 --> 0:07:48,000
If that number seems high for some of you,

171
0:07:49.052,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I assure you it seems low for others in the room.

172
0:07:52.265,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.

173
0:07:55.215,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We don't share it with the other three apes,

174
0:07:57.517,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon,

175
0:07:59.773,000 --> 0:08:,000
who are more typical of mammals,

176
0:08:01.434,000 --> 0:08:04,000
having sex only about a dozen times per birth.

177
0:08:04.626,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face-to-face

178
0:08:08.847,000 --> 0:08:1,000
when both of them are alive.

179
0:08:11.253,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:15.895,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo

181
0:08:19.066,000 --> 0:08:21,000
all have external testicles, which in our book

182
0:08:21.462,000 --> 0:08:24,000
we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage

183
0:08:25.45,000 --> 0:08:27,000
just for beer.

184
0:08:27.71,000 --> 0:08:29,000
If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge

185
0:08:30.436,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in the garage, you expect a party to happen

186
0:08:32.778,000 --> 0:08:33,000
at any moment, and you need to be ready.

187
0:08:34.567,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That's what the external testicles are.

188
0:08:36.722,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They keep the sperm cells cool

189
0:08:39.132,000 --> 0:08:41,000
so you can have frequent ejaculations.

190
0:08:41.35,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I'm sorry. It's true.

191
0:08:45.089,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The human, some of you will be happy to hear,

192
0:08:48.178,000 --> 0:08:5,000
has the largest, thickest penis of any primate.

193
0:08:50.989,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.

194
0:08:53.499,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It goes into anthropology as well.

195
0:08:56.06,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Historical records are full of accounts of people

196
0:08:58.677,000 --> 0:08:59,000
around the world who have sexual practices

197
0:09:00.486,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that should be impossible

198
0:09:02.116,000 --> 0:09:05,000
given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution.

199
0:09:06.042,000 --> 0:09:08,000
These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China.

200
0:09:08.742,000 --> 0:09:1,000
In their society, everyone, men and women,

201
0:09:11.309,000 --> 0:09:12,000
are completely sexually autonomous.

202
0:09:13.05,000 --> 0:09:15,000
There's no shame associated with sexual behavior.

203
0:09:16.009,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Women have hundreds of partners.

204
0:09:18.255,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody gossips. It's not an issue.

205
0:09:21.437,000 --> 0:09:22,000
When the woman becomes pregnant,

206
0:09:23.233,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the child is cared for by her, her sisters, and her brothers.

207
0:09:26.091,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The biological father is a nonissue.

208
0:09:28.93,000 --> 0:09:3,000
On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon,

209
0:09:31.336,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we've got many tribes which practice

210
0:09:34.205,000 --> 0:09:36,000
what anthropologists call partible paternity.

211
0:09:36.937,000 --> 0:09:38,000
These people actually believe --

212
0:09:39.534,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and they have no contact among them,

213
0:09:41.249,000 --> 0:09:42,000
no common language or anything,

214
0:09:42.905,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so it's not an idea that spread,

215
0:09:44.642,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it's an idea that's arisen around the world --

216
0:09:46.779,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they believe that a fetus is literally made

217
0:09:48.936,000 --> 0:09:5,000
of accumulated semen.

218
0:09:51.212,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So a woman who wants to have a child

219
0:09:53.2,000 --> 0:09:54,000
who's smart and funny and strong

220
0:09:55.032,000 --> 0:09:57,000
makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy,

221
0:09:57.163,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the funny guy and the strong guy,

222
0:09:59.107,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to get the essence of each of these men into the baby,

223
0:10:01.331,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and then when the child is born,

224
0:10:03.843,000 --> 0:10:05,000
these different men will come forward

225
0:10:05.985,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and acknowledge their paternity of the child.

226
0:10:08.855,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor

227
0:10:11.693,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in this society.

228
0:10:13.309,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So there are all sorts of examples like this

229
0:10:15.297,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that we go through in the book.

230
0:10:17.747,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Now, why does this matter?

231
0:10:21.207,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Edward Wilson says we need to understand

232
0:10:23.767,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that human sexuality is first a bonding device

233
0:10:26.813,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and only secondarily procreation.

234
0:10:29.648,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I think that's true. This matters because

235
0:10:31.832,000 --> 0:10:34,000
our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict

236
0:10:34.87,000 --> 0:10:36,000
with many aspects of the modern world.

237
0:10:37.457,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The contradictions between what we're told

238
0:10:39.595,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we should feel and what we actually do feel

239
0:10:43.022,000 --> 0:10:48,000
generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering.

240
0:10:48.159,000 --> 0:10:5,000
My hope is that a more accurate,

241
0:10:50.575,000 --> 0:10:52,000
updated understanding of human sexuality

242
0:10:52.95,000 --> 0:10:55,000
will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves,

243
0:10:55.97,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for each other,

244
0:10:57.567,000 --> 0:11:,000
greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations

245
0:11:01.19,000 --> 0:11:06,000
like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions,

246
0:11:06.471,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and that we'll finally put to rest the idea

247
0:11:09.819,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that men have some innate, instinctive right

248
0:11:12.393,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to monitor and control women's sexual behavior.

249
0:11:16.621,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

250
0:11:19.613,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Thank you.

251
0:11:21.767,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And we'll see that it's not only gay people

252
0:11:24.023,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that have to come out of the closet.

253
0:11:25.692,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We all have closets we have to come out of. Right?

254
0:11:29.221,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And when we do come out of those closets,

255
0:11:30.982,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other,

256
0:11:34.541,000 --> 0:11:38,000
our fight is with an outdated, Victorian sense of human sexuality

257
0:11:39.045,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that conflates desire with property rights,

258
0:11:42.6,000 --> 0:11:44,000
generates shame and confusion

259
0:11:45.365,000 --> 0:11:47,000
in place of understanding and empathy.

260
0:11:48.2,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus,

261
0:11:50.916,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because the truth is

262
0:11:52.646,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that men are from Africa

263
0:11:53.983,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and women are from Africa.

264
0:11:55.979,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Thank you.

265
0:11:57.924,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Applause)

266
0:12:06.53,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Christopher Ryan: Thank you.

267
0:12:09.024,000 --> 0:12:1,000
CA: So a question.

268
0:12:10.766,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments

269
0:12:14.665,000 --> 0:12:17,000
about evolutionary history

270
0:12:17.732,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to turn that into what we ought to do today.

271
0:12:20.316,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Someone could give a talk and say,

272
0:12:22.722,000 --> 0:12:24,000
look at us, we've got these really sharp teeth

273
0:12:25.467,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and muscles and a brain that's really good

274
0:12:27.194,000 --> 0:12:28,000
at throwing weapons,

275
0:12:28.755,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and if you look at lots of societies around the world,

276
0:12:31.819,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you'll see very high rates of violence.

277
0:12:34.105,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism,

278
0:12:37.274,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but it's not who you are.

279
0:12:39.418,000 --> 0:12:41,000
How is that different

280
0:12:41.468,000 --> 0:12:44,000
from the talk you gave?

281
0:12:44.833,000 --> 0:12:47,000
CR: Well first of all, the evidence

282
0:12:48.017,000 --> 0:12:5,000
for high levels of violence in prehistory

283
0:12:50.792,000 --> 0:12:52,000
is very debatable.

284
0:12:53.398,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But that's just an example.

285
0:12:55.599,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me,

286
0:12:59.203,000 --> 0:13:01,000
just because we lived a certain way in the past

287
0:13:01.743,000 --> 0:13:04,000
doesn't mean we should live that way now, and I agree with that.

288
0:13:04.942,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Everyone has to respond to the modern world.

289
0:13:07.469,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But the body does have its inherent

290
0:13:11.891,000 --> 0:13:13,000
evolved trajectories.

291
0:13:14.748,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes,

292
0:13:18.228,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but your body will rebel against that. We have appetites.

293
0:13:21.702,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I think it was Schopenhauer who said,

294
0:13:23.39,000 --> 0:13:25,000
a person can do what they want

295
0:13:26.254,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but not want what they want.

296
0:13:28.311,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And so what I'm arguing against

297
0:13:30.034,000 --> 0:13:32,000
is the shame that's associated with desires.

298
0:13:32.498,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife

299
0:13:35.857,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but you still are attracted to other people,

300
0:13:38.067,000 --> 0:13:39,000
there's something wrong with you,

301
0:13:39.566,000 --> 0:13:4,000
there's something wrong with your marriage,

302
0:13:41.503,000 --> 0:13:42,000
something wrong with your partner.

303
0:13:42.963,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I think a lot of families are fractured

304
0:13:44.986,000 --> 0:13:45,000
by unrealistic expectations

305
0:13:46.971,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality.

306
0:13:50.016,000 --> 0:13:51,000
That's what I'm trying to get at.

307
0:13:51.48,000 --> 0:13:53,000
CA: Thank you. Communicated powerfully. Thanks a lot.

308
0:13:53.979,000 --> 0:13:56,000
CR: Thank you, Chris. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There's a man out there, somewhere,

2
0:00:14.88,000 --> 0:00:16,000
who looks a little bit like the actor Idris Elba,

3
0:00:17.88,000 --> 0:00:19,000
or at least he did 20 years ago.

4
0:00:20.28,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I don't know anything else about him,

5
0:00:22.12,000 --> 0:00:23,000
except that he once saved my life

6
0:00:24.04,000 --> 0:00:25,000
by putting his own life in danger.

7
0:00:26.6,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This man ran across four lanes of freeway traffic in the middle of the night

8
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to bring me back to safety

9
0:00:33.8,000 --> 0:00:35,000
after a car accident that could have killed me.

10
0:00:36.6,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And the whole thing left me really shaken up, obviously,

11
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but it also left me with this kind of burning, gnawing need

12
0:00:43.28,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to understand why he did it,

13
0:00:45.76,000 --> 0:00:47,000
what forces within him caused him to make the choice

14
0:00:48.56,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that I owe my life to,

15
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to risk his own life to save the life of a stranger?

16
0:00:54.08,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In other words, what are the causes of his or anybody else's capacity for altruism?

17
0:00:59.84,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But first let me tell you what happened.

18
0:01:01.88,000 --> 0:01:02,000
That night, I was 19 years old

19
0:01:03.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and driving back to my home in Tacoma, Washington,

20
0:01:05.76,000 --> 0:01:06,000
down the Interstate 5 freeway,

21
0:01:07.6,000 --> 0:01:09,000
when a little dog darted out in front of my car.

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I did exactly what you're not supposed to do,

23
0:01:12.52,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which is swerve to avoid it.

24
0:01:14.48,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I discovered why you're not supposed to do that.

25
0:01:17.319,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I hit the dog anyways,

26
0:01:19.08,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and that sent the car into a fishtail,

27
0:01:21.72,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and then a spin across the freeway,

28
0:01:24.32,000 --> 0:01:27,000
until finally it wound up in the fast lane of the freeway

29
0:01:27.92,000 --> 0:01:29,000
faced backwards into oncoming traffic

30
0:01:30.88,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and then the engine died.

31
0:01:33.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I was sure in that moment that I was about to die too,

32
0:01:37.88,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but I didn't

33
0:01:39.12,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because of the actions of that one brave man

34
0:01:41.88,000 --> 0:01:42,000
who must have made the decision

35
0:01:43.4,000 --> 0:01:46,000
within a fraction of a second of seeing my stranded car

36
0:01:46.44,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to pull over and run across four lanes of freeway traffic

37
0:01:50.72,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in the dark

38
0:01:52.68,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to save my life.

39
0:01:54.68,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And then after he got my car working again

40
0:01:57.6,000 --> 0:02:,000
and got me back to safety and made sure I was going to be all right,

41
0:02:01.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
he drove off again.

42
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:04,000
He never even told me his name,

43
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I'm pretty sure I forgot to say thank you.

44
0:02:08.44,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So before I go any further,

45
0:02:10.4,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I really want to take a moment

46
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to stop and say thank you to that stranger.

47
0:02:15.28,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:22.919,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I tell you all of this

49
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree.

50
0:02:28.4,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I became a psychology researcher,

51
0:02:30.04,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others.

52
0:02:34.84,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Where does it come from, and how does it develop,

53
0:02:37.2,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and what are the extreme forms that it can take?

54
0:02:40.12,000 --> 0:02:43,000
These questions are really important to understanding basic aspects

55
0:02:43.32,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of human social nature.

56
0:02:45.32,000 --> 0:02:47,000
A lot of people, and this includes everybody

57
0:02:47.44,000 --> 0:02:49,000
from philosophers and economists to ordinary people

58
0:02:50.36,000 --> 0:02:53,000
believe that human nature is fundamentally selfish,

59
0:02:53.64,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that we're only ever really motivated by our own welfare.

60
0:02:57.84,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But if that's true, why do some people, like the stranger who rescued me,

61
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
do selfless things, like helping other people

62
0:03:04.68,000 --> 0:03:06,000
at enormous risk and cost to themselves?

63
0:03:07.88,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Answering this question

64
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:13,000
requires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism,

65
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and what might make people who engage in such acts

66
0:03:15.72,000 --> 0:03:16,000
different than other people.

67
0:03:17.6,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But until recently, very little work on this topic had been done.

68
0:03:21.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The actions of the man who rescued me

69
0:03:23.76,000 --> 0:03:25,000
meet the most stringent definition of altruism,

70
0:03:26.76,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which is a voluntary, costly behavior

71
0:03:29.4,000 --> 0:03:31,000
motivated by the desire to help another individual.

72
0:03:32.64,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So it's a selfless act intended to benefit only the other.

73
0:03:36.56,000 --> 0:03:38,000
What could possibly explain an action like that?

74
0:03:40.12,000 --> 0:03:41,000
One answer is compassion, obviously,

75
0:03:42.08,000 --> 0:03:43,000
which is a key driver of altruism.

76
0:03:44.52,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But then the question becomes,

77
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
why do some people seem to have more of it than others?

78
0:03:50.12,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people

79
0:03:54.04,000 --> 0:03:56,000
are different in fundamental ways.

80
0:03:57.12,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But to figure out how,

81
0:03:59.04,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I actually started from the opposite end,

82
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
with psychopaths.

83
0:04:04.68,000 --> 0:04:07,000
A common approach to understanding basic aspects of human nature,

84
0:04:07.8,000 --> 0:04:09,000
like the desire to help other people,

85
0:04:09.84,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is to study people in whom that desire is missing,

86
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and psychopaths are exactly such a group.

87
0:04:16.2,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Psychopathy is a developmental disorder

88
0:04:18.6,000 --> 0:04:2,000
with strongly genetic origins,

89
0:04:20.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and it results in a personality that's cold and uncaring

90
0:04:23.64,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior.

91
0:04:28.04,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Once my colleagues and I at the National Institute of Mental Health

92
0:04:31.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
conducted some of the first ever brain imaging research

93
0:04:33.959,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of psychopathic adolescents,

94
0:04:36.12,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and our findings, and the findings of other researchers now,

95
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
have shown that people who are psychopathic

96
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:43,000
pretty reliably exhibit three characteristics.

97
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
First, although they're not generally insensitive to other people's emotions,

98
0:04:49.8,000 --> 0:04:52,000
they are insensitive to signs that other people are in distress.

99
0:04:53.6,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And in particular,

100
0:04:54.84,000 --> 0:04:57,000
they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one.

101
0:04:58.76,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And fearful expressions convey urgent need and emotional distress,

102
0:05:02.48,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help

103
0:05:05.12,000 --> 0:05:06,000
in people who see them,

104
0:05:06.4,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so it makes sense that people who tend to lack compassion

105
0:05:09.12,000 --> 0:05:11,000
also tend to be insensitive to these cues.

106
0:05:12.52,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The part of the brain

107
0:05:13.76,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions

108
0:05:16.68,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is called the amygdala.

109
0:05:17.96,000 --> 0:05:2,000
There are very rare cases of people who lack amygdalas completely,

110
0:05:21.4,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and they're profoundly impaired in recognizing fearful expressions.

111
0:05:25.28,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And whereas healthy adults and children

112
0:05:27.68,000 --> 0:05:29,000
usually show big spikes in amygdala activity

113
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
when they look at fearful expressions,

114
0:05:32.48,000 --> 0:05:35,000
psychopaths' amygdalas are underreactive to these expressions.

115
0:05:35.64,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Sometimes they don't react at all,

116
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which may be why they have trouble detecting these cues.

117
0:05:41.24,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas are smaller than average

118
0:05:44.4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
by about 18 or 20 percent.

119
0:05:46.92,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So all of these findings are reliable and robust,

120
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and they're very interesting.

121
0:05:52.24,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But remember that my main interest

122
0:05:53.92,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is not understanding why people don't care about others.

123
0:05:57.48,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's understanding why they do.

124
0:05:59.88,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So the real question is,

125
0:06:02.2,000 --> 0:06:04,000
could extraordinary altruism,

126
0:06:04.48,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which is the opposite of psychopathy

127
0:06:06.72,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people,

128
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy?

129
0:06:14.2,000 --> 0:06:16,000
A sort of antipsychopathic brain,

130
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:2,000
better able to recognize other people's fear,

131
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
an amygdala that's more reactive to this expression

132
0:06:23.44,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and maybe larger than average as well?

133
0:06:25.92,000 --> 0:06:27,000
As my research has now shown,

134
0:06:27.96,000 --> 0:06:28,000
all three things are true.

135
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And we discovered this

136
0:06:30.72,000 --> 0:06:33,000
by testing a population of truly extraordinary altruists.

137
0:06:33.76,000 --> 0:06:35,000
These are people who have given one of their own kidneys

138
0:06:36.44,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to a complete stranger.

139
0:06:38.6,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery

140
0:06:41.72,000 --> 0:06:43,000
so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed

141
0:06:44.36,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and transplanted into a very ill stranger

142
0:06:46.44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that they've never met and may never meet.

143
0:06:49.04,000 --> 0:06:51,000
"Why would anybody do this?" is a very common question.

144
0:06:52.52,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And the answer may be

145
0:06:53.92,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that the brains of these extraordinary altruists

146
0:06:56.2,000 --> 0:06:57,000
have certain special characteristics.

147
0:06:59.04,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They are better at recognizing other people's fear.

148
0:07:02.28,000 --> 0:07:05,000
They're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress.

149
0:07:05.72,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions.

150
0:07:10.4,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And remember, this is the same part of the brain that we found

151
0:07:13.36,000 --> 0:07:15,000
was underreactive in people who are psychopathic.

152
0:07:15.72,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And finally, their amygdalas are larger than average as well,

153
0:07:18.64,000 --> 0:07:19,000
by about eight percent.

154
0:07:19.88,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So together, what these data suggest

155
0:07:21.64,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is the existence of something like a caring continuum in the world

156
0:07:25.28,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that's anchored at the one end by people who are highly psychopathic,

157
0:07:28.84,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and at the other by people who are very compassionate

158
0:07:31.36,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and driven to acts of extreme altruism.

159
0:07:34.76,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But I should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different

160
0:07:38.72,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is not just that they're more compassionate than average.

161
0:07:41.44,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They are,

162
0:07:42.68,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but what's even more unusual about them

163
0:07:44.6,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is that they're compassionate and altruistic

164
0:07:46.72,000 --> 0:07:48,000
not just towards people who are in their own innermost circle

165
0:07:49.68,000 --> 0:07:5,000
of friends and family. Right?

166
0:07:51.68,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Because to have compassion for people that you love and identify with

167
0:07:54.96,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is not extraordinary.

168
0:07:58.04,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion extends way beyond that circle,

169
0:08:02.24,000 --> 0:08:04,000
even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances

170
0:08:04.48,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to people who are outside their social circle altogether,

171
0:08:07.44,000 --> 0:08:08,000
total strangers,

172
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:1,000
just like the man who rescued me.

173
0:08:11.96,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And I've had the opportunity now to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors

174
0:08:15.48,000 --> 0:08:19,000
how it is that they manage to generate such a wide circle of compassion

175
0:08:19.88,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that they were willing to give a complete stranger their kidney.

176
0:08:23.24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I found it's a really difficult question for them to answer.

177
0:08:26.76,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I say, "How is it that you're willing to do this thing

178
0:08:30.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
when so many other people don't?

179
0:08:32.84,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans

180
0:08:35.28,000 --> 0:08:37,000
who has ever given a kidney to a stranger.

181
0:08:37.92,000 --> 0:08:38,000
What is it that makes you so special?"

182
0:08:40.4,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And what do they say?

183
0:08:43.4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They say, "Nothing.

184
0:08:46.2,000 --> 0:08:47,000
There's nothing special about me.

185
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I'm just the same as everybody else."

186
0:08:51.2,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And I think that's actually a really telling answer,

187
0:08:54.32,000 --> 0:08:57,000
because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don't look like this,

188
0:08:59.24,000 --> 0:09:,000
they look more like this.

189
0:09:01.24,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They have no center.

190
0:09:03.32,000 --> 0:09:05,000
These altruists literally don't think of themselves

191
0:09:05.76,000 --> 0:09:07,000
as being at the center of anything,

192
0:09:08.04,000 --> 0:09:1,000
as being better or more inherently important than anybody else.

193
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
When I asked one altruist why donating her kidney made sense to her,

194
0:09:15.24,000 --> 0:09:17,000
she said, "Because it's not about me."

195
0:09:19.04,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Another said,

196
0:09:20.8,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"I'm not different. I'm not unique.

197
0:09:23.08,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Your study here is going to find out that I'm just the same as you."

198
0:09:26.44,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I think the best description for this amazing lack of self-centeredness

199
0:09:30.56,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is humility,

200
0:09:32.44,000 --> 0:09:35,000
which is that quality that in the words of St. Augustine

201
0:09:35.56,000 --> 0:09:36,000
makes men as angels.

202
0:09:38.12,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And why is that?

203
0:09:39.84,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's because if there's no center of your circle,

204
0:09:42.64,000 --> 0:09:44,000
there can be no inner rings or outer rings,

205
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:47,000
nobody who is more or less worthy of your care and compassion

206
0:09:48.12,000 --> 0:09:49,000
than anybody else.

207
0:09:49.92,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And I think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists

208
0:09:53.44,000 --> 0:09:54,000
from the average person.

209
0:09:55.4,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But I also think that this is a view of the world that's attainable by many

210
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:,000
and maybe even most people.

211
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And I think this because at the societal level,

212
0:10:03.28,000 --> 0:10:06,000
expansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere.

213
0:10:07.92,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The psychologist Steven Pinker and others have shown

214
0:10:10.4,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that all around the world people are becoming less and less accepting

215
0:10:13.68,000 --> 0:10:15,000
of suffering in ever-widening circles of others,

216
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
which has led to declines of all kinds of cruelty and violence,

217
0:10:19.24,000 --> 0:10:22,000
from animal abuse to domestic violence to capital punishment.

218
0:10:23.48,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And it's led to increases in all kinds of altruism.

219
0:10:26.32,000 --> 0:10:29,000
A hundred years ago, people would have thought it was ludicrous

220
0:10:29.44,000 --> 0:10:3,000
how normal and ordinary it is

221
0:10:30.96,000 --> 0:10:33,000
for people to donate their blood and bone marrow

222
0:10:34.28,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to complete strangers today.

223
0:10:36.72,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Is it possible that a hundred years from now

224
0:10:38.84,000 --> 0:10:4,000
people will think that donating a kidney to a stranger

225
0:10:41.44,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is just as normal and ordinary

226
0:10:42.92,000 --> 0:10:45,000
as we think donating blood and bone marrow is today?

227
0:10:45.96,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Maybe.

228
0:10:47.8,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So what's at the root of all these amazing changes?

229
0:10:50.72,000 --> 0:10:51,000
In part it seems to be

230
0:10:52.52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
increases in wealth and standards of living.

231
0:10:56.6,000 --> 0:10:58,000
As societies become wealthier and better off,

232
0:10:59.36,000 --> 0:11:01,000
people seem to turn their focus of attention outward,

233
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and as a result, all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases,

234
0:11:05.88,000 --> 0:11:09,000
from volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations.

235
0:11:11.44,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But all of these changes also yield

236
0:11:14.44,000 --> 0:11:17,000
a strange and paradoxical result,

237
0:11:17.68,000 --> 0:11:2,000
which is that even as the world is becoming a better and more humane place,

238
0:11:21.24,000 --> 0:11:22,000
which it is,

239
0:11:22.48,000 --> 0:11:24,000
there's a very common perception that it's becoming worse

240
0:11:25.2,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and more cruel, which it's not.

241
0:11:28.08,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And I don't know exactly why this is,

242
0:11:29.92,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but I think it may be that we now just know so much more

243
0:11:33.52,000 --> 0:11:36,000
about the suffering of strangers in distant places,

244
0:11:36.72,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and so we now care a lot more

245
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
about the suffering of those distant strangers.

246
0:11:42.24,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But what's clear is the kinds of changes we're seeing show

247
0:11:45.96,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that the roots of altruism and compassion

248
0:11:48.44,000 --> 0:11:51,000
are just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence,

249
0:11:51.48,000 --> 0:11:52,000
maybe even more so,

250
0:11:53.2,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and while some people do seem to be inherently more sensitive

251
0:11:57.28,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to the suffering of distant others,

252
0:11:59.4,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I really believe that the ability to remove oneself

253
0:12:02.2,000 --> 0:12:03,000
from the center of the circle

254
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and expand the circle of compassion outward to include even strangers

255
0:12:08.08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
is within reach for almost everyone.

256
0:12:12.08,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Thank you.

257
0:12:13.32,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
This is me. My name is Ben Saunders.

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I specialize in dragging heavy things

3
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
around cold places.

4
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
On May 11th last year,

5
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I stood alone at the North geographic Pole.

6
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I was the only human being in an area

7
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
one-and-a-half times the size of America,

8
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
five-and-a-half thousand square miles.

9
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest.

10
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
12 people have stood on the moon.

11
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Including me, only four people

12
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
have skied solo to the North Pole.

13
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I think the reason for that --

14
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
-- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's --

16
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
well, it's as Chris said, bonkers.

17
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's a journey that is right at the limit

18
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of human capability.

19
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons

20
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
back to back. 800 miles in 10 weeks.

21
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I was dragging all the food I needed,

22
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the supplies, the equipment, sleeping bag,

23
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
one change of underwear -- everything I needed for nearly three months.

24
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
What we're going to try and do today, in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left,

26
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is to try and answer three questions. The first one is, why?

27
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The second one is,

28
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
how do you go to the loo at minus 40?

29
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"Ben, I've read somewhere that at minus 40,

30
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature?"

31
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end.

32
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Third one: how do you top that? What's next?

33
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It all started back in 2001.

34
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap.

35
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This was like my polar apprenticeship.

36
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here,

37
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Severnaya Zemlya, to the North Pole.

38
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole,

39
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea.

40
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is about as good as maps get,

41
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and to reach it you've got to ski literally

42
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
over the frozen crust,

43
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean.

44
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I'd spoken to all the experts.

45
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts.

46
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But I realized on the morning of day one

47
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that I had no idea exactly

48
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
what I'd let myself in for.

49
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I was 23 years old. No one my age

50
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
had attempted anything like this,

51
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and pretty quickly, almost everything

52
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that could have gone wrong did go wrong.

53
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We were attacked by a polar bear on day two.

54
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I had frostbite in my left big toe.

55
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight.

56
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Some very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions.

57
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We had

58
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
decidedly low-tech communications.

59
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio.

60
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent.

61
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
There's a wire dangling down either side.

62
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
That was our HF radio antenna.

63
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We had less than two hours

64
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
two-way communication with the outside world in two months.

65
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Ultimately, we ran out of time.

66
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left

67
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time.

68
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt;

69
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio,

70
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and they said, "Look boys, you've run out of time.

71
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We've got to pick you up."

72
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly.

73
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I was a failure.

74
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The one goal, the one dream I'd had

75
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for as long as I could remember -- I hadn't even come close.

76
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And skiing along that first trip, I had two

77
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind

78
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going.

79
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The first one was reaching the Pole itself.

80
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I could see vividly, I suppose,

81
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
being filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background,

82
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind.

83
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know --

84
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
ah, glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo.

85
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The second video clip

86
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport,

87
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I could see again, vividly,

88
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the camera flashbulbs going off,

89
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the paparazzi, the autograph hunters,

90
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal.

91
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And of course, neither of these things happened.

92
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money

93
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard

94
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of this expedition.

95
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there;

96
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack --

97
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
-- and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum.

99
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I was physically exhausted,

100
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
mentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure.

101
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition,

102
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and lying on my mum's sofa,

103
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
day in day out, watching daytime TV.

104
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
My brother sent me a text message, an SMS --

105
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
it was a quote from the "Simpsons." It said,

106
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"You tried your hardest and failed miserably.

107
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The lesson is: don't even try."

108
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

109
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa,

110
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and start planning another expedition. This time,

111
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I wanted to go right across, on my own this time,

112
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from Russia, at the top of the map,

113
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is,

114
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and then on to Canada.

115
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:04,000
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.

116
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Two Norwegians did it as a team in 2000. No one's done it solo.

117
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Very famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer,

118
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Reinhold Messner, tried it in 1995,

119
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and he was rescued after a week.

120
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
He described this expedition as 10 times

121
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as dangerous as Everest.

122
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at,

123
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece,

124
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
let alone make it across to Canada,

125
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I had to take a radical approach.

126
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This meant everything from perfecting the

127
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
sawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush,

128
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists

129
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in developing a completely new,

130
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch:

131
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
6,000 calories a day.

132
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And the expedition started in February last year.

133
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Big support team. We had a film crew,

134
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a couple of logistics people with us,

135
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
my girlfriend, a photographer.

136
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow.

137
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk,

138
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir,

139
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
spelled K-R-A-S.

140
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane

141
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to fly us up to a town called Khatanga,

142
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
which was the sort of last bit of civilization.

143
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Our cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times,

144
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
actually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take,

145
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan, replied,

146
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
"Six hours -- if we live."

147
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We got to Khatanga.

149
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world,

150
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but you can see it from there.

151
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

152
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for 10 days.

153
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between

154
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter,

155
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
so we were stuck. We couldn't move.

156
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Finally, morning of day 11, we got the all-clear,

157
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:54,000
loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem --

158
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice.

159
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming,

160
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
photography; while the helicopter was still there,

161
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I did an interview on the satellite phone;

162
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter,

163
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:11,000
wham, the door closed, and I was alone.

164
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice.

165
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
All I could think about was running back up to the door,

166
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
banging on the door, and saying, "Look guys,

167
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I haven't quite thought this through."

168
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

169
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
To make things worse, you can just see the white dot

170
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
up at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon.

171
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Because we'd been held up in Russia, of course,

172
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides;

173
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea,

174
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
high and low tides generally mean

175
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that interesting things are going to happen -- the ice is going to start moving around a bit.

176
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I was, you can see there, pulling two sledges.

177
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Grand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel,

178
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
180 kilos -- that's almost exactly 400 pounds.

179
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:53,000
When the ice was flat or flattish,

180
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I could just about pull both.

181
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
When the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell.

182
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one.

183
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice --

184
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean,

185
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the wind and the tides.

186
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:12,000
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.

187
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting.

188
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I was skiing into headwinds for nine

189
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year,

190
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and I was drifting backwards most of the time.

191
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:26,000
My record was minus 2.5 miles.

192
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours,

193
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
put the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back

194
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
than when I'd started.

195
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice.

196
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Video): So it's day 22.

197
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I'm lying in the tent, getting ready to go.

198
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The weather is just appalling --

199
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
oh, drifted back about five miles

200
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in the last -- last night.

201
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Later in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice.

202
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It was a lack of ice -- open water.

203
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming.

204
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve.

205
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
This was my little bit of bio-mimicry.

206
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.

207
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
If they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it.

208
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway --

209
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
based on a sort of survival suit --

210
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear --

211
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens,

212
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it would pull up around my face, and seal pretty tightly around my face.

213
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And this meant I could ski

214
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
over very thin ice,

215
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world.

216
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It also meant, if the worst came to the worst,

217
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I could actually jump in and swim across

218
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and drag the sledge over after me.

219
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Some pretty radical technology,

220
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
a radical approach --but it worked perfectly.

221
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Another exciting thing we did last year

222
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:45,000
was with communications technology.

223
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
In 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition --

224
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
there was -- one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees.

225
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
He said, "The explorers of 2012,

226
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
if there is anything left to explore,

227
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones

228
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:02,000
fitted with wireless telescopes."

229
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Well, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone,

230
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Iridium satellite phone.

231
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.

232
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice,

233
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I was blogging live from my tent,

234
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
sending back a little diary piece,

235
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
sending back information on the distance I'd covered --

236
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the ice conditions, the temperature --

237
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and a daily photo.

238
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Remember, 2001,

239
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world.

240
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Last year, blogging live from an expedition

241
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest.

242
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating

243
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
in what's called a whiteout.

244
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:41,000
When you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up.

245
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
You can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow

246
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
ribbon tied to one of my ski poles.

247
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I'd navigate using the direction of the wind.

248
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.

249
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May.

250
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It took me 68 days to get there from Russia,

251
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and there is nothing there.

252
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Laughter).

253
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there,

254
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting.

255
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Stick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland.

256
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I knew this, but I was expecting something.

257
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Strange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage,

258
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
a lot of open water around, and

259
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
of course, elated that I'd got there under my own steam,

260
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but starting to really realize

261
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada,

262
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
which was still 400 miles away,

263
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
were slim at best.

264
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The only proof I've got that I was there

265
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget.

266
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
You can just see --

267
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
there's a nine and a string of zeros here.

268
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole.

269
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece.

270
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out.

271
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I warmed the battery up in my armpit.

272
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum.

273
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor.

274
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I got three voicemails.

275
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Laughter)

276
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Video): Ninety.

277
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's a special feeling.

278
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
The entire planet

279
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is rotating

280
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
beneath my feet.

281
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The -- the whole world underneath me.

282
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket.

283
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
She started crying. She asked me to call her back.

284
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Laughter)

285
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I skied on for a week past the Pole.

286
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could

287
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
before conditions just got too dangerous to continue.

288
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This was the last day I had on the ice.

289
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
When I spoke to the -- my project management team,

290
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
they said, "Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous.

291
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
There are huge areas of open water just south of your position.

292
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We'd like to pick you up.

293
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Ben, could you please look for an airstrip?"

294
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
This was the view outside my tent

295
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:,000
when I had this fateful phone call.

296
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said,

297
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of

298
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:07,000
flat, thick safe ice."

299
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The only bit of ice I could find --

300
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip --

301
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
was exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis.

302
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that.

303
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I thought, it'll have to do.

304
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

305
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing --

306
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
the plane actually passed over four times,

307
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all.

308
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
The pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy

309
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy.

310
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment.

311
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy.

312
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type.

313
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The plane taxied up to where I was standing.

314
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, "Hi, my name is Troy."

315
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Laughter).

316
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The co-pilot was a lady called Monica.

317
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper.

318
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
They were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day.

319
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice;

320
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
we took a few photos. He

321
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
climbed up the ladder. He said, "Just -- just get in the back."

322
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:12,000
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front,

323
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and I climbed in the back.

324
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Laughter)

325
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Taxied up and down the runway a few times,

326
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
just to flatten it out a bit, and he said, "Right, I'm going to --

327
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I'm going to give it a go." And he --

328
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time.

329
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
He put his hand on the throttle.

330
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit.

331
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle.

332
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his.

333
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I thought, "God, here we go. We're, we're -- this is all or nothing."

334
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off.

335
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:41,000
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway,

336
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
banking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls,

337
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and he just took one hand off, reached back,

338
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit,

339
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and it was the "fasten seat belt" sign you can see on the wall.

340
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

341
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And only from the air did I see the big picture.

342
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time,

343
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.

344
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip.

345
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I mean, it really was starting to break up.

346
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Why? I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense.

347
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I'm not skiing along drawing maps;

348
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:16,000
everyone knows where the North Pole is.

349
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip.

350
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop.

351
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:24,000
For me, this is about exploring human limits,

352
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
about exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology

353
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and of technology. They're the things that excite me.

354
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And it's also about potential, on a personal level.

355
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
This, for me, is a chance to explore the limits --

356
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
really push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch.

357
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life

358
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:45,000
just scratching the surface of their potential,

359
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
just doing three or four or five percent

360
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of what they're truly capable of. So,

361
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
on a wider scale, I hope that this journey

362
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
was a chance to inspire other people

363
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
to think about what they want to do

364
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
with their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time

365
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
we each have on this planet.

366
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:05,000
That's as close as I can come to summing that up.

367
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
The next question is, how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40?

368
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:12,000
The answer, of course, to which is a trade secret --

369
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and the last question,

370
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:17,000
what's next? As quickly as possible,

371
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:2,000
if I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail.

372
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
What's next:

373
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Antarctica.

374
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:27,000
It's the coldest, highest,

375
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
windiest and driest continent on Earth.

376
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Late 1911, early 1912,

377
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
there was a race to be the first

378
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:38,000
to the South Pole: the heart of the Antarctic continent.

379
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
If you include the coastal ice shelves, you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf --

380
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
it's the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France.

381
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Antarctica, if you include the ice shelves,

382
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:49,000
is twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place.

383
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen,

384
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies --

385
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott.

386
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors

387
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and a few dogs, all of which went wrong,

388
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot.

389
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:07,000
They got to the Pole late January 1912

390
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:1,000
to find a Norwegian flag already there.

391
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
There was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king.

392
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And they turned around, headed back to the coast,

393
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and all five of them died on the return journey.

394
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Since then, no one has ever skied --

395
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:23,000
this was 93 years ago -- since then, no one has ever skied

396
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:26,000
from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back.

397
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about

398
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:3,000
is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles

399
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:33,000
or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing --

400
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan.

401
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Two of us are doing it.

402
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:39,000
That's pretty much it.

403
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:43,000
One final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is --

404
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:46,000
is, I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten --

405
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:49,000
but I have a -- I have a school report. I was 13 years old,

406
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:51,000
and it's framed above my desk at home. It says,

407
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:54,000
"Ben lacks sufficient impetus

408
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to achieve anything worthwhile."

409
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:58,000
(Laughter)

410
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:01,000
(Applause)

411
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I think if I've learned anything, it's this: that no one else

412
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:05,000
is the authority on your potential.

413
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:08,000
You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of.

414
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's my story.

415
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Thank you very much.

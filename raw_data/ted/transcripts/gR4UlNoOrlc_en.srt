1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In fact, mostly now in other things.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
One thing is distant relationships among human languages.

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
from any long-distance relationships, big groupings,

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
groupings that go back a long time,

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
longer than the familiar families.

9
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank.

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians,

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow,

12
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I would love to see where that leads.

13
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Does it really lead to a single ancestor

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
some 20, 25,000 years ago?

15
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor,

16
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
when there was presumably a competition among many languages?

17
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?

18
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?

19
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?

20
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older

21
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures

22
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe,

23
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.

24
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.

25
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.

26
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most

27
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps

28
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years,

29
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck.

30
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.

31
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
You may just know more about everything than anyone.

32
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.

33
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000

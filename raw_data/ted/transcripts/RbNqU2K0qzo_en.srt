1
0:00:12.68,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the Earth.

2
0:00:18.84,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is a tapir.

3
0:00:20.96,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now this, this is a baby tapir,

4
0:00:24.64,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom.

5
0:00:28.6,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:31,000
By far.

7
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There is no competition here.

8
0:00:35.52,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I have dedicated the past 20 years of my life

9
0:00:38.24,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil,

10
0:00:41.44,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and it has been absolutely amazing.

11
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But at the moment, I've been thinking really, really hard

12
0:00:48.68,000 --> 0:00:5,000
about the impact of my work.

13
0:00:51.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I've been questioning myself about the real contributions I have made

14
0:00:55.24,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the conservation of these animals I love so much.

15
0:00:58.8,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Am I being effective

16
0:01:00.68,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in safeguarding their survival?

17
0:01:03.68,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Am I doing enough?

18
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I guess the big question here is,

19
0:01:08.36,000 --> 0:01:13,000
am I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation,

20
0:01:13.76,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or am I just documenting their extinction?

21
0:01:17.76,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The world is facing so many different conservation crises.

22
0:01:21.72,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We all know that. It's all over the news every day.

23
0:01:25.08,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Tropical forests and other ecosystems are being destroyed,

24
0:01:29.4,000 --> 0:01:33,000
climate change, so many species on the brink of extinction:

25
0:01:33.68,000 --> 0:01:38,000
tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.

26
0:01:40.24,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This is the lowland tapir, the tapir species I work with,

27
0:01:43.96,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the largest terrestrial mammal of South America.

28
0:01:47.12,000 --> 0:01:49,000
They're massive. They're powerful.

29
0:01:49.68,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos.

30
0:01:52.24,000 --> 0:01:54,000
That's half the size of a horse.

31
0:01:54.36,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They're gorgeous.

32
0:01:56.2,000 --> 0:02:,000
Tapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon,

33
0:02:01.12,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and they absolutely need large patches of habitat

34
0:02:05.6,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and survive.

35
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But their habitat is being destroyed,

36
0:02:14.12,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution.

37
0:02:19.64,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And you see, this is very, very unfortunate

38
0:02:23.4,000 --> 0:02:27,000
because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found.

39
0:02:27.8,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They're herbivores.

40
0:02:29.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Fifty percent of their diet consists of fruit,

41
0:02:32.56,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and when they eat the fruit, they swallow the seeds,

42
0:02:35.48,000 --> 0:02:38,000
which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces.

43
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They play this major role in shaping and maintaining

44
0:02:43.68,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the structure and diversity of the forest,

45
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and for that reason, tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest.

46
0:02:53.32,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Isn't that amazing?

47
0:02:55.08,000 --> 0:02:56,000
If you think about it,

48
0:02:56.92,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect

49
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
biodiversity as a whole.

50
0:03:02.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I started my tapir work in 1996, still very young, fresh out of college,

51
0:03:08.84,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and it was a pioneer research and conservation program.

52
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:15,000
At that point, we had nearly zero information about tapirs,

53
0:03:15.56,000 --> 0:03:18,000
mostly because they're so difficult to study.

54
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:22,000
They're nocturnal, solitary, very elusive animals,

55
0:03:23.44,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and we got started getting very basic data about these animals.

56
0:03:28.64,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But what is it that a conservationist does?

57
0:03:32.52,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Well, first, we need data.

58
0:03:34.8,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We need field research.

59
0:03:36.4,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We need those long-term datasets to support conservation action,

60
0:03:41.04,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and I told you tapirs are very hard to study,

61
0:03:44.08,000 --> 0:03:47,000
so we have to rely on indirect methods to study them.

62
0:03:48.04,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We have to capture and anesthetize them

63
0:03:50.76,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so that we can install GPS collars around their necks

64
0:03:54.24,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and follow their movements,

65
0:03:55.92,000 --> 0:03:59,000
which is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world.

66
0:04:00.36,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And then we can gather information about how they use space,

67
0:04:04.32,000 --> 0:04:06,000
how they move through the landscape,

68
0:04:06.4,000 --> 0:04:07,000
what are their priority habitats,

69
0:04:08.4,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and so much more.

70
0:04:10.48,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Next, we must disseminate what we learn.

71
0:04:14.44,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We have to educate people about tapirs

72
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and how important these animals are.

73
0:04:19.8,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And it's amazing how many people around the world

74
0:04:23.44,000 --> 0:04:25,000
do not know what a tapir is.

75
0:04:26.28,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In fact, many people think this is a tapir.

76
0:04:30.92,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Let me tell you, this is not a tapir.

77
0:04:33.44,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:34.88,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This is a giant anteater.

79
0:04:36.84,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.

80
0:04:42.44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And then next we have to provide training, capacity building.

81
0:04:47.2,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future.

82
0:04:51.68,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We are losing several conservation battles,

83
0:04:54.76,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and we need more people doing what we do,

84
0:04:57.24,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and they need the skills, and they need the passion to do that.

85
0:05:01.64,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Ultimately, we conservationists,

86
0:05:04.2,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we must be able to apply our data,

87
0:05:06.84,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to apply our accumulated knowledge

88
0:05:09.08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to support actual conservation action.

89
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Our first tapir program

90
0:05:15.04,000 --> 0:05:17,000
took place in the Atlantic Forest

91
0:05:17.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in the eastern part of Brazil,

92
0:05:19.48,000 --> 0:05:22,000
one of the most threatened biomes in the world.

93
0:05:22.88,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The destruction of the Atlantic Forest

94
0:05:25.08,000 --> 0:05:27,000
began in the early 1500s,

95
0:05:27.32,000 --> 0:05:29,000
when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil,

96
0:05:30.12,000 --> 0:05:34,000
beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America.

97
0:05:34.56,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This forest was almost completely cleared

98
0:05:37.88,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching and the construction of cities,

99
0:05:43.12,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest

100
0:05:46.6,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is still left standing.

101
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And tapirs are found in very, very small, isolated, disconnected populations.

102
0:05:55.2,000 --> 0:05:59,000
In the Atlantic Forest, we found out that tapirs move through open areas

103
0:05:59.88,000 --> 0:06:01,000
of pastureland and agriculture

104
0:06:02.24,000 --> 0:06:06,000
going from one patch of forest to patch of forest.

105
0:06:06.48,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So our main approach in this region

106
0:06:09.04,000 --> 0:06:13,000
was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places

107
0:06:13.44,000 --> 0:06:15,000
for the establishment of wildlife corridors

108
0:06:16.44,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in between those patches of forest,

109
0:06:19.12,000 --> 0:06:21,000
reconnecting the habitat

110
0:06:21.2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely.

111
0:06:25.96,000 --> 0:06:27,000
After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,

112
0:06:28.72,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in 2008, we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the Pantanal

113
0:06:33.76,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in the western part of Brazil

114
0:06:35.76,000 --> 0:06:38,000
near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.

115
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world,

116
0:06:44.6,000 --> 0:06:45,000
an incredible place

117
0:06:46.08,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America.

118
0:06:50.76,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And working in the Pantanal has been extremely refreshing

119
0:06:55.28,000 --> 0:06:58,000
because we found large, healthy tapir populations in the area,

120
0:06:59.28,000 --> 0:07:,000
and we have been able to study tapirs

121
0:07:01.24,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in the most natural conditions we'll ever find,

122
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:06,000
very much free of threats.

123
0:07:08.28,000 --> 0:07:12,000
In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars, we are using another technique:

124
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:14,000
camera traps.

125
0:07:14.24,000 --> 0:07:16,000
This camera is equipped with a movement sensor

126
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it.

127
0:07:20.2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So thanks to these amazing devices,

128
0:07:22.68,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we have been able to gather precious information

129
0:07:25.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
about tapir reproduction and social organization

130
0:07:28.88,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which are very important pieces of the puzzle

131
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:35,000
when you're trying to develop those conservation strategies.

132
0:07:35.56,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And right now, 2015, we are expanding our work once again

133
0:07:40.28,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to the Brazilian Cerrado,

134
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of Brazil.

135
0:07:46.36,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country,

136
0:07:53.28,000 --> 0:07:55,000
where natural habitat and wildlife populations

137
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:,000
are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats,

138
0:08:00.12,000 --> 0:08:02,000
including once again cattle ranching,

139
0:08:02.72,000 --> 0:08:04,000
large sugarcane and soybean plantations,

140
0:08:05.48,000 --> 0:08:08,000
poaching, roadkill, just to name a few.

141
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And somehow, tapirs are still there,

142
0:08:12.64,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which gives me a lot of hope.

143
0:08:15.08,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado

144
0:08:19.6,000 --> 0:08:21,000
was a bit of a slap in the face.

145
0:08:22.48,000 --> 0:08:23,000
When you drive around

146
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and you find dead tapirs along the highways

147
0:08:27.8,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations

148
0:08:32.84,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where they shouldn't be,

149
0:08:34.88,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes

150
0:08:39.12,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because their families poach and eat them,

151
0:08:42.52,000 --> 0:08:44,000
it really breaks your heart.

152
0:08:46.039,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The situation in the Cerrado made me realize --

153
0:08:49.28,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it gave me the sense of urgency.

154
0:08:52.24,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I am swimming against the tide.

155
0:08:54.559,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It made me realize that despite two decades of hard work

156
0:08:58.24,000 --> 0:09:01,000
trying to save these animals, we still have so much work to do

157
0:09:01.8,000 --> 0:09:04,000
if we are to prevent them from disappearing.

158
0:09:04.88,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We have to find ways to solve all these problems.

159
0:09:08.84,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We really do, and you know what?

160
0:09:10.72,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We really came to a point in the conservation world

161
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
where we have to think out of the box.

162
0:09:16.92,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now.

163
0:09:20.68,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I told you, roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado,

164
0:09:24.6,000 --> 0:09:27,000
so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers

165
0:09:28.04,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.

166
0:09:30.88,000 --> 0:09:32,000
These are the same stickers used on big trucks

167
0:09:33.24,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to avoid collision.

168
0:09:34.88,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Tapirs cross the highways after dark,

169
0:09:38.12,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing

170
0:09:43.32,000 --> 0:09:44,000
crossing the highway,

171
0:09:44.76,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and maybe they will slow down a little bit.

172
0:09:48.32,000 --> 0:09:5,000
For now, this is just a crazy idea.

173
0:09:50.92,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We don't know. We'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill.

174
0:09:55.6,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But the point is, maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done.

175
0:10:00.92,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And although I'm struggling with all these questions

176
0:10:04.68,000 --> 0:10:06,000
in my mind right now,

177
0:10:07.48,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I have a pact with tapirs.

178
0:10:10.4,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I know in my heart

179
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that tapir conservation is my cause.

180
0:10:15.12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This is my passion.

181
0:10:16.84,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I am not alone.

182
0:10:18.4,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I have this huge network of supporters behind me,

183
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and there is no way I'm ever going to stop.

184
0:10:25.2,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I will continue doing this, most probably for the rest of my life.

185
0:10:29.6,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And I'll keep doing this for Patrícia, my namesake,

186
0:10:33.92,000 --> 0:10:36,000
one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the Atlantic Forest

187
0:10:37.72,000 --> 0:10:39,000
many, many years ago;

188
0:10:39.84,000 --> 0:10:43,000
for Rita and her baby Vincent in the Pantanal.

189
0:10:44.4,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I'll keep doing this for Ted, a baby tapir we captured

190
0:10:48.52,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in December last year also in the Pantanal.

191
0:10:51.96,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And I will keep doing this

192
0:10:54.08,000 --> 0:10:57,000
for the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet

193
0:10:57.76,000 --> 0:10:58,000
over the years

194
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and the many others I know I will encounter in the future.

195
0:11:02.56,000 --> 0:11:05,000
These animals deserve to be cared for.

196
0:11:05.92,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They need me. They need us.

197
0:11:08.92,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And you know? We human beings deserve to live in a world

198
0:11:13.92,000 --> 0:11:16,000
where we can get out there and see and benefit from

199
0:11:17.84,000 --> 0:11:18,000
not only tapirs

200
0:11:19.52,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but all the other beautiful species,

201
0:11:22.36,000 --> 0:11:24,000
now and in the future.

202
0:11:25.2,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Thank you so much.

203
0:11:27.32,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Applause)

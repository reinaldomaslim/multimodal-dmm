0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Last year here at TED

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I asked you to give me your data,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to put your data on the web, on the basis

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that if people put data onto the web --

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
government data, scientific data, community data,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
whatever it is -- it will be used by other people

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to do wonderful things, in ways

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that they never could have imagined.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So, today I'm back just to show you a few things,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to show you, in fact, there is

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
an open data movement afoot,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
now, around the world.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The cry of "Raw data now!"

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
which I made people make in the auditorium,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
was heard around the world.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So, let's roll the video.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED --

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
blogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is,

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
it's about bicycle accidents."

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Two days it took the Times Online

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to make a map, a mashable map --

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we call these things mash-ups --

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and have a look and find out whether your bicycle

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
route to work was affected.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Here's more data, traffic survey data,

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
again, put out by the U.K. government,

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
then a user could just make a map,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
just by clicking.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Does this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Look at Zanesville, Ohio.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant,

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and which houses are there,

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which houses have been connected to the water.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And he got, from other data sources,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
information to show

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
which houses are occupied by white people.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt,

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
between which houses were occupied by white people

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That's the power of taking one piece of data,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
another piece of data, putting it together,

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and showing the result.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Let's look at some data from the U.K. now.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Where Does My Money Go.

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It allows anybody to go there and burrow down.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You can burrow down by a particular type of spending,

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
or you can go through all the different regions and compare them.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Yes, certainly you can do it over here.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in California.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Take an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California,

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
on different things such as energy.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
In fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in the repositories of data.gov,

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and data.gov.uk.

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And I'm delighted to see a great competition

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
between the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
How can you use this stuff?

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
you can take, from a postcode --

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which is like a zip plus four --

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for a specific group of houses, you can make paper,

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
print off a paper which has got very, very

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
specific things about the bus stops,

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the things specifically near you.

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
On a larger scale, this is a mash-up

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of the data which was released about the Afghan elections.

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It allows you to set your own criteria

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for what sort of things you want to look at.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The red circles are polling stations,

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
selected by your criteria.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And then you can select also other things on the map

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to see what other factors, like the threat level.

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So, that was government data.

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I also talked about community-generated data -- in fact I edited some.

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map.

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"Terrace Theater" I actually put

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I was not the only person editing the open street map.

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Each flash on this visualization --

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
put together by ITO World --

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
shows an edit in 2009

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
made to the Open Street Map.

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Let's now spin the world during the same year.

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
looking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better.

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You can see Europe is ablaze with updates.

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be.

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Here focusing in on Haiti.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The map of Port au-Prince at the end

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
of 2009 was not all it could be,

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
not as good as the map of California.

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Fortunately, just after the earthquake,

102
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
GeoEye, a commercial company,

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
released satellite imagery

104
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with a license, which allowed

105
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the open-source community to use it.

106
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
This is January, in time lapse,

107
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
of people editing ... that's the earthquake.

108
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
After the earthquake, immediately,

109
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
people all over the world, mappers

110
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
who wanted to help, and could,

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images].

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So, now we have, immediately, a real-time map

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
showing where there are refugee camps --

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
rapidly became the best map

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
being used by rescue team in Haiti.

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
There's the map showing,

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
on the left-hand side,

122
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship.

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads,

124
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
damaged buildings, refugee camps --

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work].

126
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So, if you've been involved in that at all,

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing,

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
whether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!"

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or you've been putting government or scientific data online,

130
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much,

131
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and we have only just started!

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Applause)

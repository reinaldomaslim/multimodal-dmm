2
0:00:12.146,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'll never forget that day

3
0:00:13.824,000 --> 0:00:16,000
back in the spring of 2006.

4
0:00:17.723,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was a surgical resident

5
0:00:19.302,000 --> 0:00:21,000
at The Johns Hopkins Hospital,

6
0:00:21.733,000 --> 0:00:22,000
taking emergency call.

7
0:00:23.51,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning

8
0:00:26.873,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer

9
0:00:28.9,000 --> 0:00:29,000
on her foot.

10
0:00:30.694,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh

11
0:00:34.395,000 --> 0:00:37,000
as I pulled the curtain back to see her.

12
0:00:38.022,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick

13
0:00:40.367,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and she needed to be in the hospital.

14
0:00:41.719,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That wasn't being asked.

15
0:00:43.319,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The question that was being asked of me was a different one,

16
0:00:45.461,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which was, did she also need an amputation?

17
0:00:49.39,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, looking back on that night,

18
0:00:52.357,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman

19
0:00:57.522,000 --> 0:01:,000
on that night with the same empathy and compassion

20
0:01:00.658,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed

21
0:01:04.893,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who came to the E.R. three nights earlier

22
0:01:06.838,000 --> 0:01:07,000
with lower back pain

23
0:01:08.452,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.

24
0:01:12.701,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do

25
0:01:14.864,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that was actually going to save her life.

26
0:01:16.632,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The cancer was too advanced.

27
0:01:18.681,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But I was committed to making sure that

28
0:01:21.361,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I could do anything possible to make her stay

29
0:01:23.784,000 --> 0:01:25,000
more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket

30
0:01:26.207,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and a cup of a coffee.

31
0:01:28.927,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I brought some for her parents.

32
0:01:31.112,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,

33
0:01:34.258,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because obviously she had done nothing

34
0:01:36.155,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to bring this on herself.

35
0:01:38.329,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So why was it that, just a few nights later,

36
0:01:41.142,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as I stood in that same E.R. and determined

37
0:01:44.3,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,

38
0:01:47.711,000 --> 0:01:5,000
why did I hold her in such bitter contempt?

39
0:01:51.615,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You see, unlike the woman the night before,

40
0:01:54.08,000 --> 0:01:56,000
this woman had type 2 diabetes.

41
0:01:56.479,000 --> 0:01:57,000
She was fat.

42
0:01:58.031,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And we all know that's from eating too much

43
0:01:59.944,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and not exercising enough, right?

44
0:02:02.299,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I mean, how hard can it be?

45
0:02:04.983,000 --> 0:02:06,000
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,

46
0:02:07.344,000 --> 0:02:09,000
if you just tried caring even a little bit,

47
0:02:10.232,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment

48
0:02:13.222,000 --> 0:02:14,000
with some doctor you've never met

49
0:02:14.999,000 --> 0:02:17,000
about to amputate your foot.

50
0:02:18.814,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Why did I feel justified in judging her?

51
0:02:22.456,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'd like to say I don't know.

52
0:02:25.025,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But I actually do.

53
0:02:27.061,000 --> 0:02:29,000
You see, in the hubris of my youth,

54
0:02:29.392,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I thought I had her all figured out.

55
0:02:32.496,000 --> 0:02:33,000
She ate too much. She got unlucky.

56
0:02:34.326,000 --> 0:02:37,000
She got diabetes. Case closed.

57
0:02:37.695,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Ironically, at that time in my life,

58
0:02:39.098,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I was also doing cancer research,

59
0:02:41.496,000 --> 0:02:43,000
immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific,

60
0:02:43.839,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and in that world I was actually taught to question everything,

61
0:02:47.812,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to challenge all assumptions

62
0:02:49.848,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.

63
0:02:53.658,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes

64
0:02:57.034,000 --> 0:03:,000
that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma,

65
0:03:00.583,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I never once questioned the conventional wisdom.

66
0:03:04.011,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events

67
0:03:07.057,000 --> 0:03:09,000
was settled science.

68
0:03:09.642,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.

69
0:03:13.042,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But this time, I was the patient.

70
0:03:15.642,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day,

71
0:03:19.473,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and following the food pyramid to the letter,

72
0:03:22.038,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something

73
0:03:24.195,000 --> 0:03:26,000
called metabolic syndrome.

74
0:03:26.48,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Some of you may have heard of this.

75
0:03:28.464,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I had become insulin-resistant.

76
0:03:31.909,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You can think of insulin as this master hormone

77
0:03:34.358,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that controls what our body does with the foods we eat,

78
0:03:38.421,000 --> 0:03:4,000
whether we burn it or store it.

79
0:03:40.535,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.

80
0:03:43.349,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.

81
0:03:46.525,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And insulin resistance, as its name suggests,

82
0:03:49.181,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is when your cells get increasingly resistant

83
0:03:51.861,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.

84
0:03:55.374,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Once you're insulin-resistant,

85
0:03:57.55,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you're on your way to getting diabetes,

86
0:03:58.925,000 --> 0:04:,000
which is what happens when your pancreas

87
0:04:00.989,000 --> 0:04:03,000
can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.

88
0:04:04.312,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise,

89
0:04:06.94,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and an entire cascade of pathologic events

90
0:04:09.572,000 --> 0:04:12,000
sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,

91
0:04:13.273,000 --> 0:04:16,000
cancer, even Alzheimer's disease,

92
0:04:16.882,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.

93
0:04:21.764,000 --> 0:04:23,000
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically,

94
0:04:24.725,000 --> 0:04:26,000
adding and subtracting things most of you would find

95
0:04:26.902,000 --> 0:04:29,000
almost assuredly shocking.

96
0:04:29.982,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.

97
0:04:33.861,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.

98
0:04:36.902,000 --> 0:04:38,000
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.

99
0:04:39.069,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But most important, I was left

100
0:04:41.113,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away:

101
0:04:44.962,000 --> 0:04:46,000
How did this happen to me if I was supposedly

102
0:04:47.411,000 --> 0:04:49,000
doing everything right?

103
0:04:50.108,000 --> 0:04:53,000
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me,

104
0:04:53.143,000 --> 0:04:56,000
was it possible it was failing someone else?

105
0:04:56.93,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And underlying these questions,

106
0:04:58.83,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I became almost maniacally obsessed

107
0:05:02.076,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in trying to understand the real relationship

108
0:05:04.803,000 --> 0:05:07,000
between obesity and insulin resistance.

109
0:05:08.433,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now, most researchers believe obesity

110
0:05:11.249,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is the cause of insulin resistance.

111
0:05:14.641,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,

112
0:05:16.756,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you get people to lose weight, right?

113
0:05:18.648,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You treat the obesity.

114
0:05:21.412,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But what if we have it backwards?

115
0:05:24.118,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?

116
0:05:27.489,000 --> 0:05:3,000
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem,

117
0:05:31.409,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the tip of a proverbial iceberg?

118
0:05:34.231,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst

119
0:05:36.874,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.

120
0:05:40.093,000 --> 0:05:43,000
What if obesity is a coping mechanism

121
0:05:43.307,000 --> 0:05:46,000
for a far more sinister problem going on

122
0:05:46.909,000 --> 0:05:47,000
underneath the cell?

123
0:05:48.391,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign,

124
0:05:50.757,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser

125
0:05:53.06,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of two metabolic evils.

126
0:05:55.771,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity

127
0:05:58.79,000 --> 0:05:59,000
of our cells to partition fuel,

128
0:06:00.777,000 --> 0:06:02,000
as I alluded to a moment ago,

129
0:06:03.068,000 --> 0:06:04,000
taking those calories that we take in

130
0:06:04.99,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.

131
0:06:08.429,000 --> 0:06:09,000
When we become insulin-resistant,

132
0:06:10.071,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.

133
0:06:13.438,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So now, when insulin says to a cell,

134
0:06:15.566,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I want you to burn more energy

135
0:06:17.611,000 --> 0:06:19,000
than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,

136
0:06:20.046,000 --> 0:06:24,000
"No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."

137
0:06:24.478,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And because fat cells are actually missing most of

138
0:06:26.38,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the complex cellular machinery found in other cells,

139
0:06:29.182,000 --> 0:06:31,000
it's probably the safest place to store it.

140
0:06:31.953,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans,

141
0:06:36.922,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the appropriate response to insulin resistance

142
0:06:40.537,000 --> 0:06:44,000
may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,

143
0:06:45.466,000 --> 0:06:5,000
getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.

144
0:06:50.81,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is a really subtle distinction,

145
0:06:52.985,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but the implication could be profound.

146
0:06:56.352,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Consider the following analogy:

147
0:06:58.85,000 --> 0:07:,000
Think of the bruise you get on your shin

148
0:07:01.819,000 --> 0:07:04,000
when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.

149
0:07:05.411,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly

150
0:07:08.298,000 --> 0:07:1,000
don't like the discolored look, but we all know

151
0:07:11.279,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the bruise per Se is not the problem.

152
0:07:14.732,000 --> 0:07:17,000
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma,

153
0:07:18.474,000 --> 0:07:2,000
all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury

154
0:07:21.235,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread

155
0:07:24.219,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of infection to elsewhere in the body.

156
0:07:26.917,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,

157
0:07:30.639,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and we evolved a giant medical establishment

158
0:07:33.507,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and a culture around treating bruises:

159
0:07:36.647,000 --> 0:07:39,000
masking creams, painkillers, you name it,

160
0:07:39.93,000 --> 0:07:41,000
all the while ignoring the fact that people

161
0:07:42.156,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are still banging their shins into coffee tables.

162
0:07:45.776,000 --> 0:07:48,000
How much better would we be if we treated the cause --

163
0:07:48.979,000 --> 0:07:49,000
telling people to pay attention

164
0:07:50.544,000 --> 0:07:51,000
when they walk through the living room --

165
0:07:52.147,000 --> 0:07:55,000
rather than the effect?

166
0:07:55.42,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Getting the cause and the effect right

167
0:07:57.297,000 --> 0:07:59,000
makes all the difference in the world.

168
0:07:59.776,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry

169
0:08:02.855,000 --> 0:08:04,000
can still do very well for its shareholders

170
0:08:05.535,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.

171
0:08:09.451,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Cause and effect.

172
0:08:12.295,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So what I'm suggesting is

173
0:08:14.132,000 --> 0:08:16,000
maybe we have the cause and effect wrong

174
0:08:16.889,000 --> 0:08:18,000
on obesity and insulin resistance.

175
0:08:19.523,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Maybe we should be asking ourselves,

176
0:08:21.3,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain

177
0:08:25.185,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and the diseases associated with obesity,

178
0:08:27.251,000 --> 0:08:28,000
at least in most people?

179
0:08:28.781,000 --> 0:08:31,000
What if being obese is just a metabolic response

180
0:08:31.781,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to something much more threatening,

181
0:08:34.002,000 --> 0:08:36,000
an underlying epidemic,

182
0:08:36.213,000 --> 0:08:38,000
the one we ought to be worried about?

183
0:08:38.77,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Let's look at some suggestive facts.

184
0:08:40.242,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We know that 30 million obese Americans

185
0:08:42.728,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in the United States don't have insulin resistance.

186
0:08:45.701,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any

187
0:08:47.638,000 --> 0:08:5,000
greater risk of disease than lean people.

188
0:08:50.718,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Conversely, we know that six million lean people

189
0:08:53.602,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in the United States are insulin-resistant,

190
0:08:57.039,000 --> 0:09:,000
and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk

191
0:09:00.106,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago

192
0:09:02.261,000 --> 0:09:03,000
than their obese counterparts.

193
0:09:04.083,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Now I don't know why, but it might be because,

194
0:09:06.32,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out

195
0:09:09.01,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the right thing to do with that excess energy.

196
0:09:12.295,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,

197
0:09:15.614,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and you can be lean and have it,

198
0:09:17.485,000 --> 0:09:21,000
this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy

199
0:09:21.918,000 --> 0:09:24,000
for what's going on.

200
0:09:24.942,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So what if we're fighting the wrong war,

201
0:09:27.357,000 --> 0:09:3,000
fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?

202
0:09:31.157,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Even worse, what if blaming the obese

203
0:09:34.4,000 --> 0:09:36,000
means we're blaming the victims?

204
0:09:37.125,000 --> 0:09:4,000
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity

205
0:09:40.844,000 --> 0:09:41,000
are just wrong?

206
0:09:42.702,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,

207
0:09:46.825,000 --> 0:09:48,000
let alone the luxury of certainty.

208
0:09:49.408,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,

209
0:09:52.254,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but I'm wide open to others.

210
0:09:54.166,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,

211
0:09:56.885,000 --> 0:09:57,000
is this.

212
0:09:58.502,000 --> 0:10:01,000
If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from

213
0:10:01.631,000 --> 0:10:02,000
when it becomes insulin resistant,

214
0:10:03.358,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the answer probably isn't too much food.

215
0:10:06.033,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.

216
0:10:09.683,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Now, we know that refined grains and starches

217
0:10:11.977,000 --> 0:10:13,000
elevate your blood sugar in the short run,

218
0:10:14.033,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and there's even reason to believe that sugar

219
0:10:15.941,000 --> 0:10:17,000
may lead to insulin resistance directly.

220
0:10:18.742,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So if you put these physiological processes to work,

221
0:10:22.837,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake

222
0:10:26.31,000 --> 0:10:28,000
of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving

223
0:10:29.173,000 --> 0:10:33,000
this epidemic of obesity and diabetes,

224
0:10:33.824,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but through insulin resistance,

225
0:10:35.662,000 --> 0:10:38,000
you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.

226
0:10:39.574,000 --> 0:10:41,000
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,

227
0:10:42.159,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I did it simply by restricting those things,

228
0:10:44.759,000 --> 0:10:47,000
which admittedly suggests I have a bias

229
0:10:48.215,000 --> 0:10:5,000
based on my personal experience.

230
0:10:50.576,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong,

231
0:10:53.231,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.

232
0:10:57.184,000 --> 0:11:,000
But step one is accepting the possibility

233
0:11:00.291,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that our current beliefs about obesity,

234
0:11:02.663,000 --> 0:11:05,000
diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong

235
0:11:05.669,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and therefore must be tested.

236
0:11:08.544,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I'm betting my career on this.

237
0:11:10.935,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem,

238
0:11:15.06,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and I'll go wherever the science takes me.

239
0:11:18.233,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore

240
0:11:21.764,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is pretend I have the answers when I don't.

241
0:11:24.808,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I've been humbled enough by all I don't know.

242
0:11:28.916,000 --> 0:11:3,000
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough

243
0:11:31.073,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to work on this problem with the most amazing team

244
0:11:34.486,000 --> 0:11:37,000
of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country,

245
0:11:37.89,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and the best part is,

246
0:11:39.195,000 --> 0:11:42,000
just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals,

247
0:11:43.094,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we've done the same thing.

248
0:11:44.59,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals,

249
0:11:47.853,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses

250
0:11:51.298,000 --> 0:11:52,000
for what's at the heart of this epidemic.

251
0:11:52.912,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Some think it's too many calories consumed.

252
0:11:55.293,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Others think it's too much dietary fat.

253
0:11:57.672,000 --> 0:12:,000
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches.

254
0:12:01.142,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But this team of multi-disciplinary,

255
0:12:03.75,000 --> 0:12:05,000
highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers

256
0:12:06.734,000 --> 0:12:08,000
do agree on two things.

257
0:12:09.022,000 --> 0:12:12,000
First, this problem is just simply too important

258
0:12:12.671,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.

259
0:12:15.414,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And two, if we're willing to be wrong,

260
0:12:18.198,000 --> 0:12:2,000
if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom

261
0:12:20.735,000 --> 0:12:23,000
with the best experiments science can offer,

262
0:12:23.798,000 --> 0:12:25,000
we can solve this problem.

263
0:12:26.103,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I know it's tempting to want an answer right now,

264
0:12:29.158,000 --> 0:12:33,000
some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription --

265
0:12:33.655,000 --> 0:12:34,000
eat this, not that —

266
0:12:35.384,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but if we want to get it right,

267
0:12:37.064,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we're going to have to do much more rigorous science

268
0:12:39.298,000 --> 0:12:41,000
before we can write that prescription.

269
0:12:42.151,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Briefly, to address this, our research program

270
0:12:44.75,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.

271
0:12:47.993,000 --> 0:12:49,000
First, how do the various foods we consume

272
0:12:50.888,000 --> 0:12:52,000
impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,

273
0:12:53.689,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?

274
0:12:56.507,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Second, based on these insights,

275
0:12:58.757,000 --> 0:13:,000
can people make the necessary changes in their diets

276
0:13:01.716,000 --> 0:13:04,000
in a way that's safe and practical to implement?

277
0:13:05.447,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And finally, once we identify what safe

278
0:13:08.456,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and practical changes people can make to their diet,

279
0:13:11.484,000 --> 0:13:14,000
how can we move their behavior in that direction

280
0:13:15.159,000 --> 0:13:17,000
so that it becomes more the default

281
0:13:17.412,000 --> 0:13:18,000
rather than the exception?

282
0:13:19.268,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean

283
0:13:21.688,000 --> 0:13:22,000
you're always going to do it.

284
0:13:23.197,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Sometimes we have to put cues around people

285
0:13:25.325,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to make it easier, and believe it or not,

286
0:13:27.628,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that can be studied scientifically.

287
0:13:31.269,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I don't know how this journey is going to end,

288
0:13:33.853,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but this much seems clear to me, at least:

289
0:13:38.066,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients

290
0:13:43.062,000 --> 0:13:45,000
like I did.

291
0:13:45.974,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Most of them actually want to do the right thing,

292
0:13:48.253,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but they have to know what that is,

293
0:13:51.622,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and it's got to work.

294
0:13:54.668,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I dream of a day when our patients can

295
0:13:59.364,000 --> 0:14:,000
shed their excess pounds

296
0:14:01.099,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and cure themselves of insulin resistance,

297
0:14:03.912,000 --> 0:14:05,000
because as medical professionals,

298
0:14:06.642,000 --> 0:14:07,000
we've shed our excess mental baggage

299
0:14:08.612,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently

300
0:14:11.938,000 --> 0:14:14,000
to go back to our original ideals:

301
0:14:15.028,000 --> 0:14:19,000
open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas

302
0:14:19.445,000 --> 0:14:22,000
when they don't appear to be working,

303
0:14:22.773,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final,

304
0:14:25.892,000 --> 0:14:27,000
but constantly evolving.

305
0:14:28.64,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients

306
0:14:31.932,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and better for science.

307
0:14:35.18,000 --> 0:14:37,000
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy

308
0:14:38.174,000 --> 0:14:39,000
for metabolic illness,

309
0:14:40.1,000 --> 0:14:45,000
what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?

310
0:14:45.397,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.

311
0:14:49.941,000 --> 0:14:51,000
seven years ago.

312
0:14:52.254,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I wish I could speak with that woman again.

313
0:14:55.878,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.

314
0:14:59.133,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered

315
0:15:02.02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the best clinical care I could,

316
0:15:05.68,000 --> 0:15:08,000
but as a human being,

317
0:15:09.577,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I let you down.

318
0:15:11.985,000 --> 0:15:15,000
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt.

319
0:15:16.23,000 --> 0:15:2,000
You needed my empathy and compassion,

320
0:15:20.728,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and above all else, you needed a doctor

321
0:15:22.723,000 --> 0:15:24,000
who was willing to consider

322
0:15:25.352,000 --> 0:15:28,000
maybe you didn't let the system down.

323
0:15:28.416,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Maybe the system, of which I was a part,

324
0:15:31.634,000 --> 0:15:33,000
was letting you down.

325
0:15:34.073,000 --> 0:15:36,000
If you're watching this now,

326
0:15:36.874,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I hope you can forgive me.

327
0:15:41.112,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Applause)

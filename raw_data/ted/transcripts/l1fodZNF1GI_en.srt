1
0:00:12.991,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Imagine that you are a product designer.

2
0:00:16.686,000 --> 0:00:17,000
And you've designed a product,

3
0:00:18.156,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a new type of product, called the human immune system.

4
0:00:23.161,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You're pitching this product

5
0:00:24.65,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to a skeptical, strictly no-nonsense manager.

6
0:00:28.378,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Let's call him Bob.

7
0:00:29.848,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I think we all know at least one Bob, right?

8
0:00:33.542,000 --> 0:00:34,000
How would that go?

9
0:00:35.925,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Bob, I've got this incredible idea

10
0:00:37.981,000 --> 0:00:39,000
for a completely new type of personal health product.

11
0:00:40.637,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's called the human immune system.

12
0:00:43.447,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I can see from your face that you're having some problems with this.

13
0:00:46.7,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.

14
0:00:48.8,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I don't want to take you through the gory details,

15
0:00:51.481,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product.

16
0:00:55.733,000 --> 0:00:57,000
First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy

17
0:00:58.686,000 --> 0:01:01,000
by having millions of copies of each component --

18
0:01:01.842,000 --> 0:01:03,000
leukocytes, white blood cells --

19
0:01:04.051,000 --> 0:01:05,000
before they're actually needed,

20
0:01:05.825,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to create a massive buffer against the unexpected.

21
0:01:10.276,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And it cleverly leverages diversity

22
0:01:13.66,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by having not just leukocytes but B cells, T cells,

23
0:01:17.405,000 --> 0:01:19,000
natural killer cells, antibodies.

24
0:01:19.943,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The components don't really matter.

25
0:01:21.669,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The point is that together,

26
0:01:23.263,000 --> 0:01:27,000
this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything

27
0:01:27.903,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that evolution has been able to throw up.

28
0:01:31.933,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And the design is completely modular.

29
0:01:35.86,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You have the surface barrier of the human skin,

30
0:01:39.173,000 --> 0:01:42,000
you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system

31
0:01:42.418,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system.

32
0:01:47.017,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The point is, that if one system fails, another can take over,

33
0:01:50.886,000 --> 0:01:53,000
creating a virtually foolproof system.

34
0:01:55.17,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I can see I'm losing you, Bob, but stay with me,

35
0:01:57.485,000 --> 0:02:,000
because here is the really killer feature.

36
0:02:01.773,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The product is completely adaptive.

37
0:02:04.789,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's able to actually develop targeted antibodies

38
0:02:09.355,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to threats that it's never even met before.

39
0:02:12.68,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It actually also does this with incredible prudence,

40
0:02:17.081,000 --> 0:02:21,000
detecting and reacting to every tiny threat,

41
0:02:21.203,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and furthermore, remembering every previous threat,

42
0:02:25.562,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in case they are ever encountered again.

43
0:02:28.624,000 --> 0:02:31,000
What I'm pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product.

44
0:02:33.569,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The product is embedded in the larger system of the human body,

45
0:02:38.008,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and it works in complete harmony with that system,

46
0:02:40.945,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to create this unprecedented level of biological protection.

47
0:02:44.023,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So Bob, just tell me honestly, what do you think of my product?

48
0:02:48.342,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And Bob may say something like,

49
0:02:50.89,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I sincerely appreciate the effort and passion

50
0:02:53.829,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that have gone into your presentation,

51
0:02:56.696,000 --> 0:02:57,000
blah blah blah --

52
0:02:57.874,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:59.078,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But honestly, it's total nonsense.

54
0:03:04.081,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product

55
0:03:07.474,000 --> 0:03:09,000
are that it is inefficient and complex.

56
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Didn't they teach you 80-20?

57
0:03:13.693,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And furthermore, you're saying that this product is siloed.

58
0:03:17.676,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It overreacts,

59
0:03:19.105,000 --> 0:03:2,000
makes things up as it goes along

60
0:03:20.668,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and is actually designed for somebody else's benefit.

61
0:03:23.183,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I'm sorry to break it to you, but I don't think this one is a winner.

62
0:03:27.267,000 --> 0:03:28,000
If we went with Bob's philosophy,

63
0:03:29.237,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I think we'd actually end up with a more efficient immune system.

64
0:03:32.729,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And efficiency is always important in the short term.

65
0:03:36.875,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Less complex, more efficient, more bang for the buck.

66
0:03:40.322,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Who could say no to that?

67
0:03:42.151,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Unfortunately, there's one very tiny problem,

68
0:03:44.562,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and that is that the user of this product, you or I,

69
0:03:47.851,000 --> 0:03:5,000
would probably die within one week of the next winter,

70
0:03:51.548,000 --> 0:03:54,000
when we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus.

71
0:03:57.191,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I first became interested in biology and business,

72
0:04:01.385,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and longevity and resilience,

73
0:04:03.788,000 --> 0:04:05,000
when I was asked a very unusual question

74
0:04:06.063,000 --> 0:04:08,000
by the CEO of a global tech company.

75
0:04:09.257,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And the question was:

76
0:04:10.731,000 --> 0:04:16,000
What do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years?

77
0:04:18.811,000 --> 0:04:19,000
A seemingly innocent question,

78
0:04:20.405,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but actually, it's a little trickier than you might think,

79
0:04:24.341,000 --> 0:04:28,000
considering that the average US public company now

80
0:04:28.591,000 --> 0:04:31,000
can expect a life span of only 30 years.

81
0:04:33.033,000 --> 0:04:35,000
That is less than half of the life span

82
0:04:35.778,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that its employees can expect to enjoy.

83
0:04:39.743,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, if you were the CEO of such a company,

84
0:04:42.961,000 --> 0:04:44,000
badgered by investors and buffeted by change,

85
0:04:46.379,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we might forgive you for not even worrying too much

86
0:04:48.918,000 --> 0:04:49,000
about what happens 30 years out.

87
0:04:51.09,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But here's something that should keep you awake at night:

88
0:04:55.84,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the probability that your company will not be around in five year's time,

89
0:04:59.449,000 --> 0:05:02,000
on average, is now a staggering 32 percent.

90
0:05:04.164,000 --> 0:05:08,000
That's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over

91
0:05:08.232,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or will fail within just five years.

92
0:05:13.696,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Let's come back to our tech CEO's question.

93
0:05:16.034,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Where better to turn for advice than nature,

94
0:05:19.837,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that's been in the business of life and death

95
0:05:22.455,000 --> 0:05:23,000
for longer than any company?

96
0:05:27.147,000 --> 0:05:28,000
As a lapsed biologist,

97
0:05:28.954,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I decided to immediately call a real biologist,

98
0:05:32.339,000 --> 0:05:34,000
my friend Simon Levin,

99
0:05:34.377,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Professor of Biology and Mathematics at Princeton University.

100
0:05:38.461,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Together, we looked at a variety of biological systems,

101
0:05:42.115,000 --> 0:05:45,000
ranging from natural tropical rainforests

102
0:05:45.405,000 --> 0:05:47,000
through to managed forests and fisheries.

103
0:05:48.351,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And we asked ourselves the question:

104
0:05:50.099,000 --> 0:05:54,000
What makes these systems resilient and enduring?

105
0:05:56.176,000 --> 0:06:,000
And what we found was that the same six principles

106
0:06:00.345,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system

107
0:06:03.394,000 --> 0:06:06,000
actually cropped up again and again,

108
0:06:07.157,000 --> 0:06:1,000
from redundancy through to embeddedness.

109
0:06:11.129,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In fact, we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems,

110
0:06:15.299,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we also found them being very characteristic

111
0:06:18.194,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of long-lived social systems,

112
0:06:20.605,000 --> 0:06:22,000
like the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church,

113
0:06:22.847,000 --> 0:06:23,000
believe it or not.

114
0:06:24.169,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We also went on to look at business,

115
0:06:26.031,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and found that these very same properties also characterized businesses

116
0:06:30.911,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that were resilient and long-lived,

117
0:06:32.895,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and we noted their absence from ones which were short-lived.

118
0:06:39.162,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Let's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system

119
0:06:43.208,000 --> 0:06:44,000
collapses.

120
0:06:45.202,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This beautiful building is part of the Shitennoji Temple Complex

121
0:06:49.768,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in Osaka, Japan.

122
0:06:51.672,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In fact, it's one of the oldest temples in Japan.

123
0:06:55.165,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It was built by a Korean artisan,

124
0:06:57.417,000 --> 0:07:,000
because at the time, Japan was not yet building temples.

125
0:07:00.933,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And this Korean artisan went on to found a temple-building company.

126
0:07:07.017,000 --> 0:07:1,000

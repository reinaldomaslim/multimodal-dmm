1
0:00:26.063,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum

2
0:00:29.724,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at nine o'clock or so in the morning.

3
0:00:31.82,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:33.242,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater,

5
0:00:37.336,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and really, I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues

6
0:00:40.645,000 --> 0:00:42,000
for such a great presentation.

7
0:00:43.173,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Applause)

8
0:00:46.268,000 --> 0:00:48,000
One of the interesting things, of course,

9
0:00:48.478,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology,

10
0:00:55.911,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and what he said about listening to our young people.

11
0:01:00.575,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Of course, my job is all about listening.

12
0:01:05.094,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.

13
0:01:11.063,000 --> 0:01:14,000
That's my only real aim in life.

14
0:01:15.394,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And it sounds quite simple, but actually, it's quite a big, big job.

15
0:01:21.555,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Because you know, when you look at a piece of music, for example,

16
0:01:26.849,000 --> 0:01:29,000
if I just open my little motorbike bag --

17
0:01:31.647,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we have here, hopefully,

18
0:01:34.679,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page.

19
0:01:41.494,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And, you know, we open it up ...

20
0:01:47.732,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I read the music.

21
0:01:49.554,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So technically, I can actually read this.

22
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics.

23
0:01:58.586,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I will do exactly as I'm told.

24
0:02:02.717,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And so therefore, because time is short,

25
0:02:06.133,000 --> 0:02:12,000
if I just played you, literally, the first, maybe, two lines or so --

26
0:02:13.738,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's very straightforward; there's nothing too difficult about the piece.

27
0:02:17.258,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But here, I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick.

28
0:02:21.55,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'm being told where to play on the drum.

29
0:02:24.58,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I'm being told which part of the stick to use.

30
0:02:28.847,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I'm being told the dynamic.

31
0:02:31.469,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.

32
0:02:36.094,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Snares on, snares off.

33
0:02:39.13,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So therefore, if I translate this piece of music,

34
0:02:45.006,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we have this idea.

35
0:02:48.074,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Drum sounds)

36
0:03:15.823,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Drum sounds end)

37
0:03:18.266,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And so on.

38
0:03:19.557,000 --> 0:03:22,000
My career would probably last about five years.

39
0:03:23.063,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

40
0:03:24.091,000 --> 0:03:28,000
However, what I have to do as a musician

41
0:03:28.638,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is do everything that is not on the music;

42
0:03:32.77,000 --> 0:03:37,000
everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher,

43
0:03:37.798,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or to talk about, even, from a teacher.

44
0:03:41.382,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But it's the things you notice when you're not actually with your instrument

45
0:03:46.259,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that, in fact, become so interesting, and that you want to explore

46
0:03:51.53,000 --> 0:03:54,000
through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.

47
0:03:55.022,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So there, we experience the translation.

48
0:03:57.747,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now we'll experience the interpretation.

49
0:04:02.082,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Drum sounds)

50
0:04:43.976,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Drum sounds end)

51
0:04:47.513,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Applause)

52
0:04:55.058,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now my career may last a little longer.

53
0:04:57.793,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

54
0:04:59.144,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you

55
0:05:02.453,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I see a nice, bright young lady with a pink top on.

56
0:05:06.817,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc.

57
0:05:10.259,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about,

58
0:05:14.841,000 --> 0:05:18,000
what you might like, what you might do as a profession, etc., etc.

59
0:05:19.642,000 --> 0:05:25,000
However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get

60
0:05:26.027,000 --> 0:05:29,000
when we actually look and we try to interpret.

61
0:05:29.633,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But actually it's so unbelievably shallow.

62
0:05:31.957,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea;

63
0:05:34.886,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do.

64
0:05:39.204,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Just the basic feeling.

65
0:05:40.718,000 --> 0:05:42,000
However, that is simply not enough.

66
0:05:43.405,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And I think what Herbie said: please listen, listen.

67
0:05:47.743,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We have to listen to ourselves, first of all.

68
0:05:51.403,000 --> 0:05:54,000
If I play, for example, holding the stick --

69
0:05:55.172,000 --> 0:05:58,000
where literally I do not let go of the stick --

70
0:05:58.249,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Drum sound)

71
0:06:00.838,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.

72
0:06:04.679,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not --

73
0:06:07.028,000 --> 0:06:1,000
detached from the instrument and from the stick,

74
0:06:10.295,000 --> 0:06:14,000
even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.

75
0:06:14.441,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Drum sound)

76
0:06:15.89,000 --> 0:06:18,000
By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.

77
0:06:19.871,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If I just simply let go

78
0:06:21.612,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system,

79
0:06:26.831,000 --> 0:06:27,000
suddenly --

80
0:06:28.053,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Drum sound)

81
0:06:30.091,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I have more dynamic with less effort.

82
0:06:33.572,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Much more --

83
0:06:34.771,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Drum sound)

84
0:06:36.546,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and I just feel, at last, one with the stick

85
0:06:39.503,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and one with the drum.

86
0:06:41.186,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And I'm doing far, far less.

87
0:06:43.323,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument,

88
0:06:46.759,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I need time with people in order to interpret them.

89
0:06:52.11,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Not just translate them, but interpret them.

90
0:06:54.822,000 --> 0:07:,000
If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music

91
0:07:02.289,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for which I think of myself as a technician --

92
0:07:07.703,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that is, someone who is basically a percussion player --

93
0:07:11.983,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Marimba sounds)

94
0:07:22.973,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Marimba sounds end)

95
0:07:24.894,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And so on, if I think of myself as a musician --

96
0:07:28.106,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Marimba sounds)

97
0:07:47.867,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Marimba sounds end)

98
0:07:49.934,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And so on.

99
0:07:51.132,000 --> 0:07:54,000
There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just --

100
0:07:55.018,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

101
0:07:57.593,000 --> 0:07:58,000
thinking about.

102
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And I remember when I was 12 years old,

103
0:08:02.933,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and I started playing timpani and percussion,

104
0:08:06.075,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and my teacher said,

105
0:08:08.529,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening."

106
0:08:14.206,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that, so what's the problem?"

107
0:08:18.901,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this?

108
0:08:21.344,000 --> 0:08:22,000
How are you going to hear that?"

109
0:08:22.926,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"

110
0:08:25.507,000 --> 0:08:28,000
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here."

111
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And I said, "Well, I think I do too, but I also hear it through my hands,

112
0:08:34.398,000 --> 0:08:37,000
through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp,

113
0:08:37.961,000 --> 0:08:4,000
my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."

114
0:08:41.002,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And so we began our lessons every single time

115
0:08:45.858,000 --> 0:08:48,000
tuning drums, in particular, the kettle drums, or timpani

116
0:08:49.824,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like --

117
0:08:55.606,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Marimba sounds)

118
0:09:00.04,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that of a difference.

119
0:09:01.237,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Then gradually:

120
0:09:02.463,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Marimba sounds)

121
0:09:03.644,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And gradually:

122
0:09:04.848,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Marimba sounds)

123
0:09:06.663,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And it's amazing that when you do open your body up,

124
0:09:10.746,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through,

125
0:09:14.745,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that in fact the tiny, tiny difference --

126
0:09:17.092,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Marimba sounds)

127
0:09:19.175,000 --> 0:09:25,000
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there.

128
0:09:25.281,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands

129
0:09:28.171,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on the wall of the music room,

130
0:09:30.51,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and together, we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments,

131
0:09:35.728,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and really try to connect with those sounds

132
0:09:39.588,000 --> 0:09:43,000
far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear.

133
0:09:44.005,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Because of course, the ear is subject to all sorts of things.

134
0:09:48.672,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The room we happen to be in, the amplification,

135
0:09:51.665,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks --

136
0:09:54.424,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Marimba sounds)

137
0:10:00.844,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Marimba sounds end)

138
0:10:02.815,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Etc., etc., they're all different.

139
0:10:04.658,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Marimba sounds)

140
0:10:09.117,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Marimba sounds end)

141
0:10:11.238,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Same amount of weight, but different sound colors.

142
0:10:15.847,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And that's basically what we are; we're just human beings,

143
0:10:18.775,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were,

144
0:10:21.964,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters

145
0:10:25.637,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and interests and things.

146
0:10:27.534,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And as I grew older, I then auditioned

147
0:10:30.558,000 --> 0:10:32,000
for the Royal Academy of Music in London,

148
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue,

149
0:10:37.298,000 --> 0:10:41,000
you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf musician.'"

150
0:10:41.975,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And I just couldn't quite accept that.

151
0:10:46.526,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse --

152
0:10:53.118,000 --> 0:10:56,000
if you refuse me through those reasons,

153
0:10:56.467,000 --> 0:11:,000
as opposed to the ability to perform

154
0:11:01.259,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and to understand and love the art of creating sound --

155
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."

156
0:11:14.263,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And as a result, once we got over a little hurdle,

157
0:11:18.545,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and having to audition twice,

158
0:11:20.578,000 --> 0:11:22,000
they accepted me.

159
0:11:22.817,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And not only that,

160
0:11:24.207,000 --> 0:11:29,000
what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions

161
0:11:29.874,000 --> 0:11:3,000
throughout the United Kingdom.

162
0:11:31.85,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Under no circumstances were they to refuse

163
0:11:35.822,000 --> 0:11:38,000
any application whatsoever

164
0:11:39.761,000 --> 0:11:42,000
on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs --

165
0:11:43.293,000 --> 0:11:47,000
they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand.

166
0:11:48.368,000 --> 0:11:54,000
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.

167
0:11:54.647,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced,

168
0:11:59.509,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and then, based on the musical ability,

169
0:12:02.09,000 --> 0:12:07,000
then that person could either enter or not.

170
0:12:07.366,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And so therefore, this in turn meant

171
0:12:10.544,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students

172
0:12:14.205,000 --> 0:12:17,000
who arrived in these various music institutions,

173
0:12:17.579,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras

174
0:12:22.092,000 --> 0:12:23,000
throughout the world.

175
0:12:24.095,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The interesting thing about this as well, though --

176
0:12:26.805,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Applause)

177
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:37,000
is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound --

178
0:12:37.814,000 --> 0:12:38,000
which is basically all of us --

179
0:12:39.349,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we well know that music really is our daily medicine.

180
0:12:44.295,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I say "music," but actually I mean "sound."

181
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Because some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician --

182
0:12:51.649,000 --> 0:12:55,000
when you may have a 15-year-old lad

183
0:12:55.812,000 --> 0:12:59,000
who has got the most incredible challenges,

184
0:13:00.565,000 --> 0:13:02,000
who may not be able to control his movements,

185
0:13:03.326,000 --> 0:13:06,000
who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. --

186
0:13:06.363,000 --> 0:13:12,000
suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument,

187
0:13:12.417,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba,

188
0:13:15.252,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost --

189
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps --

190
0:13:23.884,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but something like this -- let me change --

191
0:13:29.935,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Soft marimba sounds)

192
0:14:15.167,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Soft marimba sounds end)

193
0:14:17.826,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Something that's so unbelievably simple --

194
0:14:20.732,000 --> 0:14:24,000
but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be,

195
0:14:25.076,000 --> 0:14:27,000
because I'm on top of the sound.

196
0:14:27.518,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I have the sound coming this way.

197
0:14:29.808,000 --> 0:14:32,000
He would have the sound coming through the resonators.

198
0:14:33.39,000 --> 0:14:36,000
If there were no resonators on here, we would have:

199
0:14:36.894,000 --> 0:14:41,000
(Marimba sounds)

200
0:14:43.106,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So he would have a fullness of sound

201
0:14:45.449,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience,

202
0:14:48.471,000 --> 0:14:51,000
those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience, either.

203
0:14:51.64,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting,

204
0:14:54.757,000 --> 0:14:57,000
will experience this sound quite, quite differently.

205
0:14:58.558,000 --> 0:15:,000
And of course, being the participator of the sound,

206
0:15:01.452,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound

207
0:15:06.302,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I want to produce, for example, this sound:

208
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
(No sound)

209
0:15:16.171,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Can you hear anything?

210
0:15:19.108,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Exactly -- because I'm not even touching it.

211
0:15:21.878,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Laughter)

212
0:15:23.427,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But yet, we get the sensation of something happening.

213
0:15:28.078,000 --> 0:15:3,000
In the same way that when I see a tree moves,

214
0:15:30.661,000 --> 0:15:34,000
then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound.

215
0:15:34.903,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Do you see what I mean?

216
0:15:36.153,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.

217
0:15:40.294,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So there's always, always that huge --

218
0:15:44.513,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.

219
0:15:48.823,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience,

220
0:15:54.816,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and not by learning a piece of music,

221
0:15:57.336,000 --> 0:15:59,000
putting on someone else's interpretation of it,

222
0:15:59.562,000 --> 0:16:02,000
buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music,

223
0:16:02.765,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and so on and so forth,

224
0:16:04.155,000 --> 0:16:1,000
because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic,

225
0:16:10.531,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and something that I can fully experience the journey of.

226
0:16:15.682,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So it may be that, in certain halls,

227
0:16:19.933,000 --> 0:16:23,000
this dynamic may well work.

228
0:16:25.169,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Soft marimba sounds)

229
0:16:32.37,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Soft marimba sounds end)

230
0:16:34.396,000 --> 0:16:35,000
It may be that in other halls,

231
0:16:35.952,000 --> 0:16:38,000
they're simply not going to experience that at all,

232
0:16:39.211,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be --

233
0:16:43.443,000 --> 0:16:46,000
(Marimba sounds)

234
0:17:05.47,000 --> 0:17:07,000
(Marimba sounds end)

235
0:17:07.495,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Do you see what I mean?

236
0:17:08.861,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So, because of this explosion in access to sound,

237
0:17:15.143,000 --> 0:17:17,000
especially through the Deaf community,

238
0:17:17.678,000 --> 0:17:21,000
this has not only affected how music institutions,

239
0:17:22.129,000 --> 0:17:28,000
how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy --

240
0:17:28.922,000 --> 0:17:3,000
although, of course, being a participator of music,

241
0:17:31.559,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that definitely is the case as well --

242
0:17:34.181,000 --> 0:17:39,000
but it's meant that acousticians have had to really think

243
0:17:39.304,000 --> 0:17:43,000
about the types of halls they put together.

244
0:17:43.35,000 --> 0:17:45,000
There are so few halls in this world

245
0:17:45.838,000 --> 0:17:5,000
that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say.

246
0:17:51.179,000 --> 0:17:56,000
But by that I mean, where you can absolutely do anything you imagine.

247
0:17:56.788,000 --> 0:18:,000
The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad,

248
0:18:01.63,000 --> 0:18:03,000
so huge, so incredible.

249
0:18:04.376,000 --> 0:18:05,000
There's always something:

250
0:18:05.794,000 --> 0:18:07,000
it may sound good up there, may not be so good there;

251
0:18:08.322,000 --> 0:18:1,000
it may be great there, but terrible up there;

252
0:18:10.489,000 --> 0:18:14,000
maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.

253
0:18:14.697,000 --> 0:18:18,000
So to find an actual hall is incredible --

254
0:18:19.143,000 --> 0:18:23,000
for which you can play exactly what you imagine,

255
0:18:23.243,000 --> 0:18:26,000
without it being cosmetically enhanced.

256
0:18:26.374,000 --> 0:18:31,000
So therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation

257
0:18:31.455,000 --> 0:18:34,000
with people who are hearing impaired,

258
0:18:34.774,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and who are participators of sound.

259
0:18:39.649,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And this is quite interesting.

260
0:18:41.5,000 --> 0:18:44,000
I cannot give you any detail

261
0:18:45.511,000 --> 0:18:48,000
as far as what is actually happening with those halls,

262
0:18:49.272,000 --> 0:18:53,000
but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people

263
0:18:53.404,000 --> 0:18:56,000
for whom so many years, we've been saying,

264
0:18:57.374,000 --> 0:19:,000
"Well, how on earth can they experience music? They're deaf."

265
0:19:00.739,000 --> 0:19:03,000
We go like that, and we imagine that's what deafness is about.

266
0:19:04.078,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about.

267
0:19:07.238,000 --> 0:19:1,000
If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk.

268
0:19:11.084,000 --> 0:19:14,000
It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps.

269
0:19:14.632,000 --> 0:19:16,000
That, to them, means they can walk.

270
0:19:18.594,000 --> 0:19:21,000
In a year's time, it could be two extra steps.

271
0:19:22.299,000 --> 0:19:24,000
In another year's time, three extra steps.

272
0:19:25.076,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Those are hugely important aspects to think about.

273
0:19:29.803,000 --> 0:19:33,000
So when we do listen to each other,

274
0:19:34,000 --> 0:19:37,000
it's unbelievably important for us

275
0:19:37.713,000 --> 0:19:41,000
to really test our listening skills,

276
0:19:42.355,000 --> 0:19:45,000
to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber,

277
0:19:45.851,000 --> 0:19:46,000
to stop the judgment.

278
0:19:47.524,000 --> 0:19:5,000
For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music,

279
0:19:51.419,000 --> 0:19:52,000
it's very easy for me to say,

280
0:19:53.367,000 --> 0:19:56,000
"Oh yes, I like that piece. No, I don't like that piece," and so on.

281
0:19:56.992,000 --> 0:20:01,000
And I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.

282
0:20:02.145,000 --> 0:20:05,000
It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself

283
0:20:05.442,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and that particular piece of music,

284
0:20:07.243,000 --> 0:20:11,000
but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.

285
0:20:12.077,000 --> 0:20:17,000
And you know, one of the great things about being a musician

286
0:20:17.201,000 --> 0:20:2,000
is that it is so unbelievably fluid.

287
0:20:20.781,000 --> 0:20:24,000
So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.

288
0:20:25.209,000 --> 0:20:29,000
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this.

289
0:20:30.061,000 --> 0:20:36,000
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder."

290
0:20:36.459,000 --> 0:20:39,000
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder.

291
0:20:39.782,000 --> 0:20:4,000
Now, I don't mean just the sound;

292
0:20:41.388,000 --> 0:20:45,000
I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves.

293
0:20:46.329,000 --> 0:20:48,000
And please try to create that through your clapping.

294
0:20:48.811,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Try, just -- please try.

295
0:20:50.784,000 --> 0:20:53,000
(Loud clapping sounds)

296
0:20:58.561,000 --> 0:20:59,000
(Clapping ends)

297
0:21:00.103,000 --> 0:21:01,000
Snow.

298
0:21:01.485,000 --> 0:21:03,000
(Laughter)

299
0:21:03.645,000 --> 0:21:04,000
Snow.

300
0:21:04.837,000 --> 0:21:06,000
(Soft clapping sounds)

301
0:21:07.097,000 --> 0:21:08,000
Have you ever heard snow?

302
0:21:08.666,000 --> 0:21:09,000
Audience: No.

303
0:21:09.841,000 --> 0:21:11,000
Evelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping.

304
0:21:12.023,000 --> 0:21:13,000
(Laughter)

305
0:21:13.446,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Try again. Try again: snow.

306
0:21:17.016,000 --> 0:21:2,000
(No sound)

307
0:21:20.822,000 --> 0:21:21,000
See, you're awake.

308
0:21:23.095,000 --> 0:21:24,000
Rain.

309
0:21:24.714,000 --> 0:21:25,000
(Light clapping sounds)

310
0:21:26.887,000 --> 0:21:27,000
EG: (Laughs)

311
0:21:29.354,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Not bad. Not bad.

312
0:21:32.108,000 --> 0:21:36,000
The interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids

313
0:21:36.888,000 --> 0:21:37,000
not so long ago

314
0:21:38.615,000 --> 0:21:4,000
exactly the same question.

315
0:21:40.804,000 --> 0:21:43,000
Now -- great imagination, thank you very much.

316
0:21:44.207,000 --> 0:21:46,000
However, not one of you got out of your seats to think,

317
0:21:47.053,000 --> 0:21:48,000
"Right! How can I clap?

318
0:21:48.744,000 --> 0:21:49,000
OK, maybe:

319
0:21:49.99,000 --> 0:21:51,000
(Clapping sounds)

320
0:21:52.523,000 --> 0:21:54,000
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds.

321
0:21:55.379,000 --> 0:21:59,000
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."

322
0:21:59.439,000 --> 0:22:04,000
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way

323
0:22:04.856,000 --> 0:22:07,000
other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.

324
0:22:07.998,000 --> 0:22:09,000
In the same way, when we listen to music,

325
0:22:10.167,000 --> 0:22:13,000
we assume that it's all being fed through here.

326
0:22:14.132,000 --> 0:22:16,000
This is how we experience music.

327
0:22:16.7,000 --> 0:22:17,000
Of course, it's not.

328
0:22:18.395,000 --> 0:22:2,000
We experience thunder, thunder, thunder.

329
0:22:21.242,000 --> 0:22:22,000
Think, think, think.

330
0:22:22.463,000 --> 0:22:23,000
Listen, listen, listen.

331
0:22:24.852,000 --> 0:22:27,000
Now, what can we do with thunder?

332
0:22:29.266,000 --> 0:22:34,000
I remember my teacher, when I first started, my very first lesson,

333
0:22:34.684,000 --> 0:22:37,000
I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go.

334
0:22:38.093,000 --> 0:22:42,000
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,

335
0:22:42.913,000 --> 0:22:47,000
arms at a more or less 90-degree angle, sticks in a more or less V shape,

336
0:22:48.777,000 --> 0:22:51,000
keep this amount of space here, etc.

337
0:22:51.845,000 --> 0:22:53,000
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." --

338
0:22:54.423,000 --> 0:22:58,000
where I was just probably going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen,

339
0:22:58.611,000 --> 0:23:,000
and I would not be able to strike the drum

340
0:23:00.644,000 --> 0:23:02,000
because I was thinking of so many other things,

341
0:23:02.888,000 --> 0:23:04,000
he said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days,

342
0:23:05.475,000 --> 0:23:06,000
and I'll see you next week."

343
0:23:07.284,000 --> 0:23:09,000
So -- heavens! What was I to do?

344
0:23:09.713,000 --> 0:23:11,000
I no longer required the sticks.

345
0:23:12.215,000 --> 0:23:14,000
I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.

346
0:23:14.387,000 --> 0:23:17,000
I had to basically look at this particular drum,

347
0:23:18.048,000 --> 0:23:19,000
see how it was made,

348
0:23:19.745,000 --> 0:23:22,000
what these little lugs did, what the snares did.

349
0:23:22.785,000 --> 0:23:24,000
Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell.

350
0:23:25.761,000 --> 0:23:26,000
(Drum sounds)

351
0:23:27.498,000 --> 0:23:28,000
Experimented with the head.

352
0:23:28.868,000 --> 0:23:29,000
(Drum sounds)

353
0:23:30.354,000 --> 0:23:31,000
Experimented with my body.

354
0:23:32.158,000 --> 0:23:33,000
(Drum sounds)

355
0:23:33.976,000 --> 0:23:34,000
Experimented with jewelry.

356
0:23:35.824,000 --> 0:23:37,000
Experimented with all sorts of things.

357
0:23:37.936,000 --> 0:23:4,000
(Drum sounds)

358
0:23:44.356,000 --> 0:23:46,000
(Drum sounds end)

359
0:23:48.182,000 --> 0:23:51,000
And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises.

360
0:23:51.406,000 --> 0:23:52,000
(Laughter)

361
0:23:52.681,000 --> 0:23:55,000
But nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience,

362
0:23:56.065,000 --> 0:24:,000
because where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?

363
0:24:00.791,000 --> 0:24:03,000
Where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book?

364
0:24:04.801,000 --> 0:24:07,000
So we never, ever dealt with actual study books.

365
0:24:08.53,000 --> 0:24:1,000
So for example, one of the things that we learn

366
0:24:11.21,000 --> 0:24:15,000
when we are dealing with being a percussion player

367
0:24:15.918,000 --> 0:24:16,000
as opposed to a musician,

368
0:24:17.301,000 --> 0:24:2,000
is basically, straightforward single-stroke rolls.

369
0:24:20.93,000 --> 0:24:23,000
(Drum sounds)

370
0:24:24.578,000 --> 0:24:26,000
Like that, and then we get a little faster --

371
0:24:26.712,000 --> 0:24:27,000
(Drum sounds)

372
0:24:27.904,000 --> 0:24:28,000
and a little faster --

373
0:24:29.124,000 --> 0:24:3,000
(Drum sounds)

374
0:24:30.326,000 --> 0:24:32,000
and a little faster, and so on and so forth.

375
0:24:32.832,000 --> 0:24:33,000
What does this piece require?

376
0:24:34.295,000 --> 0:24:35,000
Single-stroke rolls.

377
0:24:35.694,000 --> 0:24:38,000
(Drum sound)

378
0:24:38.917,000 --> 0:24:41,000
So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music?

379
0:24:42.403,000 --> 0:24:44,000
And that's exactly what he did.

380
0:24:45.245,000 --> 0:24:5,000
And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student

381
0:24:50.619,000 --> 0:24:55,000
at a so-called "music institution," all of that went out of the window.

382
0:24:55.901,000 --> 0:24:57,000
We had to study from study books.

383
0:24:58.666,000 --> 0:25:02,000
And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to?

384
0:25:02.791,000 --> 0:25:03,000
I need to play a piece of music."

385
0:25:04.415,000 --> 0:25:05,000
"Well, this will help your control."

386
0:25:06.196,000 --> 0:25:08,000
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that?

387
0:25:08.779,000 --> 0:25:1,000
I need to relate it to a piece of music.

388
0:25:11.308,000 --> 0:25:13,000
You know, I need to say something.

389
0:25:13.894,000 --> 0:25:15,000
Why am I practicing paradiddles?

390
0:25:16.024,000 --> 0:25:19,000
(Drum sounds)

391
0:25:20.03,000 --> 0:25:23,000
Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control?

392
0:25:23.921,000 --> 0:25:24,000
Why am I doing that?

393
0:25:25.329,000 --> 0:25:27,000
I need to have the reason,

394
0:25:27.753,000 --> 0:25:32,000
and the reason has to be by saying something through the music."

395
0:25:33.358,000 --> 0:25:37,000
And by saying something through music, which basically is sound,

396
0:25:37.875,000 --> 0:25:41,000
we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people.

397
0:25:42.271,000 --> 0:25:46,000
But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage.

398
0:25:46.544,000 --> 0:25:48,000
That's up to you, when you walk through a hall,

399
0:25:48.792,000 --> 0:25:53,000
because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.

400
0:25:54.15,000 --> 0:25:59,000
I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry

401
0:25:59.455,000 --> 0:26:,000
when I play certain pieces of music,

402
0:26:01.267,000 --> 0:26:05,000
but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing.

403
0:26:06.168,000 --> 0:26:09,000
So please, the next time you go to a concert,

404
0:26:09.296,000 --> 0:26:12,000
just allow your body to open up,

405
0:26:12.965,000 --> 0:26:15,000
allow your body to be this resonating chamber.

406
0:26:16.071,000 --> 0:26:19,000
Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing

407
0:26:19.372,000 --> 0:26:2,000
as the performer is.

408
0:26:21.102,000 --> 0:26:24,000
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound,

409
0:26:24.866,000 --> 0:26:27,000
because they're hearing the contact of the stick --

410
0:26:28.446,000 --> 0:26:29,000
(Drum sound)

411
0:26:29.982,000 --> 0:26:31,000
on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood,

412
0:26:32.875,000 --> 0:26:34,000
or the bow on the string, etc.,

413
0:26:35.086,000 --> 0:26:39,000
or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.

414
0:26:39.248,000 --> 0:26:41,000
They're experiencing that rawness there.

415
0:26:41.793,000 --> 0:26:44,000
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure,

416
0:26:45.665,000 --> 0:26:48,000
which is before the sound is actually happening.

417
0:26:49.519,000 --> 0:26:55,000
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike,

418
0:26:56.099,000 --> 0:26:58,000
or breath, is being pulled.

419
0:26:58.528,000 --> 0:27:02,000
Just experience the whole journey of that sound

420
0:27:02.8,000 --> 0:27:05,000
in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey

421
0:27:06.422,000 --> 0:27:1,000
of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.

422
0:27:10.875,000 --> 0:27:14,000
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.

423
0:27:15.556,000 --> 0:27:17,000
But thank you very much for having me!

424
0:27:18.319,000 --> 0:27:21,000
(Applause)

425
0:27:24.262,000 --> 0:27:25,000
(Applause ends)

426
0:27:37.957,000 --> 0:27:4,000
(Music)

427
0:32:02.631,000 --> 0:32:04,000
(Music ends)

428
0:32:08.244,000 --> 0:32:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was asked by Wilsonart International,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a plastic laminate company, which is

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the largest plastic laminate company in the world --

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
they asked me to design

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a trade show booth

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in New York, in 2000.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So looking at their three main markets

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
for their product which were basically

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
transportation design,

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
interiors and furniture,

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we came up with the solution of taking

13
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
an old Airstream trailer and gutting it,

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and trying to portray laminate,

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and a trailer, in kind of a

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
fresh, new contemporary look.

17
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
When this trailer showed up at my shop

18
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.

20
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So I can be somebody that can look at this

21
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can

22
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I decided I had to do some research

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and really figure out what had gone wrong

25
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
somewhere along the history of Airstream.

26
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
What I discovered in these interiors is that

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
there was a disconnect between the exterior shell

28
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and the interior architecture of the pieces.

29
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In that the shell was originally conceived

30
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as a lightweight, modern, futuristic,

31
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and

32
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the interiors were completely out of sync with that.

33
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In fact it appeared like they

34
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
referenced a mountain cabin.

35
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
That seemed really like a crisis to me,

36
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that they had never been able to

37
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
develop a vocabulary

38
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
about escape, and about travel, and modernity

39
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.

40
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We really needed to do some archeology

41
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic

42
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in an Airstream trailer,

43
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.

44
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We stripped out all the vinyl

45
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and zolatone paint that was covering up

46
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
this just fantastic aluminum shell.

47
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We took off all the visible hardware and trim

48
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.

49
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer,

50
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
mocked it up in cardboard,

51
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong,

52
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
pull it out, put it back in.

53
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The main goal was to smooth out the interior,

54
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and begin to speak about motion,

55
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and mobility, and independence.

56
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers

57
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is that when you're designing there's actually no

58
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
logical place to stop and start materials

59
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
because of the continuous form of the trailer.

60
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling

61
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.

62
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So that became a challenge.

63
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Compounding that,

64
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the material of choice, laminate,

65
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that I was trying to highlight,

66
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
only bends in two dimensions.

67
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It's a compound curve interior.

68
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What I had to devise was

69
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a way of fooling the eye

70
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
into believing that all these panels

71
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
are curved with the shell.

72
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What I came up with was

73
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
a series of second skins

74
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that basically float over the aluminum shell.

75
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And what I was trying to do there was

76
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
direct your eye in the space,

77
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,

78
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and that the casework wouldn't break up the space.

79
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They also gave us a way to run power

80
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,

81
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
so they function as an electrical chase.

82
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
That's the trailer, pretty much finished.

83
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That trailer led to another commission,

84
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.

85
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.

86
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,

87
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.

88
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
He said one he would like to

89
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.

90
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.

91
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We came up with a fantasy scenario

92
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of a DJ traveling around the States,

93
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that would collect records and go on tours.

94
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This trailer housed two turntables,

95
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.

96
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,

97
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and basically we'd had a great time with this.

98
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,

99
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.

100
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
A lot of these ideas migrated into

101
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the production trailers for Airstream.

102
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.

103
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They came to me and said,

104
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?

105
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,

106
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
rock climbers, would use these things?"

107
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And I said, "Well, not in that interior."

108
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Anyway, I went out to Airstream

110
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
about six times during the process of building this prototype,

111
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and it's called the Bambi prototype.

112
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great,

113
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money

114
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
for tooling and molding."

115
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And I walked in their prototype facility, and

116
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
it's exactly like my shop, only bigger --

117
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
same tools, same things.

118
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me --

119
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,

120
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and there's no money for tooling or molding.

121
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.

122
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,

123
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,

124
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.

125
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
They didn't want to go to a componentized system.

126
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.

127
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

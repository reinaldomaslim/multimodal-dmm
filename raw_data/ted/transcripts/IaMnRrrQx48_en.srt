1
0:00:12.824,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County, New York.

2
0:00:16.517,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I've been a first responder in a number of incidents

3
0:00:18.359,000 --> 0:00:21,000
ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy.

4
0:00:21.677,000 --> 0:00:22,000
If you are like most people, death might be

5
0:00:23.421,000 --> 0:00:24,000
one of your greatest fears.

6
0:00:25.389,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Some of us will see it coming.

7
0:00:26.81,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Some of us won't.

8
0:00:28.809,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There is a little-known documented medical term

9
0:00:30.913,000 --> 0:00:31,000
called impending doom.

10
0:00:32.859,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It's almost a symptom.

11
0:00:34.186,000 --> 0:00:35,000
As a medical provider, I'm trained to respond

12
0:00:35.919,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to this symptom like any other,

13
0:00:37.741,000 --> 0:00:38,000
so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me

14
0:00:39.282,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and says, "I'm going to die today,"

15
0:00:41.51,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition.

16
0:00:45.236,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Throughout my career, I have responded

17
0:00:47.382,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to a number of incidents where the patient

18
0:00:49.328,000 --> 0:00:5,000
had minutes left to live

19
0:00:50.965,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and there was nothing I could do for them.

20
0:00:54.09,000 --> 0:00:56,000
With this, I was faced with a dilemma:

21
0:00:56.876,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death,

22
0:01:00.588,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or do I lie to them to comfort them?

23
0:01:03.615,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Early in my career, I faced this dilemma

24
0:01:05.808,000 --> 0:01:06,000
by simply lying.

25
0:01:07.366,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I was afraid.

26
0:01:09.295,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I was afraid if I told them the truth,

27
0:01:11.635,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that they would die in terror, in fear,

28
0:01:14.976,000 --> 0:01:17,000
just grasping for those last moments of life.

29
0:01:18.182,000 --> 0:01:2,000
That all changed with one incident.

30
0:01:20.95,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Five years ago, I responded to a motorcycle accident.

31
0:01:23.799,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The rider had suffered critical, critical injuries.

32
0:01:26.601,000 --> 0:01:28,000
As I assessed him, I realized that there was nothing

33
0:01:29.432,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that could be done for him,

34
0:01:31.399,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and like so many other cases, he looked me in the eye

35
0:01:34.664,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and asked that question: "Am I going to die?"

36
0:01:39.076,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In that moment, I decided to do something different.

37
0:01:42.582,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I decided to tell him the truth.

38
0:01:45.462,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I decided to tell him that he was going to die

39
0:01:48.556,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and that there was nothing I could do for him.

40
0:01:51.82,000 --> 0:01:54,000
His reaction shocked me to this day.

41
0:01:55.596,000 --> 0:01:56,000
He simply laid back and had a look

42
0:01:57.501,000 --> 0:01:59,000
of acceptance on his face.

43
0:01:59.927,000 --> 0:02:,000
He was not met with that terror or fear

44
0:02:01.63,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that I thought he would be.

45
0:02:04.01,000 --> 0:02:07,000
He simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes,

46
0:02:07.222,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I saw inner peace and acceptance.

47
0:02:09.95,000 --> 0:02:1,000
From that moment forward, I decided

48
0:02:11.688,000 --> 0:02:15,000
it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies.

49
0:02:16.402,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Having responded to many cases since then

50
0:02:19.147,000 --> 0:02:21,000
where patients were in their last moments

51
0:02:21.655,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and there was nothing I could do for them,

52
0:02:23.511,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in almost every case,

53
0:02:25.15,000 --> 0:02:28,000
they have all had the same reaction to the truth,

54
0:02:28.484,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of inner peace and acceptance.

55
0:02:30.55,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In fact, there are three patterns

56
0:02:32.972,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I have observed in all these cases.

57
0:02:37.247,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The first pattern always kind of shocked me.

58
0:02:40.903,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Regardless of religious belief or cultural background,

59
0:02:44.84,000 --> 0:02:46,000
there's a need for forgiveness.

60
0:02:47.675,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Whether they call it sin

61
0:02:49.221,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or they simply say they have a regret,

62
0:02:52.09,000 --> 0:02:54,000
their guilt is universal.

63
0:02:54.503,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I had once cared for an elderly gentleman

64
0:02:55.899,000 --> 0:02:57,000
who was having a massive heart attack.

65
0:02:58.317,000 --> 0:03:,000
As I prepared myself and my equipment

66
0:03:00.443,000 --> 0:03:02,000
for his imminent cardiac arrest,

67
0:03:03.368,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise.

68
0:03:07.721,000 --> 0:03:09,000
He already knew by my tone of voice and body language.

69
0:03:10.719,000 --> 0:03:12,000
As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest,

70
0:03:13.385,000 --> 0:03:14,000
prepping for what was going to happen,

71
0:03:15.289,000 --> 0:03:17,000
he looked me in the eye and said,

72
0:03:17.817,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren

73
0:03:20.517,000 --> 0:03:23,000
instead of being selfish with my time."

74
0:03:23.588,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Faced with imminent death,

75
0:03:25.92,000 --> 0:03:27,000
all he wanted was forgiveness.

76
0:03:28.854,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The second pattern I observe

77
0:03:30.742,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is the need for remembrance.

78
0:03:33.03,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts

79
0:03:35.287,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or their loved ones', they needed to feel

80
0:03:37.001,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that they would be living on.

81
0:03:39.15,000 --> 0:03:41,000
There's a need for immortality

82
0:03:41.474,000 --> 0:03:43,000
within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones,

83
0:03:44.118,000 --> 0:03:47,000
myself, my crew, or anyone around.

84
0:03:47.391,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Countless times, I have had a patient look me in the eyes

85
0:03:50.282,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and say, "Will you remember me?"

86
0:03:54.22,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The final pattern I observe

87
0:03:56.672,000 --> 0:03:59,000
always touched me the deepest, to the soul.

88
0:03:59.9,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The dying need to know that their life had meaning.

89
0:04:03.44,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They need to know that they did not waste their life

90
0:04:06.222,000 --> 0:04:08,000
on meaningless tasks.

91
0:04:09.17,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This came to me very, very early in my career.

92
0:04:12.319,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I had responded to a call.

93
0:04:14.408,000 --> 0:04:15,000
There was a female in her late 50s

94
0:04:16.332,000 --> 0:04:18,000
severely pinned within a vehicle.

95
0:04:18.39,000 --> 0:04:21,000
She had been t-boned at a high rate of speed,

96
0:04:22.068,000 --> 0:04:24,000
critical, critical condition.

97
0:04:24.5,000 --> 0:04:26,000
As the fire department worked to remove her from the car,

98
0:04:26.74,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I climbed in to begin to render care.

99
0:04:29.707,000 --> 0:04:32,000
As we talked, she had said to me,

100
0:04:32.767,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"There was so much more I wanted to do with my life."

101
0:04:35.98,000 --> 0:04:38,000
She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth.

102
0:04:39.832,000 --> 0:04:4,000
As we talked further, it would turn out

103
0:04:41.789,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that she was a mother of two adopted children

104
0:04:44.197,000 --> 0:04:47,000
who were both on their way to medical school.

105
0:04:47.312,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Because of her, two children

106
0:04:49.382,000 --> 0:04:51,000
had a chance they never would have had otherwise

107
0:04:52.1,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and would go on to save lives in the medical field

108
0:04:54.321,000 --> 0:04:56,000
as medical doctors.

109
0:04:56.683,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It would end up taking 45 minutes

110
0:04:58.472,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to free her from the vehicle.

111
0:05:00.339,000 --> 0:05:04,000
However, she perished prior to freeing her.

112
0:05:04.569,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I believed what you saw in the movies:

113
0:05:06.661,000 --> 0:05:07,000
when you're in those last moments

114
0:05:07.945,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that it's strictly terror, fear.

115
0:05:10.857,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I have come to realize, regardless of the circumstance,

116
0:05:13.535,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it's generally met with peace and acceptance,

117
0:05:16.448,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that it's the littlest things, the littlest moments,

118
0:05:20.14,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the littlest things you brought into the world

119
0:05:23.704,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that give you peace in those final moments.

120
0:05:26.633,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Thank you.

121
0:05:28.665,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Applause)

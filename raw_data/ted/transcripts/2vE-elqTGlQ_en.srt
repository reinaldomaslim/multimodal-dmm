1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So 24 years ago,

2
0:00:14.38,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was brought to The New Yorker

3
0:00:16.18,000 --> 0:00:17,000
as art editor

4
0:00:18.3,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to rejuvenate

5
0:00:21.86,000 --> 0:00:26,000
what had by then become a somewhat staid institution

6
0:00:26.9,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and to bring in new artists

7
0:00:29.42,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and to try to bring the magazine from its ivory tower

8
0:00:33.14,000 --> 0:00:36,000
into engaging with its time.

9
0:00:36.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And it was just the right thing for me to do

10
0:00:39.22,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because I've always been captivated by how an image can --

11
0:00:43.86,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a simple drawing --

12
0:00:45.58,000 --> 0:00:49,000
can cut through the torrent of images that we see every single day.

13
0:00:50.34,000 --> 0:00:52,000
How it can capture a moment,

14
0:00:52.82,000 --> 0:00:57,000
how it can crystallize a social trend or a complex event

15
0:00:58.06,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in a way that a lot of words wouldn't be able to do --

16
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and reduce it to its essence and turn it into a cartoon.

17
0:01:07.62,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So I went to the library

18
0:01:09.42,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I looked at the first cover drawn by Rea Irvin in 1925 --

19
0:01:15.38,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a dandy looking at a butterfly through his monocle,

20
0:01:20.58,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and we call it Eustace Tilley.

21
0:01:23.9,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I realized that as the magazine had become known

22
0:01:27.94,000 --> 0:01:32,000
for its in-depth research and long reports,

23
0:01:33.42,000 --> 0:01:35,000
some of the humor had gotten lost along the way,

24
0:01:36.38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because now often Eustace Tilley was seen as a haughty dandy,

25
0:01:41.3,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but in fact, in 1925,

26
0:01:44.42,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when Rea Irvin first drew this image,

27
0:01:47.86,000 --> 0:01:49,000
he did it as part of a humor magazine

28
0:01:50.66,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to amuse the youth of the era,

29
0:01:52.9,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which was the flappers of the roaring twenties.

30
0:01:56.9,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And in the library,

31
0:01:58.18,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I found the images that really captured the zeitgeist

32
0:02:03.14,000 --> 0:02:05,000
of the Great Depression.

33
0:02:05.58,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And it showed us not just how people dressed

34
0:02:10.02,000 --> 0:02:11,000
or what their cars looked like,

35
0:02:11.58,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but also what made them laugh,

36
0:02:14.86,000 --> 0:02:16,000
what their prejudices were.

37
0:02:17.18,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And you really got a sense

38
0:02:19.78,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of what it felt like to be alive in the '30s.

39
0:02:23.78,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I called on contemporary artists,

40
0:02:27.18,000 --> 0:02:29,000
such as Adrian Tomine here.

41
0:02:29.42,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I often call on narrative artists --

42
0:02:32.58,000 --> 0:02:34,000
cartoonists, children's book authors --

43
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and I give them themes such as,

44
0:02:38.66,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you know, what it's like to be in the subway,

45
0:02:41.02,000 --> 0:02:43,000
or Valentine's Day,

46
0:02:43.22,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they send me sketches.

47
0:02:44.62,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And once the sketches are approved by the editor,

48
0:02:48.54,000 --> 0:02:49,000
David Remnick,

49
0:02:51.06,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it's a go.

50
0:02:53.18,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I love the way

51
0:02:55.18,000 --> 0:03:,000
those images are actually not telling you what to think.

52
0:03:00.46,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But they do make you think,

53
0:03:02.7,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because the artist is actually --

54
0:03:07.74,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it's almost a puzzle;

55
0:03:09.02,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the artist is drawing the dots,

56
0:03:10.54,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and you, the reader, have to complete the picture.

57
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So to get this image on the left by Anita Kunz,

58
0:03:17.66,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or the one on right by Tomer Hanuka,

59
0:03:20.74,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you have to play spot the differences.

60
0:03:23.9,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And it is something that ...

61
0:03:27.54,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's really exciting to see

62
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
how the engagement with the reader ...

63
0:03:37.34,000 --> 0:03:41,000
how those images really capture --

64
0:03:42.3,000 --> 0:03:43,000
play with the stereotypes.

65
0:03:43.86,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But when you get it,

66
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it rearranges the stereotypes that are in your head.

67
0:03:49.38,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But the images don't just have to show people,

68
0:03:52.7,000 --> 0:03:54,000
sometimes it can be a feeling.

69
0:03:55.06,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Right after September 11,

70
0:03:57.94,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I was at a point,

71
0:04:00.62,000 --> 0:04:01,000
like everybody else,

72
0:04:01.86,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where I really didn't know how to deal with what we were going through,

73
0:04:07.1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I felt that no image could capture this moment,

74
0:04:12.54,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and I wanted to just do a black cover,

75
0:04:15.06,000 --> 0:04:16,000
like no cover.

76
0:04:16.78,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And I talked to my husband, cartoonist Art Spiegelman,

77
0:04:20.5,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and mentioned to him that I was going to propose that,

78
0:04:24.38,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and he said, "Oh, if you're going to do a black cover,

79
0:04:26.98,000 --> 0:04:3,000
then why don't you do the silhouette of the Twin Towers,

80
0:04:31.02,000 --> 0:04:32,000
black on black?"

81
0:04:32.58,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I sat down to draw this,

82
0:04:34.14,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and as soon as I saw it,

83
0:04:36.74,000 --> 0:04:37,000
a shiver ran down my spine

84
0:04:38.3,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I realized

85
0:04:40.46,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that in this refusal to make an image,

86
0:04:44.14,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we had found a way to capture loss

87
0:04:49.18,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and mourning

88
0:04:50.7,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and absence.

89
0:04:53.7,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And it's been a profound thing that I learned in the process --

90
0:04:58.1,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that sometimes some of the images that say the most

91
0:05:04.06,000 --> 0:05:07,000
do it with the most spare means.

92
0:05:07.7,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And a simple image can speak volumes.

93
0:05:11.3,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So this is the image that we published by Bob Staake

94
0:05:14.58,000 --> 0:05:17,000
right after the election of Barack Obama,

95
0:05:19.86,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and captured a historic moment.

96
0:05:23.14,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But we can't really plan for this,

97
0:05:25.38,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because in order to do this,

98
0:05:26.78,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we have to let the artist experience the emotions that we all feel

99
0:05:33.14,000 --> 0:05:34,000
when that is happening.

100
0:05:35.14,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So back in November 2016,

101
0:05:38.98,000 --> 0:05:4,000
during the election last year,

102
0:05:41.78,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the only image that we could publish was this,

103
0:05:44.94,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which was on the stand on the week that everybody voted.

104
0:05:48.9,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Because we knew somebody would feel this --

106
0:05:52.74,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:53.98,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when the result of the election was announced.

108
0:05:58.18,000 --> 0:06:,000
And when we found out the result,

109
0:06:02.42,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we really were at a loss,

110
0:06:04.3,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and this is the image that was sent by Bob Staake again,

111
0:06:10.34,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and that really hit a chord.

112
0:06:14.1,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And again,

113
0:06:15.38,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we can't really figure out what's going to come next,

114
0:06:21.86,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but here it felt like we didn't know how to move forward,

115
0:06:24.58,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but we did move forward,

116
0:06:26.06,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and this is the image that we published after Donald Trump's election

117
0:06:32.3,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and at the time of the Women's March

118
0:06:35.74,000 --> 0:06:36,000
all over the US.

119
0:06:37.94,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So over those 24 years,

120
0:06:39.82,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I have seen over 1,000 images come to life week after week,

121
0:06:44.62,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and I'm often asked which one is my favorite,

122
0:06:47.22,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but I can't pick one

123
0:06:49.1,000 --> 0:06:54,000
because what I'm most proud of is how different every image is,

124
0:06:55.06,000 --> 0:06:56,000
one from the other.

125
0:06:56.3,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And that's due to the talent and the diversity

126
0:06:59.78,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of all of the artists that contribute.

127
0:07:03.42,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And now, well,

128
0:07:05.22,000 --> 0:07:06,000
now, we're owned by Russia,

129
0:07:07.1,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so --

130
0:07:08.34,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

131
0:07:09.58,000 --> 0:07:11,000
In a rendering by Barry Blitt here,

132
0:07:12.3,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Eustace has become Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley.

133
0:07:17.54,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And the butterfly is none other than a flabbergasted Donald Trump

134
0:07:22.66,000 --> 0:07:23,000
flapping his wings,

135
0:07:23.9,000 --> 0:07:27,000
trying to figure out how to control the butterfly effect,

136
0:07:27.98,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and the famed logo that was drawn by Rae Irvin in 1925

137
0:07:33.58,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is now in Cyrillic.

138
0:07:35.74,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So, what makes me really excited about this moment

139
0:07:40.02,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is the way that ...

140
0:07:43.82,000 --> 0:07:47,000
You know, free press is essential to our democracy.

141
0:07:48.58,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And we can see from the sublime to the ridiculous

142
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that artists can capture what is going on

143
0:07:56.7,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in a way that an artist

144
0:07:59.34,000 --> 0:08:04,000
armed with just India ink and watercolor

145
0:08:04.5,000 --> 0:08:09,000
can capture and enter into the cultural dialogue.

146
0:08:10.5,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It puts those artists at the center of that culture,

147
0:08:15.5,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and that's exactly where I think they should be.

148
0:08:18.34,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Because the main thing we need right now is a good cartoon.

149
0:08:22.22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Thank you.

150
0:08:23.46,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Applause)

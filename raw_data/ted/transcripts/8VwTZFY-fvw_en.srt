1
0:00:13.461,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So if I told you that this was the face of pure joy,

2
0:00:19.177,000 --> 0:00:21,000
would you call me crazy?

3
0:00:22.678,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I wouldn't blame you,

4
0:00:23.918,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because every time I look at this Arctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit.

5
0:00:28.92,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I want to tell you a little bit about this photograph.

6
0:00:31.919,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was swimming around in the Lofoten Islands in Norway,

7
0:00:35.485,000 --> 0:00:36,000
just inside the Arctic Circle,

8
0:00:37.19,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and the water was hovering right at freezing.

9
0:00:40.348,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The air? A brisk -10 with windchill,

10
0:00:44.179,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands,

11
0:00:47.615,000 --> 0:00:51,000
feet and face, and rush to protect my vital organs.

12
0:00:52.375,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It was the coldest I've ever been.

13
0:00:55.069,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But even with swollen lips, sunken eyes, and cheeks flushed red,

14
0:00:59.921,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I have found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy.

15
0:01:06.562,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, when it comes to pain, psychologist Brock Bastian

16
0:01:09.627,000 --> 0:01:11,000
probably said it best when he wrote,

17
0:01:11.972,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness.

18
0:01:14.549,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment.

19
0:01:18.218,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It brutally draws us in

20
0:01:20.192,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation."

21
0:01:25.047,000 --> 0:01:28,000
If shivering is a form of meditation, then I would consider myself a monk.

22
0:01:28.537,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:29.387,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now, before we get into the why

24
0:01:32.266,000 --> 0:01:35,000
would anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water?

25
0:01:35.981,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I would love to give you a little perspective

26
0:01:38.558,000 --> 0:01:4,000
on what a day in my life can look like.

27
0:01:41.832,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Music)

28
0:02:28.017,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Video) Man: I mean, I know we were hoping for good waves,

29
0:02:31.544,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but I don't think anybody thought that was going to happen.

30
0:02:34.424,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I can't stop shaking.

31
0:02:36.095,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I am so cold.

32
0:02:40.344,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Music)

33
0:02:43.432,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Applause)

34
0:02:48.135,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Chris Burkard: So, surf photographer, right?

35
0:02:51.804,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I don't even know if it's a real job title, to be honest.

36
0:02:54.708,000 --> 0:02:56,000
My parents definitely didn't think so

37
0:02:56.844,000 --> 0:03:,000
when I told them at 19 I was quitting my job to pursue this dream career:

38
0:03:01.718,000 --> 0:03:05,000
blue skies, warm tropical beaches, and a tan that lasts all year long.

39
0:03:06.294,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I mean, to me, this was it. Life could not get any better.

40
0:03:10.125,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Sweating it out, shooting surfers in these exotic tourist destinations.

41
0:03:14.769,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But there was just this one problem.

42
0:03:16.51,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You see, the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations,

43
0:03:20.109,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the less gratifying it seemed to be.

44
0:03:23.104,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I set out seeking adventure, and what I was finding was only routine.

45
0:03:27.679,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It was things like wi-fi, TV, fine dining, and a constant cellular connection

46
0:03:32.439,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that to me were all the trappings of places heavily touristed

47
0:03:35.411,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in and out of the water,

48
0:03:37.709,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and it didn't take long for me to start feeling suffocated.

49
0:03:43.106,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I began craving wild, open spaces,

50
0:03:47.223,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and so I set out to find the places others had written off

51
0:03:50.665,000 --> 0:03:53,000
as too cold, too remote, and too dangerous to surf,

52
0:03:54.543,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and that challenge intrigued me.

53
0:03:57.353,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane,

54
0:04:01.485,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because if there's one thing I've realized,

55
0:04:04.109,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it's that any career,

56
0:04:05.961,000 --> 0:04:08,000
even one as seemingly glamorous as surf photography,

57
0:04:09.722,000 --> 0:04:11,000
has the danger of becoming monotonous.

58
0:04:12.648,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So in my search to break up this monotony, I realized something:

59
0:04:15.702,000 --> 0:04:17,000
There's only about a third of the Earth's oceans that are warm,

60
0:04:18.656,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and it's really just that thin band around the equator.

61
0:04:21.587,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So if I was going to find perfect waves,

62
0:04:24.095,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it was probably going to happen somewhere cold,

63
0:04:26.672,000 --> 0:04:27,000
where the seas are notoriously rough,

64
0:04:28.553,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and that's exactly where I began to look.

65
0:04:31.246,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And it was my first trip to Iceland

66
0:04:33.777,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that I felt like I found exactly what I was looking for.

67
0:04:36.846,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape,

68
0:04:40.023,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but most importantly, I couldn't believe we were finding perfect waves

69
0:04:44.219,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in such a remote and rugged part of the world.

70
0:04:47.639,000 --> 0:04:49,000
At one point, we got to the beach

71
0:04:49.915,000 --> 0:04:52,000
only to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline.

72
0:04:53.018,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They created this barrier between us and the surf,

73
0:04:55.371,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and we had to weave through this thing like a maze

74
0:04:57.761,000 --> 0:04:58,000
just to get out into the lineup.

75
0:04:59.348,000 --> 0:05:,000
and once we got there,

76
0:05:00.473,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves.

77
0:05:03.511,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It was an incredible experience, one I'll never forget,

78
0:05:07.468,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because amidst those harsh conditions,

79
0:05:10.254,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I felt like I stumbled onto one of the last quiet places,

80
0:05:14.976,000 --> 0:05:17,000
somewhere that I found a clarity and a connection with the world

81
0:05:17.991,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I knew I would never find on a crowded beach.

82
0:05:22.073,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I was hooked. I was hooked. (Laughter)

83
0:05:25.231,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Cold water was constantly on my mind,

84
0:05:28.087,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and from that point on,

85
0:05:29.399,000 --> 0:05:32,000
my career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments,

86
0:05:32.729,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and it took me to places like Russia, Norway, Alaska, Iceland, Chile,

87
0:05:36.605,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the Faroe Islands, and a lot of places in between.

88
0:05:39.534,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And one of my favorite things about these places

89
0:05:42.552,000 --> 0:05:45,000
was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there:

90
0:05:46.453,000 --> 0:05:48,000
hours, days, weeks spent on Google Earth

91
0:05:48.659,000 --> 0:05:52,000
trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to.

92
0:05:53.418,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And once we got there, the vehicles were just as creative:

93
0:05:56.848,000 --> 0:05:58,000
snowmobiles, six-wheel Soviet troop carriers,

94
0:05:59.757,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and a couple of super-sketchy helicopter flights.

95
0:06:03.054,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

96
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Helicopters really scare me, by the way.

97
0:06:08.51,000 --> 0:06:1,000
There was this one particularly bumpy boat ride

98
0:06:11.042,000 --> 0:06:14,000
up the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot,

99
0:06:14.158,000 --> 0:06:16,000
where we ended up watching helplessly from the water

100
0:06:16.777,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as bears ravaged our camp site.

101
0:06:19.168,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They walked off with our food and bits of our tent,

102
0:06:22.188,000 --> 0:06:25,000
clearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain

103
0:06:25.4,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and that this was their spot, not ours.

104
0:06:27.527,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But to me, that trip

105
0:06:29.454,000 --> 0:06:33,000
was a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches.

106
0:06:36.066,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now, it wasn't until I traveled to Norway -- (Laughter) --

107
0:06:40.123,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that I really learned to appreciate the cold.

108
0:06:44.294,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So this is the place

109
0:06:46.206,000 --> 0:06:49,000
where some of the largest, the most violent storms in the world

110
0:06:49.573,000 --> 0:06:52,000
send huge waves smashing into the coastline.

111
0:06:52.627,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We were in this tiny, remote fjord, just inside the Arctic Circle.

112
0:06:56.605,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It had a greater population of sheep than people,

113
0:06:59.151,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found.

114
0:07:02.936,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I was in the water taking pictures of surfers,

115
0:07:05.151,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and it started to snow.

116
0:07:08.241,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And then the temperature began to drop.

117
0:07:12.458,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And I told myself, there's not a chance you're getting out of the water.

118
0:07:15.843,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You traveled all this way, and this is exactly what you've been waiting for:

119
0:07:19.437,000 --> 0:07:21,000
freezing cold conditions with perfect waves.

120
0:07:21.519,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And although I couldn't even feel my finger to push the trigger,

121
0:07:24.537,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I knew I wasn't getting out.

122
0:07:26.049,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So I just did whatever I could. I shook it off, whatever.

123
0:07:28.842,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But that was the point that I felt

124
0:07:30.525,000 --> 0:07:32,000
this wind gush through the valley and hit me,

125
0:07:32.644,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full-on blizzard,

126
0:07:38.058,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and I started to lose perception of where I was.

127
0:07:42.932,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I didn't know if I was drifting out to sea or towards shore,

128
0:07:46.095,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and all I could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls

129
0:07:50.047,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and crashing waves.

130
0:07:52.81,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now, I knew this place had a reputation for sinking ships and grounding planes,

131
0:07:57.646,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and while I was out there floating, I started to get a little bit nervous.

132
0:08:02.609,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Actually, I was totally freaking out --

133
0:08:04.977,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Laughter) -- and I was borderline hypothermic,

134
0:08:08.414,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water.

135
0:08:11.595,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And I don't know if it was delirium setting in or what,

136
0:08:14.752,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but they told me later

137
0:08:16.912,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I had a smile on my face the entire time.

138
0:08:22.415,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now, it was this trip

139
0:08:24.528,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and probably that exact experience where I really began to feel

140
0:08:28.312,000 --> 0:08:31,000
like every photograph was precious,

141
0:08:32.272,000 --> 0:08:36,000
because all of a sudden in that moment, it was something I was forced to earn.

142
0:08:37.352,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And I realized, all this shivering had actually taught me something:

143
0:08:42.257,000 --> 0:08:46,000
In life, there are no shortcuts to joy.

144
0:08:47.12,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer

145
0:08:50.893,000 --> 0:08:51,000
just a little bit,

146
0:08:52.855,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and that tiny bit of suffering that I did for my photography,

147
0:08:56.547,000 --> 0:08:59,000
it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me

148
0:08:59.844,000 --> 0:09:01,000
than just trying to fill the pages of magazines.

149
0:09:03.9,000 --> 0:09:09,000
See, I gave a piece of myself in these places,

150
0:09:10.208,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and what I walked away with

151
0:09:12.755,000 --> 0:09:16,000
was a sense of fulfillment I had always been searching for.

152
0:09:18.326,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So I look back at this photograph.

153
0:09:21.298,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It's easy to see frozen fingers and cold wetsuits

154
0:09:26.018,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and even the struggle that it took just to get there,

155
0:09:29.082,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but most of all, what I see is just joy.

156
0:09:33.935,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Thank you so much.

157
0:09:35.996,000 --> 0:09:4,000

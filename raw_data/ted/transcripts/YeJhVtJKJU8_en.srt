1
0:00:18.49,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This is a river.

2
0:00:21.117,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This is a stream.

3
0:00:23.65,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This is a river.

4
0:00:26.004,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This is happening all over the country.

5
0:00:28.615,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States.

6
0:00:33.516,000 --> 0:00:37,000
On this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts.

7
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Similar problems are emerging in the East as well.

8
0:00:43.051,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details.

9
0:00:47.167,000 --> 0:00:51,000
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone.

10
0:00:52.915,000 --> 0:00:55,000
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife.

11
0:00:56.505,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They're the veins of the ecosystem,

12
0:00:59.489,000 --> 0:01:,000
and they're often empty veins.

13
0:01:03.224,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams,

14
0:01:06.495,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because it's an archetype for the larger story.

15
0:01:09.959,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is Prickly Pear Creek.

16
0:01:11.723,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena.

17
0:01:17.2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout.

18
0:01:22.876,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years ...

19
0:01:28.39,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it looked like this in the summer.

20
0:01:30.603,000 --> 0:01:31,000
How did we get here?

21
0:01:33.087,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Well, it started back in the late 1800s

22
0:01:36.286,000 --> 0:01:38,000
when people started settling in places like Montana.

23
0:01:39.55,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people.

24
0:01:44.351,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But as more people showed up wanting water,

25
0:01:46.385,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the folks who were there first got a little concerned,

26
0:01:49.362,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.

27
0:01:54.014,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream.

28
0:01:58.569,000 --> 0:02:,000
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream,

29
0:02:01.551,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and the folks who were there first

30
0:02:03.202,000 --> 0:02:05,000
got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers.

31
0:02:05.894,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872,

32
0:02:09.385,000 --> 0:02:11,000
both involving Prickly Pear Creek.

33
0:02:12.01,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And in 1921,

34
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear

35
0:02:18.359,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that the folks who were there first had the first, or "senior water rights."

36
0:02:24.824,000 --> 0:02:26,000
These senior water rights are key.

37
0:02:28.066,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The problem is that all over the West now it looks like this.

38
0:02:31.925,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Some of these creeks have claims

39
0:02:33.73,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream.

40
0:02:38.568,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right,

41
0:02:43.438,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they risk losing their water right --

42
0:02:46.333,000 --> 0:02:48,000
along with the economic value that goes with it.

43
0:02:49.034,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So they have no incentive to conserve.

44
0:02:52.44,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So it's not just about the number of people;

45
0:02:55.781,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve

46
0:02:59.194,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because you can lose your water right if you don't use it.

47
0:03:03.559,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So after decades of lawsuits and 140 years, now, of experience,

48
0:03:07.578,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we still have this.

49
0:03:11.103,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's a broken system.

50
0:03:12.904,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There's a disincentive to conserve,

51
0:03:14.928,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because if you don't use your water right, you can lose your water right.

52
0:03:18.543,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts

53
0:03:21.796,000 --> 0:03:24,000
between the agricultural and environmental communities.

54
0:03:25.811,000 --> 0:03:27,000
OK, now I'm going to change gears here.

55
0:03:29.225,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free ...

56
0:03:32.994,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:34.045,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer.

58
0:03:36.853,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:39.848,000 --> 0:03:41,000
There's another thing happening around the country,

60
0:03:42.322,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which is that companies are starting to get concerned

61
0:03:44.837,000 --> 0:03:45,000
about their water footprint.

62
0:03:46.495,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water,

63
0:03:49.607,000 --> 0:03:51,000
they're trying to be really efficient with their water use,

64
0:03:52.514,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and they're concerned about how their water use

65
0:03:54.75,000 --> 0:03:55,000
affects the image of their brand.

66
0:03:57.529,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Well, it's a national problem,

67
0:03:59.104,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana ...

68
0:04:01.808,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and it involves beer.

69
0:04:03.985,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water

70
0:04:06.956,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to make a pint of beer.

71
0:04:08.593,000 --> 0:04:09,000
If you include all the drain,

72
0:04:10.586,000 --> 0:04:13,000
it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer.

73
0:04:14.161,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now the brewers in Montana

74
0:04:15.633,000 --> 0:04:18,000
have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption,

75
0:04:19.587,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but they still use millions of gallons of water.

76
0:04:21.876,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I mean, there's water in beer.

77
0:04:25.428,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint

78
0:04:31.759,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that can have serious effects on the ecosystem?

79
0:04:35.436,000 --> 0:04:37,000
These ecosystems are really important

80
0:04:37.748,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to the Montana brewers and their customers.

81
0:04:39.81,000 --> 0:04:42,000
After all, there's a strong correlation between water and fishing,

82
0:04:43.479,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and for some, there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer.

83
0:04:47.73,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:49.261,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned

85
0:04:52.885,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and they're looking for some way to address the problem.

86
0:04:55.586,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So how can they address this remaining water footprint?

87
0:04:59.229,000 --> 0:05:,000
Remember Prickly Pear.

88
0:05:00.758,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Up until now, business water stewardship

89
0:05:04.961,000 --> 0:05:07,000
has been limited to measuring and reducing,

90
0:05:09.235,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore.

91
0:05:13.383,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Remember Prickly Pear.

92
0:05:14.579,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It's a broken system.

93
0:05:15.827,000 --> 0:05:17,000
You've got a disincentive to conserve,

94
0:05:17.894,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.

95
0:05:21.663,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds --

96
0:05:24.074,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the world of the companies with their water footprints

97
0:05:27.419,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and the world of the farmers

98
0:05:29.05,000 --> 0:05:31,000
with their senior water rights on these creeks.

99
0:05:31.523,000 --> 0:05:32,000
In some states,

100
0:05:33.584,000 --> 0:05:37,000
senior water rights holders can leave their water in the stream

101
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
while legally protecting it from others,

102
0:05:42.303,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and maintaining their water right.

103
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
After all, it is their water right,

104
0:05:48.438,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream,

105
0:05:52.981,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it's their right to do so.

106
0:05:55.395,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But they have no incentive to do so.

107
0:06:00.062,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So, working with local water trusts, we created an incentive to do so.

108
0:06:05.36,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We pay them to leave their water in stream.

109
0:06:09.536,000 --> 0:06:1,000
That's what's happening here.

110
0:06:10.954,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion,

111
0:06:15.781,000 --> 0:06:17,000
leaving the water in the stream.

112
0:06:17.98,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He doesn't lose the water right,

113
0:06:19.645,000 --> 0:06:23,000
he just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it,

114
0:06:24.438,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to the stream, instead of to the land.

115
0:06:27.692,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Because he's the senior water-rights holder,

116
0:06:30.097,000 --> 0:06:33,000
he can protect the water from other users in the stream.

117
0:06:34.21,000 --> 0:06:35,000
OK?

118
0:06:35.534,000 --> 0:06:37,000
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream.

119
0:06:39.468,000 --> 0:06:42,000
This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream.

120
0:06:43.825,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We then take the measured water,

121
0:06:46.335,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we divide it into thousand-gallon increments.

122
0:06:49.5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate,

123
0:06:53.158,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and then the brewers and others buy those certificates

124
0:06:56.57,000 --> 0:07:,000
as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems.

125
0:07:00.659,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The brewers pay to restore water to the stream.

126
0:07:05.932,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way

127
0:07:10.133,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to return water to these degraded ecosystems,

128
0:07:12.867,000 --> 0:07:14,000
while giving farmers an economic choice

129
0:07:15.784,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints

130
0:07:18.692,000 --> 0:07:19,000
an easy way to deal with them.

131
0:07:20.737,000 --> 0:07:26,000
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams,

132
0:07:27.576,000 --> 0:07:3,000
a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved,

133
0:07:33.047,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution --

134
0:07:37.253,000 --> 0:07:39,000
a solution that does not require litigation.

135
0:07:41.735,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints

136
0:07:46.641,000 --> 0:07:49,000
a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed,

137
0:07:51.246,000 --> 0:07:53,000
into these degraded ecosystems,

138
0:07:53.768,000 --> 0:07:58,000
while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice

139
0:07:59.523,000 --> 0:08:,000
about how their water is used.

140
0:08:01.456,000 --> 0:08:03,000
These transactions create allies, not enemies.

141
0:08:04.163,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They connect people rather than dividing them.

142
0:08:06.642,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities.

143
0:08:10.38,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And most importantly, it's working.

144
0:08:12.388,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.

145
0:08:17.081,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We've connected senior water-rights holders

146
0:08:19.134,000 --> 0:08:2,000
with brewers in Montana,

147
0:08:20.606,000 --> 0:08:22,000
with hotels and tea companies in Oregon,

148
0:08:23.342,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest.

149
0:08:26.971,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And when we make these connections,

150
0:08:29.383,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we can and we do turn this ...

151
0:08:33.223,000 --> 0:08:34,000
into this.

152
0:08:34.823,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Applause)

153
0:08:36.217,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Thank you very much.

154
0:08:37.694,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Applause)

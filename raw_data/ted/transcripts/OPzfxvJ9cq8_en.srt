1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Imagine being unable to say, "I am hungry," "I am in pain,"

2
0:00:18.28,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"thank you," or "I love you."

3
0:00:20.84,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Being trapped inside your body,

4
0:00:22.96,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a body that doesn't respond to commands.

5
0:00:26.12,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Surrounded by people,

6
0:00:27.8,000 --> 0:00:28,000
yet utterly alone.

7
0:00:29.44,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Wishing you could reach out,

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to connect, to comfort, to participate.

9
0:00:35.4,000 --> 0:00:38,000
For 13 long years, that was my reality.

10
0:00:39.52,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Most of us never think twice about talking, about communicating.

11
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I've thought a lot about it.

12
0:00:47.24,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I've had a lot of time to think.

13
0:00:49.92,000 --> 0:00:51,000
For the first 12 years of my life,

14
0:00:52.04,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.

15
0:00:54.76,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Then everything changed.

16
0:00:56.92,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I contracted a brain infection.

17
0:00:59.2,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The doctors weren't sure what it was,

18
0:01:01.52,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but they treated me the best they could.

19
0:01:04.04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
However, I progressively got worse.

20
0:01:07.44,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Eventually, I lost my ability to control my movements,

21
0:01:11.64,000 --> 0:01:12,000
make eye contact,

22
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and finally, my ability to speak.

23
0:01:17.28,000 --> 0:01:18,000
While in hospital,

24
0:01:18.52,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I desperately wanted to go home.

25
0:01:21.12,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I said to my mother, "When home?"

26
0:01:24.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Those were the last words I ever spoke with my own voice.

27
0:01:28.92,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I would eventually fail every test for mental awareness.

28
0:01:32.76,000 --> 0:01:34,000
My parents were told I was as good as not there.

29
0:01:35.6,000 --> 0:01:39,000
A vegetable, having the intelligence of a three-month-old baby.

30
0:01:40.24,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable

31
0:01:43.92,000 --> 0:01:44,000
until I died.

32
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My parents, in fact my entire family's lives,

33
0:01:49.56,000 --> 0:01:53,000
became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how.

34
0:01:53.88,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Their friends drifted away.

35
0:01:56.24,000 --> 0:01:57,000
One year turned to two,

36
0:01:58.08,000 --> 0:01:59,000
two turned to three.

37
0:02:00.24,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It seemed like the person I once was began to disappear.

38
0:02:04.68,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The Lego blocks and electronic circuits I'd loved as a boy were put away.

39
0:02:09.6,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one.

40
0:02:14.08,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I had become a ghost,

41
0:02:15.8,000 --> 0:02:19,000
a faded memory of a boy people once knew and loved.

42
0:02:20.199,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Meanwhile, my mind began knitting itself back together.

43
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Gradually, my awareness started to return.

44
0:02:27.52,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But no one realized that I had come back to life.

45
0:02:30.88,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I was aware of everything,

46
0:02:32.72,000 --> 0:02:34,000
just like any normal person.

47
0:02:34.76,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I could see and understand everything,

48
0:02:37.08,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but I couldn't find a way to let anybody know.

49
0:02:40.56,000 --> 0:02:43,000
My personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body,

50
0:02:44.56,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis.

51
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The stark reality hit me that I was going to spend

52
0:02:51.68,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the rest of my life locked inside myself,

53
0:02:54.36,000 --> 0:02:55,000
totally alone.

54
0:02:56.08,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I was trapped with only my thoughts for company.

55
0:02:59.72,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I would never be rescued.

56
0:03:01.92,000 --> 0:03:03,000
No one would ever show me tenderness.

57
0:03:04.88,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I would never talk to a friend.

58
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
No one would ever love me.

59
0:03:09.92,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I had no dreams, no hope, nothing to look forward to.

60
0:03:14.08,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Well, nothing pleasant.

61
0:03:16.6,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I lived in fear,

62
0:03:17.96,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and, to put it bluntly,

63
0:03:19.52,000 --> 0:03:22,000
was waiting for death to finally release me,

64
0:03:22.6,000 --> 0:03:25,000
expecting to die all alone in a care home.

65
0:03:26.52,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I don't know if it's truly possible to express in words

66
0:03:29.92,000 --> 0:03:31,000
what it's like not to be able to communicate.

67
0:03:32.76,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Your personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog

68
0:03:36.2,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and all of your emotions and desires are constricted, stifled and muted within you.

69
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
For me, the worst was the feeling of utter powerlessness.

70
0:03:46.52,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I simply existed.

71
0:03:48.68,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It's a very dark place to find yourself

72
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because in a sense, you have vanished.

73
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Other people controlled every aspect of my life.

74
0:03:58.24,000 --> 0:04:,000
They decided what I ate and when.

75
0:04:00.56,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Whether I was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair.

76
0:04:04.56,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I often spent my days positioned in front of the TV

77
0:04:07.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
watching Barney reruns.

78
0:04:10.44,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I think because Barney is so happy and jolly,

79
0:04:13.36,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and I absolutely wasn't,

80
0:04:15.12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
it made it so much worse.

81
0:04:17.8,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I was completely powerless to change anything in my life

82
0:04:21.24,000 --> 0:04:23,000
or people's perceptions of me.

83
0:04:23.72,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I was a silent, invisible observer of how people behaved

84
0:04:27.32,000 --> 0:04:29,000
when they thought no one was watching.

85
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.

86
0:04:33.44,000 --> 0:04:36,000
With no way to communicate, I became the perfect victim:

87
0:04:37.44,000 --> 0:04:4,000
a defenseless object, seemingly devoid of feelings

88
0:04:41.44,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that people used to play out their darkest desires.

89
0:04:45.2,000 --> 0:04:48,000
For more than 10 years, people who were charged with my care

90
0:04:48.88,000 --> 0:04:51,000
abused me physically, verbally and sexually.

91
0:04:52.76,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Despite what they thought, I did feel.

92
0:04:56.4,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The first time it happened,

93
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
I was shocked and filled with disbelief.

94
0:05:00.84,000 --> 0:05:01,000
How could they do this to me?

95
0:05:03.12,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I was confused.

96
0:05:04.72,000 --> 0:05:06,000
What had I done to deserve this?

97
0:05:07.44,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight.

98
0:05:11.52,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Hurt, sadness and anger flooded through me.

99
0:05:15.28,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I felt worthless.

100
0:05:17.08,000 --> 0:05:18,000
There was no one to comfort me.

101
0:05:20.08,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But neither of my parents knew this was happening.

102
0:05:23.36,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I lived in terror, knowing it would happen again and again.

103
0:05:27.44,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I just never knew when.

104
0:05:29.56,000 --> 0:05:31,000
All I knew was that I would never be the same.

105
0:05:33.36,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I remember once listening to Whitney Houston singing,

106
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity."

107
0:05:41.88,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I thought to myself, "You want to bet?"

108
0:05:47.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Perhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped.

109
0:05:50.88,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But the years of constant caretaking,

110
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
having to wake up every two hours to turn me,

111
0:05:56.08,000 --> 0:05:59,000
combined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son,

112
0:05:59.48,000 --> 0:06:02,000
had taken a toll on my mother and father.

113
0:06:02.84,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Following yet another heated argument between my parents,

114
0:06:06.44,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in a moment of despair and desperation,

115
0:06:09.08,000 --> 0:06:12,000
my mother turned to me and told me that I should die.

116
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I was shocked, but as I thought about what she had said,

117
0:06:17.32,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother,

118
0:06:21.36,000 --> 0:06:22,000
yet I could do nothing about it.

119
0:06:24.64,000 --> 0:06:26,000
There were many moments when I gave up,

120
0:06:27.04,000 --> 0:06:29,000
sinking into a dark abyss.

121
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I remember one particularly low moment.

122
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:34,000
My dad left me alone in the car

123
0:06:34.88,000 --> 0:06:37,000
while he quickly went to buy something from the store.

124
0:06:38.48,000 --> 0:06:4,000
A random stranger walked past,

125
0:06:41.12,000 --> 0:06:43,000
looked at me and he smiled.

126
0:06:44.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I may never know why, but that simple act,

127
0:06:48.04,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the fleeting moment of human connection,

128
0:06:50.36,000 --> 0:06:52,000
transformed how I was feeling,

129
0:06:52.76,000 --> 0:06:53,000
making me want to keep going.

130
0:06:55.76,000 --> 0:06:57,000
My existence was tortured by monotony,

131
0:06:58.72,000 --> 0:07:01,000
a reality that was often too much to bear.

132
0:07:01.76,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Alone with my thoughts, I constructed intricate fantasies

133
0:07:05.92,000 --> 0:07:08,000
about ants running across the floor.

134
0:07:09.32,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I taught myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were.

135
0:07:14.44,000 --> 0:07:18,000
As I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed,

136
0:07:18.6,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home.

137
0:07:23.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Seeing my father walk through the door to collect me

138
0:07:26.56,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was the best moment of the day.

139
0:07:29.6,000 --> 0:07:31,000
My mind became a tool that I could use

140
0:07:31.96,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to either close down to retreat from my reality

141
0:07:34.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
or enlarge into a gigantic space that I could fill with fantasies.

142
0:07:39.8,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I hoped that my reality would change

143
0:07:41.8,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and someone would see that I had come back to life.

144
0:07:44.68,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But I had been washed away like a sand castle

145
0:07:47.4,000 --> 0:07:49,000
built too close to the waves,

146
0:07:49.56,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and in my place was the person people expected me to be.

147
0:07:53.76,000 --> 0:07:56,000
To some I was Martin, a vacant shell, the vegetable,

148
0:07:57.56,000 --> 0:08:01,000
deserving of harsh words, dismissal and even abuse.

149
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
To others, I was the tragically brain-damaged boy

150
0:08:04.96,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who had grown to become a man.

151
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Someone they were kind to and cared for.

152
0:08:10.4,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Good or bad, I was a blank canvas

153
0:08:12.92,000 --> 0:08:15,000
onto which different versions of myself were projected.

154
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It took someone new to see me in a different way.

155
0:08:20.48,000 --> 0:08:24,000
An aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week.

156
0:08:24.76,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Whether through intuition or her attention to details

157
0:08:27.76,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that others failed to notice,

158
0:08:29.8,000 --> 0:08:33,000
she became convinced that I could understand what was being said.

159
0:08:33.96,000 --> 0:08:36,000
She urged my parents to have me tested by experts

160
0:08:37.48,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in augmentative and alternative communication.

161
0:08:40.8,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And within a year,

162
0:08:42.04,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I was beginning to use a computer program to communicate.

163
0:08:46.12,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It was exhilarating, but frustrating at times.

164
0:08:49.88,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I had so many words in my mind,

165
0:08:51.88,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that I couldn't wait to be able to share them.

166
0:08:54.72,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Sometimes, I would say things to myself simply because I could.

167
0:08:59.48,000 --> 0:09:01,000
In myself, I had a ready audience,

168
0:09:02.12,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and I believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes,

169
0:09:05.28,000 --> 0:09:06,000
others would listen, too.

170
0:09:07.04,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But as I began to communicate more,

171
0:09:09.32,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I realized that it was in fact only just the beginning

172
0:09:12.52,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of creating a new voice for myself.

173
0:09:15.48,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I was thrust into a world I didn't quite know how to function in.

174
0:09:19.84,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I stopped going to the care home

175
0:09:21.52,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and managed to get my first job making photocopies.

176
0:09:25.4,000 --> 0:09:28,000
As simple as this may sound, it was amazing.

177
0:09:28.88,000 --> 0:09:3,000
My new world was really exciting

178
0:09:30.92,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but often quite overwhelming and frightening.

179
0:09:33.76,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I was like a man-child,

180
0:09:35.6,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and as liberating as it often was,

181
0:09:37.72,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I struggled.

182
0:09:39.48,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time

183
0:09:43.04,000 --> 0:09:47,000
found it impossible to abandon the idea of Martin they had in their heads.

184
0:09:47.72,000 --> 0:09:48,000
While those I had only just met

185
0:09:49.36,000 --> 0:09:52,000
struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair.

186
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I realized that some people would only listen to me

187
0:09:56.76,000 --> 0:09:59,000
if what I said was in line with what they expected.

188
0:09:59.8,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Otherwise, it was disregarded

189
0:10:01.84,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and they did what they felt was best.

190
0:10:04.52,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I discovered that true communication

191
0:10:06.56,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is about more than merely physically conveying a message.

192
0:10:10.4,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It is about getting the message heard and respected.

193
0:10:14.96,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Still, things were going well.

194
0:10:17.24,000 --> 0:10:19,000
My body was slowly getting stronger.

195
0:10:19.84,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I had a job in computing that I loved,

196
0:10:22.32,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and had even got Kojak, the dog I had been dreaming about for years.

197
0:10:27.24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
However, I longed to share my life with someone.

198
0:10:31.2,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work,

199
0:10:35.64,000 --> 0:10:39,000
thinking I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to.

200
0:10:40.36,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Just as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life,

201
0:10:44.84,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I met Joan.

202
0:10:46.64,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Not only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me,

203
0:10:50.12,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but Joan helped me to challenge my own misconceptions about myself.

204
0:10:55.04,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Joan said it was through my words that she fell in love with me.

205
0:10:59.68,000 --> 0:11:01,000
However, after all I had been through,

206
0:11:02.48,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I still couldn't shake the belief

207
0:11:04.24,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that nobody could truly see beyond my disability

208
0:11:07.48,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and accept me for who I am.

209
0:11:10.08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I also really struggled to comprehend that I was a man.

210
0:11:14.28,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The first time someone referred to me as a man,

211
0:11:17.12,000 --> 0:11:19,000
it stopped me in my tracks.

212
0:11:19.44,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I felt like looking around and asking, "Who, me?"

213
0:11:24.08,000 --> 0:11:26,000
That all changed with Joan.

214
0:11:26.28,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We have an amazing connection

215
0:11:27.88,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly.

216
0:11:32.56,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought.

217
0:11:37.52,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I started to feel whole again, a man worthy of love.

218
0:11:41.84,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I began to reshape my destiny.

219
0:11:44.32,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I spoke up a little more at work.

220
0:11:46.56,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I asserted my need for independence to the people around me.

221
0:11:50.96,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Being given a means of communication changed everything.

222
0:11:54.84,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions

223
0:11:59.08,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of those around me and those I had of myself.

224
0:12:02.68,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Communication is what makes us human,

225
0:12:05.4,000 --> 0:12:07,000
enabling us to connect on the deepest level

226
0:12:07.72,000 --> 0:12:08,000
with those around us --

227
0:12:09.68,000 --> 0:12:1,000
telling our own stories,

228
0:12:11.28,000 --> 0:12:14,000
expressing wants, needs and desires,

229
0:12:14.92,000 --> 0:12:17,000
or hearing those of others by really listening.

230
0:12:18.08,000 --> 0:12:21,000
All this is how the world knows who we are.

231
0:12:21.44,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So who are we without it?

232
0:12:24.48,000 --> 0:12:27,000
True communication increases understanding

233
0:12:27.68,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and creates a more caring and compassionate world.

234
0:12:31.8,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Once, I was perceived to be an inanimate object,

235
0:12:34.92,000 --> 0:12:37,000
a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair.

236
0:12:38.24,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Today, I am so much more.

237
0:12:40.52,000 --> 0:12:42,000
A husband, a son, a friend,

238
0:12:42.96,000 --> 0:12:46,000
a brother, a business owner, a first-class honors graduate,

239
0:12:47.24,000 --> 0:12:49,000
a keen amateur photographer.

240
0:12:49.6,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It is my ability to communicate that has given me all this.

241
0:12:54.32,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We are told that actions speak louder than words.

242
0:12:58.04,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But I wonder,

243
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:01,000
do they?

244
0:13:02.88,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Our words, however we communicate them,

245
0:13:05.56,000 --> 0:13:07,000
are just as powerful.

246
0:13:07.68,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Whether we speak the words with our own voices,

247
0:13:10.44,000 --> 0:13:11,000
type them with our eyes,

248
0:13:11.8,000 --> 0:13:15,000
or communicate them non-verbally to someone who speaks them for us,

249
0:13:16.08,000 --> 0:13:18,000
words are among our most powerful tools.

250
0:13:20.4,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I have come to you through a terrible darkness,

251
0:13:23.24,000 --> 0:13:25,000
pulled from it by caring souls

252
0:13:25.36,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and by language itself.

253
0:13:27.72,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light.

254
0:13:31.76,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We are shining here together.

255
0:13:34.08,000 --> 0:13:38,000
If there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating,

256
0:13:38.4,000 --> 0:13:39,000
it is that sometimes I want to shout

257
0:13:40.36,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude.

258
0:13:44.68,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It all sounds the same.

259
0:13:46.96,000 --> 0:13:47,000
But if you will,

260
0:13:48.4,000 --> 0:13:51,000
please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can:

261
0:13:54.48,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Thank you.

262
0:13:56.28,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Applause)

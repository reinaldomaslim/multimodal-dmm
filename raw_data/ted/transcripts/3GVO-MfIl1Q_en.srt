(Music)

3
0:00:32.346,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Music)

0:01:11.917,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Music ends)

5
0:01:18.98,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Applause)

6
0:01:24.657,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So, that's what I've done with my life.

7
0:01:26.623,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

8
0:01:28.105,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Applause)

9
0:01:30.737,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Thank you.

10
0:01:31.914,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Applause)

11
0:01:37.312,000 --> 0:01:39,000
As a kid, I grew up on a farm in Florida,

12
0:01:39.833,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I did what most little kids do.

13
0:01:41.788,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I played a little baseball, did a few other things like that,

14
0:01:45.524,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but I always had the sense of being an outsider,

15
0:01:47.834,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and it wasn't until I saw pictures in the magazines

16
0:01:50.699,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that a couple other guys skate, I thought,

17
0:01:52.976,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"Wow, that's for me," you know?

18
0:01:54.52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Because there was no coach standing directly over you,

19
0:01:57.144,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and these guys, they were just being themselves.

20
0:01:59.424,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There was no opponent directly across from you.

21
0:02:01.67,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I loved that sense, so I started skating

22
0:02:04.962,000 --> 0:02:07,000
when I was about 10 years old, in 1977,

23
0:02:08.235,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and when I did, I picked it up pretty quickly.

24
0:02:11.38,000 --> 0:02:14,000
In fact, here's some footage from about 1984.

25
0:02:14.933,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It wasn't until 79 I won my first amateur championship,

26
0:02:20.076,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and then, by 81, I was 14, and I won my first world championship,

27
0:02:26.222,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which was amazing to me,

28
0:02:28.414,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and in a very real sense, that was the first real victory I had.

29
0:02:31.503,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Oh, watch this.

30
0:02:32.692,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is a Casper slide, where the board's upside down.

31
0:02:35.251,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Mental note on that one.

32
0:02:36.863,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:38.347,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And this one here?

34
0:02:39.851,000 --> 0:02:4,000
An ollie.

35
0:02:42.7,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So, as she mentioned, that is overstated for sure,

36
0:02:46.899,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but that's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating.

37
0:02:51.197,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Here's some images of that.

38
0:02:58.041,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Now, I was about halfway through my pro career

39
0:03:01.072,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in, I would say, the mid-'80s.

40
0:03:04.439,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Freestyle itself -- we developed all these flat ground tricks, as you saw,

41
0:03:08.195,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding,

42
0:03:11.478,000 --> 0:03:15,000
where guys were taking it to the streets, and they were using that ollie,

43
0:03:16.322,000 --> 0:03:17,000
like I showed you.

44
0:03:17.73,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails

45
0:03:21.077,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff.

46
0:03:23.905,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So it was evolving upwards.

47
0:03:26.178,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In fact, when someone tells you they're a skater today,

48
0:03:28.91,000 --> 0:03:29,000
they pretty much mean a street skater,

49
0:03:30.905,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because freestyle, it took about five years for it to die,

50
0:03:34.215,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and at that stage, I'd been a "champion" champion for 11 years, which --

51
0:03:40.294,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Phew!

52
0:03:41.76,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And suddenly, it was over for me, that's it -- it was gone.

53
0:03:45.333,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They took my pro model off the shelf,

54
0:03:47.821,000 --> 0:03:49,000
which was essentially pronouncing you dead, publicly.

55
0:03:50.657,000 --> 0:03:51,000
That's how you make your money, you know?

56
0:03:52.644,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes.

57
0:03:55.964,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I had all that stuff, and it's gone.

58
0:03:59.051,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The crazy thing was, there was a really liberating sense about it,

59
0:04:02.488,000 --> 0:04:06,000
because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion.

60
0:04:07.098,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"Champion," again.

61
0:04:08.302,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Champion sounds so goofy, but it's what it was, right?

62
0:04:10.877,000 --> 0:04:13,000
What drew me to skateboarding, the freedom,

63
0:04:14.503,000 --> 0:04:16,000
was now restored, where I could just create things,

64
0:04:17.078,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because that's where the joy was for me, always,

65
0:04:19.954,000 --> 0:04:21,000
was creating new stuff.

66
0:04:22.148,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from

67
0:04:25.703,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that were rooted in these flat ground tricks.

68
0:04:27.956,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different.

69
0:04:30.978,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, as humbling and rotten as it was —

70
0:04:32.832,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And believe me, it was rotten.

71
0:04:34.564,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I would go to skate spots, and I was already "famous guy," right?

72
0:04:38.926,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And everyone thought I was good,

73
0:04:40.762,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but in this new terrain, I was horrible.

74
0:04:43.08,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So people would go, "Oh, what happened to Mullen?"

75
0:04:47.382,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:49.245,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So, humbling as it was, I began again.

77
0:04:51.909,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Here are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain.

78
0:04:56.38,000 --> 0:05:,000
And again, there's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle --

79
0:05:01.013,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Oh, that one?

80
0:05:02.803,000 --> 0:05:04,000
That's, like, the hardest thing I've ever done.

81
0:05:06.376,000 --> 0:05:07,000
OK, look at that, it's a Darkslide.

82
0:05:08.111,000 --> 0:05:09,000
See how it's sliding on the backside?

83
0:05:11.332,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Those are super fun, and, actually, not that hard.

84
0:05:14.2,000 --> 0:05:16,000
You know, at the very root of that, see, Caspers,

85
0:05:16.816,000 --> 0:05:17,000
see how you throw it?

86
0:05:19.512,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Simple as that, right? No biggie.

87
0:05:22.015,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And your front foot, the way it grabs it --

88
0:05:26.761,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that,

89
0:05:29.552,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I was like, "How can I get it over?"

90
0:05:31.498,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Because that had not yet been done.

91
0:05:33.228,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And then it dawned on me, and here's part of what I'm saying.

92
0:05:36.135,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer,

93
0:05:38.352,000 --> 0:05:4,000
where it was like, oh my gosh, it's just your foot.

94
0:05:40.804,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's just the way you throw your board over.

95
0:05:42.9,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Just let the ledge do that, and it's easy,

96
0:05:45.184,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the next thing you know, there's 20 more tricks

97
0:05:47.608,000 --> 0:05:48,000
based out of the variations.

98
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So that's the kind of thing -- here, check this out,

99
0:05:51.777,000 --> 0:05:53,000
here's another way, and I won't overdo this.

100
0:05:53.862,000 --> 0:05:54,000
A little indulgent, I understand.

101
0:05:55.54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
There's something called a Primo slide.

102
0:05:59.642,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It is the funnest trick ever to do.

103
0:06:05.528,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's like skimboarding.

104
0:06:08.052,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And this one, look how it slides sideways, every which way?

105
0:06:10.985,000 --> 0:06:12,000
OK, so when you're skating, and you take a fall,

106
0:06:13.837,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the board slips that way or that way; it's kind of predictable.

107
0:06:16.938,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This? It goes every which way -- it's like a cartoon, the falls,

108
0:06:20.006,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and that's what I love the most about it.

109
0:06:22.118,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's so much fun to do.

110
0:06:23.768,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In fact, when I started doing them, I remember, because I got hurt.

111
0:06:27.053,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I had to get a knee surgery, right?

112
0:06:28.864,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So there were a couple of weeks where I couldn't skate at all.

113
0:06:33.131,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It would give out on me, and I would watch the guys,

114
0:06:36.041,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating,

115
0:06:38.974,000 --> 0:06:39,000
my friends, and I was like,

116
0:06:40.318,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"I've got to do something new, I want to do something new.

117
0:06:43.086,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I want to start fresh."

118
0:06:44.285,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And so the night before my surgery, I'd watched, and I was like,

119
0:06:47.331,000 --> 0:06:48,000
"How am I going to do this?"

120
0:06:48.703,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So I ran up, and I jumped on my board,

121
0:06:50.557,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and I Cavemanned, and I flipped it down,

122
0:06:52.529,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and I remember thinking, I landed so light-footed, thinking,

123
0:06:55.448,000 --> 0:06:58,000
if my knee gives, they'll just have more work to do in the morning.

124
0:06:58.648,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:59.843,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And so, when it was the crazy thing.

126
0:07:01.917,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I don't know how many of you guys have had surgery, but --

127
0:07:04.657,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:06.12,000 --> 0:07:07,000
you are so helpless, right?

129
0:07:07.436,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You're on this gurney and you're watching the ceiling go by,

130
0:07:10.286,000 --> 0:07:11,000
every time, it's always that,

131
0:07:11.691,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and right when they're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep,

132
0:07:15.053,000 --> 0:07:18,000
all I was thinking is, "Man, when I wake up and I get better,

133
0:07:18.251,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the first thing I'm going to do is film that trick."

134
0:07:21.141,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And indeed I did, it was the very first thing I filmed, which was awesome.

135
0:07:26.084,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks.

136
0:07:30.004,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Consider that content, in a sense.

137
0:07:32.234,000 --> 0:07:35,000
What we do as street skaters is, you have these tricks --

138
0:07:36.105,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Say I'm working on Darkslides, or a Primo,

139
0:07:38.147,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that you guys know this stuff now.

140
0:07:40.054,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:41.844,000 --> 0:07:43,000
What you do is, you cruise around the same streets

142
0:07:44.202,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that you've seen a hundred times,

143
0:07:46.013,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but suddenly, because you already have something

144
0:07:48.806,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in this fixed domain of this target, it's like, what will match this trick?

145
0:07:54.051,000 --> 0:07:57,000
How can I expand, how can the context,

146
0:07:57.091,000 --> 0:08:,000
how can the environment change the very nature of what I do?

147
0:08:00.168,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So you drive and drive and drive, and, actually I've got to admit,

148
0:08:04.016,000 --> 0:08:06,000
just because I was struggling with this because I'm here,

149
0:08:06.764,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but I'll just say it, is, I cannot tell you,

150
0:08:09.273,000 --> 0:08:1,000
not only to be here in front of you,

151
0:08:11.042,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but what a privilege it is to be at US campus,

152
0:08:13.592,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.

153
0:08:17.652,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:20.453,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:22.483,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So let me give you another example of how context shapes content.

156
0:08:28.337,000 --> 0:08:31,000
This is a place not that far from here, It's a rotten neighborhood.

157
0:08:31.666,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Your first consideration is, am I going to get beat up?

158
0:08:34.262,000 --> 0:08:36,000
You go out and -- See this wall?

159
0:08:36.739,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's fairly mellow, and it's beckoning to do bank tricks, right?

160
0:08:42.624,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But there's this other aspect of it for wheelies,

161
0:08:45.368,000 --> 0:08:46,000
so check this out.

162
0:08:47.348,000 --> 0:08:48,000
There's a few tricks, again,

163
0:08:48.882,000 --> 0:08:5,000
how environment changes the nature of your tricks.

164
0:08:51.307,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Freestyle oriented, manual down -- wheelie down.

165
0:08:54.504,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Watch, this one? Oh, I love this, it's like surfing, this one,

166
0:08:57.602,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the way you catch it.

167
0:08:59.18,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This one, a little sketchy going backwards,

168
0:09:02.354,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and watch the back foot.

169
0:09:05.116,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Oops --

170
0:09:06.291,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:07.728,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Mental note right there.

172
0:09:09.252,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Again, we'll get back to that.

173
0:09:10.874,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:12.049,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Here, back foot, back foot.

175
0:09:14.438,000 --> 0:09:15,000
OK, up there?

176
0:09:15.635,000 --> 0:09:16,000
That was called a 360 flip.

177
0:09:16.968,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Notice how the board flipped and spun this way, both axes.

178
0:09:21.494,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And another example of how the context changed,

179
0:09:26.053,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and the creative process for me and for most skaters,

180
0:09:30.071,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is, you go, you get out of the car, you check for security,

181
0:09:33.317,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you check for stuff.

182
0:09:34.498,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:35.717,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It's funny, you get to know their rhythms, you know,

184
0:09:38.212,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the guys that cruise around --

185
0:09:39.859,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:41.253,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Skateboarding is such a humbling thing, man.

187
0:09:43.372,000 --> 0:09:45,000
No matter how good you are, you've still got to deal with --

188
0:09:46.296,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So you hit this wall, and when I hit it,

189
0:09:48.351,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the first thing you do is you fall forward,

190
0:09:50.643,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and I'm like, all right, all right.

191
0:09:52.357,000 --> 0:09:53,000
As you adjust ...

192
0:09:55.105,000 --> 0:09:57,000
you punch it up, and then when I would do that,

193
0:09:57.464,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it was throwing my shoulder this way ...

194
0:10:00.067,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which as I was doing it, I was like, "Oh wow, that's begging for a 360 flip,"

195
0:10:04.949,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because that's how you load up for a 360 flip.

196
0:10:07.928,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And so this is what I want to emphasize that, as you can imagine,

197
0:10:11.632,000 --> 0:10:14,000
all of these tricks are made of submovements,

198
0:10:15.234,000 --> 0:10:16,000
executive motor functions,

199
0:10:16.576,000 --> 0:10:19,000
more granular to the degree to which I can't quite tell you,

200
0:10:19.638,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but one thing I do know is,

201
0:10:21.018,000 --> 0:10:24,000
every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements.

202
0:10:25.01,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And so, as I'm going up, these things are floating around,

203
0:10:28.299,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind rest back,

204
0:10:31.058,000 --> 0:10:32,000
pull it back a little bit,

205
0:10:32.348,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and let your intuition go as you feel these things.

206
0:10:34.803,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And these submovements are kind of floating around,

207
0:10:37.334,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and as the wall hits you, they connect themselves to an extent,

208
0:10:40.322,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and that's when the cognitive mind: "Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that."

209
0:10:43.921,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So that's how that works to me, the creative process,

210
0:10:46.45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the process itself, of street skating.

211
0:10:48.362,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So, next -- Oh, mind you ...

212
0:10:49.761,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:50.851,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Those are the community.

214
0:10:52.039,000 --> 0:10:54,000
These are some of the best skaters in the world.

215
0:10:54.712,000 --> 0:10:57,000
These are my friends -- oh my gosh, they're such good people.

216
0:10:58.307,000 --> 0:11:,000
And the beauty of skateboarding is that,

217
0:11:00.839,000 --> 0:11:01,000
no one guy is the best.

218
0:11:02.827,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In fact, I know this is rotten to say, they're my friends,

219
0:11:06.223,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but a couple of them actually don't look that comfortable on their board.

220
0:11:09.723,000 --> 0:11:14,000
What makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding

221
0:11:14.763,000 --> 0:11:15,000
to individuate themselves.

222
0:11:16.046,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Every single one of these guys, you look at them,

223
0:11:18.393,000 --> 0:11:2,000
you can see a silhouette of them, and you realize,

224
0:11:20.831,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"Oh, that's him, that's Haslam, that's Koston,

225
0:11:23.144,000 --> 0:11:25,000
there's these guys, these are the guys."

226
0:11:26.323,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And skaters, I think they tend to be outsiders

227
0:11:30.401,000 --> 0:11:33,000
who seek a sense of belonging,

228
0:11:33.766,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but belonging on their own terms.

229
0:11:36.704,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do,

230
0:11:41.371,000 --> 0:11:45,000
these basic tricks, 360 flips, we take that, we make it our own,

231
0:11:46.291,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and then we contribute back to the community

232
0:11:48.601,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the inner way that edifies the community itself.

233
0:11:51.885,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The greater the contribution,

234
0:11:54.119,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the more we express and form our individuality,

235
0:11:58.372,000 --> 0:12:01,000
which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with.

236
0:12:02.699,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The summation of that

237
0:12:05.281,000 --> 0:12:08,000
gives us something we could never achieve as an individual.

238
0:12:09.784,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I should say this.

239
0:12:10.975,000 --> 0:12:11,000
There's some sort of beautiful symmetry

240
0:12:12.873,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that the degree to which we connect to a community

241
0:12:15.704,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is in proportion to our individuality,

242
0:12:18.349,000 --> 0:12:2,000
which we are expressing by what we do.

243
0:12:21.322,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Next,

244
0:12:22.502,000 --> 0:12:26,000
these guys, very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation.

245
0:12:26.924,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Laughter)

246
0:12:28.134,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Notice a couple of these shots from the police department.

247
0:12:31.707,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But it is quite similar, I mean, what is it to hack, right?

248
0:12:34.505,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it

249
0:12:37.813,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right?

250
0:12:42.196,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And they're not all bad.

251
0:12:43.555,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You can be a Linux kernel hacker, make it more stable, right?

252
0:12:47.649,000 --> 0:12:48,000
More safe, more secure.

253
0:12:48.911,000 --> 0:12:49,000
You can be an iOS hacker,

254
0:12:50.865,000 --> 0:12:52,000
make your iPhone do stuff it wasn't supposed to.

255
0:12:54.159,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Not authorized, but not illegal.

256
0:12:56.574,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And then, you've got some of these guys, right?

257
0:12:58.943,000 --> 0:13:,000
What they do is very similar to our creative process.

258
0:13:01.509,000 --> 0:13:03,000
They connect disparate information,

259
0:13:04.625,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and they bring it together in a way that a security analyst doesn't expect.

260
0:13:10.672,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It doesn't make them good people,

261
0:13:12.786,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but it's at the heart of engineering,

262
0:13:15.102,000 --> 0:13:19,000
at the heart of a creative community, an innovative community,

263
0:13:19.656,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and the open source community, the basic ethos of it

264
0:13:22.545,000 --> 0:13:25,000
is, take what other people do, make it better,

265
0:13:26.077,000 --> 0:13:28,000
give it back so we all rise further.

266
0:13:28.265,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Very similar communities, very similar.

267
0:13:30.678,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We have our edgier sides, too.

268
0:13:32.693,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:33.922,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It's funny, my dad was right.

270
0:13:35.409,000 --> 0:13:36,000
These are my peers.

271
0:13:37.908,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But I respect what they do, and they respect what I do,

272
0:13:40.516,000 --> 0:13:42,000
because they can do things, it's amazing what they can do.

273
0:13:43.289,000 --> 0:13:44,000
In fact, one of them,

274
0:13:44.945,000 --> 0:13:48,000
he was Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County,

275
0:13:49.168,000 --> 0:13:52,000
so they're not -- you never know who you're dealing with.

276
0:13:52.252,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We've all had some degree of fame.

277
0:13:55.758,000 --> 0:14:,000
In fact, I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of.

278
0:14:00.826,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I've had a patent, and that was cool, and we started a company,

279
0:14:03.809,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and it grew, and it became the biggest,

280
0:14:05.955,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and then it went down, and then it became the biggest again,

281
0:14:08.864,000 --> 0:14:1,000
which is harder than the first time, and then we sold it,

282
0:14:11.559,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and then we sold it again.

283
0:14:13.104,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So I've had some success.

284
0:14:15.19,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And in the end, when you've had all of these things,

285
0:14:17.691,000 --> 0:14:18,000
what is it that continues to drive you?

286
0:14:19.579,000 --> 0:14:21,000
As I mentioned, the knee stuff and these things,

287
0:14:21.888,000 --> 0:14:22,000
what is it that will punch you?

288
0:14:23.478,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Because it's not just the mind.

289
0:14:25.323,000 --> 0:14:27,000
What is it that will punch you and make you do something

290
0:14:28.192,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and bring it to another level, and when you've had it all,

291
0:14:31.234,000 --> 0:14:34,000
sometimes, guys, they die on the vine with all of that talent,

292
0:14:35.492,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and one of the things we've had, all of us, is fame --

293
0:14:38.184,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I think the best kind of fame, because you can take it off.

294
0:14:41.018,000 --> 0:14:43,000
I've been all around the world,

295
0:14:43.088,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name,

296
0:14:45.732,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and it's such a weird, visceral experience.

297
0:14:47.804,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It's like, it's disorienting.

298
0:14:49.435,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And you get in a car, and you drive away,

299
0:14:51.537,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and 10-minute drive, and you get out,

300
0:14:54.431,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and no one gives a rat's who you are.

301
0:14:56.266,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Laughter)

302
0:14:57.656,000 --> 0:15:,000
And it gives you that clarity of perspective of, man, I'm just me,

303
0:15:00.961,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and popularity, what does that really mean again?

304
0:15:03.695,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Not much.

305
0:15:05.14,000 --> 0:15:07,000
It's peer respect that drives us.

306
0:15:07.323,000 --> 0:15:09,000
That's the one thing that makes us do what we do.

307
0:15:09.668,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I've had over a dozen bones, this guy, over, eight, 10 concussions,

308
0:15:13.773,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to the point where it's comedy, right?

309
0:15:16.317,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It is actually comedy, they mess with him.

310
0:15:19.072,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Laughter)

311
0:15:20.65,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Next,

312
0:15:21.845,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and this is something deeper.

313
0:15:26.25,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I think I was on tour when I was reading one of the Feynman biographies.

314
0:15:29.786,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It was the red one or the blue one.

315
0:15:31.833,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And he made this statement that was so profound to me.

316
0:15:39.101,000 --> 0:15:43,000
It was that the Nobel Prize was the tombstone on all great work,

317
0:15:44.086,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and it resonated because I had won 35 out of 36 contests

318
0:15:47.945,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that I'd entered over 11 years, and it made me bananas.

319
0:15:51.31,000 --> 0:15:53,000
In fact, winning isn't the word, I won it once.

320
0:15:53.58,000 --> 0:15:55,000
The rest of the time, you're just defending,

321
0:15:55.656,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and you get into this, turtle posture, you know?

322
0:15:58.255,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Where you're not doing -- it usurped the joy of what I loved to do

323
0:16:01.389,000 --> 0:16:04,000
because I was no longer doing it to create and have fun,

324
0:16:04.565,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and when it died out from under me,

325
0:16:06.3,000 --> 0:16:08,000
that was one of the most liberating things,

326
0:16:08.38,000 --> 0:16:09,000
because I could create.

327
0:16:09.99,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And look, I understand that I am on the very edge of preachy, here.

328
0:16:14.709,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I'm not here to do that.

329
0:16:15.897,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience.

330
0:16:18.663,000 --> 0:16:2,000
If you guys aren't already leaders in your community,

331
0:16:21.567,000 --> 0:16:24,000
you probably will be, and if there's anything I can give you

332
0:16:24.659,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that will transcend what I've gotten from skateboarding,

333
0:16:27.863,000 --> 0:16:3,000
the only things of meaning, I think, and of permanence,

334
0:16:30.909,000 --> 0:16:32,000
it's not fame, it's not all these things.

335
0:16:32.991,000 --> 0:16:35,000
What it is, is that there's an intrinsic value in creating something

336
0:16:36.926,000 --> 0:16:37,000
for the sake of creating it,

337
0:16:38.743,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and better than that, because I'm 46 years old, or I'll be 46,

338
0:16:42.938,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and how pathetic is that I'm still skateboarding, but there is --

339
0:16:46.588,000 --> 0:16:51,000
there is this beauty in dropping it into a community of your own making,

340
0:16:52.727,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and seeing it dispersed, and seeing younger, more talented,

341
0:16:56.038,000 --> 0:16:59,000
just different talent, take it to levels you can never imagine,

342
0:16:59.303,000 --> 0:17:,000
because that lives on.

343
0:17:00.991,000 --> 0:17:01,000
So thank you for your time.

344
0:17:02.717,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Applause)

345
0:17:12.616,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Kristina Holly: I have a question for you.

346
0:17:14.862,000 --> 0:17:17,000
(Applause)

347
0:17:18.634,000 --> 0:17:21,000
So you've really reinvented yourself in the past, from freestyle to street,

348
0:17:22.555,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and, I think it was about four years ago you officially retired.

349
0:17:25.864,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Is that it? What's next?

350
0:17:29.15,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Rodney Mullen: That's a good question. KG: Something tells me it's not the end.

351
0:17:32.903,000 --> 0:17:35,000
RM: Yeah. Every time you think you've chased something down,

352
0:17:36.711,000 --> 0:17:39,000
it's funny, no matter how good you are, and I know guys like this,

353
0:17:39.872,000 --> 0:17:41,000
it feels like you're polishing a turd, you know?

354
0:17:42.262,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Laughter)

355
0:17:45.581,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And I thought, the only way I can extend this

356
0:17:48.052,000 --> 0:17:5,000
is to change something infrastructural.

357
0:17:50.88,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And so that's what I proceeded to do, through a long story,

358
0:17:54.142,000 --> 0:17:58,000
one of desperation, so if I do it, rather than talk about it,

359
0:17:58.427,000 --> 0:17:59,000
if I do it, you'll be the first to know.

360
0:18:00.394,000 --> 0:18:03,000
KG: All right, we won't ask you any more. RM: You'll get a text.

361
0:18:03.42,000 --> 0:18:05,000
KG: Right, thank you, good job. RM: Thank you. Thank you.

362
0:18:06.419,000 --> 0:18:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There are times when I feel really quite ashamed

2
0:00:16.28,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to be a European.

3
0:00:18.2,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In the last year,

4
0:00:20.08,000 --> 0:00:24,000
more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help,

5
0:00:24.68,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and our response, frankly, has been pathetic.

6
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
There are just so many contradictions.

7
0:00:32.36,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We mourn the tragic death

8
0:00:34.84,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of two-year-old Alan Kurdi,

9
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and yet, since then, more than 200 children

10
0:00:41.88,000 --> 0:00:43,000
have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.

11
0:00:45.96,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We have international treaties

12
0:00:47.44,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility,

13
0:00:50.68,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon

14
0:00:53.76,000 --> 0:00:56,000
hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.

15
0:00:58.32,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We lament the existence of human smugglers,

16
0:01:02.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and yet we make that the only viable route

17
0:01:05.8,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to seek asylum in Europe.

18
0:01:08.84,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We have labor shortages,

19
0:01:10.72,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs

20
0:01:16.2,000 --> 0:01:17,000
from coming to Europe.

21
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam,

22
0:01:24.96,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and yet --

23
0:01:27.56,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we have repressive policies

24
0:01:30.24,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that detain child asylum seekers,

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that separate children from their families,

26
0:01:36.8,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and that seize property from refugees.

27
0:01:40.96,000 --> 0:01:41,000
What are we doing?

28
0:01:42.64,000 --> 0:01:44,000
How has the situation come to this,

29
0:01:45.08,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?

30
0:01:51.28,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I don't believe it's because people don't care,

31
0:01:53.72,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.

32
0:01:56.92,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision,

33
0:02:00.76,000 --> 0:02:03,000
a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system

34
0:02:04.4,000 --> 0:02:06,000
created over 50 years ago

35
0:02:06.56,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for a changing and globalized world.

36
0:02:09.8,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And so what I want to do is take a step back

37
0:02:12.36,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and ask two really fundamental questions,

38
0:02:15.8,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the two questions we all need to ask.

39
0:02:18.28,000 --> 0:02:21,000
First, why is the current system not working?

40
0:02:21.6,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And second, what can we do to fix it?

41
0:02:26.76,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So the modern refugee regime

42
0:02:28.84,000 --> 0:02:32,000
was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys.

43
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Its basic aim is to ensure

44
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people,

45
0:02:41.4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
people have somewhere to go,

46
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to live in safety and dignity until they can go home.

47
0:02:46.68,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.

48
0:02:52.68,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments,

49
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:03:,000
the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees,

50
0:03:00.6,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and an international organization, UNHCR,

51
0:03:03.8,000 --> 0:03:07,000
states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory

52
0:03:08.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
who flee conflict and persecution.

53
0:03:11.68,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But today, that system is failing.

54
0:03:14.92,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum.

55
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.

56
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration,

57
0:03:27.64,000 --> 0:03:29,000
or return to the country they've come from.

58
0:03:30.36,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo.

59
0:03:34.24,000 --> 0:03:37,000
In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.

60
0:03:38.04,000 --> 0:03:42,000
In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict

61
0:03:42.4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.

62
0:03:46.72,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong.

63
0:03:49.48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world,

64
0:03:53.84,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and that's what we need to reconsider.

65
0:03:56.44,000 --> 0:04:,000
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.

66
0:04:00.96,000 --> 0:04:02,000
How does the refugee regime actually work?

67
0:04:03.56,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But not from a top-down institutional perspective,

68
0:04:06.36,000 --> 0:04:09,000
rather from the perspective of a refugee.

69
0:04:10.24,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So imagine a Syrian woman.

70
0:04:12.72,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Let's call her Amira.

71
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region.

72
0:04:19.56,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Amira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees,

73
0:04:22.92,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is a woman with children,

74
0:04:24.84,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and she can't go home because she comes from this city

75
0:04:28.12,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that you see before you, Homs,

76
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a once beautiful and historic city

77
0:04:32.92,000 --> 0:04:33,000
now under rubble.

78
0:04:34.44,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And so Amira can't go back there.

79
0:04:37.12,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country,

80
0:04:41.36,000 --> 0:04:42,000
because that's a lottery ticket

81
0:04:42.88,000 --> 0:04:45,000
only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.

82
0:04:46.88,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So Amira and her family

83
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
face an almost impossible choice.

84
0:04:51.36,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They have three basic options.

85
0:04:54.56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp.

86
0:05:00.52,000 --> 0:05:02,000
In the camp, she might get assistance,

87
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family.

88
0:05:06.88,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Camps are in bleak, arid locations,

89
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
often in the desert.

90
0:05:12.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,

91
0:05:14.76,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime.

92
0:05:20.6,000 --> 0:05:22,000
There's restricted economic activity.

93
0:05:23.2,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Education is often of poor quality.

94
0:05:25.96,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And around the world,

95
0:05:27.32,000 --> 0:05:3,000
some 80 percent of refugees who are in camps

96
0:05:30.44,000 --> 0:05:32,000
have to stay for at least five years.

97
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's a miserable existence,

98
0:05:34.92,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and that's probably why, in reality,

99
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
only nine percent of Syrians choose that option.

100
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area

101
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut.

102
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:53,000
That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken.

103
0:05:54.2,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But there, there's great difficulty as well.

104
0:05:57.72,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work.

105
0:06:02.04,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They don't usually get significant access to assistance.

106
0:06:05.44,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings,

107
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.

108
0:06:14.28,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So there's a third alternative,

109
0:06:16.92,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking.

110
0:06:21.84,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Amira can seek some hope for her family

111
0:06:26.04,000 --> 0:06:29,000
by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey

112
0:06:29.8,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to another country,

113
0:06:31.32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.

114
0:06:35.44,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice

115
0:06:40.72,000 --> 0:06:41,000
between three options:

116
0:06:42.56,000 --> 0:06:46,000
encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys.

117
0:06:47.52,000 --> 0:06:51,000
For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today.

118
0:06:52.6,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But I think it's a false choice.

119
0:06:54.76,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I think we can reconsider that choice.

120
0:06:57.44,000 --> 0:07:,000
The reason why we limit those options

121
0:07:02.04,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is because we think

122
0:07:05.08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that those are the only options that are available to refugees,

123
0:07:09.48,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and they're not.

124
0:07:11.12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue,

125
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens.

126
0:07:18.6,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We tend to have a collective assumption

127
0:07:20.68,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.

128
0:07:24.36,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But they don't have to. They can contribute.

129
0:07:26.88,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So what I want to argue

130
0:07:28.32,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set

131
0:07:31.32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and still benefit everyone else:

132
0:07:33.36,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the host states and communities,

133
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:38,000
our societies and refugees themselves.

134
0:07:39.08,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And I want to suggest four ways

135
0:07:41.08,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees.

136
0:07:45.52,000 --> 0:07:47,000
All four ways have one thing in common:

137
0:07:48.44,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization,

138
0:07:52.24,000 --> 0:07:54,000
mobility and markets,

139
0:07:54.32,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and update the way we think about the refugee issue.

140
0:07:58.28,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The first one I want to think about

141
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is the idea of enabling environments,

142
0:08:02.72,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and it starts from a very basic recognition

143
0:08:05.6,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that refugees are human beings like everyone else,

144
0:08:08.32,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but they're just in extraordinary circumstances.

145
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Together with my colleagues in Oxford,

146
0:08:13.28,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we've embarked on a research project in Uganda

147
0:08:15.96,000 --> 0:08:18,000
looking at the economic lives of refugees.

148
0:08:19.84,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries.

149
0:08:23.92,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It's not. It's exceptional.

150
0:08:25.96,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Unlike most host countries around the world,

151
0:08:28.36,000 --> 0:08:29,000
what Uganda has done

152
0:08:29.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is give refugees economic opportunity.

153
0:08:32.24,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement.

154
0:08:36.2,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And the results of that are extraordinary

155
0:08:39.12,000 --> 0:08:41,000
both for refugees and the host community.

156
0:08:42.48,000 --> 0:08:43,000
In the capital city, Kampala,

157
0:08:44.48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people,

158
0:08:49.919,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and 40 percent of those employees

159
0:08:52.4,000 --> 0:08:53,000
are nationals of the host country.

160
0:08:54.4,000 --> 0:08:56,000
In other words, refugees are making jobs

161
0:08:56.6,000 --> 0:08:58,000
for citizens of the host country.

162
0:08:59.92,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples

163
0:09:03.28,000 --> 0:09:06,000
of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.

164
0:09:07.8,000 --> 0:09:1,000
For example, in a settlement called Nakivale,

165
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
we found examples of Congolese refugees

166
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
running digital music exchange businesses.

167
0:09:16.72,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available

168
0:09:20.52,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to allow the youth to play computer games

169
0:09:23.28,000 --> 0:09:26,000
on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions.

170
0:09:28.44,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Against the odds of extreme constraint,

171
0:09:31.28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
refugees are innovating,

172
0:09:33.32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.

173
0:09:37.2,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little,

174
0:09:40.88,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but he wanted to be a filmmaker.

175
0:09:43.2,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station,

176
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
he rented a video camera,

177
0:09:48.92,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and he's now making films.

178
0:09:50.44,000 --> 0:09:51,000
He made two documentary films

179
0:09:52.44,000 --> 0:09:53,000
with and for our team,

180
0:09:54.44,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and he's making a successful business out of very little.

181
0:09:58.64,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It's those kinds of examples

182
0:10:00.64,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that should guide our response to refugees.

183
0:10:03.4,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Rather than seeing refugees

184
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:07,000
as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance,

185
0:10:08.04,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.

186
0:10:12.2,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food

187
0:10:16.438,000 --> 0:10:18,000
are all important in the emergency phase,

188
0:10:19.24,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but we need to also look beyond that.

189
0:10:22.2,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity,

190
0:10:26.56,000 --> 0:10:28,000
education, the right to work,

191
0:10:29.4,000 --> 0:10:3,000
access to capital and banking.

192
0:10:31.56,000 --> 0:10:33,000
All the ways in which we take for granted

193
0:10:33.72,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that we are plugged in to the global economy

194
0:10:35.88,000 --> 0:10:37,000
can and should apply to refugees.

195
0:10:39.28,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.

196
0:10:43.32,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Unfortunately, not every host country in the world

197
0:10:46.08,000 --> 0:10:48,000
takes the approach Uganda has taken.

198
0:10:48.48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees

199
0:10:51.84,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in the same way.

200
0:10:53.36,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.

201
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague,

202
0:11:01.72,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the development economist Paul Collier,

203
0:11:04.4,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and we brainstormed an idea while we were there

204
0:11:07.28,000 --> 0:11:09,000
with the international community and the government,

205
0:11:09.76,000 --> 0:11:11,000
an idea to bring jobs to Syrians

206
0:11:12.12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.

207
0:11:15.76,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The idea is for an economic zone,

208
0:11:19.08,000 --> 0:11:22,000
one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees

209
0:11:22.64,000 --> 0:11:25,000
alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals.

210
0:11:26.84,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp,

211
0:11:30.28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
home to 83,000 refugees,

212
0:11:32.44,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is an existing economic zone

213
0:11:34.48,000 --> 0:11:36,000
called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.

214
0:11:37.92,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The government has spent over a hundred million dollars

215
0:11:40.72,000 --> 0:11:43,000
connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network,

216
0:11:44.56,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but it lacked two things:

217
0:11:46.2,000 --> 0:11:48,000
access to labor and inward investment.

218
0:11:48.96,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So what if refugees were able to work there

219
0:11:51.88,000 --> 0:11:52,000
rather than being stuck in camps,

220
0:11:53.72,000 --> 0:11:57,000
able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training

221
0:11:57.76,000 --> 0:11:58,000
before they go back to Syria?

222
0:11:59.84,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We recognized that that could benefit Jordan,

223
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
whose development strategy requires it to make the leap

224
0:12:04.96,000 --> 0:12:06,000
as a middle income country to manufacturing.

225
0:12:07.8,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute

226
0:12:11.52,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria

227
0:12:13.92,000 --> 0:12:15,000
by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees

228
0:12:16.72,000 --> 0:12:19,000
as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria.

229
0:12:20.76,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.

230
0:12:23.84,000 --> 0:12:25,000
King Abdullah has picked up on the idea.

231
0:12:26.08,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago,

232
0:12:29.08,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and a pilot will begin in the summer.

233
0:12:32.12,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

234
0:12:37.12,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The third idea that I want to put to you

235
0:12:39.84,000 --> 0:12:42,000
is preference matching between states and refugees

236
0:12:43.48,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie

237
0:12:46.64,000 --> 0:12:48,000
featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.

238
0:12:50.44,000 --> 0:12:54,000
What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go,

239
0:12:54.96,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but I'd argue we can do that

240
0:12:56.84,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and still make everyone better off.

241
0:12:59.64,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets,

242
0:13:03.8,000 --> 0:13:08,000
ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match.

243
0:13:09.72,000 --> 0:13:12,000
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym

244
0:13:12.8,000 --> 0:13:16,000
have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees,

245
0:13:16.96,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations,

246
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want

247
0:13:24.32,000 --> 0:13:26,000
on skills criteria or language criteria

248
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and allow those to match.

249
0:13:28.88,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas

250
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
on things like diversity and vulnerability,

251
0:13:34.28,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching.

252
0:13:37.84,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The matching idea has been successfully used

253
0:13:40.36,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to match, for instance, students with university places,

254
0:13:45.52,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to match kidney donors with patients,

255
0:13:48.04,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites.

256
0:13:52.2,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?

257
0:13:55.32,000 --> 0:13:57,000
It could also be used at the national level,

258
0:13:57.392,000 --> 0:13:58,000
where one of the great challenges we face

259
0:13:59.4,000 --> 0:14:02,000
is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.

260
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And at the moment, in my country, for instance,

261
0:14:05.64,000 --> 0:14:09,000
we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities,

262
0:14:09.84,000 --> 0:14:1,000
which makes no sense at all.

263
0:14:11.72,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together

264
0:14:16.32,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host

265
0:14:20.28,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and the refugees themselves.

266
0:14:22.84,000 --> 0:14:25,000
The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas.

267
0:14:27.24,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe

268
0:14:29.96,000 --> 0:14:31,000
was entirely avoidable.

269
0:14:32.4,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy,

270
0:14:36.52,000 --> 0:14:37,000
which is the following:

271
0:14:37.92,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that in order to seek asylum in Europe,

272
0:14:40.44,000 --> 0:14:45,000
you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys

273
0:14:45.48,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that I described.

274
0:14:47.52,000 --> 0:14:51,000
But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline

275
0:14:52.28,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and modern consular capabilities?

276
0:14:54.72,000 --> 0:14:56,000
They're completely unnecessary journeys,

277
0:14:57.08,000 --> 0:15:,000
and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people

278
0:15:00.88,000 --> 0:15:03,000
on Europe's borders and within European territory.

279
0:15:05.36,000 --> 0:15:06,000
If refugees were simply allowed

280
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe,

281
0:15:09.8,000 --> 0:15:1,000
we would avoid that,

282
0:15:11.12,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and there's a way of doing that

283
0:15:12.68,000 --> 0:15:14,000
through something called a humanitarian visa,

284
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy

285
0:15:18.56,000 --> 0:15:2,000
or a consulate in a neighboring country

286
0:15:20.72,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and then simply pay their own way

287
0:15:22.64,000 --> 0:15:24,000
through a ferry or a flight to Europe.

288
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
It costs around a thousand euros

289
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.

290
0:15:31.44,000 --> 0:15:36,000
It costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.

291
0:15:36.92,000 --> 0:15:39,000
If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages.

292
0:15:40.72,000 --> 0:15:41,000
It would save lives,

293
0:15:42.76,000 --> 0:15:45,000
it would undercut the entire market for smugglers,

294
0:15:46.72,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line

295
0:15:50.08,000 --> 0:15:52,000
in areas like the Greek islands.

296
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.

297
0:15:56.88,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And this is an idea that has been applied.

298
0:15:59.24,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach

299
0:16:01.92,000 --> 0:16:05,000
where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas,

300
0:16:06.24,000 --> 0:16:1,000
enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil.

301
0:16:10.64,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it

302
0:16:13.56,000 --> 0:16:16,000
has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.

303
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
There is a historical precedent for it as well.

304
0:16:20.92,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Between 1922 and 1942,

305
0:16:24.28,000 --> 0:16:27,000
these Nansen passports were used as travel documents

306
0:16:28.08,000 --> 0:16:33,000
to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens

307
0:16:33.64,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to travel across Europe

308
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.

309
0:16:38.52,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And the Nansen International Refugee Office

310
0:16:41.28,000 --> 0:16:42,000
received the Nobel Peace Prize

311
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
in recognition of this being a viable strategy.

312
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So all four of these ideas that I've presented you

313
0:16:50.24,000 --> 0:16:53,000
are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set.

314
0:16:53.92,000 --> 0:16:56,000
They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees

315
0:16:57.2,000 --> 0:17:,000
beyond those basic, impossible three options

316
0:17:01.04,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I explained to you

317
0:17:02.28,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and still leave others better off.

318
0:17:04.96,000 --> 0:17:07,000
In conclusion, we really need a new vision,

319
0:17:08.36,000 --> 0:17:1,000
a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees

320
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden.

321
0:17:13.72,000 --> 0:17:16,000
There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.

322
0:17:17.2,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility,

323
0:17:20.48,000 --> 0:17:23,000
but they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations,

324
0:17:24.119,000 --> 0:17:26,000
with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them.

325
0:17:28.52,000 --> 0:17:29,000
In the new world,

326
0:17:30.319,000 --> 0:17:32,000
migration is not going to go away.

327
0:17:32.599,000 --> 0:17:34,000
What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years.

328
0:17:35.599,000 --> 0:17:36,000
People will continue to travel,

329
0:17:37.44,000 --> 0:17:38,000
they'll continue to be displaced,

330
0:17:39.319,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this --

331
0:17:42.84,000 --> 0:17:45,000
not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance,

332
0:17:45.88,000 --> 0:17:47,000
not based on logics of charity,

333
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:49,000
but building on the opportunities

334
0:17:49.64,000 --> 0:17:52,000
offered by globalization, markets and mobility.

335
0:17:53.04,000 --> 0:17:56,000
I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians

336
0:17:56.48,000 --> 0:17:57,000
to wake up to this challenge.

337
0:17:58.36,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Thank you very much.

338
0:17:59.64,000 --> 0:18:07,000
(Applause)

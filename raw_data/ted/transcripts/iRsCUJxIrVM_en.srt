1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was born in Switzerland

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and raised in Ghana, West Africa.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Ghana felt safe to me as a child.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I was free, I was happy.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The early 70s

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But then by the end of the decade,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the country had fallen back into political instability

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and mismanagement.

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
In 1979,

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I witnessed my first military coup.

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We the children had gathered at a friend's house.

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It was a dimly lit shack.

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
There was a beaten up black and white television

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
flickering in the background,

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and a former head of state and general

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
was being blindfolded

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and tied to the pole.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The firing squad aimed, fired --

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the general was dead.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now this was being broadcast live.

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And shortly after, we left the country,

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and we returned to Switzerland.

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now Europe came as a shock to me,

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I think I started feeling the need

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to shed my skin in order to fit in.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I wanted to blend in like a chameleon.

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I think it was a tactic of survival.

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And it worked, or so I believed.

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So here I was in 2008

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
wondering where I was in my life.

32
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I felt I was being typecast as an actor.

33
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I was always playing the exotic African.

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I was playing the violent African,

35
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the African terrorist.

36
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I was thinking,

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
how many terrorists could I possibly play

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
before turning into one myself?

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I had become ashamed of the other,

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the African in me.

41
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And fortunately I decided in 2008

42
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to return to Ghana,

43
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
after 28 years of absence.

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I wanted to document on film

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the 2008 presidential elections.

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And there, I started by searching

47
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
for the footprints in my childhood.

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And before I even knew it,

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I was suddenly on a stage

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
surrounded by thousands of cheering people

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
during a political rally.

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And I realized that, when I'd left the country,

53
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
free and fair elections in a democratic environment

54
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
were a dream.

55
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality,

56
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
though a fragile reality.

57
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And I was thinking,

58
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
was Ghana searching for its identity

59
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
like I was looking for my identity?

60
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
for what was happening in me?

62
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And it was as if through the standards of my Western life,

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I hadn't lived up to my full potential.

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I mean, nor had Ghana,

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
even though we had been trying very hard.

66
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now in 1957,

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country

68
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to gain its independence.

69
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In the late 50s,

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I mean, today, Singapore is a First World country

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and Ghana is not.

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But maybe it was time to prove to myself,

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
yes, it's important to understand the past,

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it is important to look at it in a different light,

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and build on those foundations in the present.

78
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So here I was, December 7th, 2008.

79
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM,

80
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,

81
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
were starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.

82
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far,

83
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because they wanted to make their voices heard.

84
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I asked one of the voters, I said, "Whom are you going to vote for?"

85
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."

86
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
He said that his vote was in his heart.

87
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And I understood, this was their election,

88
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and they weren't going to let anyone

89
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
take it away from them.

90
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner --

91
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so nobody had achieved the absolute majority --

92
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so voting went into a second round three weeks later.

93
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.

94
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.

95
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The heat was on.

96
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And then the cliche came to haunt us.

97
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There were claims of intimidation

98
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
at the polling stations,

99
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of ballot boxes being stolen.

100
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Inflated results started coming in

101
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the mob was starting to get out of control.

102
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.

103
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
People were being beaten brutally.

104
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling.

105
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It was complete chaos.

106
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And my heart sank,

107
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because I thought, here we are again.

108
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Here is another proof

109
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that the African is not capable of governing himself.

110
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And not only that, I am documenting it --

111
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
documenting my own cultural shortcomings.

112
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So when the echo of the gunshots

113
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
had lingered,

114
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob,

115
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I didn't believe what I was hearing.

116
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They were chanting, "We want peace.

117
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We want peace."

118
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I realized it had to come from the people.

119
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
After all, they decide,

120
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and they did.

121
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So the sounds that were before distorted and loud,

122
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
were suddenly a melody.

123
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The sounds of the voices were harmonious.

124
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So it could happen.

125
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
A democracy could be upheld peacefully.

126
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It could be, by the will of the masses

127
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
who were now urgently pressing

128
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with all their heart and all their will

129
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
for peace.

130
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now here's an interesting comparison.

131
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We in the West,

132
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we preach the values,

133
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the golden light of democracy,

134
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that we are the shining example of how it's done.

135
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But when it comes down to it,

136
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Ghana found itself in the same place

137
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in which the U.S. election stalled

138
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
in the 2000 presidential elections --

139
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Bush versus Gore.

140
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates

141
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide,

142
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Ghana honored democracy

143
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and its people.

144
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide;

145
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the people did.

146
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Now the second round of voting

147
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
did not bring forth a clear winner either.

148
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I mean, it was so incredibly close.

149
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The electoral commissioner declared,

150
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
with the consent of the parties,

151
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to run an unprecedented

152
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
second re-run.

153
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So the people went back to the polls

154
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to determine their own president,

155
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
not the legal system.

156
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And guess what, it worked.

157
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The defeated candidate

158
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
gave up power

159
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.

160
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I mean, at the absolute time

161
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
for the absolute need of democracy,

162
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
they did not abuse their power.

163
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep,

164
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
proving that the African is capable of governing himself.

165
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa

166
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is not over,

167
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists,

168
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and that we must not take it for granted.

169
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now I have learned

170
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that my place is not just in the West or in Africa,

171
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and I'm still searching

172
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
for my identity,

173
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but I saw Ghana

174
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
create democracy better.

175
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Ghana taught me

176
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to look at people differently

177
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and to look at myself differently.

178
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And yes,

179
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we Africans can.

180
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Thank you.

181
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000

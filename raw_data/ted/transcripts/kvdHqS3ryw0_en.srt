1
0:00:13.507,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Everybody has that one friend --

2
0:00:16.801,000 --> 0:00:17,000
you know, the single-minded one,

3
0:00:18.649,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the one who, no matter what the question is,

4
0:00:21.848,000 --> 0:00:25,000
always finds a way to make the answer whatever it is she's single-minded about.

5
0:00:26.769,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm that friend.

6
0:00:28.006,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.803,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And the thing that I'm single-minded about

8
0:00:32.41,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is racism.

9
0:00:34.1,000 --> 0:00:38,000
If someone were to ask me, "So, Janet, got any plans for the 4th of July?"

10
0:00:38.46,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'm subject to answer, "Yeah, I'm going to binge-watch 'Roots.'"

11
0:00:41.553,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:42.633,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Or if they said, "Janet, I've got a joke for you:

13
0:00:45.533,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Why'd the chicken cross the road?"

14
0:00:47.406,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"Uh, was it a black chicken?

15
0:00:49.591,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Probably gentrification."

16
0:00:51.228,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:54.657,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Applause)

18
0:01:01.065,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But for me, single-mindedness is not just caring about something.

19
0:01:05.653,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's caring about something enough to do something about it.

20
0:01:09.903,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's not just thinking, it's doing.

21
0:01:13.52,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's not just praying, it is moving your feet.

22
0:01:18.292,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And the reason I'm single-minded about racism is because I know

23
0:01:22.994,000 --> 0:01:25,000
single-mindedness can destroy it.

24
0:01:26.103,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I learned that many, many years ago.

25
0:01:28.274,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Back in 1984, I was a junior at Davidson College

26
0:01:31.992,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in Davidson, North Carolina.

27
0:01:34.126,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, Davidson is a little-bitty town,

28
0:01:36.537,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Southern town, split by railroad tracks,

29
0:01:38.957,000 --> 0:01:41,000
with white Davidson on one side, black Davidson on the other side,

30
0:01:42.746,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and, as black students lived on the white side of the tracks,

31
0:01:46.071,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we got used to being stopped in downtown and asked for ID,

32
0:01:50.259,000 --> 0:01:53,000
until the police memorized our faces.

33
0:01:53.377,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But fortunately, that didn't take too long,

34
0:01:55.476,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because out of 1,200 students, only 52 of us were black.

35
0:01:59.156,000 --> 0:02:,000
There was one black professor

36
0:02:00.987,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and one black assistant dean.

37
0:02:03.194,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Things weren't a lot better on campus.

38
0:02:05.657,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Well, I wasn't OK with this.

39
0:02:08.359,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And so, I started writing things.

40
0:02:10.531,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And then I started yelling things.

41
0:02:12.54,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And after about three years of that,

42
0:02:14.317,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I got tired.

43
0:02:15.624,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So I decided to write one more thing;

44
0:02:18.532,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I wrote something called "Project '87."

45
0:02:21.788,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Project '87 was really just a challenge to Davidson:

46
0:02:25.953,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in three years, by 1987,

47
0:02:28.66,000 --> 0:02:3,000
enroll 100 black students,

48
0:02:31.387,000 --> 0:02:33,000
hire 10 black professors,

49
0:02:34.589,000 --> 0:02:36,000
create five Black Studies classes

50
0:02:36.883,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and hire one black dean.

51
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It didn't seem particularly revolutionary,

52
0:02:41.64,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but what was different about it was,

53
0:02:43.763,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we also challenged Davidson to say that if you don't do this,

54
0:02:47.565,000 --> 0:02:49,000
we will question your commitment to diversity.

55
0:02:50.946,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It was a real problem.

56
0:02:52.423,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We put some real numbers to it.

57
0:02:54.258,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We gave them some real consequences.

58
0:02:56.503,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, the campus went absolutely nuts.

59
0:02:59.316,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But fortunately, in the middle of this,

60
0:03:01.986,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Davidson got a new president,

61
0:03:03.936,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and that president was single-minded about racism, too.

62
0:03:07.632,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so, he created a task force

63
0:03:10.49,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to address the issues in Project '87.

64
0:03:12.972,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And several months after that,

65
0:03:14.931,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we produced a 77-page report.

66
0:03:19.244,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That report was the foundation for all the change that came after it.

67
0:03:24.882,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, I wasn't there to see that change,

68
0:03:27.708,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because, actually, in 1985,

69
0:03:30.11,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I graduated.

70
0:03:31.816,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Applause)

71
0:03:36.231,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You are looking at the three happiest people on the planet that day,

72
0:03:41.502,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because I am leaving.

73
0:03:43.41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:45.58,000 --> 0:03:47,000
However, the change did happen,

75
0:03:47.81,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and today, there are 185 black students,

76
0:03:51.413,000 --> 0:03:54,000
there are 16 black or multiracial professors,

77
0:03:55.339,000 --> 0:03:56,000
there are four black deans,

78
0:03:56.984,000 --> 0:04:,000
and there's an entire degree-granting Africana Studies Department.

79
0:04:01.508,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Applause)

80
0:04:07.513,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Project '87 changed Davidson.

81
0:04:09.997,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But it also changed me, because what it taught me

82
0:04:12.998,000 --> 0:04:14,000
was there's a lot of power in single-mindedness.

83
0:04:16.896,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Well, today, I'm an executive speechwriter

84
0:04:19.326,000 --> 0:04:21,000
for one of the biggest companies in the world.

85
0:04:22.39,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's a profession that is 92 percent white and predominantly male,

86
0:04:27.177,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which makes me a little bit of a unicorn.

87
0:04:30.369,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But I'm a single-minded unicorn.

88
0:04:32.026,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:33.899,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So the thing about speech writing is, it's very personal.

90
0:04:37.719,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So I spend a lot of time in deep conversation

91
0:04:40.379,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with the CEO and senior executives,

92
0:04:43.573,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and a lot of times those conversations turn to diversity and inclusion,

93
0:04:47.933,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which, of course, I'm always happy to talk about.

94
0:04:51.38,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But after quite a few of these conversations,

95
0:04:53.715,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I've come to a conclusion:

96
0:04:55.824,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I believe that business is in a position to do something

97
0:04:59.122,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that no other entity can do.

98
0:05:02.286,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Business can dismantle racism.

99
0:05:06.344,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, colleges can't do it.

100
0:05:07.822,000 --> 0:05:09,000
There aren't but 5,000 of them in the United States

101
0:05:10.377,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and only 20 million students enrolled.

102
0:05:12.587,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Church can't do it, either --

103
0:05:14.031,000 --> 0:05:16,000
only 35 percent of us go on a regular basis,

104
0:05:16.822,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and when we do,

105
0:05:18.209,000 --> 0:05:22,000
eleven o'clock Sunday morning is "the most segregated hour" in America.

106
0:05:23.232,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But business?

107
0:05:24.656,000 --> 0:05:3,000
There are a 162 million people in the US workforce alone --

108
0:05:31.032,000 --> 0:05:32,000
people of all races,

109
0:05:32.595,000 --> 0:05:36,000
united in the spirit of wanting a paycheck and having to show up to get it.

110
0:05:37.111,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:39.458,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, I'm aware that diversity is bigger than race,

112
0:05:43.491,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and racism is bigger than America.

113
0:05:45.638,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But racial discrimination is the most prominent form,

114
0:05:49.448,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and Lord knows America is the absolute best at it.

115
0:05:52.524,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So what if, though, what if

116
0:05:56.703,000 --> 0:06:,000
we worked in diverse and inclusive environments

117
0:06:01.167,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that we had something to do something with?

118
0:06:03.8,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And since we spend one-third of our lives at work,

119
0:06:07.541,000 --> 0:06:1,000
what if we did that with people who didn't look like us?

120
0:06:11.272,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I think the world would be a totally different place outside of work.

121
0:06:15.624,000 --> 0:06:19,000
That can happen if business gets single-minded about racism.

122
0:06:21.316,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But the question is: How is that supposed to happen?

123
0:06:23.813,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Well, I think there are three things that business can borrow from Project '87:

124
0:06:27.618,000 --> 0:06:28,000
real problems,

125
0:06:29.108,000 --> 0:06:3,000
real numbers,

126
0:06:30.325,000 --> 0:06:31,000
real consequences.

127
0:06:33.235,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Like it or not,

128
0:06:35.401,000 --> 0:06:38,000
diversity is not really a problem for business -- yet.

129
0:06:38.894,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I mean, it's a nice thing to have, it's the right thing to do,

130
0:06:42.378,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but for decades, we've been trying to make the case

131
0:06:45.078,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that diversity fuels innovation and customer insight.

132
0:06:49.973,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I mean, at this point, it's kind of a no-brainer,

133
0:06:52.302,000 --> 0:06:54,000
a little bit like hearing a smoke alarm going off

134
0:06:54.815,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and standing with your hand on the hot door,

135
0:06:56.923,000 --> 0:06:59,000
waiting for some data to tell you that your house is on fire.

136
0:07:00.23,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Because the data is already there.

137
0:07:02.904,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Ethnically diverse companies perform 33 percent better than the norm.

138
0:07:08.632,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Forbes's best workplaces for diversity enjoy 24 percent higher revenue growth.

139
0:07:15.269,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And yet, here we are in 2018,

140
0:07:18.962,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and there are only three black CEOs in the Fortune 500.

141
0:07:23.771,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And if your name is Molly or Connor,

142
0:07:26.157,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you've got a 14 percent better chance of getting a callback on your resume

143
0:07:30.433,000 --> 0:07:32,000
than if your name is Shanice or DeShawn.

144
0:07:33.399,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And all of this, despite the fact that by 2045,

145
0:07:38.174,000 --> 0:07:43,000
America is projected to be a minority-majority country.

146
0:07:44.207,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Here's the thing:

147
0:07:45.472,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the business case for diversity, as it stands today,

148
0:07:48.914,000 --> 0:07:5,000
doesn't really speak to any problem.

149
0:07:51.472,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And the only way business is going to get single-minded

150
0:07:54.253,000 --> 0:07:55,000
about racial diversity

151
0:07:56.19,000 --> 0:08:,000
is if it has a problem that is urgent and relative to somebody

152
0:08:00.44,000 --> 0:08:01,000
other than people of color.

153
0:08:02.928,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I got one:

154
0:08:04.164,000 --> 0:08:06,000
How about employees and customers?

155
0:08:07.1,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Because no matter what business you're in,

156
0:08:09.321,000 --> 0:08:1,000
you're going to need those, right?

157
0:08:11.054,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Well, let's talk about some real numbers.

158
0:08:14.319,000 --> 0:08:18,000
If you have employees and customers, wouldn't it make sense

159
0:08:18.635,000 --> 0:08:22,000
if they looked a little bit like the people that work for you?

160
0:08:23.345,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So if that's the case, maybe your employee base should be 13 percent Black

161
0:08:28.441,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and 18 percent Hispanic,

162
0:08:30.016,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because that's what the population looks like.

163
0:08:32.413,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Maybe that's what your customer base looks like.

164
0:08:36.017,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But let's be clear:

165
0:08:37.403,000 --> 0:08:4,000
diversity and inclusion are not the same things.

166
0:08:41.421,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Diversity is a numbers game.

167
0:08:43.937,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Inclusion is about impact.

168
0:08:46.652,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Companies can mandate diversity,

169
0:08:48.91,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but they have to cultivate inclusion.

170
0:08:51.964,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And if inclusion is what you're after,

171
0:08:54.54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
you've got to calculate some slightly different numbers.

172
0:08:57.292,000 --> 0:08:59,000
How about 30 percent?

173
0:09:00.361,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Because that's the point that research shows

174
0:09:02.851,000 --> 0:09:06,000
at which the voices of minorities actually begin to be heard.

175
0:09:08.379,000 --> 0:09:09,000
If you want a real problem,

176
0:09:10.157,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you're going to need real numbers to fix it,

177
0:09:12.256,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and if you're not willing to set real numbers,

178
0:09:14.439,000 --> 0:09:17,000
then maybe you're not real serious about diversity and inclusion.

179
0:09:17.935,000 --> 0:09:18,000
That brings me to my third point:

180
0:09:20.779,000 --> 0:09:21,000
real consequences.

181
0:09:23.143,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Think about this:

182
0:09:24.338,000 --> 0:09:28,000
when salespeople forget what they're doing and don't come up with their numbers,

183
0:09:28.419,000 --> 0:09:29,000
what do we do?

184
0:09:29.604,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We give them a little time, maybe we give them some training.

185
0:09:32.534,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But then if they don't hit those numbers eventually,

186
0:09:35.009,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we fire them.

187
0:09:36.498,000 --> 0:09:39,000
However, when you start talking about diversity and inclusion,

188
0:09:39.72,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we use terms like "accountability."

189
0:09:42.163,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And maybe we scold, and maybe we hold back an incentive or two.

190
0:09:46.521,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But you know what the best incentive is?

191
0:09:48.497,000 --> 0:09:49,000
A job.

192
0:09:49.694,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And you know what the best disincentive is?

193
0:09:51.793,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Losing it.

194
0:09:53.058,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So if companies really want accountability,

195
0:09:56.817,000 --> 0:09:58,000
they should assume that that is a given.

196
0:09:58.946,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Consequences are what happen when you don't do what you're accountable for.

197
0:10:04.426,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Imagine this:

198
0:10:06.438,000 --> 0:10:12,000
imagine a place where people of all colors and all races

199
0:10:13.213,000 --> 0:10:17,000
are on and climbing every rung of the corporate ladder;

200
0:10:17.929,000 --> 0:10:21,000
where those people feel safe -- indeed, expected --

201
0:10:22.294,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to bring their unassimilated, authentic selves to work every day,

202
0:10:26.796,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because the difference that they bring is both recognized and respected.

203
0:10:32.511,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And imagine a place where the lessons we learn about diversity at work

204
0:10:38.237,000 --> 0:10:43,000
actually transform the things we do, think and say outside of work.

205
0:10:44.288,000 --> 0:10:46,000
That is what happens if we all work together

206
0:10:47.2,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to fix what's broken.

207
0:10:48.762,000 --> 0:10:51,000
That is what happens if we stop praying for change to happen

208
0:10:52.42,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and actually start moving our feet to making it.

209
0:10:55.551,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That is the power of single-mindedness.

210
0:10:58.071,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Thank you.

211
0:10:59.255,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Applause)

0:00:15.222,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Music)

2
0:00:31.334,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Sun shining up above

3
0:00:35.406,000 --> 0:00:37,000
down here it's 10 below

4
0:00:43.701,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I'm moving on to a place now

5
0:00:48.142,000 --> 0:00:51,000
where the streets are paved with gold

6
0:00:55.962,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There'll be two trains running --

7
0:01:00.648,000 --> 0:01:02,000
running side by side

8
0:01:08.95,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Some trains are going out

9
0:01:14.244,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Two trains running --

10
0:01:18.459,000 --> 0:01:2,000
running side by side

11
0:01:24.521,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I'm going to catch that fast express train

12
0:01:28.818,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to my reward in the sky

13
0:01:37.29,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Many rooms in my father's house now --

14
0:01:40.475,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Oh Lord there's one for you and me

15
0:01:47.47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Many rooms in my father's house now --

16
0:01:51.553,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Oh there's one for you and me

17
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
No blues and no trouble

18
0:02:02.804,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Oh my Lord sweet Jesus victory

19
0:02:11.188,000 --> 0:02:13,000
There's one glory from the moon --

20
0:02:14.198,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Lord another, oh another from the sun

21
0:02:20.503,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Oh one glory from the moon

22
0:02:24.669,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and another from the sun

23
0:02:32.098,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Behind I'll leave this earthly body

24
0:02:35.36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
when my Lord king Jesus comes

25
0:02:49.095,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Thank you very much.

26
0:02:50.27,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Applause)

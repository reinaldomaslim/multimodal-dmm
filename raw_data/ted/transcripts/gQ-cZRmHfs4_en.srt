1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
If you're here today --

2
0:00:27.43,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I'm very happy that you are --

3
0:00:29.388,000 --> 0:00:31,000
you've all heard about how sustainable development

4
0:00:31.765,000 --> 0:00:32,000
will save us from ourselves.

5
0:00:33.751,000 --> 0:00:36,000
However, when we're not at TED, we are often told

6
0:00:37.274,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible,

7
0:00:41.207,000 --> 0:00:43,000
especially in large urban areas like New York City.

8
0:00:44.429,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And that's because most people with decision-making powers,

9
0:00:47.689,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in both the public and the private sector,

10
0:00:49.943,000 --> 0:00:51,000
really don't feel as though they're in danger.

11
0:00:52.578,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog --

12
0:00:56.695,000 --> 0:00:59,000
an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.

13
0:00:59.997,000 --> 0:01:01,000
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.

14
0:01:03.431,000 --> 0:01:06,000
When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility

15
0:01:07.43,000 --> 0:01:09,000
planned for the East River waterfront

16
0:01:09.916,000 --> 0:01:11,000
despite the fact that our small part of New York City

17
0:01:12.45,000 --> 0:01:16,000
already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste:

18
0:01:16.832,000 --> 0:01:21,000
a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants,

19
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the world's largest food-distribution center,

20
0:01:24.359,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips

21
0:01:28.565,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to the area each week.

22
0:01:30.118,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.

23
0:01:34.11,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department

24
0:01:36.427,000 --> 0:01:4,000
about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects,

25
0:01:40.609,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.

26
0:01:43.547,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river,

27
0:01:47.238,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier.

28
0:01:50.555,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning,

29
0:01:52.839,000 --> 0:01:55,000
she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.

30
0:01:56.606,000 --> 0:01:59,000
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here,

31
0:02:00.407,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but she kept dragging me,

32
0:02:01.645,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.

33
0:02:04.541,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I knew that this forgotten little street-end,

34
0:02:06.666,000 --> 0:02:09,000
abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.

35
0:02:09.694,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings

36
0:02:12.314,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.

37
0:02:15.322,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.

38
0:02:19.325,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We garnered much support along the way,

39
0:02:21.484,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park

40
0:02:24.668,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.

41
0:02:27.091,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times,

42
0:02:30.481,000 --> 0:02:32,000
into a $3 million park.

43
0:02:32.745,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.

44
0:02:37.697,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Audience whistles)

45
0:02:38.721,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Thank you very much.

46
0:02:40.013,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Applause)

47
0:02:44.579,000 --> 0:02:47,000
That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.

48
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:50.488,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Applause)

50
0:02:53.829,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But those of us living in environmental justice communities

51
0:02:56.631,000 --> 0:02:57,000
are the canary in the coal mine.

52
0:02:58.21,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.

53
0:03:02.29,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term,

54
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:07,000
goes something like this:

55
0:03:07.224,000 --> 0:03:09,000
no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens

56
0:03:10.239,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and less environmental benefits than any other.

57
0:03:12.929,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators

58
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees,

59
0:03:20.061,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities.

60
0:03:23.817,000 --> 0:03:26,000
As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person

61
0:03:27.076,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health.

62
0:03:30.697,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I am five times more likely to live within walking distance

63
0:03:33.504,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of a power plant or chemical facility,

64
0:03:35.437,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which I do.

65
0:03:37.149,000 --> 0:03:39,000
These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions

66
0:03:39.804,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.

67
0:03:42.82,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?

68
0:03:46.745,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country,

69
0:03:49.68,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and diabetes comes with it.

70
0:03:51.117,000 --> 0:03:53,000
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma.

71
0:03:53.649,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Our asthma hospitalization rate

72
0:03:55.488,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is seven times higher than the national average.

73
0:03:57.795,000 --> 0:03:58,000
These impacts are coming everyone's way.

74
0:03:59.77,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs,

75
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
health problems associated with pollution and more odiously,

76
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men,

77
0:04:08.013,000 --> 0:04:1,000
who possess untold amounts of untapped potential.

78
0:04:10.792,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line;

79
0:04:13.896,000 --> 0:04:14,000
25 percent of us are unemployed.

80
0:04:15.675,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care.

81
0:04:19.722,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.

82
0:04:23.645,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.

83
0:04:27.512,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions

84
0:04:31.321,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that won't compromise the lives

85
0:04:32.845,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of low-income communities of color in the short term,

86
0:04:35.369,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and won't destroy us all in the long term.

87
0:04:37.499,000 --> 0:04:39,000
None of us want that, and we all have that in common.

88
0:04:40.009,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So what else do we have in common?

89
0:04:41.672,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.

90
0:04:44.474,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:45.685,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees,

92
0:04:48.496,000 --> 0:04:51,000
traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens,

93
0:04:51.832,000 --> 0:04:53,000
financially stable, never been imprisoned.

94
0:04:55.688,000 --> 0:04:56,000
OK. Good.

95
0:04:56.872,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:58.235,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But, besides being a black woman,

97
0:04:59.866,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I am different from most of you in some other ways.

98
0:05:02.552,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.

99
0:05:05.967,000 --> 0:05:06,000
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,

100
0:05:07.954,000 --> 0:05:09,000
only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.

101
0:05:13.992,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Jesus.

102
0:05:15.271,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I grew up with a crack house across the street.

103
0:05:19.796,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.

104
0:05:23.784,000 --> 0:05:25,000
These things make me different from you.

105
0:05:25.975,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But the things we have in common

106
0:05:27.862,000 --> 0:05:29,000
set me apart from most of the people in my community,

107
0:05:30.625,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and I am in between these two worlds

108
0:05:32.475,000 --> 0:05:34,000
with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.

109
0:05:36.315,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So how did things get so different for us?

110
0:05:38.347,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave --

111
0:05:41.702,000 --> 0:05:43,000
bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx,

112
0:05:44.593,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and a few years later, he married my mom.

113
0:05:46.632,000 --> 0:05:49,000
At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.

114
0:05:50.137,000 --> 0:05:51,000
My dad was not alone.

115
0:05:51.687,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream,

116
0:05:55.148,000 --> 0:05:57,000
white flight became common in the South Bronx

117
0:05:57.701,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and in many cities around the country.

118
0:06:00.018,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city,

119
0:06:03.675,000 --> 0:06:06,000
including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment.

120
0:06:07.688,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings

121
0:06:11.18,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions --

122
0:06:15.375,000 --> 0:06:17,000
dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.

123
0:06:17.839,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community,

124
0:06:20.705,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.

125
0:06:24.655,000 --> 0:06:27,000
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems.

126
0:06:27.865,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In New York State,

127
0:06:29.04,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.

128
0:06:32.847,000 --> 0:06:34,000
One of its primary goals was to make it easier

129
0:06:35.067,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.

130
0:06:40.116,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.

131
0:06:43.215,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Residents were often given less than a month's notice

132
0:06:45.789,000 --> 0:06:46,000
before their buildings were razed.

133
0:06:47.443,000 --> 0:06:49,000
600,000 people were displaced.

134
0:06:49.791,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The common perception was

135
0:06:51.125,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.

136
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And if you are told from your earliest days

137
0:06:57.954,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that nothing good is going to come from your community,

138
0:07:00.595,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that it's bad and ugly,

139
0:07:01.77,000 --> 0:07:03,000
how could it not reflect on you?

140
0:07:04.335,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So now, my family's property was worthless,

141
0:07:06.877,000 --> 0:07:08,000
save for that it was our home, and all we had.

142
0:07:09.543,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it,

143
0:07:13.293,000 --> 0:07:18,000
along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.

144
0:07:18.459,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, why is this story important?

145
0:07:20.172,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Because from a planning perspective,

146
0:07:22.006,000 --> 0:07:25,000
economic degradation begets environmental degradation,

147
0:07:25.747,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which begets social degradation.

148
0:07:28.287,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage

149
0:07:31.374,000 --> 0:07:33,000
for all the environmental injustices that were to come.

150
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day

151
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.

152
0:07:41.067,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?

153
0:07:44.869,000 --> 0:07:46,000
What costs are associated with these decisions?

154
0:07:47.489,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And who pays? Who profits?

155
0:07:49.749,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Does anything justify what the local community goes through?

156
0:07:53.392,000 --> 0:07:55,000
This was "planning" -- in quotes --

157
0:07:55.71,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that did not have our best interests in mind.

158
0:07:58.002,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.

159
0:08:01.441,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That small park I told you about earlier

160
0:08:03.409,000 --> 0:08:06,000
was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.

161
0:08:06.711,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant

162
0:08:10.087,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade

163
0:08:12.219,000 --> 0:08:13,000
with dedicated on-street bike paths.

164
0:08:13.973,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety,

165
0:08:17.455,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the placement of the waste and other facilities,

166
0:08:19.724,000 --> 0:08:22,000
which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.

167
0:08:23.22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
They provide opportunities to be more physically active,

168
0:08:25.958,000 --> 0:08:27,000
as well as local economic development.

169
0:08:28.415,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Think bike shops, juice stands.

170
0:08:30.011,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.

171
0:08:32.906,000 --> 0:08:33,000
This is Lafayette Avenue --

172
0:08:34.804,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.

173
0:08:37.985,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx

174
0:08:41.03,000 --> 0:08:43,000
with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.

175
0:08:43.403,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.

176
0:08:47.401,000 --> 0:08:51,000
As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.

177
0:08:51.689,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training,

178
0:08:55.524,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration,

179
0:08:58.855,000 --> 0:09:,000
so that folks from our community have the skills to compete

180
0:09:01.68,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for these well-paying jobs.

181
0:09:03.043,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs --

182
0:09:06.404,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and with people that have both a financial and personal stake

183
0:09:09.287,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in their environment.

184
0:09:10.468,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic

185
0:09:13.135,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of the Robert Moses era,

186
0:09:14.358,000 --> 0:09:17,000
built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.

187
0:09:17.758,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.

188
0:09:20.551,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The community created an alternative transportation plan

189
0:09:23.247,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that allows for the removal of the highway.

190
0:09:25.897,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders

191
0:09:29.044,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized

192
0:09:31.656,000 --> 0:09:34,000
for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.

193
0:09:34.722,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project

194
0:09:39.573,000 --> 0:09:4,000
on top of our offices.

195
0:09:40.985,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat,

196
0:09:44.474,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.

197
0:09:46.601,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Green roofs are soil and living plants.

198
0:09:48.657,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials

199
0:09:51.928,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect

200
0:09:54.723,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and degrade under the sun,

201
0:09:56.072,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which we in turn breathe.

202
0:09:57.318,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall,

203
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions --

204
0:10:03.683,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which, incidentally, are often located

205
0:10:05.527,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in environmental justice communities like mine.

206
0:10:07.772,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And they provide habitats for our little friends!

207
0:10:11.096,000 --> 0:10:12,000
[Butterfly]

208
0:10:12.277,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:13.524,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So cool!

210
0:10:14.731,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard

211
0:10:17.261,000 --> 0:10:19,000
for our own green roof installation business,

212
0:10:19.409,000 --> 0:10:22,000
bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.

213
0:10:22.935,000 --> 0:10:23,000
[Green is the new black ...]

214
0:10:24.335,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

215
0:10:28.502,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I like that, too.

216
0:10:30.177,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here,

217
0:10:33.897,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but since I have all of your attention:

218
0:10:35.801,000 --> 0:10:36,000
We need investors. End of pitch.

219
0:10:37.412,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.

220
0:10:39.824,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Anyway --

221
0:10:41.004,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Laughter)

222
0:10:42.488,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Applause)

223
0:10:47.431,000 --> 0:10:49,000
OK. Katrina.

224
0:10:50.884,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward

225
0:10:53.932,000 --> 0:10:54,000
had a lot in common.

226
0:10:55.145,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Both were largely populated by poor people of color,

227
0:10:57.923,000 --> 0:11:,000
both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.

228
0:11:01.242,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents

229
0:11:04.6,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in close proximity of one another.

230
0:11:06.51,000 --> 0:11:09,000
In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.

231
0:11:09.582,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst,

232
0:11:13.084,000 --> 0:11:16,000
by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning

233
0:11:16.455,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and lax governmental accountability.

234
0:11:18.652,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.

235
0:11:23.104,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But we have emerged with valuable lessons

236
0:11:25.264,000 --> 0:11:27,000
about how to dig ourselves out.

237
0:11:27.561,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight

238
0:11:31.387,000 --> 0:11:34,000
or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises

239
0:11:34.717,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of presidents come and gone.

240
0:11:36.351,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two,

241
0:11:39.194,000 --> 0:11:4,000
like the South Bronx did?

242
0:11:40.48,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Or will we take proactive steps

243
0:11:41.988,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists

244
0:11:44.949,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?

245
0:11:47.819,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Now listen, I do not expect individuals,

246
0:11:50.486,000 --> 0:11:52,000
corporations or government to make the world a better place

247
0:11:53.295,000 --> 0:11:54,000
because it is right or moral.

248
0:11:55.596,000 --> 0:11:59,000
This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through.

249
0:11:59.9,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue.

250
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But I'll tell you later, if you want to know.

251
0:12:04.12,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

252
0:12:05.209,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it,

253
0:12:09.523,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that motivates people in the end.

254
0:12:11.283,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line"

255
0:12:14.229,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that sustainable development can produce.

256
0:12:16.477,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns

257
0:12:20.423,000 --> 0:12:23,000
for all concerned: the developers, government

258
0:12:23.549,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and the community where these projects go up.

259
0:12:26.009,000 --> 0:12:28,000
At present, that's not happening in New York City.

260
0:12:29.311,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit.

261
0:12:33.358,000 --> 0:12:35,000
A parade of government subsidies

262
0:12:35.477,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx,

263
0:12:39.053,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but there is scant coordination between city agencies

264
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution,

265
0:12:45.934,000 --> 0:12:47,000
solid waste and the impacts on open space.

266
0:12:48.483,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame

267
0:12:52.887,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it's not even funny.

268
0:12:54.082,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Because on top of that,

269
0:12:56.305,000 --> 0:13:,000
the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built

270
0:13:00.752,000 --> 0:13:02,000
by destroying two well-loved community parks.

271
0:13:03.593,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.

272
0:13:06.728,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars,

273
0:13:10.07,000 --> 0:13:13,000
these projects include thousands of new parking spaces,

274
0:13:13.768,000 --> 0:13:16,000
yet zip in terms of mass public transit.

275
0:13:17.046,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Now, what's missing from the larger debate

276
0:13:19.102,000 --> 0:13:2,000
is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis

277
0:13:21.055,000 --> 0:13:24,000
between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community,

278
0:13:24.478,000 --> 0:13:27,000
versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.

279
0:13:28.109,000 --> 0:13:31,000
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others

280
0:13:31.364,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to shine a light on these issues.

281
0:13:32.974,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development.

282
0:13:36.197,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve.

283
0:13:38.629,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And I've embraced my inner capitalist.

284
0:13:41.692,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And, but I don't have --

285
0:13:43.193,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Laughter)

286
0:13:44.842,000 --> 0:13:46,000
You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.

287
0:13:47.462,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Laughter)

288
0:13:51.256,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So I don't have a problem with developers making money.

289
0:13:54.696,000 --> 0:13:56,000
There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable,

290
0:13:57.67,000 --> 0:14:01,000
community-friendly development can still make a fortune.

291
0:14:02.085,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins --

292
0:14:05.181,000 --> 0:14:08,000
both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that.

293
0:14:09.174,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit

294
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
politically vulnerable communities for profit.

295
0:14:14.191,000 --> 0:14:16,000
That it continues is a shame upon us all,

296
0:14:17.063,000 --> 0:14:19,000
because we are all responsible for the future that we create.

297
0:14:20.028,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities,

298
0:14:23.299,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is to learn from visionaries in other cities.

299
0:14:25.457,000 --> 0:14:27,000
This is my version of globalization.

300
0:14:27.513,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Let's take Bogota.

301
0:14:29.07,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking;

302
0:14:32.887,000 --> 0:14:34,000
a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.

303
0:14:35.749,000 --> 0:14:38,000
However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s

304
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:43,000
with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa.

305
0:14:43.048,000 --> 0:14:44,000
He looked at the demographics.

306
0:14:44.853,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Few Bogotanos own cars,

307
0:14:46.608,000 --> 0:14:5,000
yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.

308
0:14:50.67,000 --> 0:14:52,000
If you're a mayor, you can do something about that.

309
0:14:53.079,000 --> 0:14:57,000
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three,

310
0:14:57.359,000 --> 0:14:59,000
outlawed parking on those streets,

311
0:14:59.646,000 --> 0:15:01,000
expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes,

312
0:15:02.449,000 --> 0:15:03,000
created public plazas,

313
0:15:04.404,000 --> 0:15:06,000
created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems

314
0:15:07.295,000 --> 0:15:08,000
in the entire world.

315
0:15:08.801,000 --> 0:15:11,000
For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached.

316
0:15:13.186,000 --> 0:15:16,000
But as people began to see that they were being put first

317
0:15:16.916,000 --> 0:15:18,000
on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives,

318
0:15:19.15,000 --> 0:15:2,000
incredible things happened.

319
0:15:20.505,000 --> 0:15:21,000
People stopped littering.

320
0:15:21.921,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people.

321
0:15:25.83,000 --> 0:15:28,000
His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time,

322
0:15:29.733,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and on a third-world budget, at that.

323
0:15:31.868,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry.

324
0:15:34.591,000 --> 0:15:36,000
But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda

325
0:15:37.456,000 --> 0:15:4,000
was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars,

326
0:15:41.394,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate

327
0:15:45.283,000 --> 0:15:46,000
in the city's resurgence.

328
0:15:46.929,000 --> 0:15:48,000
That development should not come

329
0:15:49.113,000 --> 0:15:51,000
at the expense of the majority of the population

330
0:15:51.724,000 --> 0:15:53,000
is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S.

331
0:15:54.518,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But Bogota's example has the power to change that.

332
0:15:57.327,000 --> 0:16:,000
You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence.

333
0:16:00.844,000 --> 0:16:03,000
That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.

334
0:16:04.59,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Use your influence

335
0:16:05.964,000 --> 0:16:08,000
in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere.

336
0:16:09.567,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Don't just talk about it at TED.

337
0:16:11.985,000 --> 0:16:15,000
This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build,

338
0:16:16.119,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and as you all know, politics are personal.

339
0:16:19.118,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Help me make green the new black.

340
0:16:21.592,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Help me make sustainability sexy.

341
0:16:23.753,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations.

342
0:16:27.174,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice.

343
0:16:30.301,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return.

344
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table,

345
0:16:37.564,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.

346
0:16:40.937,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Oh good, glad I have a little more time!

347
0:16:42.869,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast,

348
0:16:46.838,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included

349
0:16:51.61,000 --> 0:16:53,000
in his new marketing strategy.

350
0:16:53.86,000 --> 0:16:55,000
His response was a grant program.

351
0:16:57.692,000 --> 0:17:,000
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.

352
0:17:03.736,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I was making him an offer.

353
0:17:07.233,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Applause)

354
0:17:14.983,000 --> 0:17:18,000
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around.

355
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.

356
0:17:22.174,000 --> 0:17:23,000
(Laughter)

357
0:17:23.61,000 --> 0:17:27,000
But grassroots groups are needed at the table

358
0:17:27.741,000 --> 0:17:29,000
during the decision-making process.

359
0:17:30.583,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us

360
0:17:34.651,000 --> 0:17:35,000
that we waste every day,

361
0:17:36.097,000 --> 0:17:39,000
don't add wasting our energy, intelligence

362
0:17:39.291,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and hard-earned experience to that count.

363
0:17:43.158,000 --> 0:17:48,000
(Applause)

364
0:17:48.645,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I have come from so far to meet you like this.

365
0:17:56.436,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Please don't waste me.

366
0:18:00.628,000 --> 0:18:01,000
By working together,

367
0:18:01.806,000 --> 0:18:05,000
we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals

368
0:18:06.808,000 --> 0:18:08,000
who actually have the audacity and courage

369
0:18:09.039,000 --> 0:18:11,000
to believe that we actually can change the world.

370
0:18:12.238,000 --> 0:18:13,000
We might have come to this conference

371
0:18:14.032,000 --> 0:18:16,000
from very, very different stations in life,

372
0:18:16.588,000 --> 0:18:2,000
but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing.

373
0:18:23.517,000 --> 0:18:26,000
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

374
0:18:28.675,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Ciao, bellos!

375
0:18:29.875,000 --> 0:18:35,000
(Applause)

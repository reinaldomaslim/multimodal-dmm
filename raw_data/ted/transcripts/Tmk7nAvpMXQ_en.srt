1
0:00:12.725,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I am a climate scientist,

2
0:00:15.034,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I hate weather.

3
0:00:17.821,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I have spent too much time in California,

4
0:00:20.251,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I strongly feel that weather should be optional.

5
0:00:23.94,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.098,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So I don't want to experience clouds,

7
0:00:28.163,000 --> 0:00:29,000
let alone study them.

8
0:00:30.186,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But clouds seem to follow me wherever I go.

9
0:00:34.642,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The thing is, clouds are a real challenge for climate science.

10
0:00:39.791,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We don't know how they're going to react as the planet heats up,

11
0:00:43.636,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and hidden in that uncertainty

12
0:00:47.381,000 --> 0:00:48,000
might be hope.

13
0:00:49.351,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Maybe, just maybe,

14
0:00:51.908,000 --> 0:00:53,000
clouds could slow down global warming,

15
0:00:54.613,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and buy us a little bit more time to get our act together,

16
0:00:58.284,000 --> 0:01:,000
which would be very convenient right now.

17
0:01:01.42,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I mean, even I could put up with a few more cloudy days

18
0:01:05.534,000 --> 0:01:07,000
if clouds saved the planet.

19
0:01:08.542,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, we are sure about some things.

20
0:01:11.717,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,

21
0:01:14.064,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we're emitting a lot of it,

22
0:01:15.484,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and the planet is heating up.

23
0:01:17.354,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Case closed.

24
0:01:19.327,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But I still go to work every day.

25
0:01:21.79,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It turns out that there is a lot that we don't understand

26
0:01:25.514,000 --> 0:01:26,000
about climate change.

27
0:01:27.434,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In particular, we haven't answered

28
0:01:29.922,000 --> 0:01:31,000
what seems to be a very fundamental question.

29
0:01:33.404,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We know it's going to get hot,

30
0:01:35.019,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but we don't know exactly how hot it's going to get.

31
0:01:39.492,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, this is a really easy question to answer

32
0:01:42.455,000 --> 0:01:44,000
if one of you would like to give me a time machine.

33
0:01:45.453,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But I'm going to be honest with you:

34
0:01:47.938,000 --> 0:01:49,000
if I had a time machine,

35
0:01:50.017,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I would not be hanging out at this particular point in history.

36
0:01:54.049,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So in order to see the future,

37
0:01:57.126,000 --> 0:02:,000
we have to rely on the output of computer simulations --

38
0:02:00.764,000 --> 0:02:01,000
climate models, like this one.

39
0:02:03.338,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, in my line of work,

40
0:02:05.202,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I encounter many very charming people on the internet

41
0:02:08.927,000 --> 0:02:12,000
who like to tell me that climate models are all wrong.

42
0:02:13.762,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And I would just like to say:

43
0:02:16.102,000 --> 0:02:17,000
no kidding!

44
0:02:18.209,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Seriously? I get paid to complain about climate models.

45
0:02:21.811,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But we don't want models to be perfect.

46
0:02:25.645,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We want them to be useful.

47
0:02:27.766,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I mean, think about it:

48
0:02:29.421,000 --> 0:02:31,000
a computer simulation

49
0:02:31.503,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that's able to exactly reproduce all of reality.

50
0:02:35.986,000 --> 0:02:36,000
That's not a climate model;

51
0:02:38.315,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That's "The Matrix."

52
0:02:40.842,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So, models are not crystal balls.

53
0:02:44.278,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They're research tools,

54
0:02:45.993,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the ways in which they're wrong can actually teach us a lot.

55
0:02:50.813,000 --> 0:02:51,000
For example:

56
0:02:52.19,000 --> 0:02:54,000
different climate models are largely able to capture

57
0:02:55.208,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the warming that we've seen so far.

58
0:02:57.356,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But fast-forward to the end of the century

59
0:03:00.148,000 --> 0:03:02,000
under a business-as-usual scenario,

60
0:03:02.501,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and climate models don't really agree anymore.

61
0:03:05.607,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Yeah, they're all warming; that's just basic physics.

62
0:03:09.15,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But some of them project catastrophe --

63
0:03:12.383,000 --> 0:03:14,000
more than five times the warming we've seen already.

64
0:03:15.576,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And others are literally more chill.

65
0:03:18.839,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So why don't climate models agree on how warm it's going to get?

66
0:03:24.254,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Well, to a large extent,

67
0:03:26.325,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it's because they don't agree on what clouds will do in the future.

68
0:03:30.572,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And that is because, just like me,

69
0:03:33.367,000 --> 0:03:34,000
computers hate clouds.

70
0:03:35.639,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Computers hate clouds because they're simultaneously very large

71
0:03:39.853,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and very small.

72
0:03:41.624,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Clouds are formed

73
0:03:42.806,000 --> 0:03:46,000
when microscopic water droplets or ice crystals coalesce

74
0:03:47.455,000 --> 0:03:48,000
around tiny particles.

75
0:03:49.515,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But at the same time, they cover two-thirds of the earth's surface.

76
0:03:53.715,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In order to really accurately model clouds,

77
0:03:56.759,000 --> 0:04:,000
we'd need to track the behavior of every water droplet and dust grain

78
0:04:01.307,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in the entire atmosphere,

79
0:04:02.773,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and there's no computer powerful enough to do that.

80
0:04:05.676,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So instead, we have to make a trade-off:

81
0:04:08.94,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we can zoom in and get the details right,

82
0:04:11.867,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but have no idea what's going on worldwide;

83
0:04:14.869,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or, we could sacrifice realism at small scales

84
0:04:19.816,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in order to see the bigger picture.

85
0:04:22.129,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now, there's no one right answer,

86
0:04:24.383,000 --> 0:04:25,000
no perfect way to do this,

87
0:04:26.422,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and different climate models make different choices.

88
0:04:30.263,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, it is unfortunate

89
0:04:32.652,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that computers struggle with clouds,

90
0:04:35.014,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because clouds are crucially important

91
0:04:37.736,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in regulating the temperature of the planet.

92
0:04:40.454,000 --> 0:04:42,000
In fact, if all the clouds went away,

93
0:04:43.049,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we would experience profound climate changes.

94
0:04:46.809,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But without clouds,

95
0:04:48.306,000 --> 0:04:5,000
would it be warmer or colder?

96
0:04:51.312,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The answer is both.

97
0:04:53.836,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So I'm going to be honest with you, I am not a cloud spotter.

98
0:04:56.882,000 --> 0:04:58,000
My favorite type of cloud is none.

99
0:04:59.59,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But even I know that clouds come in all shapes and sizes.

100
0:05:04.387,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Low, thick clouds like these are really good at blocking out the sun

101
0:05:08.631,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and ruining your barbecue,

102
0:05:10.708,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus

103
0:05:13.655,000 --> 0:05:15,000
largely let that sunlight stream through.

104
0:05:16.436,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Every sunny day is the same,

105
0:05:18.857,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but every cloudy day is cloudy in its own way.

106
0:05:21.857,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And it's this diversity

107
0:05:23.839,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that can make the global impact of clouds very hard to understand.

108
0:05:28.096,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So to see this global effect of clouds,

109
0:05:31.124,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it really helps to take a selfie.

110
0:05:34.958,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It will never cease to blow my mind

111
0:05:38.483,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that we can see our planet from outer space,

112
0:05:41.692,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but we can't see all of it.

113
0:05:43.938,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Clouds are blocking the view.

114
0:05:46.12,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That's what they do.

115
0:05:47.509,000 --> 0:05:51,000
These low, thick clouds are extremely effective sunshades.

116
0:05:52.219,000 --> 0:05:55,000
They turn back about 20 percent of everything the sun sends us.

117
0:05:56.294,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That is a lot of wasted solar power.

118
0:05:59.022,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So, low clouds are powerful sunshades,

119
0:06:02.028,000 --> 0:06:03,000
making the planet cooler.

120
0:06:03.892,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But that's not the only effect of clouds.

121
0:06:06.766,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Our planet has a temperature,

122
0:06:08.362,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and like anything with a temperature,

123
0:06:10.573,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it's giving off heat.

124
0:06:12.469,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We are radiating thermal energy away into space,

125
0:06:15.819,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we can see this in the infrared.

126
0:06:18.688,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Once again, clouds are blocking the view.

127
0:06:22.207,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That's because high clouds live in the upper reaches of the atmosphere,

128
0:06:26.034,000 --> 0:06:27,000
where it's very cold.

129
0:06:27.811,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And this means that they lose very little heat to space themselves.

130
0:06:31.533,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But at the same time, they block the heat coming up from the planet below.

131
0:06:35.948,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The earth is trying to cool itself off,

132
0:06:38.847,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and high clouds are getting in the way.

133
0:06:41.983,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The result is a very powerful greenhouse effect.

134
0:06:46.819,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So, clouds play this very large and dual role

135
0:06:50.697,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in the climate system.

136
0:06:52.292,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We've got low clouds that act like a sunshade,

137
0:06:55.107,000 --> 0:06:56,000
cooling the planet,

138
0:06:56.5,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and high clouds which act like a greenhouse,

139
0:06:59.443,000 --> 0:07:,000
warming the planet.

140
0:07:01.245,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Right now, these two effects -- they don't cancel out.

141
0:07:04.51,000 --> 0:07:07,000
That sunshade -- it's a little bit more powerful.

142
0:07:07.952,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So if we got rid of all the clouds tomorrow,

143
0:07:11.054,000 --> 0:07:14,000
which, for the record, I am not advocating,

144
0:07:14.292,000 --> 0:07:15,000
our planet would get warmer.

145
0:07:16.875,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So clearly, all of the clouds are not going away.

146
0:07:20.63,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But climate change is change.

147
0:07:23.348,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So we can ask:

148
0:07:24.782,000 --> 0:07:27,000
How will global warming change clouds?

149
0:07:28.696,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But remember, clouds are so important

150
0:07:31.534,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in regulating the earth's temperature,

151
0:07:33.656,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and they both warm and cool the planet.

152
0:07:36.391,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So even small changes to cloud cover

153
0:07:39.495,000 --> 0:07:41,000
could have profound consequences.

154
0:07:42.06,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So we might also ask:

155
0:07:44.044,000 --> 0:07:47,000
How will clouds change global warming?

156
0:07:47.79,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And that is where there might be space for hope.

157
0:07:51.505,000 --> 0:07:54,000
If global warming triggers cloud changes

158
0:07:54.733,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that make for a less powerful greenhouse or a more effective sunshade,

159
0:07:59.909,000 --> 0:08:02,000
then that would enhance the cooling power of clouds.

160
0:08:03.623,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It would act in opposition to global warming,

161
0:08:07.174,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and that's what's happening in those climate models

162
0:08:10.168,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that project relatively muted warming.

163
0:08:13.214,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But climate models struggle with clouds,

164
0:08:16.601,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways.

165
0:08:20.412,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Clouds could help us out with global warming.

166
0:08:23.653,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They could also make it worse.

167
0:08:25.953,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now, we know that climate change is happening

168
0:08:28.863,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because we can see it:

169
0:08:30.652,000 --> 0:08:35,000
rising temperatures, melting icecaps, shifts in rainfall patterns.

170
0:08:36.701,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And you might think that we could also see it in the clouds.

171
0:08:40.122,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But here's something else unfortunate:

172
0:08:42.662,000 --> 0:08:44,000
clouds are really hard to see.

173
0:08:46.254,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest

174
0:08:48.324,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is like, "I have some suggestions for you."

175
0:08:50.547,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:51.595,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And you guys, we have tried looking up.

177
0:08:54.215,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

178
0:08:55.29,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But in order to do climate science,

179
0:08:58.333,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we need to see all of the clouds, everywhere, for a very long time.

180
0:09:03.49,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And that's what makes it hard.

181
0:09:05.917,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, nothing sees more clouds than a satellite --

182
0:09:10.715,000 --> 0:09:11,000
not even a British person.

183
0:09:12.659,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:13.804,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And fortunately, we do have satellite observations of clouds

185
0:09:18.935,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that, like me, date back to the 1980s.

186
0:09:22.502,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But these satellites were designed for weather,

187
0:09:26.14,000 --> 0:09:27,000
not climate.

188
0:09:27.688,000 --> 0:09:28,000
They weren't in it for the long haul.

189
0:09:29.626,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So to get that long-term trend information,

190
0:09:32.336,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we need to do climate science.

191
0:09:34.135,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We have to stitch together the output of multiple satellites

192
0:09:37.277,000 --> 0:09:4,000
with different viewing angles and orbits

193
0:09:40.379,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and carrying different camera equipment.

194
0:09:42.326,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And as a result,

195
0:09:43.572,000 --> 0:09:45,000
there are gaps in our knowledge.

196
0:09:46.319,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But even from this very cloudy picture,

197
0:09:49.672,000 --> 0:09:52,000
we're starting to get hints of a possible future.

198
0:09:53.468,000 --> 0:09:55,000
When we looked at the observations,

199
0:09:56.092,000 --> 0:09:57,000
one thing jumped out at us:

200
0:09:58.492,000 --> 0:10:,000
the clouds are moving.

201
0:10:01.513,000 --> 0:10:03,000
As the planet's temperature increases,

202
0:10:04.026,000 --> 0:10:05,000
high clouds rise up.

203
0:10:06.506,000 --> 0:10:1,000
They move to the colder upper reaches of the atmosphere,

204
0:10:10.76,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and this means that even as the planet heats up,

205
0:10:14.447,000 --> 0:10:15,000
high clouds don't.

206
0:10:16.204,000 --> 0:10:18,000
They remain at roughly the same temperature.

207
0:10:18.865,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So they are not losing more heat to space.

208
0:10:22.387,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But at the same time, they're trapping more heat

209
0:10:25.448,000 --> 0:10:26,000
from the warming planet below.

210
0:10:27.669,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This intensifies the greenhouse effect.

211
0:10:31.614,000 --> 0:10:34,000
High clouds are making global warming worse.

212
0:10:36.202,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Clouds are moving in other dimensions, too.

213
0:10:38.691,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The atmospheric circulation, that large-scale motion

214
0:10:41.72,000 --> 0:10:42,000
of air and water in the atmosphere,

215
0:10:43.662,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is changing,

216
0:10:45.073,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and clouds are going with it.

217
0:10:49.036,000 --> 0:10:5,000
On large scales,

218
0:10:50.666,000 --> 0:10:54,000
clouds seem to be moving from the tropics toward the poles.

219
0:10:54.802,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's kind of like your grandparents in reverse.

220
0:10:58.027,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And this matters,

221
0:10:59.63,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because if your job is to block incoming sunlight,

222
0:11:03.503,000 --> 0:11:06,000
you are going to be much more effective in the tropics

223
0:11:06.543,000 --> 0:11:08,000
under that intense tropical sun

224
0:11:08.764,000 --> 0:11:09,000
than you are in higher latitudes.

225
0:11:11.092,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So if this keeps up,

226
0:11:12.986,000 --> 0:11:15,000
this will also make global warming worse.

227
0:11:16.107,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And what we have not found,

228
0:11:18.452,000 --> 0:11:2,000
despite years of looking,

229
0:11:20.754,000 --> 0:11:22,000
is any indication of the opposite.

230
0:11:23.865,000 --> 0:11:25,000
There is no observational evidence

231
0:11:26.821,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that clouds will substantially slow down global warming.

232
0:11:31.961,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The earth is not going to break its own fever.

233
0:11:36.013,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now, there are still uncertainties here.

234
0:11:39.044,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We don't know for sure

235
0:11:41.296,000 --> 0:11:42,000
what the future holds.

236
0:11:43.671,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But we are sending our kids there,

237
0:11:46.802,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and they are never coming back.

238
0:11:50.253,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I want them to be prepared for what they'll face,

239
0:11:54.12,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and that is why it is so important

240
0:11:57.387,000 --> 0:12:,000
to keep our earth-observing satellites up there

241
0:12:00.662,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and to hire diverse and smart and talented people

242
0:12:04.482,000 --> 0:12:06,000
who do not hate clouds

243
0:12:06.773,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to improve the climate models.

244
0:12:09.39,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But uncertainty is not ignorance.

245
0:12:13.873,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We don't know everything,

246
0:12:15.913,000 --> 0:12:16,000
but we don't know nothing,

247
0:12:18.254,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and we know what carbon dioxide does.

248
0:12:21.651,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I started my career as an astrophysicist,

249
0:12:24.839,000 --> 0:12:25,000
so you can believe me

250
0:12:26.345,000 --> 0:12:31,000
when I say that this is the greatest place in the universe.

251
0:12:32.904,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Other planets might have liquid water.

252
0:12:36.808,000 --> 0:12:39,000
On earth, we have whiskey.

253
0:12:39.975,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:42.012,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Applause)

255
0:12:47.044,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We are so lucky to live here,

256
0:12:51.41,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but let's not push our luck.

257
0:12:54.296,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I don't think that clouds will save the planet.

258
0:12:58.045,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I think that's probably up to us.

259
0:13:00.177,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Thank you.

260
0:13:01.44,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Applause)

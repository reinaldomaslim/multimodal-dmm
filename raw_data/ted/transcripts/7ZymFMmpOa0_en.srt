1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
where the power dynamics between men and women

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
are shifting very rapidly,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and in many of the places where it counts the most,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
women are, in fact, taking control of everything.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Not a lot of women did.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And now, for every two men who get a college degree,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
three women will do the same.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Women, for the first time this year,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
became the majority of the American workforce.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions --

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
doctors, lawyers,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
bankers, accountants.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and in the 15 professions

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
projected to grow the most in the next decade,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all but two of them are dominated by women.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So the global economy is becoming a place

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
where women are more successful than men,

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
believe it or not,

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and these economic changes

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
are starting to rapidly affect our culture --

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
what our romantic comedies look like,

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
what our marriages look like,

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
what our dating lives look like,

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and our new set of superheroes.

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated --

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
tough, rugged,

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in control of his own environment.

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and replaced by this

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
much less impressive specimen,

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
who is a parody of American manhood,

35
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and that's what we have in our commercials today.

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The phrase "first-born son"

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that this statistic alone shocked me.

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In American fertility clinics,

40
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
75 percent of couples

41
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
are requesting girls and not boys.

42
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And in places where you wouldn't think,

43
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
such as South Korea, India and China,

44
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the very strict patriarchal societies

45
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
are starting to break down a little,

46
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and families are no longer

47
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
strongly preferring first-born sons.

48
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility

49
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and start to connect the dots,

50
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
you can see the evidence everywhere.

51
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
You can see it in college graduation patterns,

52
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in job projections,

53
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in our marriage statistics,

54
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,

56
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that something amazing and unprecedented

57
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is happening with women.

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind.

60
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But the difference is that, back then,

61
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that was trying to project its own desires,

63
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
whereas this time, it's not about passion,

64
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and it's not about any kind of movement.

65
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is really just about the facts

66
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of this economic moment that we live in.

67
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The 200,000-year period

68
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in which men have been top dog

69
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is truly coming to an end, believe it or not,

70
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and that's why I talk about the "end of men."

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now all you men out there,

72
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,

73
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because the point is that this

74
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is happening to all of us.

75
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I myself have a husband and a father

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and two sons whom I dearly love.

77
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And this is why I like to talk about this,

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because if we don't acknowledge it,

79
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
then the transition will be pretty painful.

80
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But if we do take account of it,

81
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
then I think it will go much more smoothly.

82
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.

83
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,

84
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I started to notice a distinct pattern --

85
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that the recession was affecting men

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
much more deeply than it was affecting women.

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago

88
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
when I read a book by Susan Faludi

89
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,"

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in which she described how hard the recession had hit men,

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I started to think about

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I realized that two things were different this time around.

94
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The first was that

95
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
these were no longer just temporary hits

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that the recession was giving men --

97
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that this was reflecting a deeper

98
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
underlying shift in our global economy.

99
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And second, that the story was no longer

100
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
just about the crisis of men,

101
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but it was also about what was happening to women.

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And now look at this second set of slides.

103
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.

105
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Women, a majority of the workplace.

106
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.

107
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This second set of headlines --

108
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.

109
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And look at that last headline --

110
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
young women earning more than young men.

111
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.

112
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They were basically asked by one of their clients

113
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.

114
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And they expected that it would be young families,

115
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or young men, just like it had always been.

116
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But in fact, they found something very surprising.

117
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It was young, single women

118
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,

120
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to do a nationwide survey.

121
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So they spread out all the census data,

122
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which is that in 1,997

124
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
out of 2,000 communities,

125
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
women, young women,

126
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
were making more money than young men.

127
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So here you have a generation of young women

128
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
who grow up thinking of themselves

129
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
as being more powerful earners

130
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
than the young men around them.

131
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, I've just laid out the picture for you,

132
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.

133
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,

134
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and what you'll see on this graph --

135
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it begins in 1973,

136
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
just before women start flooding the workforce,

137
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it brings us up to our current day.

138
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And basically what you'll see

139
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
is what economists talk about

140
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
as the polarization of the economy.

141
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now what does that mean?

142
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs

143
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and low-skill, low-wage jobs --

144
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,

145
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.

146
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This has been going on for 40 years now.

147
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But this process is affecting men

148
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
very differently than it's affecting women.

149
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.

150
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,

151
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but see what happens to women and see what happens to men.

152
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
There we go.

153
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.

154
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.

155
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The men sort of stagnate there,

156
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.

157
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So what's that about?

158
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game,

159
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills

160
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that lets them shoot up high.

161
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But of course, it's not about that.

162
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.

163
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We used to have a manufacturing economy,

164
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
which was about building goods and products,

165
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and now we have a service economy

166
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and an information and creative economy.

167
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Those two economies require very different skills,

168
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and as it happens, women have been much better

169
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.

170
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It used to be that you were

171
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
a guy who went to high school

172
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
who didn't have a college degree,

173
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
but you had a specific set of skills,

174
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and with the help of a union,

175
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.

176
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But that really isn't true anymore.

177
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This new economy is pretty indifferent

178
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to size and strength,

179
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which is what's helped men along all these years.

180
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
What the economy requires now

181
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is a whole different set of skills.

182
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You basically need intelligence,

183
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you need an ability to sit still and focus,

184
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to communicate openly,

185
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to be able to listen to people

186
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,

187
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and those are things that women do extremely well,

188
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
as we're seeing.

189
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
If you look at management theory these days,

190
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it used to be that our ideal leader

191
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
sounded something like General Patton, right?

192
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You would be issuing orders from above.

193
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You would be very hierarchical.

194
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You would tell everyone below you what to do.

195
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now.

196
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
If you read management books now,

197
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a leader is somebody who can foster creativity,

198
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" --

199
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
who can get the employees to talk to each other,

200
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
who can basically build teams and get them to be creative.

201
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And those are all things that women do very well.

202
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.

203
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Women enter the workplace at the top,

204
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and then at the working class,

205
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
all the new jobs that are created

206
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.

207
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So that's childcare,

208
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
elder care and food preparation.

209
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So those are all the jobs that are growing,

210
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and those are jobs that women tend to do.

211
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now one day it might be

212
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that mothers will hire an out-of-work,

213
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
middle-aged, former steelworker guy

214
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to watch their children at home,

215
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.

216
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,

217
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you have to look at our future workforce.

218
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And here the story is fairly simple.

219
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Women are getting college degrees

220
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
at a faster rate than men.

221
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Why? This is a real mystery.

222
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,

223
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to community college, say, and retool themselves,

224
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
learn a new set of skills?

225
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.

226
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers,

227
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and they can't seem to build the social networks

228
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that allow them to get through college.

229
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So for some reason

230
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
men just don't end up going back to college.

231
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And what's even more disturbing

232
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is what's happening with younger boys.

233
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
There's been about a decade of research

234
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
about what people are calling the "boy crisis."

235
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now the boy crisis is this idea

236
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that very young boys, for whatever reason,

237
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
are doing worse in school than very young girls,

238
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and people have theories about that.

239
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,

240
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and little girls are better at that than little boys?

241
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Or that we require kids to sit still too much,

242
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and so boys initially feel like failures?

243
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And some people say it's because,

244
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.

245
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,

246
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
so I don't have the answer.

247
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,

248
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,

249
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to talk to you about

250
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
why the boys in her class do worse.

251
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.

252
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
I mean they have much larger vocabulary.

253
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They learn much faster.

254
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
They are more controlled.

255
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.

256
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Hanna Rosin: And why is that?

257
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class

258
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
while the girls sat there very nicely.

259
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
HR: So there you go.

260
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This whole thesis really came home to me

261
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
when I went to visit a college in Kansas City --

262
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
working-class college.

263
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --

264
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that my husband and I would both work,

265
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and that we would equally raise the children.

266
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But these college girls

267
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
had a completely different view of their future.

268
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Basically, the way they said it to me is

269
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that they would be working 18 hours a day,

270
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that their husband would maybe have a job,

271
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.

272
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And this was kind of a shocker to me.

273
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:

274
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"Men are the new ball and chain."

275
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Laughter)

276
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now you laugh,

277
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?

278
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And I think the reason it has a sting

279
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is because thousands of years of history

280
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
don't reverse themselves

281
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
without a lot of pain,

282
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and that's why I talk about

283
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
us all going through this together.

284
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The night after I talked to these college girls,

285
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I also went to a men's group in Kansas,

286
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy

287
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
which I spoke to you about earlier.

288
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
They were men who had been contractors,

289
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
or they had been building houses

290
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,

291
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.

292
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And the instructor was up there in the class

293
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
explaining to them all the ways

294
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
in which they had lost their identity in this new age.

295
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,

296
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,

297
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and they were not really the providers.

298
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So who were they?

299
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And this was very disheartening for them.

300
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And what he did was he wrote down on the board

301
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"$85,000,"

302
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and he said, "That's her salary,"

303
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and then he wrote down "$12,000."

304
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
"That's your salary.

305
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
So who's the man now?" he asked them.

306
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
"Who's the damn man?

307
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
She's the man now."

308
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And that really sent a shudder through the room.

309
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,

310
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
because I think it can be pretty painful,

311
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and we really have to work through it.

312
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And the other reason it's kind of urgent

313
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is because it's not just happening in the U.S.

314
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's happening all over the world.

315
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
In India, poor women are learning English

316
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
faster than their male counterparts

317
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in order to staff the new call centers

318
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that are growing in India.

319
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship

320
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is happening because women are starting businesses,

321
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
small businesses, faster than men.

322
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.

323
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Over several decades,

324
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.

325
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women

326
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
in the civil code.

327
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And if women failed to birth male children,

328
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
they were basically treated like domestic servants.

329
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child

330
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
so they could have a male child.

331
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But over the '70s and '80s,

332
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,

333
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and so what they did was,

334
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
they started to push women into the workforce.

335
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now they've been asking a question since 1985:

336
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?"

337
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And now look at the chart.

338
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
That's from 1985 to 2003.

339
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
How much do you prefer a first-born son?

340
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So you can see that these economic changes

341
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
really do have a strong effect on our culture.

342
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Now because we haven't fully processed this information,

343
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture

344
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,

345
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
where you can see that the stereotypes are changing.

346
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And so we have on the male side

347
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up,

348
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
who are the males who are romantically challenged losers

349
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
who can't find a job.

350
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And they come up in lots of different forms.

351
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So we have the perpetual adolescent.

352
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We have the charmless misanthrope.

353
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Then we have our Bud Light guy

354
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
who's the happy couch potato.

355
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,

356
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the sexiest man alive

357
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
gets romantically played these days in a movie.

358
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And then on the female side, you have the opposite,

359
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
in which you have these crazy superhero women.

360
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
You've got Lady Gaga.

361
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.

362
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And it's not just for the young, right?

363
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.

364
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And so it feels like we have to move from this place

365
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
where we've got these uber-exaggerated images

366
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
into something that feels a little more normal.

367
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So for a long time in the economic sphere,

368
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we've lived with the term "glass ceiling."

369
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Now I've never really liked this term.

370
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
For one thing, it puts men and women

371
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
in a really antagonistic relationship with one another,

372
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because the men are these devious tricksters up there

373
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
who've put up this glass ceiling.

374
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.

375
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And we have a lot of skill and experience,

376
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare

377
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to get through that glass ceiling?

378
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.

379
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
What crazy person

380
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
would pop their head through a glass ceiling?

381
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So the image that I like to think of,

382
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
instead of glass ceiling,

383
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
is the high bridge.

384
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,

385
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
but it's also pretty exhilarating,

386
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
because it's beautiful up there,

387
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and you're looking out on a beautiful view.

388
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.

389
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
There's no man or woman standing in the middle

390
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
about to cut the cables.

391
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.

392
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.

393
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
You can bring your husband along.

394
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
You can bring your friends, or your colleagues,

395
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
or your babysitter to walk along with you.

396
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.

397
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But the point about the high bridge

398
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
is that you have to have the confidence

399
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
to know that you deserve to be on that bridge,

400
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that you have all the skills and experience you need

401
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
in order to walk across the high bridge,

402
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
but you just have to make the decision

403
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
to take the first step and do it.

404
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Thanks very much.

405
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Applause)

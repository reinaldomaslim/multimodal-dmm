0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about a cache of dodo bones that was found

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in a pit on the island of Mauritius.

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
off the east coast of Madagascar

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
where the dodo bird was discovered

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and extinguished, all within about 150 years.

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find,

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because it meant that they might finally be able

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to assemble a single dodo skeleton.

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
See, while museums all over the world

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody --

14
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
not even the actual Natural History Museum

15
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
from the bones of a single dodo.

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well, this isn't exactly true.

18
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
The fact is, is that the British Museum

19
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection

20
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
up until the 18th century --

21
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
it was actually mummified, skin and all --

22
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but in a fit of space-saving zeal,

23
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet

24
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and they burned the rest in a bonfire.

25
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
If you go look at their website today,

26
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
they'll actually list these specimens, saying,

27
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the rest was lost in a fire.

28
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Not quite the whole truth. Anyway.

29
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The frontispiece of this article was this photo,

30
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker,

32
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because this photo completely rocked my world.

33
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I became obsessed with the object --

34
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
not just the beautiful photograph itself,

35
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible,

36
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the wire you can see on the beak there

37
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that the conservator used to put this skeleton together --

38
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
there's an entire story here.

39
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I thought to myself,

40
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
wouldn't it be great

41
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
if I had my own dodo skeleton?

42
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I want to point out here at this point that

44
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
I've spent my life obsessed

45
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
by objects and the stories that they tell,

46
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and this was the very latest one.

47
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So I began looking around for --

48
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to see if anyone sold a kit,

49
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
some kind of model that I could get,

50
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.

51
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.

52
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons

53
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
into my "Creative Projects" folder --

54
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.

55
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Any time I have an internet connection,

56
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
there's a sluice of stuff moving into there,

57
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.

58
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington

59
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to celebrate the storming of the Bastille.

60
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Russian nuclear launch key:

61
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay;

62
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself,

63
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.

64
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth --

65
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder.

66
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This folder has 17,000 photos --

67
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
over 20 gigabytes of information --

68
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and it's growing constantly.

69
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been

70
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
maybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids,

71
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day.

72
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.

73
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought,

74
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
maybe,

75
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.

76
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor;

77
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I'm a hard-edged model maker.

78
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate,

79
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" --

80
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
especially parts from "Star Wars" --

81
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I can do this stuff all day long.

82
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.

83
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But you give me something like this --

84
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this;

85
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
it's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" --

86
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
this is not my thing --

87
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
this is something other people do -- dragons, soft things.

88
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls

89
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to actually be able to

90
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
understand the topology and perhaps replicate it --

91
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I mean, it couldn't be that difficult.

92
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.

93
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I grabbed all the reference,

94
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and I found this lovely piece of reference.

95
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is someone selling this on eBay;

96
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
it was clearly a woman’s hand, hopefully a woman's hand.

97
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand,

98
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.

99
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,

100
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it

101
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be,

102
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
exactly how long, etc.

103
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved

104
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I --

105
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room

106
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.

107
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton;

108
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I just noticed that as I finished this skull,

109
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up

110
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.

111
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years

112
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.

113
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I actually understood the mechanics

114
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.

115
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And so button by button,

116
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.

117
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,

118
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.

119
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,

120
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.

121
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This guy -- I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner

122
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
with a ruler.

123
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,

124
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and I

125
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
replicated every last bone and put it in.

126
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And after about six weeks,

127
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I finished, painted, mounted

128
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
my own dodo skeleton.

129
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You can see that I even made a museum label for it

130
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that includes a brief history of the dodo.

131
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it --

132
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
a museum vitrine.

133
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I don't have the room for this in my house,

134
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but I had to finish what I had started.

135
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.

136
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Again, like I said, my life has been about

137
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell,

138
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and also making them for myself, obtaining them,

139
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
appreciating them and diving into them.

140
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And in this folder, "Creative Projects,"

141
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on,

142
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day,

143
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and things that I may just want to find and buy and have

144
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and look at and touch.

145
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But now there was potentially this new category of things

146
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that I could sculpt

147
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that was different, that I -- you know,

148
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I have my own R2D2, but that's --

149
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.

150
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder,

151
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.

152
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, this is funny for me:

153
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,

154
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,

155
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.

156
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But in this case,

157
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story,

158
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it's about the object in and of itself.

159
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And in this case, this object is --

160
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
plays on a host of levels.

161
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
First of all, there's the object in the world.

162
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk."

163
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It is a ceremonial pouring vessel

164
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
made around 1700 for a Swedish Count,

165
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and it is very likely the object from which

166
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.

167
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.

168
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Built out of words, it is the engine

169
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that drives the plot of his book and also the movie,

170
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
in which another object is created:

171
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,

172
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.

173
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And then there is this fourth level, which is

174
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
a whole new object in the world:

175
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,

176
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
becomes, in its own right,

177
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
a whole other thing,

178
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
a whole new object of desire.

179
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And so now it was time to do some research.

180
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I actually had done some research

181
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.

182
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica,

183
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of the Maltese Falcon on eBay,

184
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and had downloaded enough pictures to actually

185
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
have some reasonable reference.

186
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But I discovered,

187
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
in researching further,

188
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
really wanting precise reference, that

189
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
one of the original lead birds

190
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
had been sold at Christie's in 1994,

191
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller

192
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
who had the original Christie's catalogue,

193
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and in it I found this magnificent picture,

194
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which included a size reference.

195
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.

196
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,

197
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
a New Jersey editor, actually found this

198
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
resin Maltese Falcon

199
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
at a flea market in 1991,

200
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
although it took him five years

201
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to authenticate this bird to

202
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the auctioneers' specifications,

203
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because there was a lot of controversy about it.

204
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props

205
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
about the time the movie was made.

206
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,

207
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
because I can see it compared to this thing,

208
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing,

209
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.

210
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,

211
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this --

212
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars --

213
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom --

214
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
not just a front elevation, but also

215
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
a side, rear

216
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and other side elevation.

217
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So now, I had all the topology I needed

218
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to replicate the Maltese Falcon.

219
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.

220
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,

221
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I blew all my reference up to full size,

222
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and then I began cutting out the negatives and using

223
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
those templates as shape references.

224
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,

225
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.

226
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,

227
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I worked out and achieved --

228
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
working in front of the television and Super Sculpey --

229
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
here's me sitting next to my wife --

230
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it's the only picture I took of the entire process.

231
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
As I moved through, I achieved

232
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.

233
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But again, I am not a sculptor,

234
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,

235
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey;

236
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I certainly wasn't able to get it.

237
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So, I went down to my shop,

238
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and I molded it and I cast it in resin,

239
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.

240
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.

241
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
My preference is about 70 coats of this --

242
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
matte black auto primer.

243
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell,

244
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface

245
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and I can get it glass-smooth.

246
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Oh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.

247
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that

248
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,

249
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.

250
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So I was able to actually

251
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.

252
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light

253
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it --

254
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.

255
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.

256
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority

257
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
at this point in time, when I'd finished it,

258
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few --

259
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
this is by far the most accurate

260
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
representation of the original Maltese Falcon

261
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you,

262
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.

263
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is where it gets weird.

264
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.

265
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer

266
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
of the Black Dahlia.

267
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now, James Ellroy believes

268
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,

269
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
killed James Elroy's mother.

270
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,

271
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon,"

272
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal,

273
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art

274
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon --

275
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie --

276
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought

277
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
it was a publicity stunt for the movie.

278
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
John's Grill, which actually

279
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon,"

280
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
is still a viable San Francisco eatery,

281
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook,

282
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
who played Wilmer Cook in the movie,

283
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and he gave them

284
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.

285
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years,

286
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
until it got stolen

287
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
in January of 2007.

288
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It would seem that the object of desire

289
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly.

290
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So here I had this Falcon,

291
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and it was lovely. It looked really great,

292
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the light worked on it really well,

293
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
it was better than anything that I could achieve

294
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or obtain out in the world.

295
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
But there was a problem. And the problem was that:

296
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I wanted the entirety of the object,

297
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I wanted the weight behind the object.

298
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
This thing was made of resin and it was too light.

299
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
There's this group online that I frequent.

300
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It's a group of prop crazies just like me

301
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade,

302
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
make and travel in information about movie props.

303
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And it turned out that one of the guys there,

304
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
a friend of mine that I never actually met,

305
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.

306
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
He took my master Falcon pattern,

307
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
he actually did lost wax casting

308
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in bronze for me,

309
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and this is the bronze I got back.

310
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.

311
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.

312
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Here, I'm going to put it out there,

313
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
later on tonight, and

314
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I want you to pick it up and handle it.

315
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You want to know

316
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
how obsessed I am. This project's only for me,

317
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay

318
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper,

319
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...

320
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
like it is in the movie.

321
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Laughter)

322
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Yeah, I know!

323
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

324
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.

325
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.

326
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But there's a problem.

327
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Now, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.

328
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.

329
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon,

330
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting,

331
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
there's my master and there's my bronze.

332
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things,

333
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin,

334
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.

335
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one,

336
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.

337
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah --

338
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
why didn't I remember this?

339
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Why didn't I start and make it bigger?

340
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So what do I do? I figure I have two options.

341
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it,

342
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
which I have already done,

343
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.

344
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved

345
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
going from a wax master to a bronze master

346
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and blown this up big enough to make

347
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
a 3D lithography master of this,

348
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker

349
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and then I will have it done in bronze. Or:

350
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
There are several people who own originals,

351
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them,

352
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes

353
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture,

354
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner

355
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box,

356
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear,

357
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
get a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages

358
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
saying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise.

359
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I'll give them one if they want it.

360
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.

361
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves,

362
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise

363
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
was never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.

364
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So that's Johnny Depp, of course.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And that's Johnny Depp's shoulder.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Some of you might know that, in 1990,

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and he had tattooed on his right shoulder

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Winona forever."

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And then three years later --

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
which in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards --

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
they broke up,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And now his shoulder says, "Wino forever."

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So like Johnny Depp,

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and like 25 percent of Americans

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
between the ages of 16 and 50,

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I have a tattoo.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s,

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but I deliberately waited a really long time.

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Because we all know people

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who have gotten tattoos when they were 17

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
or 19 or 23

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and regretted it by the time they were 30.

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
That didn't happen to me.

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I got my tattoo when I was 29,

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I regretted it instantly.

27
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And by "regretted it,"

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place --

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
this is just a couple miles from here

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
down on the Lower East Side --

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares.

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown,

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which I'll say more about in a minute.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And this was all actually quite shocking to me,

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
because prior to this moment,

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I had prided myself

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
on having absolutely no regrets.

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I made a lot of mistakes

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and dumb decisions, of course.

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I do that hourly.

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But I had always felt like, look, you know,

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I made the best choice I could make

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
given who I was then,

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
given the information I had on hand.

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I learned a lesson from it.

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It somehow got me to where I am in life right now.

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And okay, I wouldn't change it.

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
In other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret,

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is an absolute waste of time,

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that we should always look forward and not backward,

56
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and that one of the noblest and best things we can do

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is strive to live a life free of regrets.

58
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This idea is nicely captured by this quote:

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"Things without all remedy

60
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
should be without regard;

61
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
what's done is done."

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first --

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
something we might all agree to sign onto ...

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
until I tell you who said it.

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Right, so this is Lady MacBeth

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss

67
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for feeling bad about murdering people.

68
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And as it happens, Shakespeare was onto something here,

69
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as he generally was.

70
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Because the inability to experience regret

71
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of sociopaths.

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So people who have damage

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to their orbital frontal cortex

76
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
seem to be unable to feel regret

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in the face of even obviously very poor decisions.

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret,

79
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
there is an option open to you.

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's called a lobotomy.

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But if you want to be fully functional

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and fully human

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and fully humane,

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it.

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So let's start off by defining some terms.

86
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
What is regret?

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Regret is the emotion we experience

88
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when we think that our present situation

89
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
could be better or happier

90
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
if we had done something different in the past.

91
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So in other words, regret requires two things.

92
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place.

93
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And second of all, it requires imagination.

94
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice,

95
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward

96
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and imagine how things would be playing out in our present.

97
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And in fact, the more we have of either of these things --

98
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the more agency and the more imagination

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
with respect to a given regret,

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the more acute that regret will be.

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So let's say for instance

102
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding

103
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic,

104
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and you finally arrive at your gate

105
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and you've missed your flight.

106
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You're going to experience more regret in that situation

107
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
if you missed your flight by three minutes

108
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
than if you missed it by 20.

109
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Why?

110
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Well because, if you miss your flight by three minutes,

111
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it is painfully easy to imagine

112
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
that you could have made different decisions

113
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that would have led to a better outcome.

114
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel.

115
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I should have gone through that yellow light."

116
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
These are the classic conditions that create regret.

117
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We feel regret when we think we are responsible

118
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
for a decision that came out badly,

119
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but almost came out well.

120
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now within that framework,

121
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.

122
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This session today is about behavioral economics.

123
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And most of what we know about regret

124
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
comes to us out of that domain.

125
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We have a vast body of literature

126
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
on consumer and financial decisions

127
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the regrets associated with them --

128
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
buyer's remorse, basically.

129
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back

130
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and say, well okay, but overall,

131
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
what do we regret most in life?

132
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Here's what the answers turn out to look like.

133
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So top six regrets --

134
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the things we regret most in life:

135
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Number one by far, education.

136
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
33 percent of all of our regrets

137
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
pertain to decisions we made about education.

138
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We wish we'd gotten more of it.

139
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have.

140
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic.

141
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Others very high on our list of regrets

142
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
include career, romance, parenting,

143
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
various decisions and choices about our sense of self

144
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and how we spend our leisure time --

145
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
or actually more specifically,

146
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
how we fail to spend our leisure time.

147
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The remaining regrets

148
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
pertain to these things:

149
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
finance, family issues unrelated to romance or parenting,

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
health, friends,

151
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
spirituality and community.

152
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So in other words, we know most of what we know about regret

153
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
by the study of finance.

154
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life,

155
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
you know what, our financial decisions don't even rank.

156
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They account for less than three percent of our total regrets.

157
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So if you're sitting there stressing

158
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
about large cap versus small cap,

159
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
or company A versus company B,

160
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius,

161
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you know what, let it go.

162
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Odds are, you're not going to care in five years.

163
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But for these things that we actually do really care about

164
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and do experience profound regret around,

165
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
what does that experience feel like?

166
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We all know the short answer.

167
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It feels terrible. Regret feels awful.

168
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But it turns out that regret feels awful

169
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in four very specific and consistent ways.

170
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So the first consistent component of regret

171
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is basically denial.

172
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
When I went home that night after getting my tattoo,

173
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I basically stayed up all night.

174
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And for the first several hours,

175
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
there was exactly one thought in my head.

176
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And the thought was,

177
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
"Make it go away!"

178
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response.

179
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!"

180
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We're not trying to solve the problem.

181
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We're not trying to understand how the problem came about.

182
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We just want it to vanish.

183
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The second characteristic component of regret

184
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is a sense of bewilderment.

185
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night

186
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
was, "How could I have done that?

187
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
What was I thinking?"

188
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
This real sense of alienation

189
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
from the part of us that made a decision we regret.

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We can't identify with that part.

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We don't understand that part.

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part --

193
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which explains the third consistent component of regret,

194
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
which is an intense desire to punish ourselves.

195
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
That's why, in the face of our regret,

196
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the thing we consistently say is, "I could have kicked myself."

197
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The fourth component here

198
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.

199
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly

200
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
on the exact same thing.

201
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Now the effect of perseveration

202
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is to basically take these first three components of regret

203
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and put them on an infinite loop.

204
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night,

205
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
thinking, "Make it go away."

206
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's that I sat there and I thought,

207
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"Make it go away. Make it go away.

208
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Make it go away. Make it go away."

209
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So if you look at the psychological literature,

210
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
these are the four consistent defining components of regret.

211
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one.

212
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And I think of this

213
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
as a kind of existential wake-up call.

214
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
That night in my apartment,

215
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
after I got done kicking myself and so forth,

216
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I lay in bed for a long time,

217
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and I thought about skin grafts.

218
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And then I thought about how,

219
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God,

220
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.

221
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
In point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy.

222
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The whole point of acts of idiocy

223
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
is that they leave you totally uninsured;

224
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
they leave you exposed to the world

225
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility

226
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe.

227
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
This is obviously an incredibly painful experience.

228
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West

229
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in the grips of what I sometimes think of

230
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
as a Control-Z culture --

231
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Control-Z like the computer command,

232
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
undo.

233
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We're incredibly used to not having to face

234
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
life's hard realities, in a certain sense.

235
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We think we can throw money at the problem

236
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
or throw technology at the problem --

237
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
we can undo and unfriend

238
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and unfollow.

239
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life

240
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that we desperately want to change

241
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and we cannot.

242
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Sometimes instead of Control-Z,

243
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
we actually have zero control.

244
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists --

245
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and I know where of I speak --

246
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
this is really hard,

247
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right.

248
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Now there is a case to be made

249
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos,

250
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes.

251
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But first I want to say

252
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that the intensity and persistence

253
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
with which we experience these emotional components of regret

254
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is obviously going to vary

255
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about.

256
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So for instance, here's one of my favorite

257
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
automatic generators of regret in modern life.

258
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

259
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Text: Relpy to all.

260
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And the amazing thing

261
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
about this really insidious technological innovation

262
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is that even just with this one thing,

263
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we can experience a huge range of regret.

264
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You can accidentally hit "reply all" to an email

265
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and torpedo a relationship.

266
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.

267
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Or you can have your last day at work.

268
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And this doesn't even touch

269
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
on the really profound regrets of a life.

270
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Because of course, sometimes we do make decisions

271
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that have irrevocable and terrible consequences,

272
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
either for our own or for other people's

273
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
health and happiness and livelihoods,

274
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.

275
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now obviously, those kinds of regrets

276
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
are incredibly piercing and enduring.

277
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets

278
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days.

279
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So how are we supposed to live with this?

280
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I want to suggest that there's three things

281
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that help us to make our peace with regret.

282
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And the first of these

283
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is to take some comfort in its universality.

284
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
If you Google regret and tattoo,

285
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
you will get 11.5 million hits.

286
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Laughter)

287
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
The FDA estimates

288
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that of all the Americans who have tattoos,

289
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
17 percent of us regret getting them.

290
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
That is Johnny Depp and me

291
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and our seven million friends.

292
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And that's just regret about tattoos.

293
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
We are all in this together.

294
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
The second way that we can help make our peace with regret

295
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
is to laugh at ourselves.

296
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Now in my case, this really wasn't a problem,

297
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself

298
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy

299
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because you don't like your new tattoo.

300
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion

301
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
when it comes to these more profound regrets.

302
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I don't think that's the case though.

303
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
All of us who've experienced regret

304
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that contains real pain and real grief

305
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
understand that humor and even black humor

306
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
plays a crucial role in helping us survive.

307
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It connects the poles of our lives back together,

308
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the positive and the negative,

309
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and it sends a little current of life back into us.

310
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret

311
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is through the passage of time,

312
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
which, as we know, heals all wounds --

313
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
except for tattoos, which are permanent.

314
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So it's been several years

315
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
since I got my own tattoo.

316
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And do you guys just want to see it?

317
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
All right.

318
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Actually, you know what, I should warn you,

319
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
you're going to be disappointed.

320
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Because it's actually not that hideous.

321
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face

322
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
on some indiscreet part of myself or something.

323
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
When other people see my tattoo,

324
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
for the most part they like how it looks.

325
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It's just that I don't like how it looks.

326
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.

327
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But I'll let you see it anyway.

328
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
This is my tattoo.

329
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I can guess what some of you are thinking.

330
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So let me reassure you about something.

331
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Some of your own regrets

332
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
are also not as ugly as you think they are.

333
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I got this tattoo

334
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
because I spent most of my 20s

335
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
living outside the country and traveling.

336
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And when I came and settled in New York afterward,

337
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I was worried that I would forget

338
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.

339
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Specifically the two things I learned about myself

340
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that I most didn't want to forget

341
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
was how important it felt to keep exploring

342
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and, simultaneously, how important it is

343
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to somehow keep an eye on your own true north.

344
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And what I loved about this image of the compass

345
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas

346
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
in one simple image.

347
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.

348
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Well it did.

349
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
But it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would;

350
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
it reminds me constantly of something else instead.

351
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
It actually reminds me

352
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of the most important lesson regret can teach us,

353
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.

354
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing

355
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I possibly could have tattooed onto my body --

356
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
partly as a writer,

357
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
but also just as a human being.

358
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Here's the thing,

359
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
if we have goals

360
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and dreams,

361
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and we want to do our best,

362
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and if we love people

363
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and we don't want to hurt them or lose them,

364
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
we should feel pain when things go wrong.

365
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
The point isn't to live without any regrets.

366
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them.

367
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo

368
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and that I want to leave you with today

369
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
is this:

370
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We need to learn to love

371
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
the flawed, imperfect things

372
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that we create

373
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and to forgive ourselves for creating them.

374
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly.

375
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
It reminds us that we know we can do better.

376
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Thank you.

377
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Applause)

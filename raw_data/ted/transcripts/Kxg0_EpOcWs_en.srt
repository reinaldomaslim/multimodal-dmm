1
0:00:12.891,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Have you ever been asked by your Chinese friend,

2
0:00:15.713,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"What is your zodiac sign?"

3
0:00:17.947,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Don't think they are making small talk.

4
0:00:20.456,000 --> 0:00:21,000
If you say, "I'm a Monkey,"

5
0:00:22.407,000 --> 0:00:23,000
they immediately know

6
0:00:23.79,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.

7
0:00:27.21,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:28.24,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age.

9
0:00:32.616,000 --> 0:00:35,000
By revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated.

10
0:00:36.529,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Judgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune,

11
0:00:40.593,000 --> 0:00:42,000
your personality, career prospects

12
0:00:42.995,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and how you will do in a given year.

13
0:00:45.322,000 --> 0:00:47,000
If you share you and your partner's animal signs,

14
0:00:48.242,000 --> 0:00:51,000
they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life.

15
0:00:52.725,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Maybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac.

16
0:00:55.372,000 --> 0:00:58,000
As a quarter of the world population is influenced by it,

17
0:00:59.227,000 --> 0:01:01,000
you'd be wise to do something about that.

18
0:01:02.406,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?

19
0:01:05.991,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Most Westerners think of Greco-Roman zodiac,

20
0:01:09.211,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the signs divided into 12 months.

21
0:01:11.973,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The Chinese zodiac is different.

22
0:01:13.948,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals,

23
0:01:17.15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig,

24
0:01:19.75,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and has no association with constellations.

25
0:01:23.663,000 --> 0:01:27,000
For example, if you were born in 1975, you are a Rabbit.

26
0:01:29.273,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Can you see your zodiac sign there?

27
0:01:32.139,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Our Chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework

28
0:01:37.448,000 --> 0:01:41,000
based on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals.

29
0:01:42.486,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Over thousands of years,

30
0:01:44.305,000 --> 0:01:48,000
this popular culture has affected people's major decisions,

31
0:01:48.801,000 --> 0:01:53,000
such as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other.

32
0:01:54.409,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And some of the implications are quite amazing.

33
0:01:58.248,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others.

34
0:02:03.147,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So parents choose specific years to give birth to babies,

35
0:02:07.865,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals

36
0:02:12.811,000 --> 0:02:14,000
can give prosperity to families.

37
0:02:15.667,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations.

38
0:02:20.63,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits.

39
0:02:27.425,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies.

40
0:02:31.536,000 --> 0:02:34,000
As a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake.

41
0:02:35.102,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Raise your hand if you are a Snake.

42
0:02:37.726,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Let's have a chat later.

43
0:02:39.283,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:40.702,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We believe some animals are luckier than the others,

45
0:02:43.969,000 --> 0:02:44,000
such as the Dragon.

46
0:02:45.688,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Unlike the Western tradition,

47
0:02:47.57,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth.

48
0:02:52.178,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby.

49
0:02:55.359,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Jack Ma's parents must have been very proud.

50
0:02:58.499,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And they are not the only ones.

51
0:03:00.085,000 --> 0:03:02,000
In 2012, the Year of the Dragon,

52
0:03:03.006,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan

53
0:03:05.329,000 --> 0:03:06,000
increased by five percent.

54
0:03:07.596,000 --> 0:03:1,000
That means another one million more babies.

55
0:03:12.497,000 --> 0:03:14,000
With a traditional preference to baby boys,

56
0:03:15.434,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100.

57
0:03:20.431,000 --> 0:03:21,000
When those Dragon boys grow up,

58
0:03:22.219,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they will face much more severe competition in love and job markets.

59
0:03:27.669,000 --> 0:03:3,000
According to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release,

60
0:03:31.607,000 --> 0:03:36,000
January 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections.

61
0:03:36.835,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Why?

62
0:03:38.726,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That was the last month for the Year of the Horse.

63
0:03:42.161,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's not because they like horses so much,

64
0:03:44.787,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies.

65
0:03:48.28,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:49.382,000 --> 0:03:51,000
If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.

67
0:03:52.185,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Those are Goat babies.

68
0:03:53.939,000 --> 0:03:55,000
They don't look like losers to me.

69
0:03:56.073,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:57.262,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Tiger is another undesirable animal,

71
0:04:00.048,000 --> 0:04:01,000
due to its volatile temperament.

72
0:04:02.337,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Many Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate

73
0:04:06.214,000 --> 0:04:07,000
during those years.

74
0:04:08.122,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Perhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse,

75
0:04:11.816,000 --> 0:04:15,000
as those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition.

76
0:04:16.044,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Maybe they are the lucky ones.

77
0:04:20.055,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world,

78
0:04:24.539,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and it's interesting to see

79
0:04:26.596,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger,

80
0:04:30.198,000 --> 0:04:31,000
are at the top of the chart,

81
0:04:32.544,000 --> 0:04:33,000
even higher than the Dragon.

82
0:04:34.351,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So maybe we should consider,

83
0:04:36.495,000 --> 0:04:39,000
maybe it's much better to have less competition.

84
0:04:40.384,000 --> 0:04:42,000
One last but interesting point:

85
0:04:42.429,000 --> 0:04:44,000
many Chinese people make their investment decisions

86
0:04:45.286,000 --> 0:04:47,000
based on the zodiac sign index.

87
0:04:48.611,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Although the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign

88
0:04:52.3,000 --> 0:04:53,000
has been over thousands of years,

89
0:04:55.051,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the trend of using it in making major decisions

90
0:04:58.369,000 --> 0:05:01,000
did not really happen until the past few decades.

91
0:05:01.934,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Our ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought,

92
0:05:06.354,000 --> 0:05:09,000
famine, riot, disease and civil war.

93
0:05:10.028,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology

94
0:05:15.814,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to create an ideal life they've always wanted.

95
0:05:19.604,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The collective decision made by 1.3 billion people

96
0:05:23.275,000 --> 0:05:27,000
has caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything,

97
0:05:27.85,000 --> 0:05:31,000
from health care and education to property and consumer goods.

98
0:05:33.092,000 --> 0:05:37,000
As China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics,

99
0:05:38.09,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions

100
0:05:42.223,000 --> 0:05:45,000
end up impacting everyone around the world.

101
0:05:47.203,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Are there any Monkeys here?

102
0:05:50.03,000 --> 0:05:52,000
2016 is the Year of the Monkey.

103
0:05:53.22,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Monkeys are clever, curious, creative and mischievous.

104
0:05:58.953,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Thank you.

105
0:06:00.135,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.07,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So when was the last time that you wrote a handwritten note?

3
0:00:14.945,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It's probably been a while.

4
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:18,000
[The Way We Work]

5
0:00:20.487,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Technology has changed the way we communicate.

6
0:00:22.737,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We send emails, not letters,

7
0:00:24.362,000 --> 0:00:25,000
text messages, not phone calls.

8
0:00:26.112,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We order delivery instead of cooking dinners in our kitchen.

9
0:00:29.028,000 --> 0:00:3,000
All in the name of efficiency.

10
0:00:30.737,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But here's the point.

11
0:00:32.028,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Technology has made it easier to communicate.

12
0:00:34.278,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But it hasn't made it easier to connect

13
0:00:36.528,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with other human beings.

14
0:00:37.82,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've found that the secret to connecting

15
0:00:39.903,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in the high-tech, fast-paced world that we live in,

16
0:00:42.862,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is doing a few small things the old-fashioned way.

17
0:00:46.32,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Write a letter.

18
0:00:47.612,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I've written thousands of handwritten notes.

19
0:00:50.07,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Thanking people for advice, thanking them for an interview.

20
0:00:52.903,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It just puts that extra effort to show someone that you really care

21
0:00:56.112,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and that you're willing to go above and beyond.

22
0:00:58.403,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Some advice for writing a thank-you letter is to really make it clear

23
0:01:01.737,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to the person that you're writing to

24
0:01:03.57,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the impact that they have had on your life.

25
0:01:05.653,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Talk about something specific.

26
0:01:07.195,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Like "Thank you for the advice that you gave me.

27
0:01:09.528,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's because of the advice you gave me, that I am now doing x."

28
0:01:13.737,000 --> 0:01:14,000
People are looking to make a difference.

29
0:01:15.695,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And so if you can show someone that they've really had an impact

30
0:01:18.737,000 --> 0:01:2,000
on the life that you're living, the life you're pursuing,

31
0:01:21.528,000 --> 0:01:22,000
it could have a huge impact.

32
0:01:22.945,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Pick up the phone and dial.

33
0:01:24.32,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We've hired thousands of employees.

34
0:01:26.362,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And I've personally called every single one of them

35
0:01:29.07,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to welcome them to the Compass family.

36
0:01:30.945,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I'm able to set the tone of really what I want the company to be.

37
0:01:34.362,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Where, you know, people go above and beyond

38
0:01:36.445,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to make people feel welcomed and to give people a sense of belonging.

39
0:01:39.737,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And sometimes I call people on their last day of work.

40
0:01:42.32,000 --> 0:01:44,000
When people leave, sometimes they're more transparent

41
0:01:44.862,000 --> 0:01:46,000
than they ever were when they were still at the company.

42
0:01:47.528,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And so it's a great opportunity to get feedback

43
0:01:49.778,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that is very hard to get otherwise.

44
0:01:51.528,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Ask interesting and meaningful questions when you get outside of the office.

45
0:01:55.153,000 --> 0:01:56,000
When I'm traveling the country,

46
0:01:56.737,000 --> 0:01:58,000
every night I'll have dinner with people in the company.

47
0:01:59.445,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I like to ask questions like "What's your underlying motivation?

48
0:02:02.695,000 --> 0:02:05,000
What's something that's happened this week that meant a lot to you?"

49
0:02:05.987,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And when you go around the table,

50
0:02:07.612,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and people really open up and are able to engage,

51
0:02:09.945,000 --> 0:02:1,000
it sets a different tone.

52
0:02:11.528,000 --> 0:02:12,000
When people come back to the office,

53
0:02:13.32,000 --> 0:02:16,000
they can see each other and they know each other in a deeper way.

54
0:02:16.403,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Answer questions with honesty.

55
0:02:18.07,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You know how it feels when you go into an elevator

56
0:02:20.442,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and someone says, "How was your weekend?"

57
0:02:22.445,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It could've been the best weekend ever, you could've met the love of your life,

58
0:02:26.195,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and you would say, "Good, how was yours?"

59
0:02:28.173,000 --> 0:02:3,000
If you want to connect with people, then you have to open up.

60
0:02:31.07,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I'm not always that good at it, and I imagine most people aren't.

61
0:02:34.153,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But that's why being open stands out so much,

62
0:02:36.862,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because most people aren't.

63
0:02:38.237,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Turn the video on.

64
0:02:39.528,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I would always recommend a videoconference over a phone call.

65
0:02:42.612,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Because that's when you can see the real personality come out.

66
0:02:45.57,000 --> 0:02:47,000
When you're on video, you're forced to be present.

67
0:02:47.945,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's almost a forcing mechanism to be in the moment.

68
0:02:50.487,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Nobody succeeds alone.

69
0:02:51.945,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The more you can take time

70
0:02:53.279,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to develop genuine, authentic relationships,

71
0:02:56.237,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the more you're going to be able to realize your dreams.

72
0:02:58.945,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You're going to be able to take big risks and know that there's a network of people

73
0:03:02.987,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to cheer you on and to support your efforts.

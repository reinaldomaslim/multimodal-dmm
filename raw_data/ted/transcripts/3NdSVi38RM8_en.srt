1
0:00:13.359,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Great things happen at intersections.

2
0:00:16.8,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In fact, I would argue that some of the most interesting things

3
0:00:20.039,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of the human experience occur at the intersections,

4
0:00:23.84,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the liminal space,

5
0:00:25.52,000 --> 0:00:29,000
where by liminal I mean the space in-between.

6
0:00:29.6,000 --> 0:00:31,000
There's freedom in that in-between,

7
0:00:32.32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
freedom to create from the indefiniteness of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,

8
0:00:38.12,000 --> 0:00:41,000
a new self-definition.

9
0:00:41.36,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Some of the great intersections of the world come to mind,

10
0:00:44.4,000 --> 0:00:46,000
like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,

11
0:00:46.64,000 --> 0:00:48,000
or Times Square in New York City,

12
0:00:49.12,000 --> 0:00:54,000
both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people.

13
0:00:55.08,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Other intersections,

14
0:00:56.6,000 --> 0:00:58,000
like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama,

15
0:00:59.48,000 --> 0:01:04,000
or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind

16
0:01:05.2,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings,

17
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
ideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice.

18
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Beyond the physical landscape of our planet,

19
0:01:17.48,000 --> 0:01:21,000
some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections.

20
0:01:21.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust,

21
0:01:25.92,000 --> 0:01:28,000
instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.

22
0:01:29.44,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Stars die by this same intersection, this time flung outward

23
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in a violent collision of smaller atoms,

24
0:01:36.2,000 --> 0:01:41,000
intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things.

25
0:01:42.84,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us.

26
0:01:47.76,000 --> 0:01:48,000
To be intersectional, then,

27
0:01:49.6,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is to occupy a position at an intersection.

28
0:01:54.6,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I've lived the entirety of my life in the in-between,

29
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in the liminal space between dreams and reality,

30
0:02:03.28,000 --> 0:02:05,000
race and gender,

31
0:02:05.6,000 --> 0:02:07,000
poverty and plenty,

32
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:1,000
science and society.

33
0:02:10.72,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I am both black and a woman.

34
0:02:13.68,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies,

35
0:02:16.04,000 --> 0:02:2,000
this robust combination of knowing results in a shining example

36
0:02:20.56,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of the explosive fusion of identities.

37
0:02:24.08,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I am also an astrophysicist.

38
0:02:27.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I study blazars, supermassive, hyperactive black holes

39
0:02:32.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that sit at the centers of massive galaxies

40
0:02:34.96,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and shoot out jets nearby those black holes

41
0:02:37.84,000 --> 0:02:39,000
at speeds approaching the speed of light

42
0:02:40.6,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in a process we are still trying to completely understand.

43
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist

44
0:02:48.72,000 --> 0:02:5,000
since I was 12 years old.

45
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I had no idea that at that time,

46
0:02:53.6,000 --> 0:02:58,000
according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics,

47
0:02:59.32,000 --> 0:03:03,000
only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD

48
0:03:03.68,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in a physics-related discipline,

49
0:03:05.68,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy-related field

50
0:03:10.36,000 --> 0:03:13,000
did so just one year before my birth.

51
0:03:14.88,000 --> 0:03:15,000
As I journeyed along my path,

52
0:03:16.72,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection:

53
0:03:21.6,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the tremendous opportunity to self-define,

54
0:03:24.44,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the collision of expectation and experience,

55
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs

56
0:03:30.76,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and, sometimes,

57
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the explosive pain of regeneration.

58
0:03:36.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart.

59
0:03:42.12,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Our financial situation disintegrated

60
0:03:44.76,000 --> 0:03:47,000
just after my father's departure from our lives.

61
0:03:48.2,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This thrust my mother, my sister and I

62
0:03:51.12,000 --> 0:03:53,000
out of the relative comfort of middle-class life

63
0:03:54.12,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet.

64
0:03:58.52,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Thus, I was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color

65
0:04:02.36,000 --> 0:04:06,000
who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals.

66
0:04:07.24,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Thankfully, Norfolk State University provided me with full funding,

67
0:04:10.88,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics.

68
0:04:14.84,000 --> 0:04:19,000
After graduation, and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,

69
0:04:19.88,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I fell through the cracks.

70
0:04:22.08,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It was a poster that saved my dream,

71
0:04:25.2,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and some really incredible people and programs.

72
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The American Physical Society had this beautiful poster

73
0:04:32.64,000 --> 0:04:35,000
encouraging students of color to become physicists.

74
0:04:36.36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It was striking to me because it featured a young black girl,

75
0:04:39.88,000 --> 0:04:4,000
probably around 12 years old,

76
0:04:41.68,000 --> 0:04:44,000
looking studiously at some physics equations.

77
0:04:46.2,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I remember thinking

78
0:04:48.4,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I was looking directly back at the little girl

79
0:04:51.12,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who first dared to dream this dream.

80
0:04:53.96,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I immediately wrote to the Society

81
0:04:55.92,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and requested my personal copy of the poster,

82
0:04:59.84,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which to this day still hangs in my office.

83
0:05:03.24,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I described to them in the email my educational path,

84
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD.

85
0:05:11.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt University Bridge Program,

86
0:05:14.8,000 --> 0:05:17,000
itself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees

87
0:05:18.6,000 --> 0:05:19,000
at two institutions.

88
0:05:21.56,000 --> 0:05:24,000
After two years out of school, they accepted me into the program,

89
0:05:25.08,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and I found myself again on the path to the PhD.

90
0:05:29.52,000 --> 0:05:31,000
After receiving my master's at Fisk,

91
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I went on to Yale to complete my PhD.

92
0:05:35.36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way

93
0:05:39.52,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to my childhood aspirations,

94
0:05:41.52,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.

95
0:05:44.72,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:46.72,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It became immediately apparent

97
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality

98
0:05:52.84,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in their space.

99
0:05:54.48,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I was ostracized by many of my classmates,

100
0:05:57.56,000 --> 0:06:02,000
one of whom went so far as to invite me to "do what I really came here to do"

101
0:06:02.92,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up.

102
0:06:08.56,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I wish that were an isolated occurrence,

103
0:06:11.48,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but for many women of color

104
0:06:13.24,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM,

105
0:06:19.08,000 --> 0:06:21,000
this is something they have long endured.

106
0:06:21.68,000 --> 0:06:24,000
One hundred percent of the 60 women of color

107
0:06:24.84,000 --> 0:06:28,000
interviewed in a recent study by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings

108
0:06:29.2,000 --> 0:06:32,000
reported facing racialized gender bias,

109
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:35,000
including being mistaken for the janitorial staff.

110
0:06:37.28,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This mistaken identity was not reported

111
0:06:40.2,000 --> 0:06:42,000
by any of the white women interviewed for this study,

112
0:06:42.76,000 --> 0:06:45,000
which comprised 557 women in total.

113
0:06:47.56,000 --> 0:06:51,000
While there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position,

114
0:06:51.64,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college

115
0:06:55.08,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because many of their parents worked these jobs,

116
0:06:57.96,000 --> 0:07:,000
it was a clear attempt to put me in my place.

117
0:07:02.84,000 --> 0:07:05,000
While there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter,

118
0:07:06.08,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the real issue is that my appearance

119
0:07:08.68,000 --> 0:07:12,000
can tell anyone anything about my ability.

120
0:07:13.24,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Beyond that, though, it underscores

121
0:07:15.6,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers

122
0:07:21.6,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that just women or just people of color face.

123
0:07:25.72,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That's why today I want to highlight women of color in STEM,

124
0:07:29.6,000 --> 0:07:31,000
who are inexorably, unapologetically

125
0:07:32.52,000 --> 0:07:35,000
living as the inseparable sum of identities.

126
0:07:37.6,000 --> 0:07:39,000
STEM itself is an intersectional term,

127
0:07:40.6,000 --> 0:07:43,000
such that its true richness cannot be appreciated

128
0:07:43.88,000 --> 0:07:46,000
without considering the liminal space between disciplines.

129
0:07:47.76,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Science, the pursuit of understanding the physical world

130
0:07:50.56,000 --> 0:07:53,000
by way of chemistry, physics, biology,

131
0:07:53.68,000 --> 0:07:56,000
cannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics.

132
0:07:57.48,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Engineering requires the application of basic science and math

133
0:08:01.56,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to the lived experience.

134
0:08:03.6,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Technology sits firmly on the foundation of math,

135
0:08:07.32,000 --> 0:08:09,000
engineering and science.

136
0:08:09.68,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Math itself serves the critical role of Rosetta Stone,

137
0:08:13.72,000 --> 0:08:17,000
decoding and encoding the physical principles of the world.

138
0:08:18.48,000 --> 0:08:22,000
STEM is utterly incomplete without each individual piece.

139
0:08:23.44,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized

140
0:08:26.84,000 --> 0:08:29,000
when STEM is combined with other disciplines.

141
0:08:30.48,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The purpose for this talk is twofold:

142
0:08:33.08,000 --> 0:08:38,000
first, to say directly to every black, Latina, indigenous, First Nation

143
0:08:38.84,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or any other woman or girl

144
0:08:40.88,000 --> 0:08:43,000
who finds herself resting at the blessed intersection

145
0:08:44.12,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of race and gender,

146
0:08:46.159,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that you can be anything you want to be.

147
0:08:50.159,000 --> 0:08:53,000
My personal hope is that you'll become an astrophysicist,

148
0:08:53.679,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but beyond that, anything you want.

149
0:08:56.76,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Do not think for one minute

150
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that because you are who you are,

151
0:09:02.12,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be.

152
0:09:05.68,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Hold fast to those dreams

153
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine.

154
0:09:12.64,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Secondly, among the most pressing issues of our time,

155
0:09:16.4,000 --> 0:09:19,000
most now find their intersection with STEM.

156
0:09:20.04,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We have as a global society solved

157
0:09:22.08,000 --> 0:09:25,000
most of the single-faceted issues of our time.

158
0:09:25.8,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Those that remain require a thorough investigation

159
0:09:29.28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
of the liminal space between disciplines

160
0:09:32.08,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow.

161
0:09:36.52,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Who better to solve these liminal problems

162
0:09:39.64,000 --> 0:09:43,000
than those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections.

163
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We as thought leaders and decision makers

164
0:09:46.96,000 --> 0:09:49,000
must push past the first steps of diversity

165
0:09:50.4,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and into the richer and more robust territory

166
0:09:53.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of full inclusion and equal opportunity.

167
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:10:,000
One of my favorite examples of liminal excellence

168
0:10:00.84,000 --> 0:10:02,000
comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,

169
0:10:03.72,000 --> 0:10:04,000
a black woman plasma physicist,

170
0:10:05.48,000 --> 0:10:1,000
who passed away this past July after a 10-year bout with breast cancer.

171
0:10:10.56,000 --> 0:10:14,000
She was a NASA project scientist who spearheaded the NASA side

172
0:10:14.68,000 --> 0:10:15,000
of the Rosetta mission,

173
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
which became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet,

174
0:10:20.64,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and the 1.5 billion dollar Galileo mission to Jupiter,

175
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
two high-profile scientific victories

176
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
for NASA, the United States and the world.

177
0:10:32.28,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Dr. Alexander said it this way:

178
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"I'm used to walking between two cultures.

179
0:10:37.72,000 --> 0:10:4,000
For me, it's among the purposes of my life

180
0:10:40.88,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding

181
0:10:44.52,000 --> 0:10:48,000
with bold exploration that you can't do every day."

182
0:10:48.92,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This shows exactly the power of a liminal person.

183
0:10:52.72,000 --> 0:10:54,000
She had the technical ability to spearhead

184
0:10:55.12,000 --> 0:10:58,000
some of the most ambitious space missions of our time,

185
0:10:58.24,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and she perfectly understood her place

186
0:11:01.6,000 --> 0:11:04,000
of being exactly who she was in any place she was.

187
0:11:06.24,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Jessica Matthews, inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products,

188
0:11:09.88,000 --> 0:11:12,000
like soccer balls, that generate renewable energy as you play with them,

189
0:11:13.88,000 --> 0:11:14,000
said it this way:

190
0:11:15.76,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"A major part of invention isn't just creating things,

191
0:11:19.24,000 --> 0:11:2,000
it's understanding people

192
0:11:21.08,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and understanding the systems that make this world."

193
0:11:25.32,000 --> 0:11:26,000
The reason I tell my story

194
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews

195
0:11:30.24,000 --> 0:11:33,000
is because they are fundamentally intersectional stories,

196
0:11:34.12,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race, gender and innovation.

197
0:11:40.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space,

198
0:11:46.4,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I'm proud to report that when I graduated,

199
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I was the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics

200
0:11:52.48,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in Yale's then 312-year history.

201
0:11:55.6,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Applause)

202
0:12:01.52,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in STEM

203
0:12:06.96,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life

204
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:13,000
on the most pressing issues of our time:

205
0:12:13.8,000 --> 0:12:15,000
things like educational inequities,

206
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
police brutality, HIV/AIDS, climate change, genetic editing,

207
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:25,000
artificial intelligence and Mars exploration.

208
0:12:25.4,000 --> 0:12:29,000
This is to say nothing of the things we haven't even thought of yet.

209
0:12:29.72,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Women of color in STEM occupy some of the toughest

210
0:12:33.24,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time.

211
0:12:38.04,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Thus, we are uniquely positioned

212
0:12:40.4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to contribute to and drive these conversations

213
0:12:43.84,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience.

214
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This outlook can be expanded to the many intersectional people

215
0:12:52.6,000 --> 0:12:55,000
whose experiences, positive and negative,

216
0:12:55.68,000 --> 0:12:58,000
enrich the conversations in ways that outmatch

217
0:12:58.76,000 --> 0:13:01,000
even the best-resourced homogenous groups.

218
0:13:02.88,000 --> 0:13:05,000
This is not a request born out of a desire to fit in.

219
0:13:06.8,000 --> 0:13:1,000
It's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes

220
0:13:11.32,000 --> 0:13:13,000
for the totality of humanity

221
0:13:13.52,000 --> 0:13:15,000
without precisely this collaboration,

222
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
this bringing together of the liminal,

223
0:13:18.56,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the differently lived, distinctly experienced

224
0:13:22.08,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and disparately impacted.

225
0:13:24.64,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Simply put, we cannot be the most excellent expression

226
0:13:28.68,000 --> 0:13:29,000
of our collective genius

227
0:13:30.48,000 --> 0:13:33,000
without the full measure of humanity brought to bear.

228
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Thank you.

229
0:13:35.24,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.001,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, I have a friend.

2
0:00:15.828,000 --> 0:00:17,000
She's an actress, she's in her 60s.

3
0:00:18.485,000 --> 0:00:2,000
She's super bright,

4
0:00:20.76,000 --> 0:00:21,000
badass,

5
0:00:22.199,000 --> 0:00:23,000
emotionally intelligent.

6
0:00:24.056,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And a couple of days before Christmas, she was at the post office.

7
0:00:28.258,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It was really crowded, as it is around the holidays,

8
0:00:31.157,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and she was filling out some forms

9
0:00:33.604,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and she was really focused.

10
0:00:35.451,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And out of nowhere, someone moved her out of the way --

11
0:00:40.041,000 --> 0:00:44,000
just physically put their hands on her and moved her out of the way.

12
0:00:45.208,000 --> 0:00:47,000
He apparently needed something that she was blocking,

13
0:00:48.189,000 --> 0:00:49,000
so he moved her.

14
0:00:50.58,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Maybe he had said something to her, maybe he didn't, she didn't hear it ...

15
0:00:54.294,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Either way, she was focused, she was filling out the form.

16
0:00:57.09,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And the next thing you know, there were hands on her,

17
0:00:59.653,000 --> 0:01:,000
and she was being moved out of the way.

18
0:01:01.867,000 --> 0:01:03,000
He then got what he was reaching for,

19
0:01:05.102,000 --> 0:01:06,000
whatever she was blocking,

20
0:01:06.973,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and went on his merry way.

21
0:01:09.718,000 --> 0:01:11,000
She said that she was shocked at first --

22
0:01:12.642,000 --> 0:01:13,000
yeah.

23
0:01:14.157,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And then a fury rose up in her that she could not explain:

24
0:01:17.729,000 --> 0:01:18,000
not annoyance,

25
0:01:19.649,000 --> 0:01:2,000
not frustration,

26
0:01:21.593,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but "fury" was the word that she used.

27
0:01:24.352,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And she went on to say,

28
0:01:26.609,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"I mean, I wanted to get physical.

29
0:01:30.959,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I don't know -- I was furious.

30
0:01:34.879,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I don't know why.

31
0:01:36.438,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I mean, he didn't hit me.

32
0:01:38.315,000 --> 0:01:39,000
He didn't hurt me,

33
0:01:39.55,000 --> 0:01:4,000
he didn't violate me.

34
0:01:41.702,000 --> 0:01:42,000
He moved me,

35
0:01:43.317,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I wanted to hurt him,

36
0:01:46.076,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or at the very least,

37
0:01:47.315,000 --> 0:01:49,000
run after him and yell in his face."

38
0:01:50.952,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So later, I was left pondering this fury,

39
0:01:55.408,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and looking for an explanation as to why, even in her telling of it,

40
0:02:00.421,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I felt fury, too,

41
0:02:01.93,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and why this was a word and a feeling that I was hearing a lot about lately.

42
0:02:07.792,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I feel like this is the point in the room

43
0:02:09.825,000 --> 0:02:11,000
where all the men are getting a little bit uncomfortable.

44
0:02:12.729,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:13.759,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's OK.

46
0:02:15.307,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Stay with me.

47
0:02:17.659,000 --> 0:02:2,000
This fury is something that I have been chomping on

48
0:02:21.602,000 --> 0:02:23,000
since the last US presidential election.

49
0:02:25.06,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And it seems that many women have.

50
0:02:28.202,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This fury was not my friend's alone.

51
0:02:31.672,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Her fury was ignited

52
0:02:34.122,000 --> 0:02:38,000
by lifetimes of men helping themselves to women's bodies

53
0:02:38.822,000 --> 0:02:39,000
without consent.

54
0:02:41.744,000 --> 0:02:43,000
There's a culture of men helping themselves to women,

55
0:02:44.323,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and in this case,

56
0:02:45.501,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in a seemingly innocuous way,

57
0:02:47.669,000 --> 0:02:49,000
where a woman's body is like a saltshaker:

58
0:02:49.785,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"Get out of the way so I can get to the fries" --

59
0:02:52.175,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:54.28,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to the most egregious,

61
0:02:56.835,000 --> 0:02:57,000
violent

62
0:02:58.287,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and horrific situations.

63
0:03:01.721,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I imagine that some of you are wondering what the connection is

64
0:03:04.761,000 --> 0:03:06,000
between the innocuous and the horrific,

65
0:03:07.845,000 --> 0:03:1,000
two things that seem to be on opposite ends of the spectrum.

66
0:03:12.892,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Well, the common thread is the spectrum.

67
0:03:18.106,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The innocuous makes space for the horrific.

68
0:03:24.429,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And women have to live with the effects of both

69
0:03:29.934,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and everything in between.

70
0:03:33.31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Fellas,

71
0:03:34.74,000 --> 0:03:37,000
can you imagine you're just on your phone,

72
0:03:38.48,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and someone walks up to you and just takes it out of your hand?

73
0:03:41.638,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And they're like, "OK dude, I don't know why you're getting so upset,

74
0:03:44.971,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I want to make a phone call.

75
0:03:46.53,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I'm going to give it back to you as soon as I'm done.

76
0:03:49.041,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Whatever."

77
0:03:51.14,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And then imagine if someone takes that cell phone out of your hands --

78
0:03:55.126,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I don't know -- once a day,

79
0:03:58.438,000 --> 0:03:59,000
twice a day,

80
0:03:59.62,000 --> 0:04:,000
random times.

81
0:04:01.427,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the explanation is,

82
0:04:02.602,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Yeah, well, I mean, you got a fancy case,"

83
0:04:06.436,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or "You shouldn't have taken it out of your pocket,"

84
0:04:10.148,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or "Yep. Yeah.

85
0:04:12.437,000 --> 0:04:13,000
That's just the way it is."

86
0:04:14.8,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But somehow, no one ever talks about the person who took the cell phone.

87
0:04:21.246,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Overly simplified, I get it,

88
0:04:23.618,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but you see where I'm going.

89
0:04:27.026,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Men are so used to helping themselves, that it's like ...

90
0:04:31.118,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they can't help themselves.

91
0:04:34.482,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And not because men are fundamentally less moral,

92
0:04:38.228,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but because this is a very big blind spot for most men.

93
0:04:46.046,000 --> 0:04:49,000
When someone helps themselves to a woman,

94
0:04:49.105,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it not only triggers discomfort and distress,

95
0:04:54.505,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but the unspoken experiences of our mothers' lives,

96
0:04:59.436,000 --> 0:05:,000
sisters' lives

97
0:05:01.294,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and generations of women before us.

98
0:05:05.6,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That's lifetimes of women dealing with men

99
0:05:10.053,000 --> 0:05:13,000
who assume they know better for us than we know for ourselves,

100
0:05:15.657,000 --> 0:05:17,000
being the property of husbands,

101
0:05:18.953,000 --> 0:05:19,000
landowners,

102
0:05:20.938,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and having old, white men tell us the fate of our lady parts;

103
0:05:26.087,000 --> 0:05:31,000
lifetimes of having our bodies used for love and objects of desire,

104
0:05:31.477,000 --> 0:05:37,000
instead of bodies that we get to wield and use as we choose;

105
0:05:39.144,000 --> 0:05:42,000
lifetimes of knowing that whether we play by their rules or not,

106
0:05:42.488,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we still have to tolerate harassment,

107
0:05:46.45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
assault

108
0:05:47.889,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and even worse;

109
0:05:49.648,000 --> 0:05:54,000
lifetimes of our bodies being used as property that can be hit and hurt,

110
0:05:55.336,000 --> 0:05:57,000
manipulated and moved

111
0:05:58.915,000 --> 0:06:,000
and like objects that are not deserving of respect;

112
0:06:03.14,000 --> 0:06:09,000
lifetimes of not being able to express the anger of our bodies.

113
0:06:12.578,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It's no wonder we feel this fury.

114
0:06:17.446,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And if you add in the history of race --

115
0:06:21.602,000 --> 0:06:22,000
which is a whole other talk --

116
0:06:24.396,000 --> 0:06:27,000
it gets exponentially more complicated.

117
0:06:30.173,000 --> 0:06:32,000
When women get manhandled, we start to rationalize,

118
0:06:33.115,000 --> 0:06:35,000
try to figure out the ways that it was --

119
0:06:35.365,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"It was probably our fault.

120
0:06:36.733,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You know what? He probably said something, and I didn't hear him.

121
0:06:41.029,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I'm just overreacting.

122
0:06:42.538,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I'm totally overreacting."

123
0:06:43.89,000 --> 0:06:44,000
No.

124
0:06:45.719,000 --> 0:06:46,000
No.

125
0:06:47.508,000 --> 0:06:48,000
No.

126
0:06:49.244,000 --> 0:06:51,000
No, no, no, no, no.

127
0:06:52.988,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Women have been trained to think that we are overreacting

128
0:06:57.521,000 --> 0:07:,000
or that we're being too sensitive or unreasonable.

129
0:07:01.27,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We try to make sense of nonsense,

130
0:07:03.121,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and we swallow the furious feelings.

131
0:07:05.429,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We try to put them into some hidden place in our minds,

132
0:07:08.773,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but they don't go away.

133
0:07:11.794,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That fury sits deep inside as we practice our smiles --

134
0:07:16.533,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Giggling) "Yes, of course" --

135
0:07:19.037,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and try to be pleasant.

136
0:07:20.979,000 --> 0:07:23,000
"I know --" (Giggling) "Yes, yes, of course,"

137
0:07:24.535,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because apparently, women aren't supposed to get angry.

138
0:07:29.925,000 --> 0:07:34,000
That fury that my friend felt holds centuries

139
0:07:35.697,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of never being able to directly address or express our indignation,

140
0:07:43.028,000 --> 0:07:44,000
our frustration

141
0:07:44.971,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and our rage.

142
0:07:48.022,000 --> 0:07:51,000
When someone thinks they can help themselves to our bodies,

143
0:07:51.289,000 --> 0:07:54,000
it not only ignites the current fury,

144
0:07:55.289,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but it lights up the past.

145
0:07:59.686,000 --> 0:08:01,000
What seems like a benign moment at the post office

146
0:08:03.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is actually an anger grenade.

147
0:08:07.1,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Well,

148
0:08:08.907,000 --> 0:08:09,000
kaboom!

149
0:08:12.627,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Today, the global collection of women's experiences

150
0:08:16.253,000 --> 0:08:17,000
can no longer be ignored.

151
0:08:19.236,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Time's up on thinking that we're overreacting

152
0:08:21.825,000 --> 0:08:22,000
or "This is just the way it is."

153
0:08:24.63,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Time's up on women being held responsible

154
0:08:28.678,000 --> 0:08:31,000
for men's bad behavior.

155
0:08:31.842,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It is men's responsibility to change men's bad behavior.

156
0:08:38.104,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

157
0:08:46.183,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Our culture is shifting,

158
0:08:48.81,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and it's time.

159
0:08:52.101,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So my fellow women

160
0:08:54.852,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and our gentle men,

161
0:08:58.841,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as we are here together within this particular window

162
0:09:02.685,000 --> 0:09:06,000
of this large-scale movement towards women's equality,

163
0:09:08.532,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and as we envision a future that does not yet exist,

164
0:09:12.181,000 --> 0:09:13,000
we both have different invitations.

165
0:09:15.935,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Men,

166
0:09:18.959,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I call you in as allies,

167
0:09:23.955,000 --> 0:09:25,000
as we work together towards change.

168
0:09:27.982,000 --> 0:09:3,000
May you be accountable and self-reflective,

169
0:09:33.679,000 --> 0:09:36,000
compassionate and open.

170
0:09:38.59,000 --> 0:09:42,000
May you ask how you can support a woman and be of service to change.

171
0:09:44.721,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And may you get help if you need it.

172
0:09:48.676,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And women,

173
0:09:51.75,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I encourage you

174
0:09:54.127,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to acknowledge your fury.

175
0:09:57.99,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Give it language.

176
0:10:00.528,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Share it in safe places of identification

177
0:10:03.745,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and in safe ways.

178
0:10:07.788,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Your fury is not something to be afraid of.

179
0:10:11.488,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It holds lifetimes of wisdom.

180
0:10:15.857,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Let it breathe

181
0:10:19.062,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and listen.

182
0:10:21.366,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Thank you.

183
0:10:22.54,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Applause)

184
0:10:29.237,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Thank you.

185
0:10:30.577,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Applause)

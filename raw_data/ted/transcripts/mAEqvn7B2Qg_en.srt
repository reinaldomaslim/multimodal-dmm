2
0:00:16.023,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Organic chemists make molecules,

3
0:00:18.638,000 --> 0:00:19,000
very complicated molecules,

4
0:00:20.454,000 --> 0:00:23,000
by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules

5
0:00:24.138,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and reverse engineering.

6
0:00:25.999,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And as a chemist,

7
0:00:27.038,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is,

8
0:00:30.505,000 --> 0:00:34,000
could we make a really cool universal chemistry set?

9
0:00:34.656,000 --> 0:00:39,000
In essence, could we "app" chemistry?

10
0:00:39.689,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?

11
0:00:42.872,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Well to start to do this,

12
0:00:44.843,000 --> 0:00:45,000
we took a 3D printer

13
0:00:46.575,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side

14
0:00:50.877,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side

15
0:00:54.942,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and combine them together in what we call reactionware.

16
0:00:58.096,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time,

17
0:01:02.53,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry.

18
0:01:07.697,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now what could this mean?

19
0:01:09.245,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine,

20
0:01:14.513,000 --> 0:01:17,000
so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure

21
0:01:17.662,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or bacteria that you want to kill,

22
0:01:19.381,000 --> 0:01:21,000
if you have this embedded in your device

23
0:01:21.712,000 --> 0:01:23,000
at the same time, and you do the chemistry,

24
0:01:24.161,000 --> 0:01:27,000
you may be able to make drugs in a new way.

25
0:01:27.762,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So how are we doing this in the lab?

26
0:01:30.162,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Well it requires software, it requires hardware

27
0:01:33.261,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and it requires chemical inks.

28
0:01:35.627,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And so the really cool bit is,

29
0:01:37.08,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks

30
0:01:40.127,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that we put out with the printer,

31
0:01:42.396,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule

32
0:01:46.678,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and you make it in the device.

33
0:01:49.678,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.

34
0:01:55.245,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So what could this mean?

35
0:01:57.444,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.

36
0:02:02.391,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment.

37
0:02:04.36,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But to take baby steps to get there,

38
0:02:06.262,000 --> 0:02:08,000
first of all we want to look at drug design and production,

39
0:02:09.095,000 --> 0:02:11,000
or drug discovery and manufacturing.

40
0:02:11.745,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it,

41
0:02:14.744,000 --> 0:02:16,000
we could deploy it anywhere.

42
0:02:16.878,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You don't need to go to the chemist anymore.

43
0:02:18.994,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We can print drugs at point of need.

44
0:02:21.362,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We can download new diagnostics.

45
0:02:24.017,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Say a new super bug has emerged.

46
0:02:26.028,000 --> 0:02:27,000
You put it in your search engine,

47
0:02:27.645,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and you create the drug to treat the threat.

48
0:02:30.778,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.

49
0:02:34.466,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future

50
0:02:37.461,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is this idea of taking your own stem cells,

51
0:02:40.811,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with your genes and your environment,

52
0:02:42.578,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and you print your own personal medicine.

53
0:02:46.027,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough,

54
0:02:48.279,000 --> 0:02:5,000
where do you think we're going to go?

55
0:02:50.327,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator.

56
0:02:54.911,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Beam me up, Scotty.

57
0:02:56.811,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Applause)

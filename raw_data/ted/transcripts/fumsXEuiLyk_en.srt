1
0:00:15.64,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So the type of magic I like, and I'm a magician,

2
0:00:18.541,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is magic that uses technology to create illusions.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So I would like to show you something I've been working on.

4
0:00:25.094,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's an application

5
0:00:26.365,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that I think will be useful for artists -- multimedia artists in particular.

6
0:00:31.032,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices.

7
0:00:35.421,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I borrowed these three iPods from people here in the audience

8
0:00:38.366,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to show you what I mean.

9
0:00:43.036,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject:

10
0:00:47.728,000 --> 0:00:48,000
deception.

11
0:00:51.991,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Music)

12
0:00:54.036,000 --> 0:00:58,000
One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain.

13
0:00:58.779,000 --> 0:01:02,000
He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom

14
0:01:03.266,000 --> 0:01:04,000
right in front of your eyes.

15
0:01:05.702,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful.

16
0:01:10.977,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Recording) Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

17
0:01:13.858,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the creation of life.

18
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Applause)

19
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Music)

20
0:01:21.975,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Marco Tempest: When asked about deception,

21
0:01:24.217,000 --> 0:01:25,000
he said this:

22
0:01:27.22,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Announcer: Magic is the only honest profession.

23
0:01:30.711,000 --> 0:01:32,000
A magician promises to deceive you --

24
0:01:33.368,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and he does.

25
0:01:34.778,000 --> 0:01:37,000
MT: I like to think of myself as an honest magician.

26
0:01:38.275,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I use a lot of tricks,

27
0:01:39.986,000 --> 0:01:42,000
which means that sometimes I have to lie to you.

28
0:01:44.836,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now I feel bad about that.

29
0:01:47.899,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But people lie every day.

30
0:01:50.4,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Ringing)

31
0:01:51.448,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Hold on.

32
0:01:52.485,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Phone: Hey, where are you?

33
0:01:54.164,000 --> 0:01:56,000
MT: Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon.

34
0:01:57.257,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You've all done it.

35
0:01:58.748,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:00.264,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Music)

37
0:02:01.312,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Right: I'll be ready in just a minute, darling.

38
0:02:03.685,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Center: It's just what I've always wanted.

39
0:02:06.906,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Left: You were great.

40
0:02:08.993,000 --> 0:02:09,000
MT: Deception,

41
0:02:10.771,000 --> 0:02:12,000
it's a fundamental part of life.

42
0:02:14.508,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Now polls show

43
0:02:15.937,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that men tell twice as many lies as women --

44
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
assuming the women they asked told the truth.

45
0:02:23.18,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughing)

46
0:02:24.339,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We deceive to gain advantage

47
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and to hide our weaknesses.

48
0:02:30.67,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The Chinese general Sun Tzu said that all war was based on deception.

49
0:02:37.106,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance.

50
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Some people deceive

51
0:02:43.997,000 --> 0:02:44,000
for money.

52
0:02:45.544,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Let's play a game.

53
0:02:48.552,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Three cards, three chances.

54
0:02:51.87,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Announcer: One five will get you 10, 10 will get you 20.

55
0:02:54.568,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, where's the lady?

56
0:02:56.444,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Where is the queen?

57
0:02:59.158,000 --> 0:03:,000
MT: This one?

58
0:03:00.748,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Sorry. You lose.

59
0:03:02.861,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, I didn't deceive you.

60
0:03:05.414,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You deceived yourself.

61
0:03:08.612,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Self-deception.

62
0:03:10.565,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That's when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth.

63
0:03:14.863,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.

64
0:03:20.165,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception.

65
0:03:23.755,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Slot machine)

66
0:03:25.398,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They believe they can win.

67
0:03:27.89,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They forget the times they lose.

68
0:03:30.597,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The brain is very good at forgetting.

69
0:03:33.87,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.

70
0:03:37.076,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Bad experiences quickly disappear.

71
0:03:41.265,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos,

72
0:03:44.206,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we are so wonderfully optimistic.

73
0:03:48.19,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Our self-deception becomes a positive illusion --

74
0:03:52.321,000 --> 0:03:56,000
why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures;

75
0:03:57.074,000 --> 0:04:,000
why we believe Romeo when he says he loves Juliet;

76
0:04:00.876,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and why single notes of music,

77
0:04:03.608,000 --> 0:04:05,000
when played together,

78
0:04:05.95,000 --> 0:04:07,000
become a sonata and conjure up meaning.

79
0:04:09.37,000 --> 0:04:1,000
That's "Clair De lune."

80
0:04:10.812,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Its composer, called Debussy,

81
0:04:13.453,000 --> 0:04:16,000
said that art was the greatest deception of all.

82
0:04:18.36,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Art is a deception that creates real emotions --

83
0:04:23.608,000 --> 0:04:26,000
a lie that creates a truth.

84
0:04:27.227,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And when you give yourself over to that deception,

85
0:04:31.432,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it becomes magic.

86
0:04:34.733,000 --> 0:04:35,000
[MAGIC]

87
0:04:38.856,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Music fades slowly)

88
0:04:41.538,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Applause)

89
0:04:54.228,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

90
0:04:57.204,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Applause)

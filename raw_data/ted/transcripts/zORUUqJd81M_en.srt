1
0:00:12.998,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Why does the universe exist?

2
0:00:15.001,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Why is there — Okay. Okay. (Laughter)

3
0:00:18.996,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.

4
0:00:21.838,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Why is there a world, why are we in it,

5
0:00:25.414,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and why is there something rather than nothing at all?

6
0:00:27.293,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question?

7
0:00:31.939,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,

8
0:00:34.174,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the puzzle of existence,

9
0:00:35.73,000 --> 0:00:37,000
where we are now in addressing it,

10
0:00:38.644,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and why you should care,

11
0:00:40.894,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I hope you do care.

12
0:00:42.81,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that

13
0:00:45.636,000 --> 0:00:48,000
those who don't wonder about the contingency of their existence,

14
0:00:49.416,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of the contingency of the world's existence,

15
0:00:52.273,000 --> 0:00:53,000
are mentally deficient.

16
0:00:53.936,000 --> 0:00:56,000
That's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter)

17
0:00:57.883,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So this has been called the most sublime

18
0:00:59.56,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and awesome mystery,

19
0:01:01.854,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the deepest and most far-reaching question

20
0:01:04.523,000 --> 0:01:05,000
man can pose.

21
0:01:05.583,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It's obsessed great thinkers.

22
0:01:07.297,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Ludwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest

23
0:01:08.901,000 --> 0:01:1,000
philosopher of the 20th century,

24
0:01:11.231,000 --> 0:01:13,000
was astonished that there should be a world at all.

25
0:01:13.714,000 --> 0:01:17,000
He wrote in his "Tractatus," Proposition 4.66,

26
0:01:17.718,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"It is not how things are in the world

27
0:01:20.408,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that is the mystical,

28
0:01:21.76,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it's that the world exists."

29
0:01:24.095,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And if you don't like taking your epigrams

30
0:01:26.313,000 --> 0:01:28,000
from a philosopher, try a scientist.

31
0:01:29.224,000 --> 0:01:31,000
John Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists

32
0:01:31.825,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of the 20th century,

33
0:01:33.051,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the teacher of Richard Feynman,

34
0:01:34.976,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the coiner of the term "black hole,"

35
0:01:37.636,000 --> 0:01:39,000
he said, "I want to know

36
0:01:40.059,000 --> 0:01:41,000
how come the quantum,

37
0:01:41.792,000 --> 0:01:44,000
how come the universe, how come existence?"

38
0:01:44.936,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And my friend Martin Amis —

39
0:01:46.935,000 --> 0:01:48,000
sorry that I'll be doing a lot of name-dropping in this talk,

40
0:01:49.612,000 --> 0:01:5,000
so get used to it —

41
0:01:50.987,000 --> 0:01:54,000
my dear friend Martin Amis once said

42
0:01:55.963,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that we're about five Einsteins away from answering

43
0:01:59.183,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the mystery of where the universe came from.

44
0:02:01.219,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins

45
0:02:03.2,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in the audience tonight.

46
0:02:05.387,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Any Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No?

47
0:02:06.89,000 --> 0:02:07,000
No Einsteins? Okay.

48
0:02:08.052,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So this question, why is there something rather than nothing,

49
0:02:12.274,000 --> 0:02:13,000
this sublime question, was posed rather late

50
0:02:14.242,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in intellectual history.

51
0:02:16.552,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It was towards the end of the 17th century,

52
0:02:19.031,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the philosopher Leibniz who asked it,

53
0:02:21.993,000 --> 0:02:22,000
a very smart guy, Leibniz,

54
0:02:23.736,000 --> 0:02:25,000
who invented the calculus

55
0:02:25.886,000 --> 0:02:27,000
independently of Isaac Newton, at about the same time,

56
0:02:28.74,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but for Leibniz, who asked why is there something rather than nothing,

57
0:02:31.342,000 --> 0:02:33,000
this was not a great mystery.

58
0:02:33.535,000 --> 0:02:35,000
He either was or pretended to be

59
0:02:35.931,000 --> 0:02:37,000
an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,

60
0:02:38.687,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and he said it's obvious why the world exists:

61
0:02:41.702,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because God created it.

62
0:02:44.164,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.

63
0:02:47.449,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That's how powerful God is.

64
0:02:48.96,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of.

65
0:02:52.602,000 --> 0:02:54,000
He can make it out of sheer nothingness,

66
0:02:54.762,000 --> 0:02:55,000
creation ex nihilo.

67
0:02:56.236,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And by the way, this is what

68
0:02:57.181,000 --> 0:02:59,000
most Americans today believe.

69
0:03:00.02,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There is no mystery of existence for them.

70
0:03:01.734,000 --> 0:03:02,000
God made it.

71
0:03:03.302,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So let's put this in an equation.

72
0:03:05.888,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I don't have any slides so I'm going to mime my visuals,

73
0:03:08.515,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so use your imaginations.

74
0:03:09.95,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So it's God + nothing = the world.

75
0:03:15.804,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Okay? Now that's the equation.

76
0:03:19.118,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And so maybe you don't believe in God.

77
0:03:20.851,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Maybe you're a scientific atheist

78
0:03:22.681,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or an unscientific atheist, and you don't believe in God,

79
0:03:26.015,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and you're not happy with it.

80
0:03:27.433,000 --> 0:03:29,000
By the way, even if we have this equation,

81
0:03:30.137,000 --> 0:03:31,000
God + nothing = the world,

82
0:03:32.039,000 --> 0:03:33,000
there's already a problem:

83
0:03:33.725,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Why does God exist?

84
0:03:36.759,000 --> 0:03:38,000
God doesn't exist by logic alone

85
0:03:38.962,000 --> 0:03:39,000
unless you believe the ontological argument,

86
0:03:40.775,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and I hope you don't, because it's not a good argument.

87
0:03:43.102,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So it's conceivable, if God were to exist,

88
0:03:46.263,000 --> 0:03:49,000
he might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,

89
0:03:49.413,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but where did I come from?

90
0:03:51.843,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

91
0:03:54.013,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Whence then am I?

92
0:03:55.432,000 --> 0:03:58,000
God speaks in a more formal English.

93
0:03:58.64,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:00.629,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And so one theory is that God was so bored with

95
0:04:03.677,000 --> 0:04:04,000
pondering the puzzle of His own existence

96
0:04:05.466,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that He created the world just to distract himself.

97
0:04:08.388,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But anyway, let's forget about God.

98
0:04:10.5,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Take God out of the equation: We have

99
0:04:11.857,000 --> 0:04:14,000
________ + nothing = the world.

100
0:04:14.98,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now, if you're a Buddhist,

101
0:04:16.761,000 --> 0:04:17,000
you might want to stop right there,

102
0:04:18.505,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because essentially what you've got is

103
0:04:20.474,000 --> 0:04:21,000
nothing = the world,

104
0:04:22.05,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and by symmetry of identity, that means

105
0:04:23.563,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the world = nothing. Okay?

106
0:04:25.918,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And to a Buddhist, the world is just a whole lot of nothing.

107
0:04:28.337,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's just a big cosmic vacuity.

108
0:04:31.443,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And we think there's a lot of something out there

109
0:04:33.995,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.

110
0:04:36.56,000 --> 0:04:38,000
If we let our desires melt away,

111
0:04:39.271,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we'll see the world for what it truly is,

112
0:04:42.151,000 --> 0:04:43,000
a vacuity, nothingness,

113
0:04:44.131,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana

114
0:04:46.313,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which has been defined as having

115
0:04:48.136,000 --> 0:04:51,000
just enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter)

116
0:04:51.454,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So that's the Buddhist thinking.

117
0:04:53.333,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But I'm a Westerner, and I'm still concerned

118
0:04:56.832,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with the puzzle of existence, so I've got

119
0:04:58.815,000 --> 0:04:59,000
________ + —

120
0:05:00.423,000 --> 0:05:02,000
this is going to get serious in a minute, so —

121
0:05:02.581,000 --> 0:05:05,000
________ + nothing = the world.

122
0:05:05.607,000 --> 0:05:06,000
What are we going to put in that blank?

123
0:05:06.83,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Well, how about science?

124
0:05:08.678,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Science is our best guide to the nature of reality,

125
0:05:12.229,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the most fundamental science is physics.

126
0:05:15.244,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That tells us what naked reality really is,

127
0:05:18.214,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that reveals what I call TAUFOTU,

128
0:05:20.84,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.

129
0:05:23.83,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So maybe physics can fill this blank,

130
0:05:26.482,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,

131
0:05:31.544,000 --> 0:05:34,000
physicists have purported to give

132
0:05:35.207,000 --> 0:05:38,000
a purely scientific explanation of how

133
0:05:38.327,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a universe like ours could have popped into existence

134
0:05:41.322,000 --> 0:05:42,000
out of sheer nothingness,

135
0:05:43.201,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a quantum fluctuation out of the void.

136
0:05:46.281,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists,

137
0:05:48.339,000 --> 0:05:5,000
more recently Alex Vilenkin,

138
0:05:50.645,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and the whole thing has been popularized

139
0:05:52.378,000 --> 0:05:54,000
by another very fine physicist and friend of mine,

140
0:05:54.571,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called

141
0:05:57.103,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"A Universe from Nothing,"

142
0:05:59.229,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and Lawrence thinks that he's given —

143
0:06:01.445,000 --> 0:06:03,000
he's a militant atheist, by the way,

144
0:06:03.526,000 --> 0:06:04,000
so he's gotten God out of the picture.

145
0:06:05.15,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The laws of quantum field theory,

146
0:06:07.531,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the state-of-the-art physics, can show how

147
0:06:09.432,000 --> 0:06:1,000
out of sheer nothingness,

148
0:06:10.75,000 --> 0:06:12,000
no space, no time, no matter, nothing,

149
0:06:12.975,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a little nugget of false vacuum

150
0:06:16.42,000 --> 0:06:17,000
can fluctuate into existence,

151
0:06:18.393,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and then, by the miracle of inflation,

152
0:06:20.375,000 --> 0:06:23,000
blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos

153
0:06:23.46,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we see around us.

154
0:06:25.215,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario.

155
0:06:28.769,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It's very speculative. It's fascinating.

156
0:06:31.537,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But I've got a big problem with it,

157
0:06:33.865,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the problem is this:

158
0:06:35.75,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's a pseudo-religious point of view.

159
0:06:37.221,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,

160
0:06:39.217,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.

161
0:06:41.965,000 --> 0:06:45,000
He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.

162
0:06:46.734,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The laws of quantum field theory for him

163
0:06:48.784,000 --> 0:06:5,000
are like fiat lux, "Let there be light."

164
0:06:51.395,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout

165
0:06:55.834,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that they can form the abyss,

166
0:06:57.941,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that it's pregnant with being.

167
0:06:59.781,000 --> 0:07:01,000
They can call a world into existence out of nothing.

168
0:07:02.688,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But that's a very primitive view of what

169
0:07:04.635,000 --> 0:07:05,000
a physical law is, right?

170
0:07:06.108,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We know that physical laws are actually

171
0:07:09.363,000 --> 0:07:12,000
generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities

172
0:07:12.407,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in the world.

173
0:07:13.612,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They don't exist outside the world.

174
0:07:15.985,000 --> 0:07:16,000
They don't have any ontic cloud of their own.

175
0:07:17.965,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They can't call a world into existence

176
0:07:19.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
out of nothingness.

177
0:07:21.278,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That's a very primitive view

178
0:07:22.809,000 --> 0:07:24,000
of what a scientific law is.

179
0:07:24.993,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And if you don't believe me on this,

180
0:07:26.988,000 --> 0:07:27,000
listen to Stephen Hawking,

181
0:07:28.79,000 --> 0:07:32,000
who himself put forward a model of the cosmos

182
0:07:32.825,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that was self-contained,

183
0:07:33.901,000 --> 0:07:36,000
didn't require any outside cause, any creator,

184
0:07:37.539,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and after proposing this,

185
0:07:39.267,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled.

186
0:07:41.681,000 --> 0:07:44,000
He said, this model is just equations.

187
0:07:44.993,000 --> 0:07:46,000
What breathes fire into the equations

188
0:07:47.852,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and creates a world for them to describe?

189
0:07:50.774,000 --> 0:07:51,000
He was puzzled by this,

190
0:07:51.907,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so equations themselves can't do the magic,

191
0:07:55.712,000 --> 0:07:57,000
can't resolve the puzzle of existence.

192
0:07:57.85,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And besides, even if the laws could do that,

193
0:08:00.763,000 --> 0:08:01,000
why this set of laws?

194
0:08:02.586,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Why quantum field theory that describes

195
0:08:05.15,000 --> 0:08:06,000
a universe with a certain number of forces

196
0:08:06.85,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and particles and so forth?

197
0:08:07.899,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Why not a completely different set of laws?

198
0:08:10.19,000 --> 0:08:13,000
There are many, many mathematically consistent sets of laws.

199
0:08:13.478,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Why not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness?

200
0:08:16.917,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So this is a problem, believe it or not,

201
0:08:18.649,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that reflective physicists really think a lot about,

202
0:08:21.647,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and at this point they tend to go metaphysical,

203
0:08:24.755,000 --> 0:08:26,000
say, well, maybe the set of laws

204
0:08:26.97,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that describes our universe,

205
0:08:28.217,000 --> 0:08:29,000
it's just one set of laws

206
0:08:29.952,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and it describes one part of reality,

207
0:08:31.988,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but maybe every consistent set of laws

208
0:08:34.784,000 --> 0:08:35,000
describes another part of reality,

209
0:08:36.57,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and in fact all possible physical worlds

210
0:08:40.503,000 --> 0:08:42,000
really exist, they're all out there.

211
0:08:42.954,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We just see a little tiny part of reality

212
0:08:45.237,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that's described by the laws of quantum field theory,

213
0:08:47.78,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but there are many, many other worlds,

214
0:08:49.512,000 --> 0:08:5,000
parts of reality that are described

215
0:08:51.278,000 --> 0:08:52,000
by vastly different theories

216
0:08:53.235,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,

217
0:08:56.251,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that are inconceivably exotic.

218
0:08:59.996,000 --> 0:09:,000
Steven Weinberg, the father

219
0:09:01.733,000 --> 0:09:03,000
of the standard model of particle physics,

220
0:09:04.174,000 --> 0:09:06,000
has actually flirted with this idea himself,

221
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that all possible realities actually exist.

222
0:09:11.243,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Also, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,

223
0:09:14.332,000 --> 0:09:18,000
who believes that all mathematical structures exist,

224
0:09:18.708,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and mathematical existence is the same thing

225
0:09:20.845,000 --> 0:09:21,000
as physical existence,

226
0:09:22.612,000 --> 0:09:24,000
so we have this vastly rich multiverse

227
0:09:24.93,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that encompasses every logical possibility.

228
0:09:28.371,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now, in taking this metaphysical way out,

229
0:09:31.881,000 --> 0:09:33,000
these physicists and also philosophers are actually

230
0:09:34.153,000 --> 0:09:36,000
reaching back to a very old idea

231
0:09:36.675,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that goes back to Plato.

232
0:09:38.132,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,

233
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
or the great chain of being,

234
0:09:43.243,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that reality is actually as full as possible.

235
0:09:47.11,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's as far removed from nothingness

236
0:09:48.811,000 --> 0:09:5,000
as it could possibly be.

237
0:09:51.706,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So we have these two extremes now.

238
0:09:54.2,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We have sheer nothingness on one side,

239
0:09:57.499,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and we have this vision of a reality

240
0:09:59.997,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that encompasses every conceivable world

241
0:10:03.18,000 --> 0:10:05,000
at the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,

242
0:10:05.909,000 --> 0:10:07,000
nothingness, the simplest possible reality.

243
0:10:08.802,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now what's in between these two extremes?

244
0:10:11.681,000 --> 0:10:13,000
There are all kinds of intermediate realities

245
0:10:13.708,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that include some things and leave out others.

246
0:10:16.655,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So one of these intermediate realities

247
0:10:18.251,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is, say, the most mathematically elegant reality,

248
0:10:23.946,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that leaves out the inelegant bits,

249
0:10:25.621,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the ugly asymmetries and so forth.

250
0:10:28.267,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now, there are some physicists who will tell you

251
0:10:30.593,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that we're actually living in the most elegant reality.

252
0:10:34.227,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I think that Brian Greene is in the audience,

253
0:10:37.174,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and he has written a book called "The Elegant Universe."

254
0:10:40.787,000 --> 0:10:42,000
He claims that the universe we live in mathematically

255
0:10:43.058,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is very elegant.

256
0:10:44.767,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Don't believe him. (Laughter)

257
0:10:46.45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's a pious hope, I wish it were true,

258
0:10:49.537,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but I think the other day he admitted to me

259
0:10:51.45,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it's really an ugly universe.

260
0:10:54.514,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It's stupidly constructed,

261
0:10:55.89,000 --> 0:10:58,000
it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants

262
0:10:59.144,000 --> 0:11:,000
and mass ratios

263
0:11:00.81,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and superfluous families of elementary particles,

264
0:11:03.588,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and what the hell is dark energy?

265
0:11:05.736,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's a stick and bubble gum contraption.

266
0:11:09.135,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's not an elegant universe. (Laughter)

267
0:11:13.138,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And then there's the best of all possible worlds

268
0:11:15.881,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in an ethical sense.

269
0:11:17.471,000 --> 0:11:18,000
You should get solemn now,

270
0:11:18.65,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because a world in which sentient beings

271
0:11:21.845,000 --> 0:11:22,000
don't suffer needlessly,

272
0:11:23.465,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in which there aren't things like

273
0:11:25.334,000 --> 0:11:27,000
childhood cancer or the Holocaust.

274
0:11:27.549,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This is an ethical conception.

275
0:11:28.8,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Anyway, so between nothingness

276
0:11:30.865,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and the fullest possible reality,

277
0:11:32.498,000 --> 0:11:33,000
various special realities.

278
0:11:34.043,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Nothingness is special. It's the simplest.

279
0:11:36.323,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Then there's the most elegant possible reality.

280
0:11:39.833,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That's special.

281
0:11:41.197,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The fullest possible reality, that's special.

282
0:11:43.849,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But what are we leaving out here?

283
0:11:45.365,000 --> 0:11:47,000
There's also just the crummy,

284
0:11:48.101,000 --> 0:11:49,000
generic realities

285
0:11:49.856,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that aren't special in any way,

286
0:11:52.477,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that are sort of random.

287
0:11:54.029,000 --> 0:11:56,000
They're infinitely removed from nothingness,

288
0:11:56.756,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.

289
0:12:00.682,000 --> 0:12:02,000
They're a mixture of chaos and order,

290
0:12:03.202,000 --> 0:12:07,000
of mathematical elegance and ugliness.

291
0:12:07.4,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So I would describe these realities

292
0:12:09.185,000 --> 0:12:13,000
as an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,

293
0:12:13.312,000 --> 0:12:16,000
a generic reality, a kind of cosmic junk shot.

294
0:12:16.692,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And these realities,

295
0:12:18.876,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is there a deity in any of these realities?

296
0:12:21.142,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Maybe, but the deity isn't perfect

297
0:12:23.553,000 --> 0:12:25,000
like the Judeo-Christian deity.

298
0:12:25.889,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.

299
0:12:29.196,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It might be instead 100 percent malevolent

300
0:12:32.527,000 --> 0:12:34,000
but only 80 percent effective,

301
0:12:34.63,000 --> 0:12:4,000
which pretty much describes the world we see around us, I think. (Laughter)

302
0:12:40.767,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So I would like to propose that the resolution

303
0:12:43.499,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to the mystery of existence

304
0:12:45.335,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is that the reality we exist in

305
0:12:49.425,000 --> 0:12:51,000
is one of these generic realities.

306
0:12:51.481,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Reality has to turn out some way.

307
0:12:54.136,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It can either turn out to be nothing

308
0:12:56.206,000 --> 0:12:59,000
or everything or something in between.

309
0:12:59.887,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So if it has some special feature,

310
0:13:03.578,000 --> 0:13:05,000
like being really elegant or really full

311
0:13:05.768,000 --> 0:13:06,000
or really simple, like nothingness,

312
0:13:07.376,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that would require an explanation.

313
0:13:09.177,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But if it's just one of these random, generic realities,

314
0:13:12.336,000 --> 0:13:14,000
there's no further explanation for it.

315
0:13:14.486,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And indeed, I would say

316
0:13:15.87,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that's the reality we live in.

317
0:13:17.85,000 --> 0:13:19,000
That's what science is telling us.

318
0:13:20.107,000 --> 0:13:21,000
At the beginning of the week,

319
0:13:21.438,000 --> 0:13:24,000
we got the exciting information that

320
0:13:24.554,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the theory of inflation, which predicts a big,

321
0:13:27.693,000 --> 0:13:3,000
infinite, messy, arbitrary, pointless reality,

322
0:13:31.663,000 --> 0:13:34,000
it's like a big frothing champagne

323
0:13:35.488,000 --> 0:13:37,000
coming out of a bottle endlessly,

324
0:13:38.172,000 --> 0:13:4,000
a vast universe, mostly a wasteland

325
0:13:40.264,000 --> 0:13:44,000
with little pockets of charm and order and peace,

326
0:13:44.53,000 --> 0:13:46,000
this has been confirmed,

327
0:13:46.895,000 --> 0:13:48,000
this inflationary scenario, by the observations

328
0:13:49.797,000 --> 0:13:51,000
made by radio telescopes in Antarctica

329
0:13:51.89,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves

330
0:13:54.713,000 --> 0:13:55,000
from just before the Big Bang.

331
0:13:56.637,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I'm sure you all know about this.

332
0:13:58.482,000 --> 0:14:,000
So anyway, I think there's some evidence

333
0:14:01.306,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that this really is the reality that we're stuck with.

334
0:14:04.793,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Now, why should you care?

335
0:14:07.9,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Well — (Laughter) —

336
0:14:09.136,000 --> 0:14:12,000
the question, "Why does the world exist?"

337
0:14:12.56,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes

338
0:14:14.239,000 --> 0:14:15,000
with a more intimate question:

339
0:14:15.693,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Why do I exist? Why do you exist?

340
0:14:18.776,000 --> 0:14:21,000
you know, our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable,

341
0:14:22.376,000 --> 0:14:26,000
because there's an enormous number of genetically possible humans,

342
0:14:26.695,000 --> 0:14:27,000
if you can compute it by looking at

343
0:14:28.099,000 --> 0:14:3,000
the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth,

344
0:14:30.441,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you

345
0:14:32.737,000 --> 0:14:34,000
there are about 10 to the 10,000th

346
0:14:34.892,000 --> 0:14:35,000
possible humans, genetically.

347
0:14:36.552,000 --> 0:14:39,000
That's between a googol and a googolplex.

348
0:14:40.02,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And the number of the actual humans that have existed

349
0:14:41.636,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,

350
0:14:44.13,000 --> 0:14:46,000
an infinitesimal fraction, so all of us,

351
0:14:46.195,000 --> 0:14:47,000
we've won this amazing cosmic lottery.

352
0:14:48.125,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We're here. Okay.

353
0:14:50.244,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So what kind of reality do we want to live in?

354
0:14:53.165,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Do we want to live in a special reality?

355
0:14:55.415,000 --> 0:14:59,000
What if we were living in the most elegant possible reality?

356
0:14:59.644,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Imagine the existential pressure on us

357
0:15:02.153,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to live up to that, to be elegant,

358
0:15:03.992,000 --> 0:15:04,000
not to pull down the tone of it.

359
0:15:05.858,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Or, what if we were living in the fullest possible reality?

360
0:15:08.939,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Well then our existence would be guaranteed,

361
0:15:10.95,000 --> 0:15:11,000
because every possible thing

362
0:15:12.728,000 --> 0:15:13,000
exists in that reality,

363
0:15:14.094,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but our choices would be meaningless.

364
0:15:16.255,000 --> 0:15:18,000
If I really struggle morally and agonize

365
0:15:19.25,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and I decide to do the right thing,

366
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
what difference does it make,

367
0:15:22.525,000 --> 0:15:24,000
because there are an infinite number

368
0:15:24.55,000 --> 0:15:25,000
of versions of me

369
0:15:25.564,000 --> 0:15:26,000
also doing the right thing

370
0:15:26.961,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and an infinite number doing the wrong thing.

371
0:15:28.616,000 --> 0:15:29,000
So my choices are meaningless.

372
0:15:30.456,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So we don't want to live in that special reality.

373
0:15:32.74,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And as for the special reality of nothingness,

374
0:15:35.327,000 --> 0:15:37,000
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

375
0:15:37.554,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre,

376
0:15:44.489,000 --> 0:15:45,000
there are nasty bits and nice bits

377
0:15:46.385,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and we could make the nice bits bigger

378
0:15:47.927,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and the nasty bits smaller

379
0:15:50.266,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and that gives us a kind of purpose in life.

380
0:15:53.157,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The universe is absurd,

381
0:15:54.563,000 --> 0:15:55,000
but we can still construct a purpose,

382
0:15:56.29,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and that's a pretty good one,

383
0:15:57.23,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and the overall mediocrity of reality

384
0:15:59.895,000 --> 0:16:01,000
kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity

385
0:16:02.5,000 --> 0:16:04,000
we all feel in the core of our being.

386
0:16:04.812,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And I know you feel it.

387
0:16:06.446,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I know you're all special,

388
0:16:07.55,000 --> 0:16:09,000
but you're still kind of secretly mediocre,

389
0:16:09.872,000 --> 0:16:1,000
don't you think?

390
0:16:11.261,000 --> 0:16:12,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

391
0:16:13.198,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So anyway, you may say, this puzzle, the mystery of existence,

392
0:16:17.25,000 --> 0:16:18,000
it's just silly mystery-mongering.

393
0:16:18.668,000 --> 0:16:21,000
You're not astonished at the existence of the universe

394
0:16:22.535,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and you're in good company.

395
0:16:24.17,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Bertrand Russell said,

396
0:16:26.386,000 --> 0:16:29,000
"I should say the universe is just there, and that's all."

397
0:16:30.041,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Just a brute fact.

398
0:16:31.442,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And my professor at Columbia, Sidney Morgenbesser,

399
0:16:34.276,000 --> 0:16:35,000
a great philosophical wag,

400
0:16:35.985,000 --> 0:16:36,000
when I said to him, "Professor Morgenbesser,

401
0:16:37.602,000 --> 0:16:39,000
why is there something rather than nothing?"

402
0:16:40.098,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And he said, "Oh, even if there was nothing,

403
0:16:42.248,000 --> 0:16:43,000
you still wouldn't be satisfied."

404
0:16:44.244,000 --> 0:16:47,000
So — (Laughter) — okay.

405
0:16:47.993,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So you're not astonished. I don't care.

406
0:16:50.355,000 --> 0:16:52,000
But I will tell you something to conclude

407
0:16:53.328,000 --> 0:16:55,000
that I guarantee you will astonish you,

408
0:16:55.606,000 --> 0:16:57,000
because it's astonished all of the brilliant,

409
0:16:58.273,000 --> 0:17:,000
wonderful people I've met at this TED conference,

410
0:17:00.586,000 --> 0:17:02,000
when I've told them, and it's this:

411
0:17:02.8,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Never in my life have I had a cell phone.

412
0:17:07.302,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Thank you.

413
0:17:09.179,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

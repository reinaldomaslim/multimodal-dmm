1
0:00:13.111,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Imagine that you're a pig farmer.

2
0:00:16.232,000 --> 0:00:18,000
You live on a small farm in the Philippines.

3
0:00:19.101,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Your animals are your family's sole source of income --

4
0:00:22.784,000 --> 0:00:23,000
as long as they're healthy.

5
0:00:24.709,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You know that any day,

6
0:00:26.103,000 --> 0:00:28,000
one of your pigs can catch the flu,

7
0:00:28.347,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the swine flu.

8
0:00:29.718,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Living in tight quarters, one pig coughing and sneezing

9
0:00:33.013,000 --> 0:00:35,000
may soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing,

10
0:00:35.977,000 --> 0:00:38,000
until an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm.

11
0:00:39.841,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If it's a bad enough virus,

12
0:00:41.554,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the health of your herd may be gone in the blink of an eye.

13
0:00:45.256,000 --> 0:00:46,000
If you called in a veterinarian,

14
0:00:46.924,000 --> 0:00:48,000
he or she would visit your farm and take samples

15
0:00:49.431,000 --> 0:00:5,000
from your pigs' noses and mouths.

16
0:00:51.279,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But then they would have to drive back into the city

17
0:00:54.13,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to test those samples in their central lab.

18
0:00:57.556,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Two weeks later, you'd hear back the results.

19
0:01:00.601,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Two weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread

20
0:01:04.711,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and take away your way of life.

21
0:01:07.616,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But it doesn't have to be that way.

22
0:01:09.411,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Today, farmers can take those samples themselves.

23
0:01:12.692,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They can jump right into the pen and swab their pigs' noses and mouths

24
0:01:16.463,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with a little filter paper,

25
0:01:18.288,000 --> 0:01:21,000
place that little filter paper in a tiny tube,

26
0:01:21.525,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and mix it with some chemicals that will extract genetic material

27
0:01:25.43,000 --> 0:01:26,000
from their pigs' noses and mouths.

28
0:01:27.367,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And without leaving their farms,

29
0:01:29.316,000 --> 0:01:31,000
they take a drop of that genetic material

30
0:01:31.638,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and put it into a little analyzer smaller than a shoebox,

31
0:01:35.872,000 --> 0:01:39,000
program it to detect DNA or RNA from the swine flu virus,

32
0:01:40.497,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and within one hour get back the results, visualize the results.

33
0:01:45.247,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This reality is possible

34
0:01:47.227,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because today we're living in the era of personal DNA technology.

35
0:01:51.172,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Every one of us can actually test DNA ourselves.

36
0:01:55.448,000 --> 0:01:58,000
DNA is the fundamental molecule the carries genetic instructions

37
0:01:59.211,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that help build the living world.

38
0:02:02.052,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Humans have DNA.

39
0:02:03.814,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Pigs have DNA.

40
0:02:05.41,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Even bacteria and some viruses have DNA too.

41
0:02:08.928,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The genetic instructions encoded in DNA inform how our bodies develop,

42
0:02:13.176,000 --> 0:02:14,000
grow, function.

43
0:02:14.908,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And in many cases, that same information can trigger disease.

44
0:02:18.915,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Your genetic information

45
0:02:20.71,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is strung into a long and twisted molecule, the DNA double helix,

46
0:02:24.424,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that has over three billion letters,

47
0:02:26.896,000 --> 0:02:27,000
beginning to end.

48
0:02:28.484,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But the lines that carry meaningful information

49
0:02:31.728,000 --> 0:02:32,000
are usually very short --

50
0:02:33.317,000 --> 0:02:36,000
a few dozen to several thousand letters long.

51
0:02:36.363,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So when we're looking to answer a question based on DNA,

52
0:02:39.534,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we actually don't need to read

53
0:02:41.491,000 --> 0:02:43,000
all those three billion letters, typically.

54
0:02:43.984,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That would be like getting hungry at night

55
0:02:46.245,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and having to flip through the whole phone book

56
0:02:48.659,000 --> 0:02:49,000
from cover to cover,

57
0:02:49.938,000 --> 0:02:5,000
pausing at every line,

58
0:02:51.537,000 --> 0:02:52,000
just to find the nearest pizza joint.

59
0:02:53.546,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:54.722,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Luckily, three decades ago,

61
0:02:57.283,000 --> 0:02:58,000
humans started to invent tools

62
0:02:59.235,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that can find any specific line of genetic information.

63
0:03:02.766,000 --> 0:03:04,000
These DNA machines are wonderful.

64
0:03:04.979,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They can find any line in DNA.

65
0:03:07.732,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But once they find it,

66
0:03:09.06,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that DNA is still tiny, and surrounded by so much other DNA,

67
0:03:14.535,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that what these machines then do is copy the target gene,

68
0:03:19.201,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and one copy piles on top of another,

69
0:03:21.466,000 --> 0:03:23,000
millions and millions and millions of copies,

70
0:03:23.655,000 --> 0:03:25,000
until that gene stands out against the rest;

71
0:03:26.665,000 --> 0:03:28,000
until we can visualize it,

72
0:03:28.872,000 --> 0:03:3,000
interpret it, read it, understand it,

73
0:03:31.439,000 --> 0:03:32,000
until we can answer:

74
0:03:32.741,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Does my pig have the flu?

75
0:03:35.914,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Or other questions buried in our own DNA:

76
0:03:39.435,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Am I at risk of cancer?

77
0:03:42.505,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Am I of Irish descent?

78
0:03:44.623,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Is that child my son?

79
0:03:47.672,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:50.537,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This ability to make copies of DNA, as simple as it sounds,

81
0:03:55.235,000 --> 0:03:56,000
has transformed our world.

82
0:03:56.55,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Scientists use it every day to detect and address disease,

83
0:04:01.586,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to create innovative medicines,

84
0:04:04.098,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to modify foods,

85
0:04:06.158,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to assess whether our food is safe to eat

86
0:04:08.158,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or whether it's contaminated with deadly bacteria.

87
0:04:11.578,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Even judges use the output of these machines in court

88
0:04:14.446,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty based on DNA evidence.

89
0:04:19.044,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The inventor of this DNA-copying technique

90
0:04:21.481,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.

91
0:04:25.831,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But for 30 years,

92
0:04:27.007,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the power of genetic analysis has been confined to the ivory tower,

93
0:04:30.864,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or bigwig PhD scientist work.

94
0:04:34.333,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Well, several companies around the world

95
0:04:36.459,000 --> 0:04:39,000
are working on making this same technology accessible

96
0:04:40.331,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to everyday people like the pig farmer,

97
0:04:43.386,000 --> 0:04:44,000
like you.

98
0:04:44.759,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I cofounded one of these companies.

99
0:04:47.367,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Three years ago,

100
0:04:48.542,000 --> 0:04:5,000
together with a fellow biologist and friend of mine,

101
0:04:51.553,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Zeke Alvarez Saavedra,

102
0:04:53.157,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we decided to make personal DNA machines

103
0:04:55.796,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that anyone could use.

104
0:04:57.957,000 --> 0:05:,000
Our goal was to bring DNA science to more people in new places.

105
0:05:01.892,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We started working in our basements.

106
0:05:04.077,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We had a simple question:

107
0:05:06.154,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What could the world look like

108
0:05:07.929,000 --> 0:05:09,000
if everyone could analyze DNA?

109
0:05:10.38,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We were curious,

110
0:05:12.142,000 --> 0:05:16,000
as curious as you would have been if I had shown you this picture in 1980.

111
0:05:17.092,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:18.401,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You would have thought, "Wow!

113
0:05:20.216,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I can now call my Aunt Glenda from the car

114
0:05:22.843,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and wish her a happy birthday.

115
0:05:24.753,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I can call anyone, anytime.

116
0:05:27.055,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is the future!"

117
0:05:29.801,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Little did you know,

118
0:05:31.281,000 --> 0:05:33,000
you would tap on that phone to make dinner reservations

119
0:05:33.91,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for you and Aunt Glenda to celebrate together.

120
0:05:36.358,000 --> 0:05:38,000
With another tap, you'd be ordering her gift.

121
0:05:38.912,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And yet one more tap,

122
0:05:40.418,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and you'd be "liking" Auntie Glenda on Facebook.

123
0:05:42.754,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And all of this, while sitting on the toilet.

124
0:05:45.122,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:47.32,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It is notoriously hard to predict where new technology might take us.

126
0:05:52.607,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And the same is true for personal DNA technology today.

127
0:05:57.04,000 --> 0:06:,000
For example, I could never have imagined

128
0:06:00.133,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that a truffle farmer, of all people,

129
0:06:02.678,000 --> 0:06:04,000
would use personal DNA machines.

130
0:06:05.267,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Dr. Paul Thomas grows truffles for a living.

131
0:06:08.582,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We see him pictured here,

132
0:06:10.313,000 --> 0:06:15,000
holding the first UK-cultivated truffle in his hands, on one of his farms.

133
0:06:16.179,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Truffles are this delicacy

134
0:06:17.699,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees.

135
0:06:21.786,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And it's a rare fungus.

136
0:06:23.437,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Some species may fetch 3,000, 7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.

137
0:06:29.968,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I learned from Paul

138
0:06:31.385,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that the stakes for a truffle farmer can be really high.

139
0:06:34.296,000 --> 0:06:37,000
When he sources new truffles to grow on his farms,

140
0:06:37.534,000 --> 0:06:39,000
he's exposed to the threat of knockoffs --

141
0:06:40.086,000 --> 0:06:43,000
truffles that look and feel like the real thing,

142
0:06:43.566,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but they're of lower quality.

143
0:06:45.092,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But even to a trained eye like Paul's,

144
0:06:47.545,000 --> 0:06:49,000
even when looked at under a microscope,

145
0:06:49.651,000 --> 0:06:51,000
these truffles can pass for authentic.

146
0:06:51.826,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So in order to grow the highest quality truffles,

147
0:06:55.776,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the ones that chefs all over the world will fight over,

148
0:06:59.039,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Paul has to use DNA analysis.

149
0:07:02.594,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Isn't that mind-blowing?

150
0:07:04.364,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I bet you will never look at that black truffle risotto again

151
0:07:07.688,000 --> 0:07:08,000
without thinking of its genes.

152
0:07:09.382,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:11.71,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But personal DNA machines can also save human lives.

154
0:07:17.045,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Professor Ian Goodfellow is a virologist at the University of Cambridge.

155
0:07:21.589,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone.

156
0:07:24.267,000 --> 0:07:27,000
When the Ebola outbreak broke out in Western Africa,

157
0:07:28.213,000 --> 0:07:31,000
he quickly realized that doctors there lacked the basic tools

158
0:07:32.049,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to detect and combat disease.

159
0:07:34.216,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Results could take up to a week to come back --

160
0:07:37.274,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that's way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering.

161
0:07:42.157,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Ian decided to move his lab into Makeni, Sierra Leone.

162
0:07:47.194,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Here we see Ian Goodfellow

163
0:07:49.343,000 --> 0:07:53,000
moving over 10 tons of equipment into a pop-up tent

164
0:07:53.435,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that he would equip to detect and diagnose the virus

165
0:07:57.135,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and sequence it within 24 hours.

166
0:08:00.25,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But here's a surprise:

167
0:08:02.053,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the same equipment that Ian could use at his lab in the UK

168
0:08:06.199,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to sequence and diagnose Ebola,

169
0:08:08.814,000 --> 0:08:1,000
just wouldn't work under these conditions.

170
0:08:10.971,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We're talking 35 Celsius heat and over 90 percent humidity here.

171
0:08:16.153,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But instead, Ian could use personal DNA machines

172
0:08:19.061,000 --> 0:08:22,000
small enough to be placed in front of the air-conditioning unit

173
0:08:22.435,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to keep sequencing the virus

174
0:08:24.39,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and keep saving lives.

175
0:08:25.989,000 --> 0:08:28,000
This may seem like an extreme place for DNA analysis,

176
0:08:29.05,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but let's move on to an even more extreme environment:

177
0:08:32.85,000 --> 0:08:33,000
outer space.

178
0:08:34.633,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.

179
0:08:37.657,000 --> 0:08:4,000
When astronauts live aboard the International Space Station,

180
0:08:40.801,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they're orbiting the planet 250 miles high.

181
0:08:44.448,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They're traveling at 17,000 miles per hour.

182
0:08:47.274,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Picture that --

183
0:08:48.456,000 --> 0:08:51,000
you're seeing 15 sunsets and sunrises every day.

184
0:08:52.817,000 --> 0:08:53,000
You're also living in microgravity,

185
0:08:54.713,000 --> 0:08:55,000
floating.

186
0:08:55.905,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And under these conditions, our bodies can do funky things.

187
0:08:59.091,000 --> 0:09:03,000
One of these things is that our immune systems get suppressed,

188
0:09:03.857,000 --> 0:09:05,000
making astronauts more prone to infection.

189
0:09:07.856,000 --> 0:09:08,000
A 16-year-old girl,

190
0:09:09.793,000 --> 0:09:12,000
a high school student from New York, Anna-Sophia Boguraev,

191
0:09:13.648,000 --> 0:09:15,000
wondered whether changes to the DNA of astronauts

192
0:09:16.541,000 --> 0:09:18,000
could be related to this immune suppression,

193
0:09:18.988,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and through a science competition called "Genes In Space,"

194
0:09:22.381,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Anna-Sophia designed an experiment to test this hypothesis

195
0:09:26.312,000 --> 0:09:3,000
using a personal DNA machine aboard the International Space Station.

196
0:09:31.463,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Here we see Anna-Sophia on April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,

197
0:09:37.186,000 --> 0:09:41,000
watching her experiment launch to the International Space Station.

198
0:09:41.273,000 --> 0:09:43,000
That cloud of smoke is the rocket

199
0:09:43.828,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that brought Anna-Sophia's experiment to the International Space Station,

200
0:09:48.547,000 --> 0:09:49,000
where, three days later,

201
0:09:50.5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
astronaut Tim Peake carried out her experiment --

202
0:09:54.272,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in microgravity.

203
0:09:56.175,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Personal DNA machines are now aboard the International Space Station,

204
0:09:59.955,000 --> 0:10:01,000
where they can help monitor living conditions

205
0:10:02.566,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and protect the lives of astronauts.

206
0:10:05.938,000 --> 0:10:08,000
A 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment

207
0:10:09.803,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to protect the lives of astronauts

208
0:10:11.74,000 --> 0:10:14,000
may seem like a rarity, the mark of a child genius.

209
0:10:15.784,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Well, to me, it signals something bigger:

210
0:10:18.378,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that DNA technology is finally within the reach of every one of you.

211
0:10:24.999,000 --> 0:10:25,000
A few years ago,

212
0:10:26.73,000 --> 0:10:29,000
a college student armed with a personal computer

213
0:10:29.937,000 --> 0:10:3,000
could code an app,

214
0:10:31.112,000 --> 0:10:35,000
an app that is now a social network with more than one billion users.

215
0:10:35.933,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Could we be moving into a world

216
0:10:37.917,000 --> 0:10:4,000
of one personal DNA machine in every home?

217
0:10:41.966,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I know families who are already living in this reality.

218
0:10:45.767,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The Daniels family, for example,

219
0:10:47.689,000 --> 0:10:51,000
set up a DNA lab in the basement of their suburban Chicago home.

220
0:10:52.904,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This is not a family made of PhD scientists.

221
0:10:56.656,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is a family like any other.

222
0:10:58.79,000 --> 0:11:02,000
They just like to spend time together doing fun, creative things.

223
0:11:02.869,000 --> 0:11:05,000
By day, Brian is an executive at a private equity firm.

224
0:11:07.137,000 --> 0:11:09,000
At night and on weekends, he experiments with DNA

225
0:11:10.066,000 --> 0:11:12,000
alongside his kids, ages seven and nine,

226
0:11:12.987,000 --> 0:11:14,000
as a way to explore the living world.

227
0:11:15.48,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Last time I called them,

228
0:11:17.178,000 --> 0:11:2,000
they were checking out homegrown produce from the backyard garden.

229
0:11:21.09,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They were testing tomatoes that they had picked,

230
0:11:23.411,000 --> 0:11:25,000
taking the flesh of their skin, putting it in a test tube,

231
0:11:26.215,000 --> 0:11:28,000
mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA

232
0:11:28.321,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and then using their home DNA copier

233
0:11:31.823,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits.

234
0:11:36.883,000 --> 0:11:37,000
For the Daniels family,

235
0:11:38.434,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the personal DNA machine is like the chemistry set

236
0:11:41.357,000 --> 0:11:42,000
for the 21st century.

237
0:11:43.375,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Most of us may not yet be diagnosing genetic conditions

238
0:11:47.261,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in our kitchen sinks

239
0:11:49.123,000 --> 0:11:51,000
or doing at-home paternity testing.

240
0:11:51.365,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

241
0:11:52.414,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But we've definitely reached a point in history

242
0:11:54.658,000 --> 0:11:59,000
where every one of you could actually get hands-on with DNA

243
0:12:00.491,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in your kitchen.

244
0:12:01.946,000 --> 0:12:04,000
You could copy, paste and analyze DNA

245
0:12:05.157,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and extract meaningful information from it.

246
0:12:08.394,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And it's at times like this that profound transformation

247
0:12:11.275,000 --> 0:12:12,000
is bound to happen;

248
0:12:12.898,000 --> 0:12:15,000
moments when a transformative, powerful technology

249
0:12:16.174,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that was before limited to a select few in the ivory tower,

250
0:12:19.82,000 --> 0:12:22,000
finally becomes within the reach of every one of us,

251
0:12:23.951,000 --> 0:12:25,000
from farmers to schoolchildren.

252
0:12:26.772,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Think about the moment

253
0:12:27.963,000 --> 0:12:3,000
when phones stopped being plugged into the wall by cords,

254
0:12:31.864,000 --> 0:12:33,000
or when computers left the mainframe

255
0:12:34.183,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and entered your home or your office.

256
0:12:37.574,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The ripples of the personal DNA revolution

257
0:12:40.421,000 --> 0:12:41,000
may be hard to predict,

258
0:12:41.972,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but one thing is certain:

259
0:12:43.613,000 --> 0:12:45,000
revolutions don't go backwards,

260
0:12:46.029,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and DNA technology is already spreading faster than our imagination.

261
0:12:50.318,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So if you're curious,

262
0:12:52.241,000 --> 0:12:55,000
get up close and personal with DNA -- today.

263
0:12:55.48,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It is in our DNA to be curious.

264
0:12:58.095,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Laughter)

265
0:12:59.134,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you.

266
0:13:00.318,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.895,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird.

2
0:00:20.166,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Birds are very agile.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
They fly, not with rotating components,

4
0:00:25.618,000 --> 0:00:28,000
so they fly only by flapping their wings.

5
0:00:29.023,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So we looked at the birds,

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and we tried to make a model that is powerful, ultralight,

7
0:00:37.627,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities

8
0:00:41.665,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings.

9
0:00:46.4,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So what would be better than to use the herring gull, in its freedom,

10
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
circling and swooping over the sea,

11
0:00:53.598,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and to use this as a role model?

12
0:00:56.937,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So we bring a team together.

13
0:00:58.921,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics,

14
0:01:04.025,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in the field of building gliders.

15
0:01:06.589,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model

16
0:01:11.986,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that is able to fly over your heads.

17
0:01:15.187,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So be careful later on.

18
0:01:17.745,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:20.077,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And this was one issue:

20
0:01:21.545,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to build it that lightweight

21
0:01:23.261,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that no one would be hurt if it fell down.

22
0:01:28.648,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So why do we do all this?

23
0:01:30.624,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We are a company in the field of automation,

24
0:01:33.571,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and we'd like to do very lightweight structures

25
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because that's energy efficient,

26
0:01:39.023,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena.

27
0:01:45.111,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So I now would like you to put your seat belts on

28
0:01:49.562,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and put your hats on.

29
0:01:51.799,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So maybe we'll try it once --

30
0:01:54.899,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to fly a SmartBird.

31
0:01:56.403,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Thank you.

32
0:01:57.455,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Applause)

33
0:02:13.888,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Cheers)

34
0:02:15.158,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Applause)

35
0:02:29.328,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Applause ends)

36
0:02:51.268,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Applause)

37
0:03:07.705,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So we can now look at the SmartBird.

38
0:03:13.084,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So here is one without a skin.

39
0:03:15.59,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We have a wingspan of about two meters.

40
0:03:18.825,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The length is one meter and six,

41
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and the weight is only 450 grams.

42
0:03:26.053,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And it is all out of carbon fiber.

43
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In the middle we have a motor,

44
0:03:31.743,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and we also have a gear in it,

45
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor.

46
0:03:40.899,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So within the motor, we have three Hall sensors,

47
0:03:44.109,000 --> 0:03:47,000
so we know exactly where the wing is.

48
0:03:49.71,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And if we now beat up and down --

49
0:03:52.735,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Mechanical sounds)

50
0:03:56.696,000 --> 0:04:,000
We have the possibility to fly like a bird.

51
0:04:00.783,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion,

52
0:04:04.425,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and if you go up,

53
0:04:07.536,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the wings are not that large,

54
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and it is easier to get up.

55
0:04:15.129,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So, the next thing we did,

56
0:04:18.2,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or the challenges we did,

57
0:04:19.997,000 --> 0:04:22,000
was to coordinate this movement.

58
0:04:23.037,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We have to turn it, go up and go down.

59
0:04:26.25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We have a split wing.

60
0:04:27.81,000 --> 0:04:28,000
With the split wing,

61
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we get the lift at the upper wing,

62
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and we get the propulsion at the lower wing.

63
0:04:35.498,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Also, we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency.

64
0:04:40.74,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency

65
0:04:44.994,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency.

66
0:04:48.976,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion,

67
0:04:54.32,000 --> 0:04:56,000
from 30 percent up to 80 percent.

68
0:04:57.581,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Next thing we have to do,

69
0:04:59.464,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we have to control and regulate the whole structure.

70
0:05:03.589,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Only if you control and regulate it,

71
0:05:06.184,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.

72
0:05:09.501,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So the overall consumption of energy

73
0:05:12.612,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is about 25 watts at takeoff

74
0:05:15.84,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and 16 to 18 watts in flight.

75
0:05:19.396,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Thank you.

76
0:05:20.429,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Applause)

77
0:05:27.034,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Bruno Giussani: Markus, we should fly it once more.

78
0:05:29.606,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.

79
0:05:31.035,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Audience) Yeah!

80
0:05:32.127,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

81
0:05:53.383,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Gasps)

82
0:06:02.069,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Cheers)

83
0:06:03.887,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Applause)

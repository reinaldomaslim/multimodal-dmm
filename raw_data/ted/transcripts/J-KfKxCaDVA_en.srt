1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
towards a renaissance in Africa.

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The question of transformation in Africa

4
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
really is a question of leadership.

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And it is my contention that the manner in which

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we educate our leaders is fundamental

8
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to progress on this continent.

9
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I want to tell you some stories that explain my view.

10
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.

11
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:07,000
An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,

12
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion

13
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
about the state of leadership in Africa

14
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that had taken me over a decade to reach.

15
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Twice she was involved in surgeries

16
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where they lost power at the hospital.

17
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The emergency generators did not start.

18
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:32,000
There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle --

19
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:33,000
pitch black.

20
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The patient's cut open, twice.

21
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The first time it was a C-section.

22
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived.

23
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.

24
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.

25
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:,000
He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.

26
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Pitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.

27
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And that hospital could have afforded flashlights.

28
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.

29
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And it happened twice.

30
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die

31
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because they refused to give her oxygen that they had.

32
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And so three months later,

33
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
just before she returned to the United States,

34
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
nurses in Accra go on strike.

35
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And her recommendation is

36
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.

37
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Start all over again.

38
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now what does this have to do with leadership?

39
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You see, the folks at the ministry of health,

40
0:02:54,000 --> 0:03:,000
the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses --

41
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:04,000
they are among just five percent of their peers

42
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
who get an education after secondary school.

43
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They are the elite. They are our leaders.

44
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Their decisions, their actions matter.

45
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And when they fail, a nation literally suffers.

46
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So when I speak of leadership,

47
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I'm not talking about just political leaders.

48
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We've heard a lot about that.

49
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I'm talking about the elite.

50
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Those who've been trained,

51
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:39,000
whose job it is to be the guardians of their society.

52
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors,

53
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the engineers, the civil servants --

54
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
those are the leaders.

55
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And we need to train them right.

56
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana

57
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
occurred when I was 16 years old.

58
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We had just had a military coup,

59
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and soldiers were pervasive in our society.

60
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They were a pervasive presence.

61
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And one day I go to the airport to meet my father,

62
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park

63
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to the terminal building,

64
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.

65
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And they asked me to join a crowd of people

66
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that were running up and down this embankment.

67
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Why? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.

68
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
No sign to this effect.

69
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, I was 16. I was very worried about

70
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
what my peers at school might think

71
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
if they saw me running up and down this hill.

72
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I was especially concerned of what the girls might think.

73
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And so I started to argue with these men.

74
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.

75
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I got lucky.

76
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.

77
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Because of his uniform they speak to him differently,

78
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and they explain to him that they're just following orders.

79
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So he takes their radio, talks to their boss,

80
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and gets us all released.

81
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
What lessons would you take from an experience like this?

82
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Several, for me.

83
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Leadership matters. Those men are following

84
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the orders of a superior officer.

85
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I learned something about courage.

86
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It was important not to look at those guns.

87
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.

88
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship

90
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to go to Swarthmore College for my education.

91
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It was a breath of fresh air.

92
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information

93
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.

94
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They wanted us to think critically.

95
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
They wanted us to be analytical.

96
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues.

97
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In my economics classes I got high marks

98
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
for my understanding of basic economics.

99
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But I learned something more profound than that,

100
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy --

101
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
were making breathtakingly bad decisions

102
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.

103
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.

104
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It matters a great deal.

105
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.

106
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I had an inkling,

107
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace

108
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.

109
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And I was part of this team -- this thinking, learning team

110
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:58,000
whose job it was to design and implement new software

111
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that created value in the world.

112
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And it was brilliant to be part of this team.

113
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It was brilliant.

114
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,

115
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
this transformation --

116
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the ability to confront problems, complex problems,

117
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and to design solutions to those problems.

118
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The ability to create is the most empowering thing

119
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that can happen to an individual.

120
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And I was part of that.

121
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company

122
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:39,000
grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.

123
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And by the way, it's continued to.

124
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The gap has widened since I left.

125
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.

126
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,

127
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:59,000
persistent, creative, empowered.

128
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But there were also some external factors:

129
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:07,000
free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.

130
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:11,000
These things were provided by institutions

131
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:15,000
run by the people that I call leaders.

132
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.

133
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do.

134
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.

135
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I became a parent.

136
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.

137
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Because I realized that the state of the African continent

138
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
would matter to my children and their children.

139
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:46,000
That the state of the world -- the state of the world

140
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:51,000
depends on what's happening to Africa,

141
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
as far as my kids would be concerned.

142
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And at this time, when I was going through

143
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:01,000
what I call my "pre-mid-life crisis,"

144
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Africa was a mess.

145
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.

146
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.

147
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,

148
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and I needed to be back helping.

149
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids

150
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.

151
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.

152
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did

153
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people

154
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and really try to understand what the real issues were.

155
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And three things kept coming up for every problem:

156
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
corruption, weak institutions

157
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and the people who run them -- the leaders.

158
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Now, I was a little scared

159
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because when you see those three problems,

160
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
they seem really hard to deal with.

161
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And they might say, "Look, don't even try."

162
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But, for me, I asked the question,

163
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"Well, where are these leaders coming from?

164
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
What is it about Ghana that produces leaders

165
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that are unethical or unable to solve problems?"

166
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.

167
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And it was the same -- learning by rote --

168
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:25,000
from primary school through graduate school.

169
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Very little emphasis on ethics,

170
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and the typical graduate

171
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense

172
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:42,000
of entitlement than a sense of responsibility.

173
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This is wrong.

174
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So I decided to engage this particular problem.

175
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Because it seems to me that every society, every society,

176
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:59,000
must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.

177
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And Ghana was not paying enough attention.

178
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.

179
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So this is what I'm doing now.

180
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.

181
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.

182
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I think it would make a huge difference.

183
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And what Ashesi University is trying to do

184
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.

185
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,

186
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:44,000
who have the ability to confront the complex problems,

187
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:49,000
ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.

188
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I'll admit that there are times when it seems like "Mission: Impossible,"

189
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
but we must believe that these kids are smart.

190
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
That if we involve them in their education,

191
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:07,000
if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront --

192
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that our whole society confronts --

193
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,

194
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that magic will happen.

195
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.

196
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And a month into it, I come to the office,

197
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and I have this email from one of our students.

198
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And it said, very simply, "I am thinking now."

199
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And he signs off, "Thank you."

200
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It's such a simple statement.

201
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But I was moved almost to tears

202
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:55,000
because I understood what was happening to this young man.

203
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And it is an awesome thing to be a part

204
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of empowering someone in this way.

205
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I am thinking now.

206
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This year we challenged our students

207
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to craft an honor code themselves.

208
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now

209
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
over whether they should have an honor code,

210
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and if so, what it should look like.

211
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:28,000
One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.

212
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Can we create a perfect society?

213
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code

214
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:46,000
constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.

215
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Now, we cannot achieve perfection,

216
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.

217
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I don't know ultimately what they will do.

218
0:13:56,000 --> 0:14:,000
I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.

219
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But the conversation they're having now --

220
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:06,000
about what their good society should look like,

221
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
what their excellent society should look like,

222
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:15,000
is a really good thing.

223
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Am I out of time? OK.

224
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up

225
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:3,000
because it's important that we think about it.

226
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I'm very excited about the fact

227
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.

228
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:44,000
That for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.

229
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:52,000
These young future leaders are beginning to understand

230
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:54,000
the real business of leadership,

231
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
the real privilege of leadership,

232
0:14:56,000 --> 0:15:01,000
which is after all to serve humanity.

233
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year

234
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
our student body elected a woman

235
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to be the head of Student Government.

236
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
It's the first time in the history of Ghana

237
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that a woman has been elected head of Student Government

238
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:22,000
at any university.

239
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It says a lot about her.

240
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.

241
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It says a lot about her peers who elected her.

242
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:38,000
She won with 75 percent of the vote.

243
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And it gives me a lot of hope.

244
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It turns out that corporate West Africa

245
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:48,000
also appreciates what's happening with our students.

246
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We've graduated two classes of students to date.

247
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And every single one of them has been placed.

248
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And we're getting great reports back

249
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:01,000
from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,

250
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.

251
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:1,000
You know, that passion for what they're doing.

252
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:14,000
The persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,

253
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:2,000
their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.

254
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:24,000
This is good because

255
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:27,000
over the past five years, there have been times

256
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
when I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible."

257
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers

258
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.

259
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I think that the current and future leaders of Africa

260
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:47,000
have an incredible opportunity

261
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
to drive a major renaissance on the continent.

262
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:52,000
It's an incredible opportunity.

263
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:56,000
There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.

264
0:16:56,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point

265
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:08,000
with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.

266
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:11,000
We have reached a moment from which can emerge

267
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:15,000
a great society within one generation.

268
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:2,000
It will depend on inspired leadership.

269
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders

270
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
will make all the difference.

271
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Thank you, and God bless.

272
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Applause)

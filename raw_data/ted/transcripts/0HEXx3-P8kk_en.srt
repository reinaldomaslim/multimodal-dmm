0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I would like to share with you this morning

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
some stories about the ocean

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
through my work as a still photographer

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
for National Geographic magazine.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I guess I became an underwater photographer

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and a photojournalist

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because I fell in love with the sea as a child.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I wanted to tell stories

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And after even 30 years of doing this,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
after 30 years of exploring the ocean,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I never cease to be amazed

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But more and more frequently these days

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
things that I don't think most people realize.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to tell a more complete story.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I want people to see what's happening underwater,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
both the horror and the magic.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The first story that I did for National Geographic,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
where I recognized the ability to include

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
environmental issues within a natural history coverage,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
was a story I proposed on harp seals.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The story I wanted to do initially

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And all of this is played out against

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the backdrop of transient pack ice

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that moves with wind and tide.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And because I'm an underwater photographer,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I wanted to do this story from both above and below,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But as I got more involved in the story,

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The first was that these animals continue to be hunted,

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
killed with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It actually is the largest marine mammal

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
slaughter on the planet,

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But as disturbing as that is,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I think the bigger problem for harp seals

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is the loss of sea ice due to global warming.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
there's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And the ice that is there is quite thin.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in order to nurse from their moms.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But if they don't get 12 days,

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
they can fall into the ocean and die.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is a photo that I made showing

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old --

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly --

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that has fallen in because of the thin ice,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and to get it back to stable purchase.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I read that last year the pup mortality rate

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So, clearly, this species has a lot of problems going forward.

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic.

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And it received quite a bit of attention.

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And with that, I saw the potential to begin

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
doing other stories about ocean problems.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis,

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in part because I had personally witnessed

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but also because I read a scientific paper

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
These are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks.

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When I read that, I was blown away by those numbers.

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet,

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but it really wasn't, so I wanted to do a story

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that was a very different kind of underwater story.

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I wanted it to be more like war photography,

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where I was making harder-hitting pictures

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that showed readers what was happening

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to marine wildlife around the planet.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The first component of the story that I thought was essential, however,

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
was to give readers a sense of appreciation

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
for the ocean animals that they were eating.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You know, I think people go into a restaurant,

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from,

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is,

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but when they're eating bluefin sushi,

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming?

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
These are the lions and tigers of the sea.

96
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart;

97
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
they're unique in the world.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
These are animals that can practically swim

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
from the equator to the poles

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year.

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life,

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them,

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and their stocks have collapsed worldwide.

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that I photographed a couple years ago.

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And every single day these tuna, bluefin like this,

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
are stacked up like cordwood,

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
just warehouse after warehouse.

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
As I wandered around and made these pictures,

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We can't keep taking without expecting

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
serious consequences as a result.

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I also, with the story, wanted to show readers

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
how fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish,

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
like a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world.

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp,

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You have a large net in the middle

120
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
with two steel doors on either end.

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And as this assembly is towed through the water,

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the doors meet resistance with the ocean,

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and it opens the mouth of the net,

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well.

127
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom,

128
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
things like sponges and corals,

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that critical habitat for other animals.

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This photograph I made of the fisherman

131
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.

132
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So he had a handful of shrimp, maybe seven or eight shrimp,

133
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch.

134
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
These are animals that died in the process,

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but have no commercial value.

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
maybe seven or eight shrimp

138
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and made this picture of the guy shoveling

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
this bycatch into the sea as trash

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and photographed this cascade of death,

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays,

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
flounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before,

145
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
were on the bottom of the ocean, alive,

146
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but now being thrown back as trash.

147
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because, currently on planet Earth,

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we're killing over 100 million sharks

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
every single year.

151
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But before I went out to photograph this component,

152
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that will resonate with readers

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think

155
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the only good shark is a dead shark.

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that had just recently died in the gill net.

158
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible,

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.

160
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
This ended up being the lead picture

161
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in the global fishery story in National Geographic.

162
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice

163
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
of this problem of 100 million sharks.

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And because I love sharks -- I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks --

165
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks,

166
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation.

167
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So I went to the Bahamas

168
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
because there're very few places in the world

169
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
where sharks are doing well these days,

170
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy,

171
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
largely due to the fact that the government there

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
had outlawed longlining several years ago.

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And I wanted to show several species

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach,

176
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks

177
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
aggregate in shallow water.

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is a low-altitude photograph that I made

179
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks

180
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
sort of just swimming around behind.

181
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage

182
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.

183
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.

184
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And with this photograph of a beautiful

185
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess,

186
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
female tiger shark,

187
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I sort of think I got to that goal,

188
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose,

189
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and my strobe created a shadow on her face.

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening,

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a little more respectful of the species.

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
I also searched on this story

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
for the elusive great hammerhead,

194
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
an animal that really hadn't been photographed much

195
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
until maybe about seven or 10 years ago.

196
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's a very solitary creature.

197
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science

198
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in both Florida and in the Bahamas.

199
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
You know, we know almost nothing about them.

200
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We don't know where they migrate to or from,

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
where they mate, where they have their pups,

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and yet, hammerhead populations in the Atlantic

203
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
You know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them.

205
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is the oceanic whitetip shark,

206
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species,

207
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
if you pay attention to such lists.

208
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline

209
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
throughout most of its range.

210
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water,

211
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and because we weren't working on the bottom,

212
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I brought along a shark cage here,

213
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.

214
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here,

215
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess.

216
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And lastly with this story,

217
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
I also wanted to focus on baby sharks, shark nurseries.

218
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas,

219
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to work with lemon shark pups.

220
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup,

221
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in these protective mangroves.

223
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.

224
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture.

225
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
swimming in about a foot of water.

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two, three years of their lives,

228
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef.

229
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
After I left Bimini, I actually learned

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that this habitat was being bulldozed

231
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to create a new golf course and resort.

232
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And other recent stories have looked at

233
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
single, flagship species, if you will,

234
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that are at risk in the ocean

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
as a way of talking about other threats.

236
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle.

237
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is the largest, widest-ranging,

238
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.

239
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Here we see a female crawling

240
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
out of the ocean under moonlight

241
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
on the island of Trinidad.

242
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years.

243
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And there was a time in their lifespan

244
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
where they were coming out of the water to nest

245
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by.

246
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And today, they crawl out and see condominiums.

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But despite this amazing longevity,

248
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
they're now considered critically endangered.

249
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
In the Pacific, where I made this photograph,

250
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
their stocks have declined about 90 percent

251
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in the last 15 years.

252
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
This is a photograph that shows a hatchling

253
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
about to taste saltwater for the very first time

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
beginning this long and perilous journey.

255
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Only one in a thousand

256
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.

257
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But that's due to natural predators

258
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
like vultures that pick them off on a beach

259
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
or predatory fish that are waiting offshore.

260
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Nature has learned to compensate with that,

261
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and females have multiple clutches of eggs

262
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to overcome those odds.

263
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses,

264
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
human things, like this picture that shows

265
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
a leatherback caught at night in a gill net.

266
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I actually jumped in and photographed this,

267
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and with the fisherman's permission,

268
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
I cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.

269
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year

270
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
are not so fortunate,

271
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and the species' future is in great danger.

272
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with

273
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is the story I did on the right whale.

274
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And essentially, the story is this with right whales,

275
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that about a million years ago, there was

276
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
one species of right whale on the planet,

277
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated,

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
the species sort of separated,

279
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and today we have essentially two distinct stocks.

280
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We have the Southern right whale that we see here

281
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here

282
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.

283
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Now, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction

284
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
by the early whalers,

285
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better

286
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
because they're located in places

287
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
farther away from human activity.

288
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The North Atlantic right whale is listed as

289
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the most endangered species on the planet today

290
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
because they are urban whales; they live along the east coast

291
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
of North America, United States and Canada,

292
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and they have to deal with all these urban ills.

293
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida.

294
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
You can see the coal burning plant in the background.

295
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals

296
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that are flushed out into the ocean,

297
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and maybe even affecting their reproduction.

298
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They also get entangled in fishing gear.

299
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.

300
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And those white markings are not natural markings.

301
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
These are entanglement scars.

302
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
72 percent of the population has such scars,

303
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but most don't shed the gear, things like lobster traps and crab pots.

304
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.

305
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And the other problem is they get hit by ships.

306
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship

307
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in Nova Scotia, Canada

308
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
being towed in, where they did a necropsy

309
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to confirm the cause of death,

310
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
which was indeed a ship strike.

311
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals

312
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and keeping their numbers very low.

313
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population,

314
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales

315
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that had only been discovered about 10 years ago

316
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand, a place called the Auckland Islands.

317
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I went down there in the winter time.

318
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And these are animals that had never seen humans before,

319
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen.

320
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And I got in the water with them,

321
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and I was amazed at how curious they were.

322
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet

323
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and one of these amazingly beautiful, 45-foot,

324
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
70-ton whales,

325
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
like a city bus just swimming up, you know.

326
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
They were in perfect condition,

327
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
very fat and healthy, robust, no entanglement scars,

328
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the way they're supposed to look.

329
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock

330
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
in Massachusetts in 1620,

331
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay

332
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
on the backs of right whales.

333
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And we can't go back and see that today,

334
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but maybe we can preserve what we have left.

335
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope,

336
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
a story I did on marine reserves

337
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
as sort of a solution

338
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to the problem of overfishing, the global fish crisis story.

339
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand

340
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
because New Zealand was rather progressive,

341
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.

342
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And I really wanted this story to be about three things:

343
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I wanted it to be about abundance,

344
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
about diversity and about resilience.

345
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And one of the first places I worked

346
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
was a reserve called Goat Island

347
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
in Leigh of New Zealand.

348
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
What the scientists there told me was that

349
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
when protected this first marine reserve in 1975,

350
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
they hoped and expected that certain things might happen.

351
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
For example, they hoped that certain species of fish

352
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
like the New Zealand snapper would return

353
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.

354
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.

355
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
For example, these fish

356
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
predate on sea urchins,

357
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and when the fish were all gone,

358
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
all anyone ever saw underwater

359
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
was just acres and acres of sea urchins.

360
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
But when the fish came back

361
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and began predating and controlling the urchin population,

362
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
low and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.

363
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And that's because the urchins eat kelp.

364
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So when the fish control the urchin population,

365
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.

366
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
You know, this is probably how the ocean looked here

367
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
one or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us.

368
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well,

369
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in beautiful, fragile, protected areas

370
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found.

371
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.

372
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
In the northern part of New Zealand,

373
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer,

374
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and photographed animals like this giant sting ray

375
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
swimming through an underwater canyon.

376
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Every part of the ecosystem in this place

377
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
seems very healthy,

378
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
from tiny, little animals like a nudibrank

379
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
crawling over encrusting sponge

380
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
or a leatherjacket

381
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that is a very important animal in this ecosystem

382
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold.

383
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And I wanted to finish with this photograph,

384
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand

385
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
when I just laid on the bottom

386
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
amidst a school of fish swirling around me.

387
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And I was in a place that had only been protected

388
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
about 20 years ago.

389
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years,

390
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and they said that the marine life was better here today

391
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
than it was in the 1960s.

392
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And that's because it's been protected,

393
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that it has come back.

394
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So I think the message is clear.

395
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point,

396
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
but we must be good custodians.

397
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I became an underwater photographer

398
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
because I fell in love with the sea,

399
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it,

400
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and I don't think it's too late.

401
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:12.806,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was excited to be a part of the "Dream" theme,

2
0:00:17.01,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and then I found out I'm leading off the "Nightmare?" section of it.

3
0:00:20.413,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:23.972,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify.

5
0:00:28.462,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I have some bad news,

6
0:00:30.749,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I have a lot more good news.

7
0:00:32.939,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm going to propose three questions

8
0:00:36.36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the answer to the first one

9
0:00:39.124,000 --> 0:00:41,000
necessarily involves a little bad news.

10
0:00:41.515,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But -- hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions

11
0:00:46.948,000 --> 0:00:48,000
really are very positive.

12
0:00:49.085,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So the first question is, "Do we really have to change?"

13
0:00:54.106,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things

14
0:00:59.255,000 --> 0:01:01,000
changed the environmental movement,

15
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:03,000
really launched the modern environmental movement.

16
0:01:04.456,000 --> 0:01:08,000
18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth,

17
0:01:08.937,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the first Earth Day was organized.

18
0:01:11.561,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And we learned a lot about ourselves

19
0:01:14.324,000 --> 0:01:16,000
looking back at our planet from space.

20
0:01:17.238,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And one of the things that we learned

21
0:01:19.055,000 --> 0:01:21,000
confirmed what the scientists have long told us.

22
0:01:21.522,000 --> 0:01:23,000
One of the most essential facts

23
0:01:23.588,000 --> 0:01:25,000
about the climate crisis has to do with the sky.

24
0:01:26.432,000 --> 0:01:27,000
As this picture illustrates,

25
0:01:28.232,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse

26
0:01:31.297,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that appears when we look up from the ground.

27
0:01:34.153,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It is a very thin shell of atmosphere

28
0:01:38.03,000 --> 0:01:39,000
surrounding the planet.

29
0:01:40.449,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization

30
0:01:45.669,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as it's currently organized.

31
0:01:47.573,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We are spewing 110 million tons

32
0:01:51.219,000 --> 0:01:55,000
of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours,

33
0:01:56.211,000 --> 0:01:57,000
free of charge, go ahead.

34
0:01:58.533,000 --> 0:02:,000
And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases,

35
0:02:01.052,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'm certainly not going to go through them all.

36
0:02:03.316,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I'm going to focus on the main one,

37
0:02:05.034,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved.

38
0:02:09.446,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Management of forests, transportation,

39
0:02:11.953,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.

40
0:02:14.458,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem,

41
0:02:16.888,000 --> 0:02:2,000
which is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels

42
0:02:21.427,000 --> 0:02:27,000
for 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year.

43
0:02:27.89,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And you can see from this image that after World War II,

44
0:02:31.59,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the emission rates started really accelerating.

45
0:02:34.522,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution

46
0:02:37.875,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that is up in the atmosphere now

47
0:02:39.425,000 --> 0:02:42,000
traps as much extra heat energy as would be released

48
0:02:43.183,000 --> 0:02:48,000
by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding

49
0:02:48.656,000 --> 0:02:51,000
every 24 hours, 365 days a year.

50
0:02:52.494,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Fact-checked over and over again,

51
0:02:54.336,000 --> 0:02:56,000
conservative, it's the truth.

52
0:02:56.557,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now it's a big planet, but --

53
0:02:59.131,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Explosion sound)

54
0:03:01.156,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that is a lot of energy,

55
0:03:02.803,000 --> 0:03:07,000
particularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day.

56
0:03:08.881,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And all that extra heat energy

57
0:03:10.414,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system.

58
0:03:13.414,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Let's look at the atmosphere.

59
0:03:15.388,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is a depiction

60
0:03:16.702,000 --> 0:03:21,000
of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures.

61
0:03:22.191,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The white represents normal temperature days;

62
0:03:25.302,000 --> 0:03:28,000
1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.

63
0:03:28.367,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The blue are cooler than average days,

64
0:03:30.271,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the red are warmer than average days.

65
0:03:32.546,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s.

66
0:03:36.728,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And you'll see in the lower right-hand corner

67
0:03:38.903,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the appearance of statistically significant numbers

68
0:03:41.37,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of extremely hot days.

69
0:03:42.972,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In the 90s, the curve shifted further.

70
0:03:44.969,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days

71
0:03:48.684,000 --> 0:03:51,000
are now more numerous than the cooler than average days.

72
0:03:52.375,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth

73
0:03:57.855,000 --> 0:04:,000
than they were just 30 years ago.

74
0:04:01.713,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So we're having record-breaking temperatures.

75
0:04:04.807,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments

76
0:04:08.154,000 --> 0:04:09,000
have been in this young century.

77
0:04:09.717,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The hottest of all was last year.

78
0:04:12.274,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Last month was the 371st month in a row

79
0:04:15.795,000 --> 0:04:17,000
warmer than the 20th-century average.

80
0:04:17.986,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And for the first time, not only the warmest January,

81
0:04:21.19,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer

82
0:04:26.275,000 --> 0:04:28,000
than the average.

83
0:04:28.381,000 --> 0:04:31,000
These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals,

84
0:04:32.309,000 --> 0:04:35,000
plants, people, ecosystems.

85
0:04:35.396,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy

86
0:04:40.342,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is trapped in the oceans.

87
0:04:42.116,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And the scientists can measure the heat buildup

88
0:04:44.347,000 --> 0:04:45,000
much more precisely now

89
0:04:45.64,000 --> 0:04:47,000
at all depths: deep, mid-ocean,

90
0:04:47.895,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the first few hundred meters.

91
0:04:49.959,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And this, too, is accelerating.

92
0:04:52.578,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It goes back more than a century.

93
0:04:54.231,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years.

94
0:04:58.642,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This has consequences.

95
0:04:59.989,000 --> 0:05:,000
The first order of consequence:

96
0:05:01.556,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the ocean-based storms get stronger.

97
0:05:03.534,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific

98
0:05:06.01,000 --> 0:05:09,000
five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal

99
0:05:09.353,000 --> 0:05:11,000
before it slammed into Tacloban,

100
0:05:11.87,000 --> 0:05:15,000
as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall.

101
0:05:15.917,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Pope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue,

102
0:05:20.561,000 --> 0:05:22,000
visited Tacloban right after that.

103
0:05:22.89,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic

104
0:05:25.493,000 --> 0:05:27,000
nine degrees warmer than normal

105
0:05:27.875,000 --> 0:05:29,000
before slamming into New York and New Jersey.

106
0:05:31.954,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now.

107
0:05:35.146,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies.

108
0:05:40.901,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent.

109
0:05:44.755,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And it creates these atmospheric rivers.

110
0:05:47.472,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The Brazilian scientists call them "flying rivers."

111
0:05:50.514,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land

112
0:05:55.281,000 --> 0:06:,000
where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours.

113
0:06:00.567,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This is from Montana.

114
0:06:03.331,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Take a look at this storm last August.

115
0:06:05.678,000 --> 0:06:07,000
As it moves over Tucson, Arizona.

116
0:06:08.021,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It literally splashes off the city.

117
0:06:11.829,000 --> 0:06:14,000
These downpours are really unusual.

118
0:06:15.056,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Last July in Houston, Texas,

119
0:06:18.231,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it rained for two days, 162 billion gallons.

120
0:06:21.209,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls

121
0:06:25.296,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in the middle of the city,

122
0:06:26.565,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which was, of course, paralyzed.

123
0:06:28.492,000 --> 0:06:32,000
These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides.

124
0:06:32.864,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This one is from Chile last year.

125
0:06:37.175,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And you'll see that warehouse going by.

126
0:06:40.342,000 --> 0:06:42,000
There are oil tankers cars going by.

127
0:06:42.97,000 --> 0:06:43,000
This is from Spain last September,

128
0:06:44.93,000 --> 0:06:48,000
you could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess.

129
0:06:49.865,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike

130
0:06:52.717,000 --> 0:06:53,000
through the Book of Revelation.

131
0:06:54.575,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:56.99,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I mean, really.

133
0:06:59.056,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The insurance industry has certainly noticed,

134
0:07:01.726,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the losses have been mounting up.

135
0:07:03.97,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They're not under any illusions about what's happening.

136
0:07:07.972,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And the causality requires a moment of discussion.

137
0:07:13.266,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect --

138
0:07:16.604,000 --> 0:07:17,000
one cause, one effect.

139
0:07:17.779,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is systemic causation.

140
0:07:21.009,000 --> 0:07:23,000
As the great Kevin Trenberth says,

141
0:07:23.272,000 --> 0:07:24,000
"All storms are different now.

142
0:07:24.756,000 --> 0:07:26,000
There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere,

143
0:07:27.019,000 --> 0:07:28,000
there's so much extra water vapor.

144
0:07:28.708,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Every storm is different now."

145
0:07:31.725,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground

146
0:07:36.09,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts

147
0:07:40.524,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and many of them are underway right now.

148
0:07:42.638,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It dries out the vegetation

149
0:07:44.176,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and causes more fires in the western part of North America.

150
0:07:47.862,000 --> 0:07:5,000
There's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them.

151
0:07:51.345,000 --> 0:07:52,000
More lightning,

152
0:07:52.52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
as the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount

153
0:07:55.326,000 --> 0:07:57,000
of additional lightning also.

154
0:07:58.71,000 --> 0:08:04,000
These climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences

155
0:08:05.602,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and create instability.

156
0:08:07.436,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006

157
0:08:12.736,000 --> 0:08:14,000
destroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria,

158
0:08:15.712,000 --> 0:08:17,000
killed 80 percent of the livestock,

159
0:08:18.077,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria,

160
0:08:22.32,000 --> 0:08:25,000
where they collided with another 1.5 million refugees

161
0:08:25.573,000 --> 0:08:27,000
from the Iraq War.

162
0:08:27.985,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell

163
0:08:32.234,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that people are trying to close now.

164
0:08:35.438,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The US Defense Department has long warned

165
0:08:37.876,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of consequences from the climate crisis,

166
0:08:40.198,000 --> 0:08:44,000
including refugees, food and water shortages

167
0:08:44.749,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and pandemic disease.

168
0:08:46.653,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread

169
0:08:51.406,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to the higher latitudes;

170
0:08:52.69,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this.

171
0:08:56.332,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas

172
0:09:00.021,000 --> 0:09:03,000
where these microbial diseases can become endemic

173
0:09:03.878,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.

174
0:09:08.641,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The Zika epidemic now --

175
0:09:12.133,000 --> 0:09:13,000
we're better positioned in North America

176
0:09:14.074,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system.

177
0:09:18.788,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But when women in some regions of South and Central America

178
0:09:23.112,000 --> 0:09:25,000
are advised not to get pregnant for two years --

179
0:09:25.847,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that's something new, that ought to get our attention.

180
0:09:29.961,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world,

181
0:09:33.133,000 --> 0:09:37,000
last summer labeled this a medical emergency now.

182
0:09:37.387,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And there are many factors because of it.

183
0:09:40.073,000 --> 0:09:42,000
This is also connected to the extinction crisis.

184
0:09:42.894,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth

185
0:09:46.465,000 --> 0:09:47,000
by the end of this century.

186
0:09:47.812,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And already, land-based plants and animals

187
0:09:50.598,000 --> 0:09:51,000
are now moving towards the poles

188
0:09:52.27,000 --> 0:09:55,000
at an average rate of 15 feet per day.

189
0:09:56.661,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Speaking of the North Pole,

190
0:09:57.995,000 --> 0:10:02,000
last December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding

191
0:10:03.289,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in the American Midwest,

192
0:10:04.962,000 --> 0:10:06,000
raised temperatures at the North Pole

193
0:10:07.169,000 --> 0:10:09,000
50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal,

194
0:10:09.823,000 --> 0:10:11,000
causing the thawing of the North Pole

195
0:10:12.285,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night.

196
0:10:16.921,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts,

197
0:10:20.527,000 --> 0:10:21,000
it raises sea level.

198
0:10:22.269,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this.

199
0:10:26.474,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's more dangerous coming off Greenland

200
0:10:28.458,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and particularly, Antarctica.

201
0:10:30.488,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population

202
0:10:35.202,000 --> 0:10:37,000
are mostly in South and Southeast Asia.

203
0:10:37.965,000 --> 0:10:41,000
When you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami:

204
0:10:42.098,000 --> 0:10:44,000
three and a half trillion dollars at risk.

205
0:10:44.745,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Number three: New York and Newark.

206
0:10:46.44,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon,

207
0:10:49.76,000 --> 0:10:52,000
one of the highest high-tide days.

208
0:10:52.895,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets

209
0:10:56.051,000 --> 0:10:58,000
of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale

210
0:10:58.226,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and Del Rey.

211
0:10:59.424,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now.

212
0:11:02.422,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Not with rain -- they call it "sunny-day flooding."

213
0:11:05.061,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It comes up through the storm sewers.

214
0:11:09.636,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says

215
0:11:14.024,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens.

216
0:11:18.271,000 --> 0:11:21,000
This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day.

217
0:11:21.431,000 --> 0:11:23,000
We have to move beyond partisanship.

218
0:11:23.776,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans --

219
0:11:27.062,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Applause)

220
0:11:28.14,000 --> 0:11:3,000
who had the courage last fall

221
0:11:30.997,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to step out and take a political risk,

222
0:11:35.455,000 --> 0:11:37,000
by telling the truth about the climate crisis.

223
0:11:38.218,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up,

224
0:11:41.399,000 --> 0:11:44,000
there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned.

225
0:11:45.091,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It's an enormous burden.

226
0:11:47.088,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I'll mention just one more,

227
0:11:48.676,000 --> 0:11:52,000
because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos,

228
0:11:53.427,000 --> 0:11:56,000
after their annual survey of 750 economists,

229
0:11:56.468,000 --> 0:11:58,000
said the climate crisis is now the number one risk

230
0:11:59.352,000 --> 0:12:,000
to the global economy.

231
0:12:01.205,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So you get central bankers

232
0:12:02.547,000 --> 0:12:04,000
like Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank,

233
0:12:05.341,000 --> 0:12:09,000
saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable.

234
0:12:09.401,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Subprime carbon.

235
0:12:11.171,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages,

236
0:12:14.486,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but it's the same thing.

237
0:12:16.112,000 --> 0:12:18,000
If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned

238
0:12:18.851,000 --> 0:12:2,000
since the beginning of the industrial revolution,

239
0:12:21.545,000 --> 0:12:24,000
this is the quantity burned in the last 16 years.

240
0:12:25.085,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books,

241
0:12:28.688,000 --> 0:12:29,000
28 trillion dollars.

242
0:12:30.5,000 --> 0:12:34,000
The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned.

243
0:12:34.733,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So the rest, 22 trillion dollars --

244
0:12:37.646,000 --> 0:12:38,000
unburnable.

245
0:12:39.303,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Risk to the global economy.

246
0:12:41.56,000 --> 0:12:44,000
That's why divestment movement makes practical sense

247
0:12:44.621,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and is not just a moral imperative.

248
0:12:47.225,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So the answer to the first question, "Must we change?"

249
0:12:51.419,000 --> 0:12:52,000
is yes, we have to change.

250
0:12:53.367,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Second question, "Can we change?"

251
0:12:55.143,000 --> 0:12:57,000
This is the exciting news!

252
0:12:57.488,000 --> 0:13:,000
The best projections in the world 16 years ago

253
0:13:01.017,000 --> 0:13:05,000
were that by 2010, the world would be able to install

254
0:13:05.072,000 --> 0:13:07,000
30 gigawatts of wind capacity.

255
0:13:07.263,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over.

256
0:13:12.278,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We see an exponential curve for wind installations now.

257
0:13:16.086,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We see the cost coming down dramatically.

258
0:13:19.685,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Some countries -- take Germany, an industrial powerhouse

259
0:13:22.959,000 --> 0:13:25,000
with a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way --

260
0:13:26.351,000 --> 0:13:27,000
one day last December,

261
0:13:28.01,000 --> 0:13:31,000
got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources,

262
0:13:31.472,000 --> 0:13:32,000
mainly solar and wind.

263
0:13:33.129,000 --> 0:13:36,000
A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.

264
0:13:36.454,000 --> 0:13:37,000
More good news:

265
0:13:37.636,000 --> 0:13:4,000
energy storage, from batteries particularly,

266
0:13:40.683,000 --> 0:13:41,000
is now beginning to take off

267
0:13:42.301,000 --> 0:13:45,000
because the cost has been coming down very dramatically

268
0:13:46.118,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to solve the intermittency problem.

269
0:13:47.915,000 --> 0:13:49,000
With solar, the news is even more exciting!

270
0:13:50.45,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install

271
0:13:53.823,000 --> 0:13:55,000
one gigawatt per year by 2010.

272
0:13:56.394,000 --> 0:14:,000
When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over.

273
0:14:01.038,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Last year, we beat it by 58 times over.

274
0:14:04.647,000 --> 0:14:07,000
This year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over.

275
0:14:07.911,000 --> 0:14:08,000
We're going to win this.

276
0:14:09.125,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We are going to prevail.

277
0:14:10.883,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic.

278
0:14:14.99,000 --> 0:14:15,000
When I came to this stage 10 years ago,

279
0:14:16.943,000 --> 0:14:17,000
this is where it was.

280
0:14:18.894,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough

281
0:14:22.472,000 --> 0:14:25,000
in the emergence of these exponential curves.

282
0:14:25.685,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

283
0:14:28.933,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And the cost has come down 10 percent per year

284
0:14:32.454,000 --> 0:14:33,000
for 30 years.

285
0:14:33.777,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And it's continuing to come down.

286
0:14:36.099,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Now, the business community has certainly noticed this,

287
0:14:38.769,000 --> 0:14:4,000
because it's crossing the grid parity point.

288
0:14:41.602,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise.

289
0:14:44.878,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Grid parity is understood as that line, that threshold,

290
0:14:48.418,000 --> 0:14:51,000
below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity

291
0:14:52.316,000 --> 0:14:54,000
from burning fossil fuels.

292
0:14:54.558,000 --> 0:14:56,000
That threshold is a little bit like the difference

293
0:14:57.275,000 --> 0:15:01,000
between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,

294
0:15:01.409,000 --> 0:15:02,000
or zero and one Celsius.

295
0:15:03.019,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It's a difference of more than one degree,

296
0:15:05.067,000 --> 0:15:07,000
it's the difference between ice and water.

297
0:15:07.792,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up,

298
0:15:11.76,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment.

299
0:15:16.316,000 --> 0:15:19,000
This is the biggest new business opportunity

300
0:15:19.945,000 --> 0:15:2,000
in the history of the world,

301
0:15:21.501,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and two-thirds of it is in the private sector.

302
0:15:24.673,000 --> 0:15:27,000
We are seeing an explosion of new investment.

303
0:15:28.133,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Starting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation

304
0:15:33.725,000 --> 0:15:34,000
surpassed fossils.

305
0:15:35.282,000 --> 0:15:37,000
The gap has been growing ever since.

306
0:15:37.722,000 --> 0:15:39,000
The projections for the future are even more dramatic,

307
0:15:40.694,000 --> 0:15:43,000
even though fossil energy is now still subsidized

308
0:15:44.317,000 --> 0:15:47,000
at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.

309
0:15:47.568,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here,

310
0:15:51.682,000 --> 0:15:53,000
particularly if you assume that the work many are doing

311
0:15:54.327,000 --> 0:15:56,000
to try to break through to safer and more acceptable,

312
0:15:57.065,000 --> 0:15:58,000
more affordable forms of nuclear,

313
0:15:58.928,000 --> 0:16:,000
this could change even more dramatically.

314
0:16:01.934,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption

315
0:16:04.914,000 --> 0:16:05,000
of a new technology?

316
0:16:06.667,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Well, there are many, but let's look at cell phones.

317
0:16:09.151,000 --> 0:16:12,000
In 1980, AT&T, then Ma Bell,

318
0:16:12.548,000 --> 0:16:14,000
commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey

319
0:16:14.965,000 --> 0:16:17,000
of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then.

320
0:16:18.605,000 --> 0:16:21,000
"How many can we sell by the year 2000?" they asked.

321
0:16:21.792,000 --> 0:16:23,000
McKinsey came back and said, "900,000."

322
0:16:24.384,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived,

323
0:16:26.48,000 --> 0:16:28,000
they did sell 900,000 -- in the first three days.

324
0:16:29.082,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more.

325
0:16:33.018,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.

326
0:16:37.418,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong?

327
0:16:41.911,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I've asked that question myself, "Why?"

328
0:16:44.335,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Laughter)

329
0:16:45.362,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And I think the answer is in three parts.

330
0:16:48.122,000 --> 0:16:51,000
First, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected,

331
0:16:51.535,000 --> 0:16:53,000
even as the quality went up.

332
0:16:54.066,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid --

333
0:16:58.362,000 --> 0:17:,000
they leap-frogged to the new technology.

334
0:17:00.614,000 --> 0:17:03,000
The big expansion has been in the developing counties.

335
0:17:03.702,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So what about the electricity grids in the developing world?

336
0:17:07.474,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Well, not so hot.

337
0:17:09.228,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And in many areas, they don't exist.

338
0:17:11.55,000 --> 0:17:14,000
There are more people without any electricity at all in India

339
0:17:14.72,000 --> 0:17:17,000
than the entire population of the United States of America.

340
0:17:17.866,000 --> 0:17:18,000
So now we're getting this:

341
0:17:19.394,000 --> 0:17:2,000
solar panels on grass huts

342
0:17:21.256,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and new business models that make it affordable.

343
0:17:24.218,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.

344
0:17:29.127,000 --> 0:17:3,000
This is a village market.

345
0:17:30.859,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world:

346
0:17:33.773,000 --> 0:17:35,000
two systems per minute on average, night and day.

347
0:17:36.209,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And we have all we need:

348
0:17:37.422,000 --> 0:17:39,000
enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth

349
0:17:39.738,000 --> 0:17:44,000
every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year.

350
0:17:45.125,000 --> 0:17:47,000
It's actually a little bit less than an hour.

351
0:17:47.322,000 --> 0:17:5,000
So the answer to the second question, "Can we change?"

352
0:17:50.678,000 --> 0:17:51,000
is clearly "Yes."

353
0:17:52.625,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And it's an ever-firmer "yes."

354
0:17:55.421,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Last question, "Will we change?"

355
0:17:58.053,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Paris really was a breakthrough,

356
0:18:00.069,000 --> 0:18:01,000
some of the provisions are binding

357
0:18:01.756,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and the regular reviews will matter a lot.

358
0:18:03.818,000 --> 0:18:05,000
But nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead.

359
0:18:06.093,000 --> 0:18:08,000
China has already announced that starting next year,

360
0:18:08.632,000 --> 0:18:1,000
they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system.

361
0:18:11.639,000 --> 0:18:14,000
They will likely link up with the European Union.

362
0:18:14.806,000 --> 0:18:16,000
The United States has already been changing.

363
0:18:17.322,000 --> 0:18:19,000
All of these coal plants were proposed

364
0:18:19.396,000 --> 0:18:21,000
in the next 10 years and canceled.

365
0:18:21.95,000 --> 0:18:23,000
All of these existing coal plants were retired.

366
0:18:24.893,000 --> 0:18:27,000
All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced.

367
0:18:27.934,000 --> 0:18:29,000
All of them -- canceled.

368
0:18:30.286,000 --> 0:18:31,000
We are moving forward.

369
0:18:31.8,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Last year -- if you look at all of the investment

370
0:18:34.292,000 --> 0:18:36,000
in new electricity generation in the United States,

371
0:18:37.259,000 --> 0:18:39,000
almost three-quarters was from renewable energy,

372
0:18:39.949,000 --> 0:18:41,000
mostly wind and solar.

373
0:18:42.485,000 --> 0:18:45,000
We are solving this crisis.

374
0:18:45.656,000 --> 0:18:49,000
The only question is: how long will it take to get there?

375
0:18:50.579,000 --> 0:18:54,000
So, it matters that a lot of people are organizing

376
0:18:55.22,000 --> 0:18:57,000
to insist on this change.

377
0:18:57.382,000 --> 0:19:,000
Almost 400,000 people marched in New York City

378
0:19:01.19,000 --> 0:19:03,000
before the UN special session on this.

379
0:19:04.061,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Many thousands, tens of thousands,

380
0:19:06.089,000 --> 0:19:08,000
marched in cities around the world.

381
0:19:08.986,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And so, I am extremely optimistic.

382
0:19:13.153,000 --> 0:19:15,000
As I said before, we are going to win this.

383
0:19:15.732,000 --> 0:19:16,000
I'll finish with this story.

384
0:19:18.218,000 --> 0:19:2,000
When I was 13 years old,

385
0:19:20.834,000 --> 0:19:23,000
I heard that proposal by President Kennedy

386
0:19:24.289,000 --> 0:19:26,000
to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely

387
0:19:26.864,000 --> 0:19:27,000
in 10 years.

388
0:19:28.053,000 --> 0:19:3,000
And I heard adults of that day and time say,

389
0:19:31.061,000 --> 0:19:34,000
"That's reckless, expensive, may well fail."

390
0:19:34.602,000 --> 0:19:36,000
But eight years and two months later,

391
0:19:36.803,000 --> 0:19:39,000
in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon,

392
0:19:40.089,000 --> 0:19:44,000
there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston.

393
0:19:44.703,000 --> 0:19:46,000
Here's a little-known fact about that:

394
0:19:47.187,000 --> 0:19:49,000
the average age of the systems engineers,

395
0:19:49.416,000 --> 0:19:52,000
the controllers in the room that day, was 26,

396
0:19:52.616,000 --> 0:19:53,000
which means, among other things,

397
0:19:54.199,000 --> 0:19:57,000
their age, when they heard that challenge, was 18.

398
0:19:57.473,000 --> 0:20:,000
We now have a moral challenge

399
0:20:00.699,000 --> 0:20:03,000
that is in the tradition of others that we have faced.

400
0:20:04.253,000 --> 0:20:07,000
One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US,

401
0:20:07.931,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Wallace Stevens,

402
0:20:09.304,000 --> 0:20:1,000
wrote a line that has stayed with me:

403
0:20:11.146,000 --> 0:20:13,000
"After the final 'no,' there comes a 'yes,'

404
0:20:13.653,000 --> 0:20:15,000
and on that 'yes', the future world depends."

405
0:20:16.658,000 --> 0:20:18,000
When the abolitionists started their movement,

406
0:20:18.967,000 --> 0:20:2,000
they met with no after no after no.

407
0:20:21.198,000 --> 0:20:22,000
And then came a yes.

408
0:20:22.498,000 --> 0:20:24,000
The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement

409
0:20:24.911,000 --> 0:20:27,000
met endless no's, until finally, there was a yes.

410
0:20:28.53,000 --> 0:20:3,000
The Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid,

411
0:20:31.325,000 --> 0:20:34,000
and more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights

412
0:20:34.94,000 --> 0:20:36,000
here in the United States and elsewhere.

413
0:20:37.369,000 --> 0:20:39,000
After the final "no" comes a "yes."

414
0:20:39.569,000 --> 0:20:44,000
When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved

415
0:20:44.726,000 --> 0:20:47,000
into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong,

416
0:20:48.605,000 --> 0:20:52,000
the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings.

417
0:20:52.758,000 --> 0:20:55,000
Ninety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now

418
0:20:56.635,000 --> 0:20:58,000
and it is why we're going to win this.

419
0:20:59.151,000 --> 0:21:,000
We have everything we need.

420
0:21:01.113,000 --> 0:21:04,000
Some still doubt that we have the will to act,

421
0:21:04.552,000 --> 0:21:08,000
but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.

422
0:21:09.266,000 --> 0:21:1,000
Thank you very much.

423
0:21:10.497,000 --> 0:21:13,000
(Applause)

424
0:21:47.319,000 --> 0:21:5,000
Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible combination of skills.

425
0:21:50.526,000 --> 0:21:52,000
You've got this scientist mind that can understand

426
0:21:53.511,000 --> 0:21:55,000
the full range of issues,

427
0:21:55.836,000 --> 0:21:58,000
and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language.

428
0:21:59.512,000 --> 0:22:01,000
No one else can do that, that's why you led this thing.

429
0:22:02.419,000 --> 0:22:05,000
It was amazing to see it 10 years ago, it was amazing to see it now.

430
0:22:05.854,000 --> 0:22:07,000
Al Gore: Well, you're nice to say that, Chris.

431
0:22:08.053,000 --> 0:22:11,000
But honestly, I have a lot of really good friends

432
0:22:11.238,000 --> 0:22:14,000
in the scientific community who are incredibly patient

433
0:22:14.981,000 --> 0:22:16,000
and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me

434
0:22:17.776,000 --> 0:22:18,000
over and over and over again

435
0:22:19.134,000 --> 0:22:22,000
until I can get it into simple enough language

436
0:22:22.754,000 --> 0:22:23,000
that I can understand it.

437
0:22:23.99,000 --> 0:22:25,000
And that's the key to trying to communicate.

438
0:22:27.497,000 --> 0:22:3,000
CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying,

439
0:22:31.206,000 --> 0:22:32,000
second part: incredibly hopeful.

440
0:22:33.81,000 --> 0:22:38,000
How do we know that all those graphs, all that progress, is enough

441
0:22:39.135,000 --> 0:22:41,000
to solve what you showed in the first part?

442
0:22:41.887,000 --> 0:22:44,000
AG: I think that the crossing --

443
0:22:45.439,000 --> 0:22:48,000
you know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years.

444
0:22:48.476,000 --> 0:22:51,000
But one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters

445
0:22:51.778,000 --> 0:22:54,000
if a new product or service is more expensive

446
0:22:54.966,000 --> 0:22:56,000
than the incumbent, or cheaper than.

447
0:22:57.144,000 --> 0:22:59,000
Turns out, it makes a difference if it's cheaper than.

448
0:22:59.723,000 --> 0:23:,000
(Laughter)

449
0:23:00.842,000 --> 0:23:02,000
And when it crosses that line,

450
0:23:03.56,000 --> 0:23:04,000
then a lot of things really change.

451
0:23:05.48,000 --> 0:23:07,000
We are regularly surprised by these developments.

452
0:23:08.449,000 --> 0:23:1,000
The late Rudi Dornbusch, the great economist said,

453
0:23:11.02,000 --> 0:23:13,000
"Things take longer to happen then you think they will,

454
0:23:13.84,000 --> 0:23:15,000
and then they happen much faster than you thought they could."

455
0:23:16.822,000 --> 0:23:17,000
I really think that's where we are.

456
0:23:18.544,000 --> 0:23:21,000
Some people are using the phrase "The Solar Singularity" now,

457
0:23:22.245,000 --> 0:23:25,000
meaning when it gets below the grid parity,

458
0:23:25.562,000 --> 0:23:27,000
unsubsidized in most places,

459
0:23:27.634,000 --> 0:23:28,000
then it's the default choice.

460
0:23:29.3,000 --> 0:23:34,000
Now, in one of the presentations yesterday, the jitney thing,

461
0:23:35.314,000 --> 0:23:4,000
there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down.

462
0:23:40.445,000 --> 0:23:43,000
And I just don't think it's going to work.

463
0:23:44.608,000 --> 0:23:46,000
There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley,

464
0:23:47.028,000 --> 0:23:49,000
who's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party.

465
0:23:49.133,000 --> 0:23:51,000
They enlisted her in this effort to put a tax

466
0:23:51.334,000 --> 0:23:53,000
on solar panels and regulations.

467
0:23:53.481,000 --> 0:23:55,000
And she had just put solar panels on her roof

468
0:23:55.624,000 --> 0:23:56,000
and she didn't understand the request.

469
0:23:57.514,000 --> 0:23:58,000
(Laughter)

470
0:23:59.303,000 --> 0:24:02,000
And so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club

471
0:24:02.805,000 --> 0:24:06,000
and they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party.

472
0:24:06.882,000 --> 0:24:07,000
(Laughter)

473
0:24:07.908,000 --> 0:24:08,000
(Applause)

474
0:24:08.933,000 --> 0:24:09,000
And they defeated the proposal.

475
0:24:10.445,000 --> 0:24:13,000
So, finally, the answer to your question is,

476
0:24:13.695,000 --> 0:24:16,000
this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a cliché,

477
0:24:16.752,000 --> 0:24:19,000
but 10 years ago -- and Christiana referred to this --

478
0:24:20.292,000 --> 0:24:25,000
there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role

479
0:24:26.223,000 --> 0:24:28,000
in generating those exponential curves.

480
0:24:29.048,000 --> 0:24:31,000
And it didn't work out economically for some of them,

481
0:24:31.596,000 --> 0:24:34,000
but it kick-started this global revolution.

482
0:24:34.674,000 --> 0:24:37,000
And what people in this audience do now

483
0:24:38.477,000 --> 0:24:4,000
with the knowledge that we are going to win this.

484
0:24:41.006,000 --> 0:24:45,000
But it matters a lot how fast we win it.

485
0:24:45.26,000 --> 0:24:47,000
CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.

486
0:24:47.641,000 --> 0:24:48,000
If this turns out to be the year,

487
0:24:49.34,000 --> 0:24:51,000
that the partisan thing changes,

488
0:24:52.192,000 --> 0:24:55,000
as you said, it's no longer a partisan issue,

489
0:24:55.594,000 --> 0:24:59,000
but you bring along people from the other side together,

490
0:24:59.784,000 --> 0:25:02,000
backed by science, backed by these kinds of investment opportunities,

491
0:25:03.093,000 --> 0:25:05,000
backed by reason that you win the day --

492
0:25:05.225,000 --> 0:25:07,000
boy, that's really exciting.

493
0:25:07.608,000 --> 0:25:08,000
Thank you so much.

494
0:25:08.8,000 --> 0:25:1,000
AG: Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED.

495
0:25:11.331,000 --> 0:25:12,000
Thank you!

496
0:25:12.506,000 --> 0:25:14,000
(Applause)

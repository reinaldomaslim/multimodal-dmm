1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"People do stupid things.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
That's what spreads HIV."

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The Guardian, not that long ago.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Well, one or two brave souls.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who's been in field of HIV for 15 years,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
worked on four continents,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and you're looking at her.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I am now going to argue

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that this is only half true.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
People do get HIV because they do stupid things,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but most of them are doing stupid things

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
for perfectly rational reasons.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in public health,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and if you put your public health nerd glasses on,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
you'll see that if we give people the information that they need

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
about what's good for them and what's bad for them,

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
if you give them the services

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that they can use to act on that information,

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and a little bit of motivation,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
people will make rational decisions

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and live long and healthy lives.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Wonderful.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV,

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and although I'm sure you all know

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and if you were at TED '07

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
it's about coffee prices ...

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs,

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and if there are two things that make

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
human beings a little bit irrational,

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
they are erections and addiction.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So, let's start with what's rational for an addict.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We were having lunch and he was telling me

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
smuggled some heroin into jail,

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and he was very generously sharing it out

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
with all of his colleagues.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And so everyone lined up,

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
all the smackheads in a row,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and the guy whose birthday it was

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
filled up the fit,

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and he went down and started injecting people.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So he injects the first guy,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and he injects the next guy.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line,

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and I can see the needle coming down towards me,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and there is blood all over the place.

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's getting blunter and blunter.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And a small part of my brain is thinking,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
'That is so gross

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and really dangerous,'

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but most of my brain is thinking,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
'Please let there be some smack left

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
by the time it gets to me.

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Please let there be some left.'"

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And then, telling me this story,

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Frankie said,

66
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"You know ... God,

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
drugs really make you stupid."

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But, actually, Frankie, at that time,

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
was a heroin addict and he was in jail.

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So his choice was either

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And if there's one place you really want to get high,

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it's when you're in jail.

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But I'm a scientist

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes,

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so let's look at some data.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We talked to 600 drug addicts

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in three cities in Indonesia,

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
at a price you can afford to avoid that?"

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"So are you carrying a needle?"

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We're actually interviewing people on the street,

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"Are you carrying clean needles?"

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One in four, maximum.

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So no surprises then that

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the proportion that actually used clean needles

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
every time they injected in the last week

95
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is just about one in 10,

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and the other nine in 10 are sharing.

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So you've got this massive mismatch;

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
everyone knows that

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
if they share they're going to get HIV,

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but they're all sharing anyway.

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"

103
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want

104
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.

105
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
There's just kind of an ick factor there.

106
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So, in Indonesia at this time,

108
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
they could put you into jail.

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Because your choice now is either

112
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I use my own needle now,

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
or I could share a needle now

114
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and get a disease that's going to

115
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
possibly kill me 10 years from now,

116
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
or I could use my own needle now

117
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and go to jail tomorrow.

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And while junkies think that

119
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
they think it's a much worse idea

121
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to spend the next year in jail

122
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation

123
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and expose themselves to HIV anyway.

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational

125
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to share needles.

126
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This is a really easy problem.

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
For once, your incentives are aligned.

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We've got what's rational for public health.

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You want people to use clean needles --

131
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and junkies want to use clean needles.

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So we could make this problem go away

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
simply by making clean needles universally available

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and taking away the fear of arrest.

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now, the first person to figure that out

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and do something about it on a national scale

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Margaret Thatcher.

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And she put in the world's first

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
national needle exchange program,

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And in all of those countries, you can see,

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
not more than four percent of injectors

144
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
ever became infected with HIV.

145
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example,

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Moscow, Jakarta --

147
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we're talking, at its peak,

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
one in two injectors

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
infected with this fatal disease.

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because she has any great love for junkies.

152
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
She did it because she ran a country

153
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that had a national health service.

154
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,

155
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
she was going to have pick up the costs

156
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of treatment later on,

157
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and obviously those are much higher.

158
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So she was making a politically rational decision.

159
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now, if I take out my

160
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
public health nerd glasses here

161
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and look at these data,

162
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?

163
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But in this country,

164
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
where the government apparently does not feel compelled

165
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)

166
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we've taken a very different approach.

167
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So what we've been doing in the United States

168
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.

169
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies

170
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
by all the big muckety-mucks

171
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of the scientific pantheon in the United States,

172
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and these are the studies that show

173
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.

174
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective --

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides

176
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,

177
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but no -- that's the whole slide.

178
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

179
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
There is nothing on the other side.

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, completely irrational,

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
you would think.

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,

183
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and they're responding to what they think the voters want.

184
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So what we see is that voters respond

185
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
very well to things like this

186
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and not quite so well to things like this.

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

188
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So it becomes quite rational

189
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to deny services to injectors.

190
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now let's talk about sex.

191
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Are we any more rational about sex?

192
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Well, I'm not even going to address

193
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the clearly irrational positions

194
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of people like the Catholic Church,

195
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
who think somehow that if you give out condoms,

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
everyone's going to run out and have sex.

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I don't know if Pope Benedict

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
watches TEDTalks online,

199
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict --

200
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I carry condoms all the time

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and I never get laid.

202
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

203
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's not that easy!

204
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.

205
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Applause)

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Okay, seriously,

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
HIV is actually not that easy

208
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to transmit sexually.

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So, it depends on how much virus there is

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in your blood and in your body fluids.

211
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus

212
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
right at the beginning when you're first infected,

213
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
then you start making antibodies,

214
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and then it bumps along at quite low levels

215
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
for a long time -- 10 or 12 years --

216
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.

217
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But basically, nothing much is going on

218
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
until you start to get symptomatic AIDS,

219
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and by that stage,

220
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you're not looking great, you're not feeling great,

221
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
you're not having that much sex.

222
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So the sexual transmission of HIV

223
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is essentially determined by how many partners you have

224
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in these very short spaces of time

225
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
when you have peak viremia.

226
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now, this makes people crazy

227
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because it means that you have to talk about

228
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
some groups having more sexual partners

229
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in shorter spaces of time than other groups,

230
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and that's considered stigmatizing.

231
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I've always been a bit curious about that

232
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
because I think stigma is a bad thing,

233
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,

234
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but we'll leave that be.

235
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The truth is that 20 years

236
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of very good research

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
have shown us that

238
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
there are groups that are more likely to turnover

239
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
large numbers of partners in a short space of time.

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And those groups are, globally,

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
people who sell sex and their more regular partners.

242
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They are gay men on the party scene

243
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
who have, on average, three times more partners

244
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
than straight people on the party scene.

245
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And they are heterosexuals

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
who come from countries that have

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
traditions of polygamy

248
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and relatively high levels of female autonomy,

249
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.

250
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.

251
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.

252
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
These are all countries in southern Africa

253
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
where between one in seven,

254
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and one in three

255
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of all adults,

256
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
are infected with HIV.

257
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Now, in the rest of the world,

258
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we've got basically nothing going on in the general population --

259
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
very, very low levels --

260
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV

261
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
in these other populations who are at highest risk:

262
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
drug injectors, sex workers

263
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and gay men.

264
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:

265
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
25 percent prevalence among gay men.

266
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.

267
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex

268
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
with a positive person.

269
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
In most of the world,

270
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
these few prevention failures

271
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
notwithstanding,

272
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we are actually doing quite well these days

273
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
in commercial sex:

274
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent

275
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
in commercial sex in most countries.

276
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.

277
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
What's rational for public health

278
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is also rational for individual sex workers

279
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because it's really bad for business to have another STI.

280
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
No one wants it.

281
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.

282
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So essentially, you're able to achieve

283
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.

284
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But in "intimate" relations

285
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
it's much more difficult because,

286
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
with your wife or your boyfriend

287
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,

288
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
we have this illusion of romance

289
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and trust and intimacy,

290
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and nothing is quite so unromantic

291
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.

292
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So in the face of that,

293
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
you really need quite a strong incentive

294
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to use condoms.

295
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.

297
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,

298
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but he is a reminder in the population,

299
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
of why you might want to be

300
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
using condoms.

301
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder

302
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.

303
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph

304
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
after six months on antiretroviral treatment.

305
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.

306
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But it is changing the equation

307
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
of what's rational

308
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in sexual decision-making.

309
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So, what we've got --

310
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much

311
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because, actually, treatment is effective prevention

312
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
because it lowers your viral load and therefore

313
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."

314
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So, if you look at the viremia thing again,

315
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
if you do start treatment when you're sick,

316
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.

317
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?

318
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Well, you die,

319
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
so your viral load goes to zero.

320
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes --

321
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,

322
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge

323
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and forgot to take your drugs,

324
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever --

325
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
all of that is virus

326
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.

327
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.

328
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Let's just stop treating people."

329
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Of course not, of course not.

330
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.

331
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But what I am doing is calling into question

332
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
those people who say that more treatment

333
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is all the prevention we need.

334
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
That's simply not necessarily true,

335
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men

336
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in rich countries where treatment has been widely available

337
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
for going on 15 years now.

338
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And what we've seen is

339
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that, actually, condom use rates,

340
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
which were very, very high --

341
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,

342
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
with extremely little help

343
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
from public health nerds, I would say --

344
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment

345
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
for two reasons really:

346
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
One is the assumption of, "Oh well,

347
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
if he's infected, he's probably on meds,

348
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."

349
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And the other thing is that people are simply

350
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
not as scared of HIV

351
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.

352
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,

353
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and HIV is an invisible virus

354
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that makes you take a pill every day.

355
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And that's boring,

356
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but is it as boring as

357
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
having to use a condom every time you have sex,

358
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
no matter how drunk you are,

359
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?

360
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
If we look at the data, we can see that

361
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the answer to that question

362
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
is, mmm.

363
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So these are data from Scotland.

364
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
You see the peak in drug injectors

365
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
before they started the national needle exchange program.

366
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Then it came way down.

367
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex --

368
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and in drug users,

369
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,

370
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and that's because of that alignment of incentives

371
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
that I talked about earlier.

372
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
But in gay men,

373
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
you've got quite a dramatic rise

374
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
starting three or four years

375
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
after treatment became widely available.

376
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This is of new infections.

377
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
What does that mean?

378
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It means that the combined effect of being less worried

379
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and having more virus out there in the population --

380
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
more people living longer, healthier lives,

381
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
more likely to be getting laid

382
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
with HIV --

383
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
is outweighing the effects of lower viral load,

384
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and that's a very worrisome thing.

385
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
What does it mean?

386
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.

387
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Is that what's happening?

388
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."

389
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,

390
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and what's happening really is that people are

391
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
unable quite to bring themselves to put in

392
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,

393
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.

394
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
But once they've gone from being

395
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone

396
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
to being AIDS victims,

397
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
we come over all compassionate

398
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.

399
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
It doesn't make any sense

400
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
from a public health point of view.

401
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.

402
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;

403
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
she's a chick with a dick.

404
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Why does she do that job?

405
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Well, of course, because she's forced into it

406
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.

407
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And if we could just teach her to sew

408
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.

409
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:

410
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
on average, 20 cents.

411
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
It varies a bit province to province.

412
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them

413
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
for this particular slide,

414
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and this is what sex workers

415
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
say they earn in an hour.

416
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people

417
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
it really is quite a rational choice.

418
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Okay, Ines.

419
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash,

420
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and commitment to preventing HIV too.

421
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?

422
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
It's all politics.

423
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.

424
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."

425
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So, from the point of view of a sex worker,

426
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
politicians are making no sense.

427
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
From the point of view of a public health nerd,

428
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
junkies are doing dumb things.

429
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.

430
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
There are as many different ways of being rational

431
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
as there are human beings on the planet,

432
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and that's one of the glories of human existence.

433
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
But those ways of being rational

434
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
are not independent of one another,

435
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
so it's rational for

436
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
a drug injector to share needles

437
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician,

438
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and it's rational for a politician

439
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
to make that stupid decision

440
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
because they're responding to

441
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
what they think the voters want.

442
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
But here's the thing:

443
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
we are the voters.

444
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.

445
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And everyone who's in this room,

446
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and everyone who's watching this out there on the web,

447
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians

448
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
that we make policy based on scientific evidence

449
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and on common sense.

450
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
It's going to be really hard for us

451
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
to individually affect what's rational

452
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
for every Frankie and every Ines out there,

453
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
but you can at least use your vote

454
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
to stop politicians doing stupid things

455
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
that spread HIV.

456
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Thank you.

457
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
(Applause)

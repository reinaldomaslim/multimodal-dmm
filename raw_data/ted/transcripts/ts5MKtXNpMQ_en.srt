1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What I'm going to try to do is explain to you

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
quickly how to predict,

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and illustrate it with some predictions

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In order to predict effectively,

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we need to use science.

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And the reason that we need to use science

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is because then we can reproduce what we're doing;

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
it's not just wisdom or guesswork.

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And if we can predict,

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
then we can engineer the future.

12
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So if you are concerned to influence energy policy,

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or you are concerned to influence national security policy,

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or health policy, or education,

15
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
science -- and a particular branch of science -- is a way to do it,

16
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
not the way we've been doing it,

17
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which is seat-of-the-pants wisdom.

18
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now before I get into how to do it

19
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
let me give you a little truth in advertising,

20
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because I'm not engaged in the business of magic.

21
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict,

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and there are some that it can't.

23
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It can predict complex negotiations

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
or situations involving coercion --

25
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that is in essence everything that has to do with politics,

26
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
much of what has to do with business,

27
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but sorry, if you're looking to speculate in the stock market,

28
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I don't predict stock markets -- OK,

29
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it's not going up any time really soon.

30
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But I'm not engaged in doing that.

31
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators.

32
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I actually get phone calls from people

33
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win.

34
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
I don't have a clue.

35
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I engage in the use of game theory, game theory is a branch of mathematics

36
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and that means, sorry, that even in the study of politics,

37
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
math has come into the picture.

38
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics,

39
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we need to look at this in a rigorous way.

40
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, what is game theory about?

41
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them.

42
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That doesn't seem terribly shocking --

43
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
although it's controversial for a lot of people --

44
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that we are self-interested.

45
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In order to look out for what's best for them

46
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or what they think is best for them,

47
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
people have values -- they identify what they want, and what they don't want.

48
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And they have beliefs about what other people want,

49
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and what other people don't want, how much power other people have,

50
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.

51
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And they face limitations, constraints,

52
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
they may be weak, they may be located in the wrong part of the world,

53
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
they may be Einstein, stuck away farming

54
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
someplace in a rural village in India not being noticed,

55
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time,

56
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a great mathematician but nobody noticed.

57
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now who is rational?

58
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about?

59
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You know, what if people are rational?

60
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Mother Theresa, she was rational.

61
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Terrorists, they're rational.

62
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Pretty much everybody is rational.

63
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of --

64
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
two-year-olds, they are not rational,

65
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they have very fickle preferences,

66
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
they switch what they think all the time,

67
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and schizophrenics are probably not rational,

68
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but pretty much everybody else is rational.

69
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
That is, they are just trying to do

70
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
what they think is in their own best interest.

71
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now in order to work out what people are going to do

72
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to pursue their interests,

73
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we have to think about who has influence in the world.

74
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior,

75
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
with regard to producing pollutants,

76
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
one approach, the common approach,

77
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is to exhort them to be better,

78
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet.

79
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have

80
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
as big an effect, as perhaps you would like it to have.

81
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But if you show them that it's in their interest,

82
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
then they're responsive.

83
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So, we have to work out who influences problems.

84
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States

85
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we would like to think, may have some influence --

86
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
certainly the president in Iran has some influence --

87
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but we make a mistake if we just pay attention

88
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to the person at the top of the power ladder

89
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because that person doesn't know much about Iran,

90
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
or about energy policy,

91
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or about health care,

92
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
or about any particular policy.

93
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers.

94
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If we're talking about national security problems,

95
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
maybe it's the Secretary of State,

96
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
maybe it's the Secretary of Defense,

97
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the Director of National Intelligence,

98
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
maybe the ambassador to the United Nations, or somebody else

99
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
who they think is going to know more about the particular problem.

100
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But let's face it, the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran.

101
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran.

102
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Each of those people in turn

103
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
has advisers who advise them,

104
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
so they can advise the president.

105
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
There are lots of people shaping decisions

106
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and so if we want to predict correctly

107
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
we have to pay attention to everybody

108
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
who is trying to shape the outcome,

109
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
not just the people at the pinnacle

110
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of the decision-making pyramid.

111
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Unfortunately, a lot of times we don't do that.

112
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
There's a good reason that we don't do that,

113
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers,

114
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we can overcome the limitation

115
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of just looking at a few people.

116
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Imagine a problem with just five decision-makers.

117
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Imagine for example

118
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
that Sally over here,

119
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
wants to know what Harry, and Jane,

120
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and George and Frank are thinking,

121
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and sends messages to those people.

122
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Sally's giving her opinion to them,

123
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they're giving their opinion to Sally.

124
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But Sally also wants to know

125
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
what Harry is saying to these three,

126
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and what they're saying to Harry.

127
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And Harry wants to know

128
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
what each of those people are saying to each other, and so on,

129
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying.

130
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That's a complicated problem; that's a lot to know.

131
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
With five decision-makers

132
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
there are a lot of linkages --

133
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
120, as a matter of fact,

134
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
if you remember your factorials.

135
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Five factorial is 120.

136
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now you may be surprised to know

137
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that smart people can keep 120 things straight

138
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in their head.

139
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Suppose we double the number of influencers

140
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
from five to 10.

141
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information

142
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
we need to know, from 120 to 240?

143
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
No. How about 10 times?

144
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
To 1,200? No.

145
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We've increased it to 3.6 million.

146
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Nobody can keep that straight in their head.

147
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But computers,

148
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
they can. They don't need coffee breaks,

149
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they don't need vacations,

150
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they don't need to go to sleep at night,

151
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they don't ask for raises either.

152
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
They can keep this information straight

153
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and that means that we can process the information.

154
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it,

155
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran,

156
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and you're going to be wondering,

157
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"Why should we listen to this guy?

158
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Why should we believe what he's saying?"

159
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So I'm going to show you a factoid.

160
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency

161
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of the percentage of time

162
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that the model I'm talking about

163
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known,

164
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
when the experts who provided the data inputs

165
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
got it wrong.

166
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
That's not my claim, that's a CIA claim -- you can read it,

167
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by

168
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
H. Bradford Westerfield, Yale University Press.

169
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So, what do we need to know

170
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in order to predict?

171
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much.

172
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We do need to know who has a stake

173
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in trying to shape the outcome of a decision.

174
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We need to know what they say they want,

175
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
not what they want in their heart of hearts,

176
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
not what they think they can get,

177
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position,

178
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and we can work backwards from that

179
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making.

180
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We need to know how focused they are

181
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
on the problem at hand.

182
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
That is, how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up,

183
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate --

184
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
how big a deal is it to them?

185
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And how much clout could they bring to bear

186
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
if they chose to engage on the issue?

187
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
If we know those things

188
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody

189
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
cares about two things on any decision.

190
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
They care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to

191
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
what they are interested in as possible.

192
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
They're careerists, they also care about getting credit --

193
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
there's ego involvement,

194
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome,

195
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
or as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome.

196
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.

197
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Different people trade off

198
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
between standing by their outcome,

199
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
faithfully holding to it, going down in a blaze of glory,

200
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
or giving it up, putting their finger in the wind,

201
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position.

202
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Most people fall in between, and if we can work out where they fall

203
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
we can work out how to negotiate with them

204
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to change their behavior.

205
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So with just that little bit of input

206
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
we can work out what the choices are that people have,

207
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
what the chances are that they're willing to take,

208
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
what they're after, what they value, what they want,

209
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and what they believe about other people.

210
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You might notice what we don't need to know:

211
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
there's no history in here.

212
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
How they got to where they are

213
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
may be important in shaping the input information,

214
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but once we know where they are

215
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future.

216
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting.

217
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate.

218
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So where are we going to get this information?

219
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We can get this information

220
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
from the Internet, from The Economist,

221
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The Financial Times, The New York Times,

222
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
U.S. News and World Report, lots of sources like that,

223
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
or we can get it from asking experts

224
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
who spend their lives studying places and problems,

225
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because those experts know this information.

226
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
If they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision,

227
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
how much clout do they have,

228
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
how much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want,

229
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
are they experts? That's what it means to be an expert,

230
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know.

231
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Alright, lets turn to Iran.

232
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Let me make three important predictions --

233
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
you can check this out, time will tell.

234
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program?

235
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran?

236
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
What's its future?

237
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And everybody's best friend,

238
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him?

239
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
How are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two?

240
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You take a look at this, this is not based on statistics.

241
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future.

242
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I've taken inputs on positions and so forth,

243
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
run it through a computer model

244
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that had simulated the dynamics of interaction,

245
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and these are the simulated dynamics,

246
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the predictions about the path of policy.

247
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So you can see here on the vertical axis,

248
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I haven't shown it all the way down to zero,

249
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
there are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction,

250
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
so I've narrowed the scale.

251
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Up at the top of the axis, "Build the Bomb."

252
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
At 130, we start somewhere above 130,

253
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
between building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel

254
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
so that you could build a bomb.

255
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
That's where, according to my analyses,

256
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
the Iranians were at the beginning of this year.

257
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And then the model makes predictions down the road.

258
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
At 115 they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel

259
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to show that they know how, but they wouldn't build a weapon:

260
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
they would build a research quantity.

261
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It would achieve some national pride,

262
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
but not go ahead and build a weapon.

263
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy,

264
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which is what they say is their objective.

265
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The yellow line shows us the most likely path.

266
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The yellow line includes an analysis

267
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
of 87 decision makers in Iran,

268
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and a vast number of outside influencers

269
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior,

270
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
various players in the United States, and Egypt,

271
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and Saudi Arabia, and Russia, European Union,

272
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Japan, so on and so forth.

273
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The white line reproduces the analysis

274
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
if the international environment

275
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
just left Iran to make its own internal decisions,

276
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
under its own domestic political pressures.

277
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
That's not going to be happening,

278
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but you can see that the line comes down faster

279
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
if they're not put under international pressure,

280
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
if they're allowed to pursue their own devices.

281
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But in any event, by the end of this year,

282
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
beginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome.

283
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And that equilibrium is not what the United States would like,

284
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
but it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with,

285
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and that a lot of others can live with.

286
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride

287
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
by making enough weapons-grade fuel, through research,

288
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
so that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel,

289
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
but not enough to actually build a bomb.

290
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
How is this happening?

291
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Over here you can see this is the distribution

292
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today,

293
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
this is what that power block is predicted to be like

294
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
by the late parts of 2010, early parts of 2011.

295
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Just about nobody supports research on weapons-grade fuel today,

296
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
but by 2011 that gets to be a big block,

297
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and you put these two together, that's the controlling influence in Iran.

298
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Out here today, there are a bunch of people --

299
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Ahmadinejad for example --

300
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
who would like not only to build a bomb,

301
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but test a bomb.

302
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
That power disappears completely;

303
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
nobody supports that by 2011.

304
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
These guys are all shrinking,

305
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
the power is all drifting out here,

306
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel.

307
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran?

308
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Take a look at these guys, they're growing in power,

309
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and by the way, this was done a while ago

310
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
before the current economic crisis,

311
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and that's probably going to get steeper.

312
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran,

313
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
the bankers, the oil people, the bazaaries.

314
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
They are growing in political clout,

315
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
as the mullahs are isolating themselves --

316
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
with the exception of one group of mullahs,

317
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
who are not well known to Americans.

318
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
That's this line here, growing in power,

319
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
these are what the Iranians call the quietists.

320
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
These are the Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom,

321
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
who have great clout in the religious community,

322
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder,

323
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction,

324
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
a direction contrary

325
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
to what Khomeini had in mind.

326
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad.

327
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Two things to notice: he's getting weaker,

328
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States,

329
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
he is not a major player in Iran.

330
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
He is on the way down.

331
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
OK, so I'd like you to take a little away from this.

332
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Everything is not predictable: the stock market

333
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
is, at least for me, not predictable,

334
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
but most complicated negotiations are predictable.

335
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Again, whether we're talking health policy, education,

336
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
environment, energy,

337
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
litigation, mergers,

338
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
all of these are complicated problems

339
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that are predictable,

340
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that this sort of technology can be applied to.

341
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And the reason that being able to predict those things is important,

342
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it,

343
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
but because if you can predict what people will do,

344
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
you can engineer what they will do.

345
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And if you engineer what they do you can change the world,

346
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
you can get a better result.

347
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I would like to leave you with one thought, which is

348
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
for me, the dominant theme of this gathering,

349
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world.

350
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
When people say to you,

351
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
"That's impossible,"

352
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
you say back to them,

353
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
"When you say 'That's impossible,'

354
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
you're confused with,

355
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
'I don't know how to do it.'"

356
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Thank you.

357
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
(Applause)

358
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Chris Anderson: One question for you.

359
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
That was fascinating.

360
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I love that you put it out there.

361
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I got very nervous halfway through the talk though,

362
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
just panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that

363
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
putting this prediction out there might change the result.

364
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
We've got 800 people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks.

365
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that,

366
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community,

367
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
they've also pondered that.

368
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
It would be a good thing if

369
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
people paid more attention, took seriously,

370
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and engaged in the same sorts of calculations,

371
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
because it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways.

372
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
It would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement,

373
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time.

374
0:18:14.33,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And, it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with,

375
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
without having to manipulate them so much --

376
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
which is basically what I do, I manipulate them.

377
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
So it would be a good thing.

378
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:3,000
CA: So you're kind of trying to say, "People of Iran, this is your destiny, lets go there."

379
0:18:30.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want,

380
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and we could get there a lot sooner,

381
0:18:38.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions,

382
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end,

383
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and the world would be a better place.

384
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
CA: Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce.

385
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
BBM: Thank you.

386
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
(Applause)

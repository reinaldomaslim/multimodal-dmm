1
0:00:12.332,000 --> 0:00:14,000
"Iran is Israel's best friend,

2
0:00:14.402,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and we do not intend to change our position

3
0:00:17.111,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in relation to Tehran."

4
0:00:20.591,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Believe it or not, this is a quote

5
0:00:22.314,000 --> 0:00:24,000
from an Israeli prime minister,

6
0:00:24.513,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir

7
0:00:26.957,000 --> 0:00:28,000
from the era of the Shah.

8
0:00:29.15,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin.

9
0:00:31.568,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The year is 1987.

10
0:00:34.054,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive,

11
0:00:35.975,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and much like Ahmadinejad today,

12
0:00:37.913,000 --> 0:00:39,000
he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel.

13
0:00:40.813,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Yet, Rabin referred to Iran

14
0:00:43.692,000 --> 0:00:46,000
as a geostrategic friend.

15
0:00:46.942,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Today, when we hear the threats of war

16
0:00:49.638,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and the high rhetoric,

17
0:00:51.044,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we're oftentimes led to believe

18
0:00:52.675,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that this is yet another one of those unsolvable

19
0:00:55.958,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Middle Eastern conflicts

20
0:00:57.833,000 --> 0:01:,000
with roots as old as the region itself.

21
0:01:01.561,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Nothing could be further from the truth,

22
0:01:05.45,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and I hope today to show you why that is.

23
0:01:09.482,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people

24
0:01:11.82,000 --> 0:01:13,000
throughout history has actually been quite positive,

25
0:01:14.3,000 --> 0:01:16,000
starting in 539 B.C.,

26
0:01:16.7,000 --> 0:01:17,000
when King Cyrus the Great of Persia

27
0:01:18.589,000 --> 0:01:21,000
liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity.

28
0:01:22.283,000 --> 0:01:24,000
A third of the Jewish population

29
0:01:24.754,000 --> 0:01:25,000
stayed in Babylonia.

30
0:01:26.32,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They're today's Iraqi Jews.

31
0:01:28.57,000 --> 0:01:31,000
A third migrated to Persia.

32
0:01:31.676,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They're today's Iranian Jews,

33
0:01:33.752,000 --> 0:01:36,000
still 25,000 of them living in Iran,

34
0:01:36.783,000 --> 0:01:37,000
making them the largest Jewish community

35
0:01:38.695,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in the Middle East outside of Israel itself.

36
0:01:41.943,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And a third returned to historic Palestine,

37
0:01:44.574,000 --> 0:01:47,000
did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,

38
0:01:47.625,000 --> 0:01:52,000
financed, incidentally, by Persian tax money.

39
0:01:52.774,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But even in modern times,

40
0:01:54.86,000 --> 0:01:56,000
relations have been close at times.

41
0:01:57.305,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Rabin's statement was a reflection

42
0:02:00.106,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of decades of security and intelligence collaboration

43
0:02:04.064,000 --> 0:02:06,000
between the two, which in turn

44
0:02:06.6,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was born out of perception of common threats.

45
0:02:10.597,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Both states feared the Soviet Union

46
0:02:13.412,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq.

47
0:02:18.559,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And, in addition, the Israeli doctrine of the periphery,

48
0:02:22.8,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the idea that Israel's security was best achieved

49
0:02:26.092,000 --> 0:02:3,000
by creating alliances with the non-Arab states

50
0:02:30.17,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in the periphery of the region

51
0:02:32.076,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity.

52
0:02:36.965,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, from the Shah's perspective, though,

53
0:02:39.433,000 --> 0:02:42,000
he wanted to keep this as secret as possible,

54
0:02:43.087,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance,

55
0:02:45.335,000 --> 0:02:46,000
traveled to Iran in the '70s,

56
0:02:47.227,000 --> 0:02:48,000
he usually wore a wig

57
0:02:48.675,000 --> 0:02:5,000
so that no one would recognize him.

58
0:02:51.086,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The Iranians built a special tarmac

59
0:02:53.521,000 --> 0:02:56,000
at the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal,

60
0:02:56.773,000 --> 0:02:58,000
so that no one would notice the large number

61
0:02:59.078,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran.

62
0:03:04.499,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, did all of this end with the Islamic revolution

63
0:03:07.686,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in 1979?

64
0:03:10.639,000 --> 0:03:13,000
In spite of the very clear anti-Israeli ideology

65
0:03:13.706,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of the new regime, the geopolitical logic

66
0:03:17.099,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for their collaboration lived on,

67
0:03:19.703,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because they still had common threats.

68
0:03:22.515,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980,

69
0:03:25.544,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Israel feared an Iraqi victory

70
0:03:28.034,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and actively helped Iran by selling it arms

71
0:03:30.785,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and providing it with spare parts

72
0:03:33.037,000 --> 0:03:35,000
for Iran's American weaponry

73
0:03:35.197,000 --> 0:03:38,000
at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable

74
0:03:38.913,000 --> 0:03:4,000
because of an American arms embargo

75
0:03:41.415,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that Israel was more than happy to violate.

76
0:03:44.403,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In fact, back in the 1980s,

77
0:03:47.161,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it was Israel that lobbied Washington

78
0:03:49.97,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran,

79
0:03:54.079,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and not pay attention to Iran's anti-Israeli ideology.

80
0:03:59.703,000 --> 0:04:,000
And this, of course, climaxed

81
0:04:01.642,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.

82
0:04:06.293,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But with the end of the Cold War

83
0:04:08.293,000 --> 0:04:12,000
came also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace.

84
0:04:12.731,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Suddenly, the two common threats

85
0:04:15.091,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that had pushed them closer together throughout decades,

86
0:04:18.144,000 --> 0:04:2,000
more or less evaporated.

87
0:04:20.59,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The Soviet Union collapsed,

88
0:04:22.552,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Iraq was defeated,

89
0:04:24.244,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and a new environment was created in the region

90
0:04:26.325,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in which both of them felt more secure,

91
0:04:28.665,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but they were also now left unchecked.

92
0:04:31.585,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Without Iraq balancing Iran,

93
0:04:34.7,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Iran could now become a threat,

94
0:04:36.878,000 --> 0:04:38,000
some in Israel argued.

95
0:04:39.41,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In fact, the current dynamic

96
0:04:42.355,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that you see between Iran and Israel

97
0:04:44.447,000 --> 0:04:46,000
has its roots more so

98
0:04:46.542,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region

99
0:04:49.195,000 --> 0:04:5,000
after the Cold War

100
0:04:50.984,000 --> 0:04:52,000
than in the events of 1979,

101
0:04:53.484,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because at this point, Iran and Israel

102
0:04:56.181,000 --> 0:04:59,000
emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region,

103
0:05:00.069,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and rather than viewing each other

104
0:05:01.312,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as potential security partners,

105
0:05:03.788,000 --> 0:05:05,000
they increasingly came to view each other

106
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
as rivals and competitors.

107
0:05:09.558,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So Israel, who in the 1980s

108
0:05:11.359,000 --> 0:05:14,000
lobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations

109
0:05:14.884,000 --> 0:05:17,000
now feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement,

110
0:05:18.267,000 --> 0:05:19,000
thinking that it would come

111
0:05:19.561,000 --> 0:05:22,000
at Israel's security interests' expense,

112
0:05:23.223,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and instead sought to put Iran

113
0:05:25.355,000 --> 0:05:27,000
in increased isolation.

114
0:05:27.889,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Ironically, this was happening at a time

115
0:05:30.817,000 --> 0:05:32,000
when Iran was more interested

116
0:05:32.884,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in peacemaking with Washington

117
0:05:35.034,000 --> 0:05:38,000
than to see to Israel's destruction.

118
0:05:38.469,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Iran had put itself in isolation

119
0:05:40.309,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because of its radicalism,

120
0:05:42.176,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and after having helped the United States indirectly

121
0:05:45.095,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in the war against Iraq in 1991,

122
0:05:47.367,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the Iranians were hoping

123
0:05:49.323,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that they would be rewarded by being included

124
0:05:53.225,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in the post-war security architecture of the region.

125
0:05:57.955,000 --> 0:06:,000
But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach,

126
0:06:01.507,000 --> 0:06:03,000
as it would a decade later in Afghanistan,

127
0:06:03.943,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation,

128
0:06:08.138,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and it is at this point, around 1993, '94,

129
0:06:11.372,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that Iran begins to translate

130
0:06:14.084,000 --> 0:06:16,000
its anti-Israeli ideology

131
0:06:16.311,000 --> 0:06:18,000
into operational policy.

132
0:06:18.706,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The Iranians believed that whatever they did,

133
0:06:20.985,000 --> 0:06:22,000
even if they moderated their policies,

134
0:06:23.295,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation,

135
0:06:26.597,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and the only way Iran could compel Washington

136
0:06:30.251,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to change its position was by imposing a cost

137
0:06:33.547,000 --> 0:06:36,000
on the U.S. if it didn't.

138
0:06:36.86,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The easiest target was the peace process,

139
0:06:40.95,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and now the Iranian ideological bark

140
0:06:43.327,000 --> 0:06:47,000
was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite,

141
0:06:47.566,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and Iran began supporting extensively

142
0:06:51.543,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously

143
0:06:54.242,000 --> 0:06:57,000
had shunned.

144
0:06:57.633,000 --> 0:07:,000
In some ways, this sounds paradoxical,

145
0:07:00.848,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but according to Martin Indyk

146
0:07:02.968,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of the Clinton administration,

147
0:07:04.841,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong,

148
0:07:07.74,000 --> 0:07:08,000
because the more peace there would be

149
0:07:09.281,000 --> 0:07:11,000
between Israel and Palestine,

150
0:07:11.444,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the U.S. believed, the more Iran would get isolated.

151
0:07:14.807,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be.

152
0:07:17.943,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So according to Indyk, and these are his words,

153
0:07:20.391,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the Iranians had an interest to do us in

154
0:07:23.579,000 --> 0:07:24,000
on the peace process

155
0:07:25.246,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in order to defeat our policy of containment.

156
0:07:28.958,000 --> 0:07:3,000
To defeat our policy of containment,

157
0:07:31.324,000 --> 0:07:34,000
not about ideology.

158
0:07:35.31,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement,

159
0:07:39.015,000 --> 0:07:42,000
all sides have reached out to each other.

160
0:07:42.278,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Netanyahu, when he got elected in 1996,

161
0:07:45.547,000 --> 0:07:46,000
reached out to the Iranians to see

162
0:07:47.343,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if there were any ways that

163
0:07:49.046,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected.

164
0:07:52.235,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Tehran was not interested.

165
0:07:54.705,000 --> 0:07:56,000
A few years later, the Iranians sent

166
0:07:57.67,000 --> 0:08:,000
a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration,

167
0:08:01.129,000 --> 0:08:05,000
a proposal that revealed that there was some potential

168
0:08:05.137,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again.

169
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The Bush administration did not even respond.

170
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
All sides have never missed an opportunity

171
0:08:15.08,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to miss an opportunity.

172
0:08:20.897,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But this is not an ancient conflict.

173
0:08:25.569,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This is not even an ideological conflict.

174
0:08:28.528,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The ebbs and flows of hostility

175
0:08:31.322,000 --> 0:08:34,000
have not shifted with ideological zeal,

176
0:08:34.598,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape.

177
0:08:37.2,000 --> 0:08:39,000
When Iran and Israel's security imperatives

178
0:08:39.531,000 --> 0:08:41,000
dictated collaboration, they did so

179
0:08:42.233,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other.

180
0:08:45.809,000 --> 0:08:47,000
When Iran's ideological impulses collided

181
0:08:48.725,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with its strategic interests,

182
0:08:50.955,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the strategic interests always prevailed.

183
0:08:54.618,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This is good news, because it means

184
0:08:57.611,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that neither war nor enmity

185
0:09:00.197,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is a foregone conclusion.

186
0:09:03.867,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But some want war.

187
0:09:06.422,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Some believe or say that it's 1938,

188
0:09:09.626,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Iran is Germany,

189
0:09:11.538,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and Ahmadinejad is Hitler.

190
0:09:14.704,000 --> 0:09:15,000
If we accept this to be true,

191
0:09:16.569,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that indeed it is 1938, Iran is Germany,

192
0:09:19.921,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Ahmadinejad is Hitler,

193
0:09:22.328,000 --> 0:09:24,000
then the question we have to ask ourself is,

194
0:09:25.163,000 --> 0:09:28,000
who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain?

195
0:09:28.976,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Who will risk peace?

196
0:09:31.842,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed

197
0:09:34.456,000 --> 0:09:36,000
at eliminating diplomacy,

198
0:09:37.216,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and when you eliminate diplomacy,

199
0:09:39.628,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you make war inevitable.

200
0:09:42.717,000 --> 0:09:45,000
In an ideological conflict, there can be no truce,

201
0:09:45.832,000 --> 0:09:47,000
no draw, no compromise,

202
0:09:47.997,000 --> 0:09:5,000
only victory or defeat.

203
0:09:51.279,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But rather than making war inevitable

204
0:09:54.469,000 --> 0:09:57,000
by viewing this as ideological,

205
0:09:57.673,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we would be wise to seek ways

206
0:09:59.712,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to make peace possible.

207
0:10:02.7,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon,

208
0:10:06.196,000 --> 0:10:07,000
only a few decades old

209
0:10:08.186,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in a history of 2,500 years,

210
0:10:10.812,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and precisely because its roots are geopolitical,

211
0:10:14.799,000 --> 0:10:16,000
it means that solutions can be found,

212
0:10:17.639,000 --> 0:10:19,000
compromises can be struck,

213
0:10:20.326,000 --> 0:10:22,000
however difficult it yet may be.

214
0:10:23.145,000 --> 0:10:26,000
After all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said,

215
0:10:27.137,000 --> 0:10:29,000
"You don't make peace with your friends.

216
0:10:30.123,000 --> 0:10:32,000
You make it with your enemies."

217
0:10:32.503,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Thank you.

218
0:10:33.938,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.984,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is my favorite protest shirt.

3
0:00:15.897,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It says, "Protect your people."

4
0:00:18.127,000 --> 0:00:2,000
We made it in the basement of our community center.

5
0:00:21.42,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've worn it at rallies,

6
0:00:23.768,000 --> 0:00:26,000
at protests and marches,

7
0:00:26.824,000 --> 0:00:27,000
at candlelight vigils

8
0:00:28.665,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with families who have lost loved ones to police violence.

9
0:00:32.674,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've seen how this ethic of community organizing

10
0:00:36.412,000 --> 0:00:38,000
has been able to change arresting practices,

11
0:00:39.332,000 --> 0:00:42,000
hold individual officers accountable

12
0:00:42.458,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and allow families to feel strong and supported

13
0:00:45.839,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in the darkest moments of their lives.

14
0:00:49.022,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But when a family would come to our center

15
0:00:51.736,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and say, "My loved one got arrested, what can we do?"

16
0:00:55.895,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we didn't know how to translate

17
0:00:57.935,000 --> 0:01:,000
the power of community organizing that we saw on the streets

18
0:01:01.617,000 --> 0:01:02,000
into the courts.

19
0:01:03.652,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We figured we're not lawyers,

20
0:01:05.348,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and so that's not our arena to make change.

21
0:01:09.017,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And so despite our belief in collective action,

22
0:01:12.208,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we would allow people that we cared about

23
0:01:15.224,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to go to court alone.

24
0:01:18.335,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Nine out of ten times -- and this is true nationally --

25
0:01:22.494,000 --> 0:01:23,000
they couldn't afford their own attorney,

26
0:01:24.434,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and so they'd have a public defender, who is doing heroic work,

27
0:01:28.331,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but was often under-resourced

28
0:01:31.15,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and stretched bare with too many cases.

29
0:01:33.903,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They would face prosecutors aiming for high conviction rates,

30
0:01:37.855,000 --> 0:01:39,000
mandatory minimum sentences

31
0:01:40.252,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and racial bias baked into every stage of the process.

32
0:01:46.1,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And so, facing those odds,

33
0:01:48.195,000 --> 0:01:51,000
stripped away from the power of community,

34
0:01:51.441,000 --> 0:01:53,000
unsure how to navigate the courts,

35
0:01:53.981,000 --> 0:01:56,000
over 90 percent of people that face a criminal charge in this country

36
0:01:57.803,000 --> 0:01:58,000
will take a plea deal.

37
0:02:00.096,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Meaning, they'll never have their fabled day in court

38
0:02:03.541,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that we talk about in television shows and in movies.

39
0:02:07.807,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And this is the untold part of the story of mass incarceration in America --

40
0:02:13.776,000 --> 0:02:16,000
how we became the largest jailer in the world.

41
0:02:17.623,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Over two million people currently incarcerated in this country.

42
0:02:21.726,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And projections that say

43
0:02:23.345,000 --> 0:02:27,000
one out of three black men will see the inside of a prison cell

44
0:02:27.386,000 --> 0:02:3,000
at some point in their life on this trajectory.

45
0:02:32.546,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But we have a solution.

46
0:02:34.928,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We decided to be irreverent to this idea

47
0:02:38.008,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that only lawyers can impact the courts.

48
0:02:41.587,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And to penetrate the judicial system

49
0:02:44.014,000 --> 0:02:49,000
with the power, intellect and ingenuity of community organizing.

50
0:02:50.569,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We call the approach "participatory defense."

51
0:02:54.286,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's a methodology for families and communities

52
0:02:57.191,000 --> 0:02:59,000
whose loved ones are facing charges,

53
0:02:59.507,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and how they could impact the outcome of those cases

54
0:03:02.334,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and transform the landscape of power in the courts.

55
0:03:06.859,000 --> 0:03:07,000
How it works is,

56
0:03:08.049,000 --> 0:03:1,000
families whose loved ones are facing criminal charges

57
0:03:10.803,000 --> 0:03:12,000
will come to a weekly meeting,

58
0:03:12.962,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and it's half support group,

59
0:03:14.784,000 --> 0:03:16,000
half strategic planning session.

60
0:03:17.823,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And they'll build a community

61
0:03:19.693,000 --> 0:03:23,000
out of what otherwise would be an isolating and lonely experience.

62
0:03:24.755,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And they'll sit in a circle,

63
0:03:27.089,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and write the names of their loved ones on a board,

64
0:03:29.771,000 --> 0:03:3,000
who they're there to support.

65
0:03:31.644,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And collectively,

66
0:03:32.878,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the group will find out ways to tangibly and tactfully

67
0:03:37.038,000 --> 0:03:38,000
impact the outcome of that case.

68
0:03:39.569,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They'll review police reports to find out inconsistencies;

69
0:03:43.514,000 --> 0:03:45,000
they'll find areas that require

70
0:03:45.695,000 --> 0:03:47,000
more investigation by the defense attorney;

71
0:03:48.237,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and they'll go to court with each other,

72
0:03:50.18,000 --> 0:03:51,000
for the emotional support

73
0:03:52.188,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but also so that the judge knows that the person standing before them

74
0:03:56.593,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is part of a larger community

75
0:03:58.31,000 --> 0:04:,000
that is invested in their well-being and success.

76
0:04:02.538,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And the results have been remarkable.

77
0:04:05.506,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We've seen charges get dismissed,

78
0:04:08.522,000 --> 0:04:1,000
sentences significantly reduced,

79
0:04:11.371,000 --> 0:04:12,000
acquittals won at trial

80
0:04:14.561,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and, sometimes, it has been literally lifesaving.

81
0:04:18.45,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Like in the case of Ramon Vasquez.

82
0:04:21.235,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Father of two, family man, truck driver

83
0:04:26.784,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and someone who was wrongfully charged with a gang-related murder

84
0:04:30.055,000 --> 0:04:31,000
he was totally innocent of,

85
0:04:31.872,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but was facing a life sentence.

86
0:04:35.172,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Ramon's family came to those meetings

87
0:04:37.387,000 --> 0:04:39,000
shortly after his arrest and his detention,

88
0:04:40.299,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and they worked the model.

89
0:04:42.268,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And through their hard work,

90
0:04:43.808,000 --> 0:04:45,000
they found major contradictions in the case,

91
0:04:47.121,000 --> 0:04:49,000
gaping holes in the investigation.

92
0:04:49.677,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And were able to disprove dangerous assumptions by the detectives.

93
0:04:54.836,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Like that the red hat that they found when they raided his home

94
0:04:58.689,000 --> 0:05:01,000
somehow affiliated him to a gang lifestyle.

95
0:05:03.149,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Through their photos and their records,

96
0:05:06.022,000 --> 0:05:1,000
they were able to prove that the red hat was from his son's Little League team

97
0:05:10.663,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that Ramon coached on the weekends.

98
0:05:14.107,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And they produced independent information

99
0:05:16.267,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that proved that Ramon was on the other side of town

100
0:05:19.133,000 --> 0:05:21,000
at the time of the alleged incident,

101
0:05:21.506,000 --> 0:05:22,000
through their phone records

102
0:05:22.927,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and receipts from the stores that they attended.

103
0:05:26.593,000 --> 0:05:29,000
After seven long months of hard work from the family,

104
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Ramon staying strong inside jail,

105
0:05:33.315,000 --> 0:05:35,000
they were able to get the charge dismissed.

106
0:05:37.053,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And they brought Ramon home

107
0:05:38.736,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to live the life that he should have been living all along.

108
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And with each new case,

109
0:05:43.657,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the families identified new ways to flex the knowledge of the community

110
0:05:48.125,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to have impact on the court system.

111
0:05:51.506,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We would go to a lot of sentencing hearings.

112
0:05:54.347,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And when we would leave the sentencing hearing,

113
0:05:56.718,000 --> 0:05:57,000
on the walk back to the parking lot

114
0:05:58.641,000 --> 0:06:01,000
after someone's loved one just got sent to prison,

115
0:06:01.998,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the most common refrain we would hear

116
0:06:04.657,000 --> 0:06:07,000
wasn't so much, "I hate that judge,"

117
0:06:07.807,000 --> 0:06:09,000
or "I wish we had a new lawyer."

118
0:06:11.268,000 --> 0:06:13,000
What they would say was,

119
0:06:13.411,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"I wish they knew him like we know him."

120
0:06:17.188,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And so we developed tools and vehicles

121
0:06:19.958,000 --> 0:06:22,000
for families to tell the fuller story of their loved one

122
0:06:22.982,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so they would be understood as more than just a case file.

123
0:06:26.36,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They started making what we call social biography packets,

124
0:06:29.63,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which is families making a compilation of photos and certificates and letters

125
0:06:34.201,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that show past challenges and hardships and accomplishments,

126
0:06:37.954,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and future prospects and opportunities.

127
0:06:41.025,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And the social biography [packets] were working so well in the courts,

128
0:06:45.406,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that we evolved it into social biography videos.

129
0:06:48.749,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Ten-minute mini documentaries,

130
0:06:51.09,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which were interviews of people in their homes,

131
0:06:53.814,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and at their churches and at their workplace,

132
0:06:56.257,000 --> 0:06:59,000
explaining who the person was in the backdrop of their lives.

133
0:07:00.578,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And it was a way for us to dissolve the walls of the court temporarily.

134
0:07:06.221,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And through the power of video,

135
0:07:08.443,000 --> 0:07:12,000
bring the judge out of the court and into the community,

136
0:07:12.858,000 --> 0:07:16,000
so that they would be able to understand the fuller context of someone's life

137
0:07:17.112,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that they're deciding the fate of.

138
0:07:21.046,000 --> 0:07:25,000
One of the first social biography projects that came out of our camp

139
0:07:25.18,000 --> 0:07:26,000
was by Carnell.

140
0:07:26.665,000 --> 0:07:27,000
He had come to the meetings

141
0:07:27.982,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because he had pled to a low-level drug charge.

142
0:07:30.585,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And after years of sobriety,

143
0:07:32.427,000 --> 0:07:34,000
got arrested for this one drug possession charge.

144
0:07:35.18,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But he was facing a five-year prison sentence

145
0:07:37.53,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because of the sentencing schemes in California.

146
0:07:40.974,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We knew him primarily as a dad.

147
0:07:43.204,000 --> 0:07:44,000
He'd bring his daughters to the meetings

148
0:07:45.148,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and then play with them at the park across the street.

149
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And he said, "Look, I could do the time,

150
0:07:50.427,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but if I go in, they're going to take my girls."

151
0:07:54.927,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And so we gave him a camera

152
0:07:56.688,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and said, "Just take pictures of what's like being a father."

153
0:08:00.758,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And so he took pictures of making breakfast for his daughters

154
0:08:04.94,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and taking them to school,

155
0:08:06.48,000 --> 0:08:08,000
taking them to after-school programs and doing homework.

156
0:08:09.863,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And it became this photo essay

157
0:08:11.974,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that he turned in to his lawyer who used it at the sentencing hearing.

158
0:08:16.077,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And that judge, who originally indicated a five-year prison sentence,

159
0:08:20.299,000 --> 0:08:22,000
understood Carnell in a whole new way.

160
0:08:23.466,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And he converted that five-year prison sentence

161
0:08:26.863,000 --> 0:08:29,000
into a six-month outpatient program,

162
0:08:30.076,000 --> 0:08:32,000
so that Carnell could be with his daughters.

163
0:08:32.663,000 --> 0:08:34,000
His girls would have a father in their life.

164
0:08:34.798,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And Carnell could get the treatment that he was actually seeking.

165
0:08:39.688,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We have one ceremony of sorts

166
0:08:43.125,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that we use in participatory defense.

167
0:08:45.585,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And I told you earlier that when families come to the meetings,

168
0:08:48.594,000 --> 0:08:5,000
they write the names of their loved ones on the board.

169
0:08:51.157,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Those are names that we all get to know, week in, week out,

170
0:08:53.967,000 --> 0:08:54,000
through the stories of the family,

171
0:08:55.657,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and we're rooting for and praying for and hoping for.

172
0:08:59.466,000 --> 0:09:,000
And when we win a case,

173
0:09:01.022,000 --> 0:09:04,000
when we get a sentence reduced, or a charge dropped,

174
0:09:04.982,000 --> 0:09:06,000
or we win an acquittal,

175
0:09:07.046,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that person, who's been a name on the board,

176
0:09:09.569,000 --> 0:09:1,000
comes to the meeting.

177
0:09:11.776,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And when their name comes up,

178
0:09:14.141,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they're given an eraser,

179
0:09:15.998,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and they walk over to the board

180
0:09:18.292,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and they erase their name.

181
0:09:20.799,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And it sounds simple, but it is a spiritual experience.

182
0:09:25.42,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And people are applauding, and they're crying.

183
0:09:29.277,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And for the families that are just starting that journey

184
0:09:31.927,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and are sitting in the back of the room,

185
0:09:34.196,000 --> 0:09:36,000
for them to know that there's a finish line,

186
0:09:36.411,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that one day, they too might be able to bring their loved one home,

187
0:09:39.998,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that they could erase the name,

188
0:09:42.307,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is profoundly inspiring.

189
0:09:46.466,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We're training organizations all over the country now

190
0:09:48.974,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in participatory defense.

191
0:09:50.746,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And we have a national network of over 20 cities.

192
0:09:54.032,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And it's a church in Pennsylvania,

193
0:09:56.643,000 --> 0:09:59,000
it's a parents' association in Tennessee,

194
0:09:59.912,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it's a youth center in Los Angeles.

195
0:10:02.614,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And the latest city that we just added to the national network

196
0:10:05.994,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to grow and deepen this practice

197
0:10:08.17,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is Philadelphia.

198
0:10:10.066,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They literally just started their first weekly participatory defense meeting

199
0:10:14.235,000 --> 0:10:15,000
last week.

200
0:10:16.465,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And the person that we brought from California to Philadelphia

201
0:10:21.14,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to share their testimony, to inspire them to know what's possible,

202
0:10:25.339,000 --> 0:10:26,000
was Ramon Vasquez,

203
0:10:27.673,000 --> 0:10:3,000
who went from sitting in a jail in Santa Clara County, California,

204
0:10:31.45,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to inspiring a community about what's possible

205
0:10:33.704,000 --> 0:10:36,000
through the perseverance of community across the country.

206
0:10:39.145,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And with all the hubs, we still use one metric that we invented.

207
0:10:44.676,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's called time saved.

208
0:10:45.915,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's a saying that we actually still say at weekly meetings.

209
0:10:48.879,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And what we say when a family comes in a meeting for the first time is:

210
0:10:52.585,000 --> 0:10:54,000
if you do nothing,

211
0:10:54.911,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the system is designed to give your loved one time served.

212
0:10:58.681,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That's the language the system uses to quantify time of incarceration.

213
0:11:04.07,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But if you engage, if you participate,

214
0:11:07.831,000 --> 0:11:1,000
you can turn time served into time saved.

215
0:11:12.061,000 --> 0:11:15,000
That's them home with you, living the life they should be living.

216
0:11:16.166,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So, Carnell, for example, would represent five years of time saved.

217
0:11:21.277,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So when we totaled our time saved numbers

218
0:11:24.062,000 --> 0:11:26,000
from all the different participatory defense hubs,

219
0:11:26.585,000 --> 0:11:28,000
through the work in the meetings and at court

220
0:11:29.458,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and making social biography videos and packets,

221
0:11:33.387,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we had 4,218 years of time saved from incarceration.

222
0:11:40.601,000 --> 0:11:43,000
That is parents' and children's lives.

223
0:11:44.212,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Young people going to college instead of prison.

224
0:11:46.966,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We're ending generational cycles of suffering.

225
0:11:51.042,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And when you consider in my home state of California,

226
0:11:56.43,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it costs 60,000 dollars to house someone in the California prison system,

227
0:12:02.585,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that means that these families are saving their states

228
0:12:07.363,000 --> 0:12:08,000
a ton of money.

229
0:12:08.99,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I'm not a mathematician, I haven't done the numbers,

230
0:12:11.87,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but that is money and resources that could be reallocated

231
0:12:15.231,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to mental health services,

232
0:12:17.54,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to drug treatment programs, to education.

233
0:12:22.016,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And we're now wearing this shirt in courts

234
0:12:26.593,000 --> 0:12:27,000
all across the country.

235
0:12:28.347,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And people are wearing this shirt

236
0:12:30.11,000 --> 0:12:34,000
because they want the immediacy of protecting their people

237
0:12:34.347,000 --> 0:12:35,000
in the courtroom.

238
0:12:36.407,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But what we're telling them is,

239
0:12:37.976,000 --> 0:12:4,000
as practitioners, they're building a new field,

240
0:12:41.749,000 --> 0:12:42,000
a new movement

241
0:12:43.575,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that is going to forever change the way justice is understood in this country.

242
0:12:48.683,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Thank you.

243
0:12:49.858,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Applause)

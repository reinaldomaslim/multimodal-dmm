0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's really quite an honor to be here tonight,

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened

4
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because I've really been inspired.

5
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight

6
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that are, literally, world premieres.

7
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I've been working on my new record

8
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I've never played these songs for anybody

9
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
except the microphone.

10
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This is a song that I wrote

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
about the meaning of technology,

12
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which goes perfectly with this gathering.

13
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I started thinking about -- when I was in college,

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
especially as a blind person,

15
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
doing a research paper was a major undertaking.

16
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
You had to go to the library,

17
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
see if you could get them to find the books for you,

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you know, footnotes and all that.

19
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up.

20
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I wish I had that when I was in college.

21
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Anyway, this is a song about:

22
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's called "All the Answers."

24
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000

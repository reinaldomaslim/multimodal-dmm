1
0:00:13.809,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Yogi Berra, a US baseball player and philosopher, said,

2
0:00:18.72,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"If we don't know where we're going, we might not get there."

3
0:00:23.525,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Accumulating scientific knowledge is giving us greater insights,

4
0:00:27.595,000 --> 0:00:32,000
greater clarity, into what our future might look like in a changing climate

5
0:00:32.791,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and what that could mean for our health.

6
0:00:35.714,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm here to talk about a related aspect,

7
0:00:39.443,000 --> 0:00:43,000
on how our emissions of greenhouse gases from burning of fossil fuels

8
0:00:44.129,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is reducing the nutritional quality of our food.

9
0:00:49.011,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We'll start with the food pyramid.

10
0:00:51.174,000 --> 0:00:52,000
You all know the food pyramid.

11
0:00:53.348,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We all need to eat a balanced diet.

12
0:00:55.81,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We need to get proteins,

13
0:00:57.351,000 --> 0:00:58,000
we need to get micronutrients,

14
0:00:59.086,000 --> 0:01:,000
we need to get vitamins.

15
0:01:00.418,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And so, this is a way for us to think about

16
0:01:03.172,000 --> 0:01:05,000
how to make sure we get what we need every day

17
0:01:06.19,000 --> 0:01:08,000
so we can grow and thrive.

18
0:01:08.332,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But we eat not just because we need to,

19
0:01:10.941,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we also eat for enjoyment.

20
0:01:12.905,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Bread, pasta, pizza --

21
0:01:15.532,000 --> 0:01:19,000
there's a whole range of foods that are culturally important.

22
0:01:19.637,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We enjoy eating these.

23
0:01:22.088,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And so they're important for our diet,

24
0:01:24.503,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but they're also important for our cultures.

25
0:01:27.757,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Carbon dioxide has been increasing since the start of the Industrial Revolution,

26
0:01:33.285,000 --> 0:01:38,000
increasing from about 280 parts per million to over 410 today,

27
0:01:38.671,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and it continues to increase.

28
0:01:40.938,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The carbon that plants need to grow comes from this carbon dioxide.

29
0:01:45.388,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They bring it into the plant,

30
0:01:46.874,000 --> 0:01:49,000
they break it apart into the carbon itself,

31
0:01:50.145,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and they use that to grow.

32
0:01:52.542,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They also need nutrients from the soil.

33
0:01:56.166,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And so yes, carbon dioxide is plant food.

34
0:02:01.186,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And this should be good news, of rising carbon dioxide concentrations,

35
0:02:06.176,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for food security around the world,

36
0:02:09.156,000 --> 0:02:12,000
making sure that people get enough to eat every day.

37
0:02:13.466,000 --> 0:02:18,000
About 820 million people in the world don't get enough to eat every day.

38
0:02:19.09,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So there's a fair amount written about how higher CO2

39
0:02:22.716,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is going to help with our food security problem.

40
0:02:25.511,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We need to accelerate our progress in agricultural productivity

41
0:02:30.617,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to feed the nine to 10 billion people who will be alive in 2050

42
0:02:35.476,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,

43
0:02:38.021,000 --> 0:02:39,000
particularly the Goal Number 2,

44
0:02:39.783,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that is on reducing food insecurity,

45
0:02:42.963,000 --> 0:02:43,000
increasing nutrition,

46
0:02:44.511,000 --> 0:02:47,000
increasing access to the foods that we need for everyone.

47
0:02:48.195,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We know that climate change is affecting agricultural productivity.

48
0:02:52.959,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The earth has warmed about one degree centigrade

49
0:02:55.389,000 --> 0:02:57,000
since preindustrial times.

50
0:02:57.704,000 --> 0:03:,000
That is changing local temperature and precipitation patterns,

51
0:03:01.537,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and that has consequences for the agricultural productivity

52
0:03:05.995,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in many parts of the world.

53
0:03:08.292,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And it's not just local changes in temperature and precipitation,

54
0:03:11.607,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it's the extremes.

55
0:03:13.553,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Extremes in terms of heat waves, floods and droughts

56
0:03:17.248,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are significantly affecting productivity.

57
0:03:22.677,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And that carbon dioxide,

58
0:03:25.037,000 --> 0:03:27,000
besides making plants grow,

59
0:03:28.018,000 --> 0:03:3,000
has other consequences as well,

60
0:03:30.819,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that plants, when they have higher carbon dioxide,

61
0:03:33.909,000 --> 0:03:37,000
increase the synthesis of carbohydrates, sugars and starches,

62
0:03:37.978,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and they decrease the concentrations of protein and critical nutrients.

63
0:03:43.262,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And this is very important for how we think about food security going forward.

64
0:03:50.532,000 --> 0:03:53,000
A couple of nights ago in the table talks on climate change,

65
0:03:54.462,000 --> 0:03:57,000
someone said that they're a five-sevenths optimist:

66
0:03:58.451,000 --> 0:04:,000
that they're an optimist five days of the week,

67
0:04:01.306,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and this is a topic for the other two days.

68
0:04:05.227,000 --> 0:04:07,000
When we think about micronutrients,

69
0:04:07.41,000 --> 0:04:11,000
almost all of them are affected by higher CO2 concentrations.

70
0:04:11.851,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Two in particular are iron and zinc.

71
0:04:14.284,000 --> 0:04:18,000
When you don't have enough iron, you can develop iron deficiency anemia.

72
0:04:18.315,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's associated with fatigue, shortness of breath

73
0:04:21.393,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and some fairly serious consequences as well.

74
0:04:24.75,000 --> 0:04:25,000
When you don't have enough zinc,

75
0:04:26.49,000 --> 0:04:28,000
you can have a loss of appetite.

76
0:04:29.045,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It is a significant problem around the world.

77
0:04:31.196,000 --> 0:04:34,000
There's about one billion people who are zinc deficient.

78
0:04:34.295,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's very important for maternal and child health.

79
0:04:37.259,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It affects development.

80
0:04:39.788,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The B vitamins are critical for a whole range of reasons.

81
0:04:43.629,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They help convert our food into energy.

82
0:04:46.647,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They're important for the functions

83
0:04:48.389,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of many of the physiologic activities in our bodies.

84
0:04:51.984,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And when you have higher carbon in a plant,

85
0:04:54.712,000 --> 0:04:55,000
you have less nitrogen,

86
0:04:56.394,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and you have less B vitamins.

87
0:04:58.731,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And it's not just us.

88
0:05:00.319,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Cattle are already being affected

89
0:05:02.082,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because the quality of their forage is declining.

90
0:05:05.728,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In fact, this affects every consumer of plants.

91
0:05:09.213,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And give a thought to, for example, our pet cats and dogs.

92
0:05:13.109,000 --> 0:05:16,000
If you look on the label of most of the pet and dog food,

93
0:05:16.601,000 --> 0:05:2,000
there's a significant amount of grain in those foods.

94
0:05:21.27,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So this affects everyone.

95
0:05:23.381,000 --> 0:05:25,000
How do we know that this is a problem?

96
0:05:25.711,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We know from field studies

97
0:05:27.612,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we know from experimental studies in laboratories.

98
0:05:30.967,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In the field studies --

99
0:05:32.471,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and I'll focus primarily on wheat and on rice --

100
0:05:36.94,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there's fields, for example, of rice

101
0:05:39.37,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that are divided into different plots.

102
0:05:42.46,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And the plots are all the same:

103
0:05:44.588,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the soil's the same,

104
0:05:46.483,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the precipitation's the same --

105
0:05:48.216,000 --> 0:05:49,000
everything's the same.

106
0:05:50.176,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Except carbon dioxide is blown over some of the plots.

107
0:05:54.637,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And so you can compare

108
0:05:57.082,000 --> 0:06:,000
what it looks like under today's conditions

109
0:06:00.376,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and under carbon dioxide conditions later in the century.

110
0:06:05.032,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I was part of one of the few studies that have done this.

111
0:06:08.121,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We looked at 18 rice lines in China and in Japan

112
0:06:12.716,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and grew them under conditions that you would expect

113
0:06:15.562,000 --> 0:06:16,000
later in the century.

114
0:06:19.185,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And when you look at the results,

115
0:06:21.257,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the white bar is today's conditions,

116
0:06:24.373,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the red bar is conditions later in the century.

117
0:06:28.741,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So protein declines about 10 percent,

118
0:06:32.759,000 --> 0:06:35,000
iron about eight percent, zinc about five percent.

119
0:06:37.404,000 --> 0:06:39,000
These don't sound like really big changes,

120
0:06:39.974,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but when you start thinking about the poor in every country

121
0:06:43.902,000 --> 0:06:45,000
who primarily eat starch,

122
0:06:46.371,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that this will put people who are on the edge

123
0:06:49.321,000 --> 0:06:51,000
over the edge into frank deficiencies,

124
0:06:51.582,000 --> 0:06:53,000
creating all kinds of health problems.

125
0:06:54.263,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The situation is more significant for the B vitamins.

126
0:06:58.148,000 --> 0:07:01,000
When you look at vitamin B1 and vitamin B2,

127
0:07:01.801,000 --> 0:07:03,000
there's about a 17 percent decline.

128
0:07:04.494,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Pantothenic acid, vitamin B5, is about a 13 percent decline.

129
0:07:09.537,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Folate is about a 30 percent decline.

130
0:07:12.888,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And these are averages over the various experiments that were done.

131
0:07:17.186,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Folate is critical for child development.

132
0:07:20.782,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Pregnant women who don't get enough folate

133
0:07:22.915,000 --> 0:07:25,000
are at much higher risk of having babies with birth defects.

134
0:07:26.599,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So these are very serious potential consequences for our health

135
0:07:31.869,000 --> 0:07:33,000
as CO2 continues to rise.

136
0:07:35.636,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In another example,

137
0:07:36.941,000 --> 0:07:4,000
this is modeling work that was done by Chris Weyant and his colleagues,

138
0:07:41.34,000 --> 0:07:45,000
taking a look at this chain from higher CO2 to lower iron and zinc --

139
0:07:45.996,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and they only looked at iron and zinc --

140
0:07:48.452,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to various health outcomes.

141
0:07:50.433,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They looked at malaria, diarrheal disease, pneumonia,

142
0:07:53.795,000 --> 0:07:54,000
iron deficiency anemia,

143
0:07:55.583,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and looked at what the consequences could be in 2050.

144
0:07:59.754,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And the darker the color in this,

145
0:08:01.998,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the larger the consequences.

146
0:08:03.982,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So you can see the major impacts

147
0:08:06.705,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in Asia and in Africa,

148
0:08:09.638,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but also note that in countries such as the United States

149
0:08:12.527,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and countries in Europe,

150
0:08:14.057,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the populations also could be affected.

151
0:08:17.075,000 --> 0:08:21,000
They estimated about 125 million people could be affected.

152
0:08:22.041,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They also modeled what would be the most effective interventions,

153
0:08:26.112,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and their conclusion was reducing our greenhouse gases:

154
0:08:30.641,000 --> 0:08:33,000
getting our greenhouse gas emissions down by mid-century

155
0:08:33.743,000 --> 0:08:36,000
so we don't have to worry so much about these consequences

156
0:08:37.07,000 --> 0:08:38,000
later in the century.

157
0:08:40.568,000 --> 0:08:42,000
These experiments, these modeling studies

158
0:08:43.098,000 --> 0:08:45,000
did not take climate change itself into account.

159
0:08:46.082,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They just focused on the carbon dioxide component.

160
0:08:49.584,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So when you put the two together,

161
0:08:51.738,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it's expected the impact is much larger than what I've told you.

162
0:08:56.108,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I'd love to be able to tell you right now

163
0:08:59.151,000 --> 0:09:03,000
how much the food you had for breakfast, the food you're going to have for lunch,

164
0:09:03.989,000 --> 0:09:05,000
has shifted from what your grandparents ate

165
0:09:06.892,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in terms of its nutritional quality.

166
0:09:10.312,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But I can't.

167
0:09:11.493,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We don't have the research on that.

168
0:09:14.253,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I'd love to tell you how much current food insecurity

169
0:09:17.428,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is affected by these changes.

170
0:09:19.851,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But I can't.

171
0:09:21.121,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We don't have the research on that, either.

172
0:09:24.437,000 --> 0:09:27,000
There's a lot that needs to be known in this area,

173
0:09:27.903,000 --> 0:09:31,000
including what the possible solutions could be.

174
0:09:31.986,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We don't know exactly what those solutions are,

175
0:09:34.764,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but we've got a range of options.

176
0:09:37.521,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We've got advancements in technologies.

177
0:09:40.056,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We've got plant breeding. We've got biofortification.

178
0:09:43.436,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Soils could make a difference.

179
0:09:45.262,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And, of course, it will be very helpful to know

180
0:09:48.279,000 --> 0:09:51,000
how these changes could affect our future health

181
0:09:51.784,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and the health of our children and the health of our grandchildren.

182
0:09:56.111,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And these investments take time.

183
0:09:59.053,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It will take time to sort all of these issues out.

184
0:10:03.427,000 --> 0:10:06,000
There is no national entity or business group

185
0:10:07.098,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that is funding this research.

186
0:10:09.799,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We need these investments critically so that we do know where we're going.

187
0:10:16.048,000 --> 0:10:18,000
In the meantime, what we can do

188
0:10:18.681,000 --> 0:10:24,000
is ensure that all people have access to a complete diet,

189
0:10:24.873,000 --> 0:10:28,000
not just those in the wealthy parts of the world but everywhere in the world.

190
0:10:29.552,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We also individually and collectively need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions

191
0:10:34.395,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to reduce the challenges that will come later in the century.

192
0:10:39.57,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's been said that if you think education is expensive, try ignorance.

193
0:10:46.112,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Let's not.

194
0:10:47.977,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Let's invest in ourselves,

195
0:10:50.787,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in our children

196
0:10:51.969,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and in our planet.

197
0:10:53.321,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Thank you.

198
0:10:54.559,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Applause)

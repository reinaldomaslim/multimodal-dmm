2
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Bruce Lee is my father,

3
0:00:14.417,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and he is best well-known as a martial artist

4
0:00:16.792,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and an action film star,

5
0:00:18.333,000 --> 0:00:2,000
as I'm sure most of you know.

6
0:00:20.458,000 --> 0:00:22,000
He died when I was four years old,

7
0:00:22.833,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but I have a really deep memory of him.

8
0:00:26.417,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I don't have those long-form, storied memories that you do when you're older,

9
0:00:30.5,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but the memory that I do have is of the feeling of him.

10
0:00:36.625,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I remember his energy,

11
0:00:38.917,000 --> 0:00:39,000
his presence,

12
0:00:40.208,000 --> 0:00:41,000
his love --

13
0:00:41.5,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the safety of it,

14
0:00:42.792,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the power of it,

15
0:00:44.083,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the radiance of it.

16
0:00:46.458,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And to me that memory is very deep and personal.

17
0:00:51.375,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And it is the memory of the quality of his essential nature.

18
0:00:58.125,000 --> 0:01:,000
What a lot of people don't know about my father

19
0:01:00.375,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is that he was also a philosopher.

20
0:01:02.75,000 --> 0:01:06,000
He had a very ever-evolving philosophy

21
0:01:07.333,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that he lived,

22
0:01:09.875,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it is that distinction -- that he lived his philosophy

23
0:01:13.542,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and didn't just espouse his philosophy --

24
0:01:16.208,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that made him the force of nature that he was, and still engages us today.

25
0:01:22.833,000 --> 0:01:26,000
His wisdom has salvaged me many times in my life:

26
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:28,000
when my brother died,

27
0:01:28.958,000 --> 0:01:29,000
when my heart's been broken,

28
0:01:30.375,000 --> 0:01:35,000
whenever I have faced a challenge to my mind, my body or my spirit,

29
0:01:35.958,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the way that he expressed himself has lifted me up.

30
0:01:42.542,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And so I come to you today not as a researcher

31
0:01:45.458,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or an educator or a guru

32
0:01:47.875,000 --> 0:01:49,000
or even a life coach,

33
0:01:50.292,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but as a student of Bruce Lee --

34
0:01:52.708,000 --> 0:01:53,000
as his daughter,

35
0:01:54.208,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and also as a student of my own life.

36
0:01:58.625,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So ...

37
0:02:00.5,000 --> 0:02:05,000
my big burning question that I want you all to consider today is ...

38
0:02:05.625,000 --> 0:02:06,000
how are you?

39
0:02:07.792,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Let me elaborate.

40
0:02:10.167,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Whenever anyone would ask my mom what my father was like,

41
0:02:14.583,000 --> 0:02:16,000
she would say, "How he was in front of the camera,

42
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:18,000
how you saw him in his films,

43
0:02:18.583,000 --> 0:02:2,000
how you saw him in his interviews

44
0:02:20.792,000 --> 0:02:23,000
was, in fact, exactly how he was."

45
0:02:24.292,000 --> 0:02:26,000
There were not multiple Bruce Lees.

46
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
There was not public Bruce Lee and private Bruce Lee,

47
0:02:29.75,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or teacher Bruce Lee and actor Bruce Lee and family man Bruce Lee.

48
0:02:34.083,000 --> 0:02:38,000
There was just one unified, total Bruce Lee.

49
0:02:39.417,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And that Bruce Lee had a very deep, philosophical life practice

50
0:02:44.083,000 --> 0:02:45,000
called self-actualization.

51
0:02:46.083,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You've probably heard that term before.

52
0:02:48.917,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It's also known as how to be yourself in the best way possible.

53
0:02:54.125,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And that Bruce Lee said this:

54
0:02:57.167,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"When I look around, I always learn something

55
0:02:59.333,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and that is to be always yourself,

56
0:03:02.5,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and to express yourself and have faith in yourself.

57
0:03:05.875,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Don't go out and find a successful personality and duplicate it,

58
0:03:09.458,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but rather start from the very root of your being,

59
0:03:12.25,000 --> 0:03:15,000
which is 'How can I be me?'"

60
0:03:15.708,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Many of us have done some soul-searching

61
0:03:18.667,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or at least some incessant thinking and worrying

62
0:03:20.958,000 --> 0:03:25,000
about things like our purpose, our passion, our impact,

63
0:03:26.458,000 --> 0:03:27,000
our values

64
0:03:29.042,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and our "reason for being."

65
0:03:32.292,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And that is sometimes considered our why.

66
0:03:35.667,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Why am I here? Why this life?

67
0:03:37.917,000 --> 0:03:4,000
What am I meant to be doing?

68
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If we can grab a little piece of that information,

69
0:03:44.833,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it can help to ground us and root us,

70
0:03:48.25,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it can also point us in a direction,

71
0:03:50.5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and typically what it points us to is our what.

72
0:03:54.5,000 --> 0:03:55,000
What we manifest in the world,

73
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
what we have.

74
0:03:57.292,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So our job, our home, our hobbies and the like.

75
0:04:02.875,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But there's this little space in between the why and the what

76
0:04:06.542,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that often doesn't get our full attention,

77
0:04:09.625,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and that is our ...

78
0:04:11.625,000 --> 0:04:12,000
how.

79
0:04:12.917,000 --> 0:04:15,000
How we get there and the quality of that doing.

80
0:04:17.5,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And I want to offer that this is actually the most important part of the equation

81
0:04:23.542,000 --> 0:04:25,000
when it comes to our personal growth,

82
0:04:26.167,000 --> 0:04:27,000
our sense of wholeness

83
0:04:28.125,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and even the long-term impact that we make.

84
0:04:33.958,000 --> 0:04:39,000
How is the action that bridges the gap from the internal to the external.

85
0:04:40.75,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And bridging the gap is a very important concept

86
0:04:44.708,000 --> 0:04:45,000
for martial artists like my father.

87
0:04:46.458,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's how you get from point A to point B.

88
0:04:49.25,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's how you get from here to your target under the most vital of circumstances.

89
0:04:54.833,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And so it makes all the difference.

90
0:04:58.125,000 --> 0:05:,000
Do you get there as an amateur? Are you sloppy?

91
0:05:00.833,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Are you wild, chaotic,

92
0:05:03.917,000 --> 0:05:05,000
sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you're not lucky?

93
0:05:06.75,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Or are you a warrior?

94
0:05:08.792,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Are you confident?

95
0:05:10.75,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Are you focused?

96
0:05:12.292,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Are you skilled?

97
0:05:13.583,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Are you intuitive?

98
0:05:14.875,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Are you expressive, creative, aware?

99
0:05:17.583,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So I want to talk to you today about your how in your life.

100
0:05:23.333,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So we do a little bit of --

101
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we spend a little time in existential crisis

102
0:05:28.542,000 --> 0:05:3,000
over "Why am I here? What am I meant to be doing?"

103
0:05:31.542,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and we put a ton of effort into our what --

104
0:05:35.375,000 --> 0:05:39,000
our job, our career, our partner that we have

105
0:05:39.708,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and the hobbies we pursue.

106
0:05:43.5,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But I want us to consider

107
0:05:45.583,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that our how is the expression of our why

108
0:05:52.792,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in every what,

109
0:05:54.958,000 --> 0:05:55,000
whether we're aware of it or not.

110
0:05:57.833,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And so let's take an example.

111
0:06:00.667,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Let's say that I have a value of kindness.

112
0:06:04.75,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I'm all about kindness,

113
0:06:06.417,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I feel really natural being kind,

114
0:06:09.375,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I want to see more kindness in the world.

115
0:06:12.208,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Is that kindness --

116
0:06:13.75,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is that value in the result

117
0:06:16.542,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or is it in the doing?

118
0:06:19.042,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Are you trying to be kind when it's hard to be kind?

119
0:06:23.875,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Can you do something you don't want to do kindly,

120
0:06:26.708,000 --> 0:06:27,000
like fire someone?

121
0:06:28.708,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Can you leave a relationship with kindness?

122
0:06:31.292,000 --> 0:06:33,000
If kindness is the value,

123
0:06:34.167,000 --> 0:06:37,000
then are you trying to express it

124
0:06:37.458,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in the whole spectrum of your doing --

125
0:06:40.292,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and trying to do that?

126
0:06:44.458,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Or are you just doing it when it's easy?

127
0:06:47.208,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So I want us to think about that for a moment

128
0:06:50.417,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and consider, you know, if we come home

129
0:06:53.5,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and we're kind and generous and loving with our kids,

130
0:06:58.042,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but then we go to work

131
0:06:59.625,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and we are dismissive

132
0:07:02.917,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and rude to our assistant

133
0:07:05.833,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and we treat them like a subhuman,

134
0:07:07.792,000 --> 0:07:12,000
then there is a fragmentation in the beingness of our value.

135
0:07:14.083,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And so I want us to consider that how we are in our lives

136
0:07:18.75,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is in fact how we are.

137
0:07:21.042,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Meaning, if I am the kind of person

138
0:07:23.667,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that walks down the street and smiles at people

139
0:07:28.042,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and says "hi" as I walk past them on the sidewalk,

140
0:07:30.542,000 --> 0:07:31,000
then that is how I am.

141
0:07:32.25,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But if I'm also the kind of person who makes fun of my brother

142
0:07:38.458,000 --> 0:07:41,000
every chance that I get behind his back,

143
0:07:41.833,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that is also the kind of person that I am.

144
0:07:45.042,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And ultimately how we are

145
0:07:48.167,000 --> 0:07:51,000
makes up the totality of the picture of who we are.

146
0:07:52.792,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And so I want to talk about how do we unite these pieces

147
0:07:57.792,000 --> 0:07:58,000
if we have any fragmentation.

148
0:07:59.292,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I want to understand how we embody ourselves

149
0:08:03.708,000 --> 0:08:06,000
as our one and only self.

150
0:08:06.875,000 --> 0:08:09,000
How do we actualize the whole self?

151
0:08:10.208,000 --> 0:08:13,000
My father said, "All goals apart from the means are an illusion.

152
0:08:13.667,000 --> 0:08:15,000
There will never be means to ends --

153
0:08:16.208,000 --> 0:08:17,000
only means.

154
0:08:17.5,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And I am means.

155
0:08:20.167,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I am what I started with

156
0:08:21.75,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and when it is all over,

157
0:08:23.083,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I will be all that is left."

158
0:08:25.333,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So you can employ a systematic approach to training and practicing,

159
0:08:28.542,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but you can't employ a systematic approach to actually living

160
0:08:31.458,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because life is a process not a goal.

161
0:08:35.333,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It is a means and not an end.

162
0:08:38.833,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So "to obtain enlightenment" --

163
0:08:41.833,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and I'm going to say self-actualize,

164
0:08:45.875,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to be self-actualized or to obtain wholeness --

165
0:08:49.375,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"emphasis should fall NOT on the cultivation

166
0:08:51.875,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of the particular department" --

167
0:08:53.457,000 --> 0:08:54,000
all of our whats --

168
0:08:55.292,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"which then merges into the totality of who we are as a total human being,

169
0:08:59.542,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but rather, on the total human being

170
0:09:02.875,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that then enters into and unites those particular departments."

171
0:09:08.417,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You are your how.

172
0:09:11.208,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You --

173
0:09:12.583,000 --> 0:09:14,000
if you have some consciousness

174
0:09:14.875,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and you want to bring some practice,

175
0:09:16.667,000 --> 0:09:19,000
if you want to step into that warrior space

176
0:09:19.958,000 --> 0:09:2,000
around your how --

177
0:09:21.792,000 --> 0:09:26,000
how you express in every aspect of your life --

178
0:09:26.958,000 --> 0:09:3,000
then you get to be the artist of that expression.

179
0:09:31.875,000 --> 0:09:36,000
You get to step into that and claim it

180
0:09:37.5,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and exercise it

181
0:09:39.083,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and bring that beingness through your doingness

182
0:09:44.792,000 --> 0:09:45,000
into your havingness.

183
0:09:47.5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And there you will find the most profound of your growth,

184
0:09:52.75,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you will find a sense of wholeness

185
0:09:56.083,000 --> 0:10:,000
and ultimately, you will leave a lasting impact on your environment.

186
0:10:01.917,000 --> 0:10:04,000
My father was his how.

187
0:10:05.167,000 --> 0:10:1,000
He applied the execution of who he was

188
0:10:10.5,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to every aspect of his life.

189
0:10:13.167,000 --> 0:10:17,000
He was way more than that kung fu guy from the '70s.

190
0:10:18.833,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He was someone who worked very hard at actualizing his inner self

191
0:10:24.375,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and expressing it out into the world.

192
0:10:26.833,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And that laid the foundation for what continues to inspire us,

193
0:10:32.5,000 --> 0:10:33,000
engage us,

194
0:10:33.792,000 --> 0:10:34,000
excite us

195
0:10:35.083,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and attract us to him.

196
0:10:37.625,000 --> 0:10:41,000
He was the embodied example of living fully.

197
0:10:42.625,000 --> 0:10:46,000
He said, "I am means."

198
0:10:47.083,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And there are only means.

199
0:10:49.917,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So I'm going to ask you one more time.

200
0:10:53.125,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Thank you for listening, and please consider,

201
0:10:56.458,000 --> 0:10:57,000
for you,

202
0:10:57.958,000 --> 0:11:,000
across the spectrum of your doing,

203
0:11:01.125,000 --> 0:11:02,000
how are you?

204
0:11:02.75,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Thank you.

205
0:11:04.042,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Applause)

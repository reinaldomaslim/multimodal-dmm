1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I had a fire nine days ago.

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
My archive:

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'd collected --

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was a collector, major, big-time.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's gone.

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I just looked at it,

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I didn't know what to do.

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I mean, this was --

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
was I my things?

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I always live in the present -- I love the present.

13
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I cherish the future.

14
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid,

15
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
like, you've got to make something good out of something bad.

16
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
You've got to make something good out of something bad.

17
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
This was bad! Man, I was --

18
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I cough. I was sick.

19
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
That's my camera lens. The first one --

20
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.

21
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
That's my feature film. "King, Murray"

22
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
won Cannes Film Festival 1970 --

23
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the only print I had.

24
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
That's my papers.

25
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes.

26
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.

27
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"You've got to make something good out of something bad,"

28
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.

29
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.

30
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.

31
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,

32
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
which opens in New York in two weeks

33
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
downtown.

34
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."

35
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
That's me at my desk.

36
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That was a desk took 40-some years to build.

37
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You know -- all the stuff.

38
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
That's my daughter, Jean.

39
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.

40
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
"Dig it up," I said. "Pieces.

41
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I want pieces. Bits and pieces."

42
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,

43
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project.

44
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That's my sister. She took care of pictures,

45
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because I was a big collector of snapshot photography

46
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that I believed said a lot.

47
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And those are some of the pictures that --

48
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
something was good about the burnt pictures.

49
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I didn't know. I looked at that --

50
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I said, "Wow, is that better than the --"

51
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.

52
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.

53
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Idea about women.

54
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I started to say, "Hey, man, you are too much!

55
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You could cry about this." I really didn't.

56
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I just instead said,

57
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... "

58
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And I appreciate this moment

59
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to come up on this stage with so many people

60
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who've already given me so much solace,

61
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and just say to TEDsters:

62
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I'm proud of me. That I take something bad,

63
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this,

64
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
all these pieces.

65
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.

66
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I was a big record collector --

67
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you,

68
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
film burns. Film burns.

69
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.

70
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The negatives are gone.

71
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That's my father's letter to me, telling me to

72
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
marry the woman I first married when I was 20.

73
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
That's my daughter and me.

74
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
She's still there. She's there this morning, actually.

75
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That's my house.

76
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.

77
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
That's my wife, Heidi,

78
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
who didn't take it as well as I did.

79
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
My children, Davey and Henry.

80
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.

81
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So, my message to you folks,

82
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance

83
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.

84
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I came to live it, and I am living it.

85
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,

86
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
just 35 miles from here.

87
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
Thank you everybody.

88
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Applause)

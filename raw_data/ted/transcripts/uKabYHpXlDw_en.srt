1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
When I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,

2
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"I gotta call my mother."

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You still with me? (Laughter)

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I called her up.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."

11
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to the White House."

13
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
"Ma, don't start!"

14
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,

15
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"What's the problem?"

16
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."

17
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.

18
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'"

19
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up,

20
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it's entertainment when you tell it,

21
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and you're going to use a microphone."

22
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"

24
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom

25
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"

26
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Then my pop got on there.

28
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know --

29
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
old Cuban man from Camaguey.

30
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.

31
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
He's from Florida.

32
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
He was born there in 1924.

33
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,

34
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,

35
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
our old Arawak ancestors.

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,

37
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.

38
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"Papi, help."

39
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."

40
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
"After what I just told you?"

42
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
My whole life, my father's been there.

43
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So we talked for a few minutes, and he said,

44
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"Why don't you tell them what you believe?"

45
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I love that, but we don't have the time.

46
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.

47
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Great story is the art of letting go.

48
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I'm going to tell you a little story.

49
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Remember, this tradition comes to us

50
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
not from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,

51
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,

52
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.

53
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.

54
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.

55
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Have you been watching the commercials?

56
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once --

57
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to tell our story and have it heard.

58
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
There are stories you tell from stages.

59
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
There's stories that you may tell

60
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in a small group of people with some good wine.

61
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,

62
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
maybe once in your life.

63
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.

64
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm not telling you that story.

65
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I'm telling you this one.

66
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."

67
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It's about human connection.

68
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to

69
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in that short character sketch,

70
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
came to the United States one thousand years ago.

71
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this country

72
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.

73
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.

74
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.

75
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And in that little Southern town, I grew up,

76
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and grew up hearing these stories.

77
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But this story only happened a few years ago.

78
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I called my mom.

79
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It was a Saturday morning.

80
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.

81
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's delicious. It's savory.

82
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth --

83
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?

84
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
That kind of food, yeah.

85
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This is the sensory part of the program, people.

86
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.

87
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now,

88
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.

89
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I got an errand to run."

90
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you --

91
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago,

92
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.

93
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child,

94
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.

95
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue,

96
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport.

97
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"

98
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Spanish)

99
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"You don't speak English?"

100
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
"No."

101
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But eventually, every dog has its day,

103
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and she ended up in traffic court,

104
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
where she bartered with the judge for a discount.

105
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
There's a historical marker.

106
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.

107
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up

108
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to take her to have her hair dyed, you know,

109
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit,

110
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you know, same color as the Buick.

111
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Anybody? All right.

112
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.

113
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Rockports -- they're for this.

114
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That's why they call them that.

115
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is her ensemble.

117
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning

118
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
when I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.

119
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.

120
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I show up. She's in the carport.

121
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Of course, they have a carport.

122
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The kind with the corrugated roof, you know.

123
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The Buick's parked outside,

124
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.

125
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
"I got a surprise for you, baby!"

126
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
"We taking your car?"

127
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
"Not we, I."

128
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.

129
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.

130
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.

131
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.

132
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Blithering fucking idiots.

133
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I said, "Is that thing real?"

135
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"I think so."

136
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
"Can you even see?"

137
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"I guess I must."

138
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
"Oh, Jesus."

139
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
She gets into the car -- she's sitting on two phone books.

140
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.

141
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
She's engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam! -- slam the door.

142
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone

143
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.

144
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"You coming? You no coming?"

145
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?"

146
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
"Are you kidding me?"

147
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"How are you doing it?"

148
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"He's got to sleep sometime."

149
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me

150
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
if I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.

151
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.

152
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.

153
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.

154
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.

155
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?

156
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of

157
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
birth breathing -- you know, that one?

158
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.

159
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"

160
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Because now she's picked up the Highway 285,

161
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now --

162
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.

163
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I said, "Ma, pick a lane!"

164
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."

165
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And there she goes, right.

166
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.

167
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.

168
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe.

169
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."

170
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"No, no, what you talking about?"

171
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
"You have a license. How long have you been driving?"

172
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
"Four or five days."

173
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"

174
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"I did not get a ticket."

175
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on."

176
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"OK, so I stopped at a light

177
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and there's a guy, you know, in the back."

178
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform

179
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and a terrified look on his face?"

180
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"You weren't there, don't start."

181
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
"Come on. You got a ticket?"

182
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"No." She explained,

183
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"The man" -- I have to tell you as she did,

184
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because it loses something if I don't, you know --

185
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this,

186
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
which tells me he's pretty old, you know.

187
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So I look up and I'm thinking,

188
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."

189
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"Ma, are you still doing that?"

190
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"If it works, it works, baby.

191
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.'

192
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."

193
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

194
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So he's talking to her, and at some point she says,

195
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done."

196
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"Yeah? What?

197
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"

198
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
"No, I look up, and the light, she change."

199
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You should be terrified.

201
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now, I don't know if she's toying with me,

202
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse --

203
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw --

204
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but by now, we've reached the mall.

205
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?

206
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.

207
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Audience: Yes.

208
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory,

209
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
praying to that saint of perpetual availability

210
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along,

211
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
some guy's going to turn on the brake lights

212
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
just as you pull up behind him.

213
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But that doesn't happen most of the time, right?

214
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"

215
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
"You mean, like, in the car?"

216
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"No, don't -- why are we here today?

217
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's Saturday. It's the holidays."

218
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."

219
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking,

220
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that you really have to -- you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren,

221
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
this woman's mind.

222
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor --

223
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
enough metaphors for you? -- somewhere, I may not get out.

224
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But you know.

225
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

226
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?

227
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And why? What is wrong with his underwear?"

228
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
"It will upset you."

229
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"

230
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.

231
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake,

232
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers,

233
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and he's supposed to buy the boxers."

234
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"Why?"

235
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children."

236
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"Oh, my God!"

237
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

238
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Olivia? Huh? Huh?

239
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
By now, we have now crawled another four feet,

240
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.

241
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."

242
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And she points out the passenger window, and I look out,

243
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and three -- three -- aisles down,

244
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
"Look, the Chevy."

245
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You want to laugh, but you don't know --

246
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
you're that politically corrected, have you noticed?

247
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Correct the other direction now, it's OK.

248
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
"Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way."

249
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."

250
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child,

251
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.

252
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"I know that, honey. Get out of the car

253
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and go stand in the parking space till I get there."

254
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.

255
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid, you were an adult --

256
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?

257
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.

258
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Laughter)

259
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And years of therapy later, we're doing great.

260
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We're doing great. We're doing fine.

261
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Well, I stood up to her.

262
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
This is -- you know, you'd think by now I'm -- and still holding?

263
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."

264
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"

265
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
(Spanish)

266
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And she's still talking while she puts the car in park,

267
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
hits the emergency brake, opens the door,

268
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age,

269
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books,

270
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and then she walks around --

271
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her --

272
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
around the front of the car.

273
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.

274
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot

275
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of

276
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah.

277
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.

278
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books.

279
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us?

280
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We'll wait for the slow ones. OK.

281
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I start, and this is where a child says to me --

282
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before,

283
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
because this is my laconic child.

284
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
A brevity, brevity of everything with this child.

285
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You know, she eats small portions.

286
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Language is something to be meted out

287
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
in small phonemes, you know -- just little hmm, hmm-hmm.

288
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.

289
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
She wields great power.

290
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.

291
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But she pauses occasionally and says,

292
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
"How do you spell that? What year? OK."

293
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
When she writes the expose in about 20 years,

294
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
don't believe a word of it.

295
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter,

296
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
my borderline Asperger's kid.

297
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Bless you, Dr. Watson.

298
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
She says, "Ma, you got to look!"

299
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know.

300
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.

301
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I grew up with this woman.

302
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't."

303
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
"No, mama, you got to look."

304
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I got to look. You got to look.

305
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Don't you want to look?

306
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
There she is.

307
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I look in bewildered awe:

308
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.

309
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.

310
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force

311
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like,

312
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"

313
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Laughter)

314
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.

315
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.

316
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Honey, sit up so they can see you."

317
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

318
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I finally come -- and now, it's the South.

319
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I don't know what part of the country you live in.

320
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I think we all secretly love stories.

321
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.

322
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.

323
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Come on, honey, tell it to me."

324
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But in the South, we love a good story.

325
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
People have pulled aside,

326
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I mean, they've come out of that queue line,

327
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.

328
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Bets are placed.

329
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"

330
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
(Laughter)

331
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.

332
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
She is, after all, Cuban.

333
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."

334
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.

335
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I pull in. I put the car in park.

336
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Engine's still running -- mine, not the car.

337
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"

338
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
"I'm not going anywhere."

339
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.

340
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I come out, and there's Esther.

341
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
She's hugging the purse.

342
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.

343
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Laughter)

344
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
"Ma, have you no shame?

345
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
People are watching us all around," right?

346
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Now, some of them you've got to make up, people.

347
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Secret of the trade.

348
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.

349
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.

350
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
She says this to me.

351
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
After I say -- let me refresh you --

352
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
"have you no shame?"

353
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
"No. I gave it up with pantyhose -- they're both too binding."

354
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Laughter)

355
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Applause)

356
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.

357
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.

358
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Intrepid soul.

359
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?

360
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
She jumped out of that car."

361
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.

362
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.

363
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Laughter)

364
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman,

365
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.

366
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
With her is a young man -- husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.

367
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" -- that's how we talk down there --

368
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
"is that your mother?"

369
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots

370
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"

371
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
The boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" --

372
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
they look at each other, it's a knowing glance -- "God, she's crazy!"

373
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say,

374
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."

375
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK,

376
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon,

377
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly."

378
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
And the girl goes, "I know, but, I mean, I swear to God,

379
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
she reminds us of our mother."

380
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I almost miss it.

381
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.

382
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
It's a half-whisper, "God, I miss her."

383
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away,

384
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
lost in their own reverie.

385
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw.

386
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says,

387
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
"You know what, honey?"

388
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
"What, ma?"

389
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years,

390
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me."

391
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
(Applause)

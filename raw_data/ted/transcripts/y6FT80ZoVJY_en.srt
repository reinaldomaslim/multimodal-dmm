1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Back in 1992, I started working for a company

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
called Interval Research,

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which was just then being founded

4
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
by David Lidell and Paul Allen

5
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I met with David

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to talk about what I might do in his company.

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and writing books --

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
after twenty years or so in the computer game industry

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
having ideas that people didn't think they could sell.

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And David and I discovered

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that we had a question in common,

15
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that we really wanted the answer to,

16
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and that was,

17
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"

18
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Why is that?

19
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.

20
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
These people aren't that smart.

21
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
There's six billion dollars on the table.

22
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They would go for it if they could figure out how.

23
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So, what is the deal here?

24
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And as we thought about our goals --

25
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution,

26
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in the classical sense

27
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that humanism, at its best,

28
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research

29
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
with a set of core values

30
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that fundamentally love and respect people.

31
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The basic idea of humanism

32
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is the improvable quality of life;

33
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that we can do good things,

34
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that there are things worth doing

35
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
because they're good things to do,

36
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and that clear-eyed empiricism

37
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
can help us figure out how to do them.

38
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So, contrary to popular belief,

39
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.

40
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
And Interval Research is kind of the living example

41
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of how that can be true.

42
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So David and I decided to go find out,

43
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
through the best research we could muster,

44
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
what it would take to get a little girl

45
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to put her hands on a computer,

46
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology

47
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that little boys have because they play video games.

48
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We spent two and a half years conducting research;

49
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we spent another year and a half in advance development.

50
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Then we formed a spin-off company.

51
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In the research phase of the project at Interval,

52
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research,

53
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland --

54
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
changed my mind entirely about what market research was

55
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and what it could be.

56
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They taught me how to look and see,

57
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing

58
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of saying to a child,

59
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Of all these things we already make you,

60
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which do you like best?" --

61
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which gives you zero answers that are usable.

62
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So, what we did for the first two and a half years

63
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
was four things:

64
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We did an extensive review of the literature

65
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in related fields, like cognitive psychology,

66
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
spatial cognition, gender studies,

67
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
play theory, sociology, primatology.

68
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are,

69
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I love you and I'd give anything to meet you.

70
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
After we had done that with a pretty large team of people

71
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and discovered what we thought the salient issues were

72
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
with girls and boys and playing --

73
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because, after all, that's really what this is about --

74
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we moved to the second phase of our work,

75
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
where we interviewed adult experts

76
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in academia, some of the people

77
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
who'd produced the literature that we found relevant.

78
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Also, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day,

79
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
like playground supervisors. We talked to them,

80
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions

81
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
about gender difference and play.

82
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work:

83
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls,

84
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
ages seven to 12, all over the United States --

85
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin

86
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them

87
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and they wouldn't be a representative sample.

88
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And at the end of those remarkable conversations

89
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
with kids and their best friends across the United States,

90
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children,

91
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research,

92
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics,

93
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
for designing computer-based products --

94
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.

95
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software

96
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and testing them with little girls.

97
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon

98
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which was a spinoff of Interval Research,

99
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest,

100
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.

101
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We launched a website on September 2nd

102
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that has now served 25 million pages,

103
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and has 42,000 registered young girl users.

104
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They visit an average of one and a half times a day,

105
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
spend an average of 35 minutes a visit,

106
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and look at 50 pages a visit.

107
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls.

108
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We launched two titles in October --

109
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"Rockett's New School" -- the first of a series

110
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school

111
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate,

112
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?"

113
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?

114
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Who are my friends?";

115
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to exercise the love of social complexity

116
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior;

117
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices

118
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.

119
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest,"

120
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.

121
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data --

122
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
entertainment titles in PC Data

123
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in December, right up there with "John Madden Football,"

124
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which thrills me to death.

125
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So, we're real,

126
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.

127
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We've made half-a-billion impressions

128
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
with marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.

129
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive;

130
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
four percent of them have been "other."

131
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I want to talk about the other,

132
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because the politics of this enterprise, in a way,

133
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
have been the most fascinating part of it, for me.

134
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.

135
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
One kind of reviewer is a male gamer

136
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
who thinks he knows what games ought to be,

137
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and won't show the product to little girls.

138
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist

139
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
who thinks they know what little girls ought to be.

140
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows

141
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
have one thing in common:

142
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
they don't listen to little girls.

143
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They haven't looked at children

144
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.

145
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I'd like to play you some voices of little girls

146
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did --

147
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
actually, some of the voices are more recent.

148
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs

149
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that they took for us of their lives,

150
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of the things that they value and care about.

151
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us

152
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to

153
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and this is the kind of research I recommend to those

154
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
who want to do humanistic work.

155
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.

156
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Hers is more into boys.

157
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Girl 2: Uh, yeah.

158
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Girl 1: We have -- in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this:

159
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age --

160
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy,

161
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
boyfriends, dogs, pets -- what else -- sisters, brothers, and all those.

162
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.

163
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.

164
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.

165
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery

166
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
with clouds and flowers.

167
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy,

168
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.

169
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Girl 7: I run track, I played soccer,

170
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.

171
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation,

172
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
like when I get Mondays and all those days off.

173
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on

174
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team --

175
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
all this different stuff that I have to do,

176
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and sometimes it gets overwhelming.

177
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Girl 9: My friend Justine

178
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
kinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.

179
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters,

180
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first

181
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and they take your idea and they do it themselves.

182
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything

183
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" -- all the time.

184
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But she gives my sister everything.

185
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute

186
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.

187
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Let's hope it's really stable.

188
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is the second day in Rockett's life.

189
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The reason I'm showing you this

190
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar

191
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.

192
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them

193
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
in the game that we've created.

194
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!

195
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?

196
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?

197
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
She asked me to make sure you knew about it.

198
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Nakilia invited Reuben too, but --

199
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Rockett: But what? Isn't he coming?

200
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Miko: I don't think so.

201
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.

202
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Rockett: Really? What other party?

203
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Girl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.

204
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
He's invited all the best people.

205
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
BL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point

206
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
because I know I don't have a lot of time.

207
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
After this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it.

208
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Rockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?

209
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.

210
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.

211
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.

212
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.

213
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters,

214
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we can go into this hidden hallway,

215
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and I'll quickly just show you the interface.

216
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We can, for example, go find Miko's locker

217
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and get some more information about her.

218
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Oops, I turned the wrong way.

219
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But you get the general idea of the product.

220
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem,

221
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls --

222
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility,

223
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and to play around with the social complexity of their lives.

224
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort,

225
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is a kind of validation,

226
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
a sense of being seen.

227
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.

228
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We love them.

229
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We see them.

230
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.

231
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But we're really, really happy about who they are.

232
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
It turns out they're really great.

233
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I want to close by showing you a videotape

234
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series

235
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that our graphic artists and design people put together,

236
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.

237
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
"Rockett 28!"

238
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?

239
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
BL: Thanks.

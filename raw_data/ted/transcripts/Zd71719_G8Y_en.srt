1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When we park in a big parking lot,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
how do we remember where we parked our car?

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Here's the problem facing Homer.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And we're going to try to understand

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
what's happening in his brain.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
which is the organ of memory.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
you can't remember things including where you parked your car.

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's named after Latin for "seahorse,"

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which it resembles.

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.

13
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So the human brain

14
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
has about a hundred billion neurons in it.

15
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And the neurons communicate with each other

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
via connections to each other.

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which are very densely interconnected.

20
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And scientists have begun to understand

21
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
how spatial memory works

22
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
by recording from individual neurons

23
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in rats or mice

24
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
while they forage or explore an environment

25
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
looking for food.

26
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron

27
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in the hippocampus of this rat here.

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And when it fires a little spike of electricity,

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
there's going to be a red dot and a click.

30
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So what we see

31
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is that this neuron knows

32
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And it signals to the rest of the brain

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
by sending a little electrical spike.

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as a function of the animal's location.

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And if we record from lots of different neurons,

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we'll see that different neurons fire

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
when the animal goes in different parts of its environment,

40
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
like in this square box shown here.

41
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So together they form a map

42
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
for the rest of the brain,

43
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
telling the brain continually,

44
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"Where am I now within my environment?"

45
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Place cells are also being recorded in humans.

46
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So epilepsy patients sometimes need

47
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.

48
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And some of these patients played a video game

49
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
where they drive around a small town.

50
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,

51
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
start sending electrical impulses

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.

53
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So how does a place cell know

54
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
where the rat or person is within its environment?

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Well these two cells here

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
show us that the boundaries of the environment

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
are particularly important.

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So the one on the top

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
likes to fire sort of midway between the walls

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of the box that their rat's in.

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.

62
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The one below likes to fire

63
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
whenever there's a wall close by to the south.

64
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And if you put another wall inside the box,

65
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
then the cell fires in both place

66
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
wherever there's a wall to the south

67
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
as the animal explores around in its box.

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So this predicts

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you --

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
extended buildings and so on --

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is particularly important for the hippocampus.

72
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus,

73
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
cells are found which project into the hippocampus,

74
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which do respond exactly

75
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to detecting boundaries or edges

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
at particular distances and directions

77
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
from the rat or mouse

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
as it's exploring around.

79
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So the cell on the left, you can see,

80
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it fires whenever the animal gets near

81
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to a wall or a boundary to the east,

82
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box

83
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or the circular wall of the circular box

84
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.

85
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And the cell on the right there

86
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
fires whenever there's a boundary to the south,

87
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall

88
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.

89
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So that's one way in which we think

90
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.

91
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We can also test where we think objects are,

92
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
like this goal flag, in simple environments --

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
or indeed, where your car would be.

94
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So we can have people explore an environment

95
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and see the location they have to remember.

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And then, if we put them back in the environment,

97
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
generally they're quite good at putting a marker down

98
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where they thought that flag or their car was.

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But on some trials,

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
we could change the shape and size of the environment

101
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
like we did with the place cell.

102
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In that case, we can see

103
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
how where they think the flag had been changes

104
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.

105
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And what you see, for example,

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,

107
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and then if you ask people where it was,

108
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but you've made the environment bigger,

109
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
where they think the flag had been

110
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
stretches out in exactly the same way

111
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that the place cell firing stretched out.

112
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's as if you remember where the flag was

113
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells

114
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
at that location,

115
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and then you can get back to that location

116
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
by moving around

117
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells

118
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
with that stored pattern.

119
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.

120
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But we also know where we are through movement.

121
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So if we take some outbound path --

122
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
perhaps we park and we wander off --

123
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we know because our own movements,

124
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
which we can integrate over this path

125
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
roughly what the heading direction is to go back.

126
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input

127
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
from a kind of cell called a grid cell.

128
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now grid cells are found, again,

129
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
on the inputs to the hippocampus,

130
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and they're a bit like place cells.

131
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But now as the rat explores around,

132
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
each individual cell fires

133
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in a whole array of different locations

134
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which are laid out across the environment

135
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
in an amazingly regular triangular grid.

136
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And if you record from several grid cells --

137
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
shown here in different colors --

138
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,

139
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly

140
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
relative to the other cells.

141
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So the red one fires on this grid

142
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.

143
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So together, it's as if the rat

144
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
can put a virtual grid of firing locations

145
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
across its environment --

146
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,

147
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but using triangles.

148
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And as it moves around,

149
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the electrical activity can pass

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
from one of these cells to the next cell

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to keep track of where it is,

152
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
so that it can use its own movements

153
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to know where it is in its environment.

154
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Do people have grid cells?

155
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns

156
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
have the same axes of symmetry,

157
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,

158
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
it means that the net activity

159
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain

160
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
should change

161
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
according to whether we're running along these six directions

162
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
or running along one of the six directions in between.

163
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So we can put people in an MRI scanner

164
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and have them do a little video game

165
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
like the one I showed you

166
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and look for this signal.

167
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,

168
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.

169
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So back to Homer.

170
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
He's probably remembering where his car was

171
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in terms of the distances and directions

172
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to extended buildings and boundaries

173
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
around the location where he parked.

174
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And that would be represented

175
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.

176
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,

177
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.

178
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Now both of these kinds of cells

179
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
can make the place cells fire.

180
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And he can return to the location where he parked

181
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
by moving so as to find where it is

182
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that best matches the firing pattern

183
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
of the place cells in his brain currently

184
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
with the stored pattern where he parked his car.

185
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And that guides him back to that location

186
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
irrespective of visual cues

187
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
like whether his car's actually there.

188
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Maybe it's been towed.

189
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.

190
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So beyond spatial memory,

191
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
if we look for this grid-like firing pattern

192
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
throughout the whole brain,

193
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we see it in a whole series of locations

194
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which are always active

195
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,

196
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.

197
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So it may be that the neural mechanisms

198
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
for representing the space around us

199
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
are also used for generating visual imagery

200
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,

201
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.

202
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So if this was happening,

203
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
your memories could start by place cells activating each other

204
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
via these dense interconnections

205
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and then reactivating boundary cells

206
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to create the spatial structure

207
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of the scene around your viewpoint.

208
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.

209
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Another kind of cell, head direction cells,

210
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
which I didn't mention yet,

211
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.

212
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
They could define the viewing direction

213
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,

214
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.

215
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So this is just one example

216
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of a new era really

217
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in cognitive neuroscience

218
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
where we're beginning to understand

219
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
psychological processes

220
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
like how you remember or imagine or even think

221
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in terms of the actions

222
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.

223
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Thank you very much.

224
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.581,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'd like to talk to you today

2
0:00:14.851,000 --> 0:00:18,000
about a whole new way to think about sexual activity

3
0:00:19.037,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and sexuality education, by comparison.

4
0:00:23.11,000 --> 0:00:25,000
If you talk to someone today in America

5
0:00:25.776,000 --> 0:00:26,000
about sexual activity,

6
0:00:27.6,000 --> 0:00:3,000
you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking

7
0:00:31.248,000 --> 0:00:32,000
about sexual activity.

8
0:00:32.906,000 --> 0:00:35,000
You're also talking about baseball.

9
0:00:35.952,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor

10
0:00:40.186,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that Americans use to think about

11
0:00:42.704,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and talk about sexual activity,

12
0:00:45.553,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and we know that because there's

13
0:00:47.101,000 --> 0:00:49,000
all this language in English

14
0:00:49.685,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that seems to be talking about baseball

15
0:00:52.63,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but that's really talking about sexual activity.

16
0:00:56.489,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So, for example, you can be a pitcher or a catcher,

17
0:00:59.688,000 --> 0:01:,000
and that corresponds to whether you

18
0:01:01.615,000 --> 0:01:04,000
perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act.

19
0:01:05.383,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Of course, there are the bases,

20
0:01:06.389,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which refer to specific sexual activities

21
0:01:09.607,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that happen in a very specific order,

22
0:01:12.822,000 --> 0:01:14,000
ultimately resulting in scoring a run

23
0:01:15.6,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or hitting a home run,

24
0:01:16.604,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which is usually having vaginal intercourse

25
0:01:18.912,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to the point of orgasm,

26
0:01:20.624,000 --> 0:01:22,000
at least for the guy.

27
0:01:23.017,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:24.946,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You can strike out, which means

29
0:01:26.447,000 --> 0:01:28,000
you don't get to have any sexual activity.

30
0:01:28.932,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And if you're a benchwarmer,

31
0:01:30.29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
you might be a virgin or somebody who for

32
0:01:32.705,000 --> 0:01:34,000
whatever reason isn't in the game,

33
0:01:34.954,000 --> 0:01:37,000
maybe because of your age or because of your ability

34
0:01:38.119,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or because of your skillset.

35
0:01:41.165,000 --> 0:01:42,000
A bat's a penis,

36
0:01:42.783,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and a nappy dugout is a vulva, or a vagina.

37
0:01:46.852,000 --> 0:01:49,000
A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.

38
0:01:49.96,000 --> 0:01:51,000
A switch-hitter is a bisexual person,

39
0:01:52.877,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team.

40
0:01:56.569,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And then there's this one:

41
0:01:59.168,000 --> 0:02:03,000
"if there's grass on the field, play ball."

42
0:02:03.192,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And that usually refers to

43
0:02:05.596,000 --> 0:02:08,000
if a young person, specifically often a young woman,

44
0:02:08.953,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is old enough to have pubic hair,

45
0:02:10.685,000 --> 0:02:12,000
she's old enough to have sex with.

46
0:02:13.41,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This baseball model is incredibly problematic.

47
0:02:16.393,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.

48
0:02:18.744,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.

49
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And it can't result in healthy sexuality

50
0:02:23.903,000 --> 0:02:26,000
developing in young people or in adults.

51
0:02:26.951,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So we need a new model.

52
0:02:28.673,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'm here today to offer you that new model.

53
0:02:31.232,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And it's based on

54
0:02:33.007,000 --> 0:02:34,000
pizza.

55
0:02:34.833,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now pizza is something that is universally understood

56
0:02:38.28,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and that most people associate with a positive experience.

57
0:02:41.177,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So let's do this.

58
0:02:42.157,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it

59
0:02:45.126,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when talking about three aspects of sexual activity:

60
0:02:48.57,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the trigger for sexual activity,

61
0:02:50.223,000 --> 0:02:52,000
what happens during sexual activity,

62
0:02:52.441,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the expected outcome of sexual activity.

63
0:02:55.593,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So when do you play baseball?

64
0:02:58.401,000 --> 0:03:,000
You play baseball when it's baseball season

65
0:03:00.841,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and when there's a game on the schedule.

66
0:03:03.123,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's not exactly your choice.

67
0:03:05.433,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So if it's prom night or a wedding night

68
0:03:08.329,000 --> 0:03:11,000
or at a party or if our parents aren't home,

69
0:03:11.399,000 --> 0:03:13,000
hey, it's just batter up.

70
0:03:14.131,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Can you imagine saying to your coach,

71
0:03:15.917,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"Uh, I'm not really feeling it today,

72
0:03:18.418,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I think I'll sit this game out."

73
0:03:20.485,000 --> 0:03:22,000
That's just not the way it happens.

74
0:03:22.577,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And when you get together to play baseball,

75
0:03:24.649,000 --> 0:03:26,000
immediately you're with two opposing teams,

76
0:03:27.1,000 --> 0:03:29,000
one playing offense, one playing defense,

77
0:03:29.43,000 --> 0:03:31,000
somebody's trying to move deeper into the field.

78
0:03:32.225,000 --> 0:03:33,000
That's usually a sign to the boy.

79
0:03:34.158,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field.

80
0:03:37.194,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's often given to the girl.

81
0:03:39.423,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's competitive.

82
0:03:40.458,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We're not playing with each other.

83
0:03:42.247,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We're playing against each other.

84
0:03:43.654,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And when you show up to play baseball,

85
0:03:45.586,000 --> 0:03:47,000
nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do

86
0:03:48.13,000 --> 0:03:5,000
or how this baseball game might be good for us.

87
0:03:50.671,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Everybody knows the rules.

88
0:03:51.934,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You just take your position and play the game.

89
0:03:56.313,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But when do you have pizza?

90
0:03:58.673,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza.

91
0:04:02.915,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It starts with an internal sense, an internal desire, or a need.

92
0:04:07.009,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"Huh. I could go for some pizza."

93
0:04:10.681,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:12.938,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And because it's an internal desire,

95
0:04:15.915,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we actually have some sense of control over that.

96
0:04:18.273,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I could decide that I'm hungry

97
0:04:19.827,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but know that it's not a great time to eat.

98
0:04:23.358,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And then when we get together with someone for pizza,

99
0:04:26.02,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we're not competing with them,

100
0:04:28.87,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we're looking for an experience

101
0:04:30.37,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that both of us will share

102
0:04:31.656,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that's satisfying for both of us,

103
0:04:33.63,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and when you get together for pizza with somebody,

104
0:04:36.635,000 --> 0:04:37,000
what's the first thing you do?

105
0:04:38.183,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You talk about it.

106
0:04:40.105,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You talk about what you want.

107
0:04:41.636,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You talk about what you like.

108
0:04:43.129,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You may even negotiate it.

109
0:04:44.685,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"How do you feel about pepperoni?" (Laughter)

110
0:04:47.454,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"Not so much, I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself."

111
0:04:50.081,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"Well, maybe we can go half and half."

112
0:04:52.147,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And even if you've had pizza with somebody

113
0:04:54.171,000 --> 0:04:57,000
for a very long time,

114
0:04:57.206,000 --> 0:04:59,000
don't you still say things like,

115
0:04:59.268,000 --> 0:05:,000
"Should we get the usual?"

116
0:05:01.261,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:02.424,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"Or maybe something a little more adventurous?"

118
0:05:06.181,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Okay, so when you're playing baseball,

119
0:05:08.015,000 --> 0:05:1,000
so if we talk about during sexual activity,

120
0:05:10.133,000 --> 0:05:11,000
when you're playing baseball,

121
0:05:11.538,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you're just supposed to round the bases

122
0:05:14.066,000 --> 0:05:16,000
in the proper order one at a time.

123
0:05:16.546,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You can't hit the ball and run to right field.

124
0:05:18.761,000 --> 0:05:19,000
That doesn't work.

125
0:05:19.983,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And you also can't get to second base and say,

126
0:05:22.301,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"I like it here. I'm going to stay here."

127
0:05:26.701,000 --> 0:05:27,000
No.

128
0:05:28.122,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And also, of course, with baseball, there's, like,

129
0:05:30.527,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the specific equipment and a specific skill set.

130
0:05:33.027,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive.

131
0:05:36.654,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Okay, but what about pizza?

132
0:05:38.312,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza,

133
0:05:40.908,000 --> 0:05:42,000
isn't it all about what's our pleasure?

134
0:05:43.593,000 --> 0:05:44,000
There are a million different kinds of pizza.

135
0:05:45.325,000 --> 0:05:46,000
There's a million different toppings.

136
0:05:47.111,000 --> 0:05:49,000
There's a million different ways to eat pizza.

137
0:05:49.413,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And none of them are wrong. They're different.

138
0:05:52.362,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And in this case, difference is good,

139
0:05:54.81,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because that's going to increase the chance

140
0:05:56.882,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that we're having a satisfying experience.

141
0:05:59.466,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And lastly, what's the expected outcome of baseball?

142
0:06:02.426,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Well, in baseball, you play to win.

143
0:06:06.124,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You score as many runs as you can.

144
0:06:08.657,000 --> 0:06:09,000
There's always a winner in baseball,

145
0:06:10.645,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and that means there's always a loser in baseball.

146
0:06:14.066,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But what about pizza?

147
0:06:15.722,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Well, in pizza, we're not really --

148
0:06:17.933,000 --> 0:06:2,000
there's no winning. How do you win pizza?

149
0:06:21.6,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You don't. But you do look for,

150
0:06:24.855,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"Are we satisfied?"

151
0:06:26.576,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And sometimes that can be different amounts

152
0:06:28.648,000 --> 0:06:3,000
over different times or with different people

153
0:06:30.815,000 --> 0:06:31,000
or on different days.

154
0:06:32.732,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And we get to decide when we feel satisfied.

155
0:06:35.862,000 --> 0:06:37,000
If we're still hungry, we might have some more.

156
0:06:38.7,000 --> 0:06:39,000
If you eat too much, though,

157
0:06:40.238,000 --> 0:06:41,000
you just feel gross.

158
0:06:42.143,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

159
0:06:44.552,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So what if we could take this pizza model

160
0:06:47.238,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and overlay it on top of sexuality education?

161
0:06:50.61,000 --> 0:06:52,000
A lot of sexuality education that happens today

162
0:06:53.149,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is so influenced by the baseball model,

163
0:06:56.575,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and it sets up education that can't help

164
0:07:00.368,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people.

165
0:07:04.101,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And those young people become older people.

166
0:07:06.364,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But if we could create sexuality education

167
0:07:09.823,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that was more like pizza,

168
0:07:12.172,000 --> 0:07:15,000
we could create education that invites people

169
0:07:15.62,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to think about their own desires,

170
0:07:17.915,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to make deliberate decisions about what they want,

171
0:07:21.167,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to talk about it with their partners,

172
0:07:23.799,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and to ultimately look for

173
0:07:25.472,000 --> 0:07:28,000
not some external outcome

174
0:07:28.616,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but for what feels satisfying,

175
0:07:31.773,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and we get to decide that.

176
0:07:34.292,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You may have noticed

177
0:07:35.053,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in the baseball and pizza comparison,

178
0:07:37.932,000 --> 0:07:39,000
under the baseball, it's all commands.

179
0:07:40.772,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They're all exclamation points.

180
0:07:42.869,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But under the pizza model, they're questions.

181
0:07:45.938,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And who gets to answer those questions?

182
0:07:47.82,000 --> 0:07:5,000
You do. I do.

183
0:07:51.48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So remember, when we're thinking about

184
0:07:53.38,000 --> 0:07:55,000
sexuality education and sexual activity,

185
0:07:56.126,000 --> 0:07:58,000
baseball, you're out.

186
0:07:58.316,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Pizza is the way to think about healthy,

187
0:08:01.548,000 --> 0:08:03,000
satisfying sexual activity,

188
0:08:03.988,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and good, comprehensive sexuality education.

189
0:08:06.928,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Thank you very much for your time.

190
0:08:09.158,000 --> 0:08:13,000

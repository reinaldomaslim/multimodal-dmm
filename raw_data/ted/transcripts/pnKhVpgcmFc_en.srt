1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
They wanted her piecemealed, papier-mâchéd,

2
0:00:16.28,000 --> 0:00:19,000
practically broken, limp-like and loveless,

3
0:00:20.119,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a litany of exaggeration.

4
0:00:22.68,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They wanted her low.

5
0:00:24.48,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And high.

6
0:00:25.96,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Flat and wide.

7
0:00:28.56,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Filled with all of their empty.

8
0:00:31.28,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They wanted her to be more like them.

9
0:00:34.6,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Not knowing her conception was immaculate.

10
0:00:37.36,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That she was birthed in sandalwood-scented river water,

11
0:00:40.52,000 --> 0:00:42,000
sweet sapphire honey-touched tongue,

12
0:00:42.6,000 --> 0:00:44,000
she was too much of a mouthful for the greedy.

13
0:00:45.32,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Just a small amount of her was more than they could stand.

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Oh, they wanted her bland.

15
0:00:49.96,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And barren.

16
0:00:51.2,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Unspirited, un-African, uncultured,

17
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
under siege in the streets.

18
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
They wanted her face down, ass up, hands cuffed and ankles strapped.

19
0:01:00.64,000 --> 0:01:02,000
They wanted her knowing she could never want them back.

20
0:01:03.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Oh, they wanted her holy,

21
0:01:05.48,000 --> 0:01:06,000
baptized in her divine,

22
0:01:07.36,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they wanted her secrets,

23
0:01:08.92,000 --> 0:01:09,000
pearls to swine.

24
0:01:10.6,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They wanted to unravel the mystery of her design.

25
0:01:14.12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Fascinated by glory, hypnotized by her kind.

26
0:01:17.56,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Oh, they wanted her complete.

27
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:2,000
They wanted her whole,

28
0:01:20.92,000 --> 0:01:23,000
though they came fractioned, half-hearted, half-soul,

29
0:01:24.48,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with no regards and no knowledge as to who she really was.

30
0:01:27.72,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Oh, but if they knew.

31
0:01:29.8,000 --> 0:01:3,000
If they knew her,

32
0:01:31.88,000 --> 0:01:34,000
praise songs would rain from the clouds of their eyes,

33
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
clearing the vision, bathing the heart.

34
0:01:37.52,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They would bow every time they saw her.

35
0:01:40.6,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Be their best selves when she was around.

36
0:01:43.48,000 --> 0:01:44,000
If they knew her,

37
0:01:45.04,000 --> 0:01:47,000
knew she was the glue to their revolution,

38
0:01:47.92,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the life flow of blood through their veins.

39
0:01:50.48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
If they knew her,

40
0:01:52.36,000 --> 0:01:53,000
she would know,

41
0:01:54.52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
she would feel

42
0:01:56.56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that her body is more than battlefield.

43
0:01:59.84,000 --> 0:02:02,000
More than bone break and bleeding bigotry.

44
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:06,000
More than bridge over your troubled conscience.

45
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
More than used up, walked on, driven through, shot up.

46
0:02:09.84,000 --> 0:02:12,000
More than your "Selma, Lord, Selma" Edmund Pettus.

47
0:02:13.08,000 --> 0:02:15,000
More than your killer Katrina Danziger.

48
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
More than your bust them out of Baltimore "Highway to Nowhere."

49
0:02:19.52,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If they knew her,

50
0:02:21.639,000 --> 0:02:22,000
she would know.

51
0:02:23.72,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Singing)

52
0:02:51.24,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Wild women,

53
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
wild women, they walk with buffalo.

54
0:02:55.76,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Have lightning on their tongues,

55
0:02:57.52,000 --> 0:02:58,000
fly whisks as weapons.

56
0:02:59.24,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Wild women, they walk with machetes.

57
0:03:01.96,000 --> 0:03:04,000
With wisdom, with grace, with ease.

58
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Wild women have hurricanes in their bellies,

59
0:03:07.96,000 --> 0:03:08,000
releasing a flood of a lesson.

60
0:03:09.88,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Oh, wild women, they fly free.

61
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Just watch their ways, how they rip and shred.

62
0:03:15.56,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Oh, who can understand her,

63
0:03:17.44,000 --> 0:03:19,000
this winding Niger river of a woman

64
0:03:20.4,000 --> 0:03:22,000
one who is unafraid to tear away

65
0:03:23.12,000 --> 0:03:26,000
only to roam and then become the wind.

66
0:03:26.68,000 --> 0:03:29,000
She who speaks in gusts and cyclones

67
0:03:30.2,000 --> 0:03:33,000
blasting us back to high ground, high consciousness,

68
0:03:34.04,000 --> 0:03:36,000
she turns and so does the world.

69
0:03:37.04,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Feel her spinning,

70
0:03:38.44,000 --> 0:03:4,000
spanning several lifetimes.

71
0:03:40.48,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Hear her speaking, sparking alarm.

72
0:03:43.88,000 --> 0:03:45,000
See her dancing, summoning the dead,

73
0:03:46.8,000 --> 0:03:47,000
resurrecting new life.

74
0:03:48.64,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Heaven hears her knocking on the door,

75
0:03:51.76,000 --> 0:03:54,000
safely transporting the ones who call for her assistance.

76
0:03:55.44,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Wild women, they open portals to new worlds,

77
0:03:59.2,000 --> 0:04:01,000
new speech, new dreams.

78
0:04:02.72,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Oh, dearly beloveds,

79
0:04:05.08,000 --> 0:04:08,000
so dearly departed from the ways of the guardian,

80
0:04:08.88,000 --> 0:04:09,000
beware.

81
0:04:10.48,000 --> 0:04:14,000
For wild women are not to be tamed.

82
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Only admired.

83
0:04:17.96,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Just let her in and witness her set your days ablaze.

84
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Cheers) (Applause)

85
0:04:27.32,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Thank you.

86
0:04:28.56,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Applause)

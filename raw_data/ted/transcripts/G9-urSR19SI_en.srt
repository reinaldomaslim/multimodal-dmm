1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So, a few years ago,

2
0:00:14.375,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was beginning a new unit on race with my fourth-graders.

3
0:00:18.042,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And whenever we start a new unit,

4
0:00:20.25,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I like to begin by having all the students list everything they know about it,

5
0:00:23.958,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and then we also list questions we have.

6
0:00:26.667,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I had the type of moment that every teacher has nightmares about.

7
0:00:31.125,000 --> 0:00:33,000
One of my students had just asked the question,

8
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Why are some people racist?"

9
0:00:36.292,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And another student, let's call her Abby,

10
0:00:39.125,000 --> 0:00:41,000
had just raised her hand and volunteered:

11
0:00:41.917,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Maybe some people don't like black people because their skin is the color of poop."

12
0:00:47.542,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Yeah, I know.

13
0:00:48.833,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So, as if on cue, my entire class exploded.

14
0:00:53.667,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Half of them immediately started laughing,

15
0:00:55.708,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and the other half started yelling at Abby

16
0:00:57.732,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and shouting things like,

17
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
"Oh, my God, you can't say that, that's racist!"

18
0:01:01.375,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So just take a second to freeze this scene in your mind.

19
0:01:04.792,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There's a class of nine- and ten-year-olds,

20
0:01:07.083,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and half of them are in hysterics

21
0:01:08.958,000 --> 0:01:11,000
because they think Abby has said something wildly funny,

22
0:01:12.875,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the other half are yelling at her for saying something offensive.

23
0:01:16.5,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And then you have Abby, sitting there completely bewildered

24
0:01:19.417,000 --> 0:01:22,000
because, in her mind, she doesn't understand the weight of what she said

25
0:01:22.875,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and why everybody is reacting this way.

26
0:01:25.708,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And then you have me, the teacher,

27
0:01:27.375,000 --> 0:01:3,000
standing there in the corner, like, about to have a panic attack.

28
0:01:30.583,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So as a classroom teacher,

29
0:01:32.042,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I have to make split-second decisions all the time.

30
0:01:35.542,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I knew I needed to react, but how?

31
0:01:38.875,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Consider your fight-or-flight instincts.

32
0:01:42.042,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I could fight by raising my voice and reprimanding her for her words.

33
0:01:47.792,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Or flight -- just change the subject

34
0:01:50.417,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and quickly start reaching for another subject,

35
0:01:52.708,000 --> 0:01:55,000
like anything to get my students' minds off the word "poop."

36
0:01:57.042,000 --> 0:02:01,000
However, as we know, the right thing to do is often not the easy thing to do.

37
0:02:01.667,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And as much as I wanted this moment to be over,

38
0:02:04.583,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and that I knew both of these options would help me escape the situation,

39
0:02:08.875,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I knew that this was far too important of a teachable moment to miss.

40
0:02:13.917,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So after standing there for what felt like an eternity,

41
0:02:17.292,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I unfroze and I turned to face my class, and I said,

42
0:02:22.292,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"Actually, Abby makes a point."

43
0:02:26.042,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And my students kind of looked at each other, all confused.

44
0:02:29.25,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I continued,

45
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"One reason why racism exists

46
0:02:33.375,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is because people with light skin have looked at people with dark skin

47
0:02:37.167,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and said that their skin was ugly.

48
0:02:39.333,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And even use this reason as an excuse to dehumanize them.

49
0:02:44.167,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And the reason why we're learning about race and racism in the first place

50
0:02:47.792,000 --> 0:02:49,000
is to educate ourselves to know better.

51
0:02:50.792,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And to understand why comments like this are hurtful,

52
0:02:53.833,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and to make sure that people with dark skin

53
0:02:55.917,000 --> 0:02:58,000
are always treated with respect and kindness."

54
0:02:59.583,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, this was a truly terrifying teachable moment.

55
0:03:03.417,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But as we moved forward in the conversation,

56
0:03:05.917,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I noticed that both Abby and the rest of the kids

57
0:03:08.25,000 --> 0:03:09,000
were still willing to engage.

58
0:03:09.917,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And as I watched the conversation really marinate with my students,

59
0:03:13.625,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I began to wonder how many of my students have assumptions just like Abby.

60
0:03:19.375,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And what happens when those assumptions go unnoticed and unaddressed,

61
0:03:22.708,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as they so often do?

62
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But first, I think it's important to take a step back

63
0:03:27.542,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and even consider what makes a topic taboo.

64
0:03:30.457,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I don't remember receiving an official list of things

65
0:03:32.958,000 --> 0:03:33,000
you're not supposed to talk about.

66
0:03:34.708,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But I do remember hearing, over and over, growing up:

67
0:03:38.25,000 --> 0:03:41,000
there are two things you do not talk about at family get-togethers.

68
0:03:41.583,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And those two things are religion and politics.

69
0:03:46.667,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And I always thought this was very curious

70
0:03:49.333,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because religion and politics often are such huge influencing factors

71
0:03:53.833,000 --> 0:03:56,000
over so many of our identities and beliefs.

72
0:03:56.958,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But what makes a topic taboo

73
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is that feeling of discomfort that arises when these things come up in conversation.

74
0:04:04.5,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But some people are extremely fluent in the language of equity,

75
0:04:09.542,000 --> 0:04:11,000
while other people fear being PC-shamed

76
0:04:12.208,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or that their ignorance will show as soon as they open their mouths.

77
0:04:15.625,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But I believe that the first step towards holding conversations

78
0:04:19.542,000 --> 0:04:2,000
about things like equity

79
0:04:20.833,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is to begin by building a common language.

80
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And that actually starts with destigmatizing topics

81
0:04:25.417,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that are typically deemed taboo.

82
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, conversations around race, for example,

83
0:04:31.458,000 --> 0:04:32,000
have their own specific language

84
0:04:33.458,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and students need to be fluent in this language

85
0:04:35.792,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in order to have these conversations.

86
0:04:38.708,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now, schools are often the only place

87
0:04:41.5,000 --> 0:04:43,000
where students can feel free and comfortable

88
0:04:43.833,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to ask questions and make mistakes.

89
0:04:45.917,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But, unfortunately, not all students feel that sense of security.

90
0:04:50.833,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now, I knew that day in front of my fourth-graders

91
0:04:53.417,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that how I chose to respond could actually have life-long implications

92
0:04:57.583,000 --> 0:05:01,000
not only for Abby, but for the rest of the students in my class.

93
0:05:01.875,000 --> 0:05:04,000
If I had brushed her words aside,

94
0:05:05.5,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the rest of the class could actually infer that this type of comment is acceptable.

95
0:05:09.792,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But if I had yelled at Abby

96
0:05:12.458,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and embarrassed her in front of all of her friends,

97
0:05:15.167,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that feeling of shame associated with one of her first conversations on race

98
0:05:19.375,000 --> 0:05:22,000
could actually prevent her from ever engaging on that topic again.

99
0:05:23.542,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Now, teaching kids about equity in schools is not teaching them what to think.

100
0:05:30.708,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It is about giving them the tools and strategies and language

101
0:05:33.833,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and opportunities to practice how to think.

102
0:05:36.708,000 --> 0:05:39,000
For example, think about how we teach kids how to read.

103
0:05:40.042,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We don't start by giving them books.

104
0:05:41.792,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We start by breaking down words into letters and sounds

105
0:05:44.833,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and we encourage them to practice their fluency by reading every single day,

106
0:05:49.5,000 --> 0:05:51,000
with a partner or with their friends.

107
0:05:52.208,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And we give them lots of comprehension questions

108
0:05:55.208,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to make sure that they're understanding what they're reading.

109
0:05:58.125,000 --> 0:06:,000
And I believe that teaching kids about equity

110
0:06:00.625,000 --> 0:06:03,000
should be approached in the exact same way.

111
0:06:04.333,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I like to start by giving my students a survey every year,

112
0:06:07.875,000 --> 0:06:1,000
about different issues around equity and inclusion.

113
0:06:11.333,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And this is a sample survey from one of my kids,

114
0:06:13.958,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and as you can see, there's some humor in here.

115
0:06:16.75,000 --> 0:06:18,000
For under the question, "What is race?"

116
0:06:18.792,000 --> 0:06:2,000
she has written, "When two or more cars, people and animals

117
0:06:21.583,000 --> 0:06:24,000
run to see who is fastest and who wins."

118
0:06:25.083,000 --> 0:06:28,000
However, if you look at her question, "What is racism?"

119
0:06:28.792,000 --> 0:06:31,000
it says, "When somebody says or calls someone dark-skinned a mean name."

120
0:06:32.583,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So, she's young, but she's showing that she's beginning to understand.

121
0:06:36.25,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And when we act

122
0:06:37.542,000 --> 0:06:41,000
like our students aren't capable of having these conversations,

123
0:06:41.583,000 --> 0:06:44,000
we actually do them such a disservice.

124
0:06:46.083,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now, I also know that these types of conversations

125
0:06:50.292,000 --> 0:06:52,000
can seem really, really intimidating with our students,

126
0:06:53.167,000 --> 0:06:54,000
especially with young learners.

127
0:06:55.125,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But I have taught first through fifth grades,

128
0:06:57.833,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and I can tell you, for example,

129
0:06:59.708,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that I'm not going to walk into a first-grade classroom

130
0:07:02.333,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and start talking about things like mass incarceration.

131
0:07:05.792,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But even a six-year-old first-grader can understand the difference

132
0:07:10.375,000 --> 0:07:15,000
between what is fair -- people getting what they need.

133
0:07:15.833,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We identified a lot of these things in class together.

134
0:07:19.125,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And the difference between fair and equal --

135
0:07:22.333,000 --> 0:07:24,000
when everybody gets the same thing,

136
0:07:24.583,000 --> 0:07:26,000
especially goody bags at birthday parties.

137
0:07:27.792,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Now, first-graders can also understand the difference

138
0:07:30.833,000 --> 0:07:33,000
between a punishment and a consequence.

139
0:07:34.042,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And all of these things are foundational concepts

140
0:07:36.5,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that anyone needs to understand

141
0:07:38.375,000 --> 0:07:39,000
before having a conversation

142
0:07:39.792,000 --> 0:07:42,000
about mass incarceration in the United States.

143
0:07:42.875,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Some people might think that kindergarteners or first-graders

144
0:07:45.792,000 --> 0:07:47,000
are too young to have conversations around racism,

145
0:07:48.458,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but also tell you that young kids

146
0:07:50.583,000 --> 0:07:52,000
understand that there are many different components

147
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that make up our identities

148
0:07:54.333,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and how people are similar and different,

149
0:07:56.917,000 --> 0:08:,000
and what it means to have power when other people don't.

150
0:08:01.042,000 --> 0:08:03,000
When we have these conversations with students at a young age,

151
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it actually takes away some of that taboo feeling

152
0:08:06.375,000 --> 0:08:08,000
when those topics come up at a later age.

153
0:08:09.833,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I also know that teaching about these things in schools

154
0:08:12.458,000 --> 0:08:14,000
can feel like navigating a minefield.

155
0:08:15.417,000 --> 0:08:18,000
For example, what happens if parents or families

156
0:08:18.5,000 --> 0:08:21,000
aren't on board with having these conversations in schools?

157
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But to these people, I can say:

158
0:08:23.542,000 --> 0:08:27,000
these are some examples of things that students have said to me

159
0:08:27.708,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and brought to my attention.

160
0:08:29.667,000 --> 0:08:32,000
For example, I had a student come in and whisper to me,

161
0:08:33.333,000 --> 0:08:36,000
"I've heard all these people use the term LGBTQ,

162
0:08:36.833,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but I don't know what it means and I'm too embarrassed to admit it."

163
0:08:40.75,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I had a student come in over a weekend and come up to me and say,

164
0:08:44.875,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"You know, I just watched this movie about Australia,

165
0:08:47.457,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and it made me wonder if they have racism there, too."

166
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And I always want my students to be comfortable having these conversations

167
0:08:55.417,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because when they're comfortable talking about it and asking questions,

168
0:08:59.125,000 --> 0:09:02,000
they also build comfort in bringing in their own lives and experiences

169
0:09:02.458,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in how they relate to these big topics.

170
0:09:05.25,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Also, some teachers might be kind of nervous

171
0:09:08.667,000 --> 0:09:1,000
if a student brings up a topic or asks a question

172
0:09:11.333,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and they don't know the answer to it.

173
0:09:13.625,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But if a student ever brings something to my attention

174
0:09:16.833,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and I don't know the answer,

175
0:09:18.5,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I will always admit it and own it

176
0:09:20.417,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in something

177
0:09:23.333,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that I don't have experience in or I'm not an authority on.

178
0:09:26.542,000 --> 0:09:27,000
That same year, I had a student come in

179
0:09:28.542,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and ask a question about the LGBTQ community.

180
0:09:31.583,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And I just didn't know enough to give them an appropriate answer.

181
0:09:35.375,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So instead, I encouraged that student

182
0:09:37.375,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to reach out and ask that question to a representative of a nonprofit

183
0:09:40.833,000 --> 0:09:43,000
who had come to speak to our class about that very same issue.

184
0:09:44.5,000 --> 0:09:47,000
When we admit to our students that we don't have all the answers,

185
0:09:47.792,000 --> 0:09:49,000
not only does it humanize us to them,

186
0:09:50.292,000 --> 0:09:52,000
it also shows them that adults have a long way to go, too,

187
0:09:53.083,000 --> 0:09:55,000
when it comes to learning about issues of equity.

188
0:09:56.708,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now, a little while back, I wrote a lesson about consent.

189
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And, to some people, this was very exciting

190
0:10:03.042,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because I took this topic that seemed very taboo and scary

191
0:10:06.583,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and I broke it down into a way that was accessible for young learners.

192
0:10:10.583,000 --> 0:10:11,000
However, to other people,

193
0:10:12.375,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the idea of consent is so strongly tied to sex,

194
0:10:15.583,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and sex is often considered a taboo subject,

195
0:10:18.125,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that it made them very uncomfortable.

196
0:10:20.625,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But my students are third-graders,

197
0:10:22.75,000 --> 0:10:24,000
so we're not talking about sex in class.

198
0:10:25.417,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Rather, I wanted them to understand

199
0:10:27.208,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that everybody has different physical boundaries

200
0:10:29.583,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that make them feel comfortable.

201
0:10:31.5,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And the social and emotional intelligence it takes

202
0:10:34.167,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to read somebody's words and tone and body language

203
0:10:37.083,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are skills that often need to be explicitly taught,

204
0:10:39.542,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the same way we teach things like reading and math.

205
0:10:42.875,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And this lesson is not reserved for students of one single demographic.

206
0:10:47.125,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Things like questioning and making observations

207
0:10:49.34,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and critical thinking

208
0:10:50.625,000 --> 0:10:52,000
are things that any student of any race or ethnicity

209
0:10:53.167,000 --> 0:10:58,000
or background or language or income or zip code should be learning in schools.

210
0:10:59.25,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Also, deliberate avoidance of these conversations

211
0:11:03.542,000 --> 0:11:05,000
speaks volumes to our students

212
0:11:05.917,000 --> 0:11:09,000
because kids notice when their teachers, when their textbooks

213
0:11:10.625,000 --> 0:11:14,000
leave out the voices and experiences of people like women or people of color.

214
0:11:15.208,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Silence speaks volumes.

215
0:11:18.625,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I recently asked my class of third-graders

216
0:11:21.042,000 --> 0:11:23,000
what they would say to adults who think they're too young

217
0:11:23.75,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to learn about issues of equity.

218
0:11:26.375,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And while this is a small sample of my 25 students,

219
0:11:31.333,000 --> 0:11:32,000
all of them agreed

220
0:11:32.625,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that not only are they capable of having these conversations,

221
0:11:35.917,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but they view it, the right to learn it, as a right and not as a privilege.

222
0:11:41.583,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And, in their words:

223
0:11:43.917,000 --> 0:11:45,000
"We're big enough to know about these things

224
0:11:46.083,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because these problems are happening where we live.

225
0:11:48.958,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And we have the right to talk about them

226
0:11:51.083,000 --> 0:11:54,000
because it will be our life in the future."

227
0:11:54.417,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Thank you.

228
0:11:55.708,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Applause)

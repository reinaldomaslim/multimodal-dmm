1
0:00:12.776,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to talk about sex for money.

2
0:00:15.413,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm not like most of the people you'll have heard speaking

3
0:00:18.207,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about prostitution before.

4
0:00:19.539,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm not a police officer or a social worker.

5
0:00:23.11,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm not an academic, a journalist or a politician.

6
0:00:26.329,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And as you'll probably have picked up from Maryam's blurb,

7
0:00:29.101,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm not a nun, either.

8
0:00:30.326,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:31.439,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Most of those people would tell you that selling sex is degrading;

10
0:00:35.431,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that no one would ever choose to do it;

11
0:00:37.59,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that it's dangerous; women get abused and killed.

12
0:00:41.039,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In fact, most of those people would say,

13
0:00:42.99,000 --> 0:00:43,000
"There should be a law against it!"

14
0:00:44.802,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.

15
0:00:47.896,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It sounded reasonable to me until the closing months of 2009,

16
0:00:51.832,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when I was working two dead-end, minimum-wage jobs.

17
0:00:55.789,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Every month my wages would just replenish my overdraft.

18
0:00:59.072,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I was exhausted and my life was going nowhere.

19
0:01:02.124,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Like many others before me,

20
0:01:04.057,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I decided sex for money was a better option.

21
0:01:07.203,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now don't get me wrong --

22
0:01:08.465,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I would have loved to have won the lottery instead.

23
0:01:10.896,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But it wasn't going to happen anytime soon,

24
0:01:13.015,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and my rent needed paying.

25
0:01:14.832,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So I signed up for my first shift in a brothel.

26
0:01:18.255,000 --> 0:01:19,000
In the years that have passed,

27
0:01:20.044,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I've had a lot of time to think.

28
0:01:22.296,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I've reconsidered the ideas I once had about prostitution.

29
0:01:25.941,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I've given a lot of thought to consent

30
0:01:27.87,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the nature of work under capitalism.

31
0:01:30.552,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I've thought about gender inequality

32
0:01:32.362,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the sexual and reproductive labor of women.

33
0:01:35.497,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I've experienced exploitation and violence at work.

34
0:01:39.142,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I've thought about what's needed

35
0:01:40.741,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to protect other sex workers from these things.

36
0:01:42.995,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Maybe you've thought about them, too.

37
0:01:45.128,000 --> 0:01:46,000
In this talk,

38
0:01:46.309,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I'll take you through the four main legal approaches

39
0:01:48.802,000 --> 0:01:49,000
applied to sex work throughout the world,

40
0:01:50.81,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and explain why they don't work;

41
0:01:52.397,000 --> 0:01:55,000
why prohibiting the sex industry actually exacerbates every harm

42
0:01:55.579,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that sex workers are vulnerable to.

43
0:01:58.122,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Then I'm going tell you about what we, as sex workers, actually want.

44
0:02:03.508,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The first approach is full criminalization.

45
0:02:06.926,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Half the world,

46
0:02:08.1,000 --> 0:02:1,000
including Russia, South Africa and most of the US,

47
0:02:10.618,000 --> 0:02:12,000
regulates sex work by criminalizing everyone involved.

48
0:02:13.569,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So that's seller, buyer and third parties.

49
0:02:16.721,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Lawmakers in these countries apparently hope

50
0:02:18.83,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that the fear of getting arrested will deter people from selling sex.

51
0:02:22.726,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But if you're forced to choose between obeying the law

52
0:02:25.302,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and feeding yourself or your family,

53
0:02:27.31,000 --> 0:02:28,000
you're going to do the work anyway,

54
0:02:29.111,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and take the risk.

55
0:02:30.57,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Criminalization is a trap.

56
0:02:32.938,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's hard to get a conventional job when you have a criminal record.

57
0:02:36.609,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Potential employers won't hire you.

58
0:02:38.995,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Assuming you still need money,

59
0:02:40.449,000 --> 0:02:42,000
you'll stay in the more flexible, informal economy.

60
0:02:43.264,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The law forces you to keep selling sex,

61
0:02:45.8,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which is the exact opposite of its intended effect.

62
0:02:49.433,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself.

63
0:02:53.568,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In many places you may be coerced into paying a bribe

64
0:02:56.357,000 --> 0:02:58,000
or even into having sex with a police officer

65
0:02:58.736,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to avoid arrest.

66
0:03:00.432,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Police and prison guards in Cambodia, for example,

67
0:03:03.384,000 --> 0:03:05,000
have been documented subjecting sex workers

68
0:03:05.432,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to what can only be described as torture:

69
0:03:07.745,000 --> 0:03:08,000
threats at gunpoint,

70
0:03:08.92,000 --> 0:03:1,000
beatings, electric shocks, rape

71
0:03:11.736,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and denial of food.

72
0:03:13.633,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Another worrying thing:

73
0:03:15.337,000 --> 0:03:19,000
if you're selling sex in places like Kenya, South Africa or New York,

74
0:03:19.76,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a police officer can arrest you if you're caught carrying condoms,

75
0:03:23.48,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because condoms can legally be used as evidence that you're selling sex.

76
0:03:27.506,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Obviously, this increases HIV risk.

77
0:03:29.972,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Imagine knowing if you're busted carrying condoms,

78
0:03:32.456,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it'll be used against you.

79
0:03:34.334,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It's a pretty strong incentive to leave them at home, right?

80
0:03:37.36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Sex workers working in these places are forced to make a tough choice

81
0:03:40.69,000 --> 0:03:42,000
between risking arrest or having risky sex.

82
0:03:44.033,000 --> 0:03:45,000
What would you choose?

83
0:03:45.77,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Would you pack condoms to go to work?

84
0:03:48.447,000 --> 0:03:49,000
How about if you're worried

85
0:03:49.773,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the police officer would rape you when he got you in the van?

86
0:03:53.285,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The second approach to regulating sex work seen in these countries

87
0:03:56.832,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is partial criminalization,

88
0:03:58.248,000 --> 0:04:,000
where the buying and selling of sex are legal,

89
0:04:00.824,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but surrounding activities,

90
0:04:02.143,000 --> 0:04:05,000
like brothel-keeping or soliciting on the street, are banned.

91
0:04:05.862,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Laws like these --

92
0:04:07.046,000 --> 0:04:08,000
we have them in the UK and in France --

93
0:04:08.959,000 --> 0:04:09,000
essentially say to us sex workers,

94
0:04:10.641,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"Hey, we don't mind you selling sex,

95
0:04:12.483,000 --> 0:04:14,000
just make sure it's done behind closed doors

96
0:04:14.594,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and all alone."

97
0:04:16.105,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And brothel-keeping, by the way,

98
0:04:17.914,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is defined as just two or more sex workers working together.

99
0:04:20.977,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Making that illegal means that many of us work alone,

100
0:04:23.834,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which obviously makes us vulnerable to violent offenders.

101
0:04:26.681,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But we're also vulnerable

102
0:04:27.935,000 --> 0:04:29,000
if we choose to break the law by working together.

103
0:04:31.429,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A couple of years ago,

104
0:04:32.603,000 --> 0:04:34,000
a friend of mine was nervous after she was attacked at work,

105
0:04:35.496,000 --> 0:04:38,000
so I said that she could see her clients from my place for a while.

106
0:04:39.209,000 --> 0:04:4,000
During that time,

107
0:04:40.455,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we had another guy turn nasty.

108
0:04:42.411,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I told the guy to leave or I'd call the police.

109
0:04:45.163,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And he looked at the two of us and said,

110
0:04:47.778,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"You girls can't call the cops.

111
0:04:49.912,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You're working together, this place is illegal."

112
0:04:52.684,000 --> 0:04:53,000
He was right.

113
0:04:53.871,000 --> 0:04:55,000
He eventually left without getting physically violent,

114
0:04:56.478,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but the knowledge that we were breaking the law

115
0:04:58.726,000 --> 0:04:59,000
empowered that man to threaten us.

116
0:05:00.44,000 --> 0:05:02,000
He felt confident he'd get away with it.

117
0:05:02.829,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The prohibition of street prostitution also causes more harm

118
0:05:05.768,000 --> 0:05:06,000
than it prevents.

119
0:05:06.944,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Firstly, to avoid getting arrested,

120
0:05:08.96,000 --> 0:05:1,000
street workers take risks to avoid detection,

121
0:05:11.247,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and that means working alone

122
0:05:12.634,000 --> 0:05:14,000
or in isolated locations like dark forests

123
0:05:14.693,000 --> 0:05:16,000
where they're vulnerable to attack.

124
0:05:16.769,000 --> 0:05:17,000
If you're caught selling sex outdoors,

125
0:05:18.69,000 --> 0:05:19,000
you pay a fine.

126
0:05:20.353,000 --> 0:05:22,000
How do you pay that fine without going back to the streets?

127
0:05:23.176,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It was the need for money that saw you in the streets

128
0:05:25.747,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in the first place.

129
0:05:26.922,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And so the fines stack up,

130
0:05:28.469,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and you're caught in a vicious cycle

131
0:05:30.231,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of selling sex to pay the fines you got for selling sex.

132
0:05:34.17,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Let me tell you about Mariana Popa who worked in Redbridge, East London.

133
0:05:37.916,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The street workers on her patch would normally wait for clients in groups

134
0:05:41.467,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for safety in numbers

135
0:05:42.787,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and to warn each other about how to avoid dangerous guys.

136
0:05:46.142,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But during a police crackdown on sex workers and their clients,

137
0:05:49.834,000 --> 0:05:51,000
she was forced to work alone to avoid being arrested.

138
0:05:53.446,000 --> 0:05:57,000
She was stabbed to death in the early hours of October 29, 2013.

139
0:05:58.009,000 --> 0:05:59,000
She had been working later than usual

140
0:05:59.838,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to try to pay off a fine she had received for soliciting.

141
0:06:03.994,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So if criminalizing sex workers hurts them,

142
0:06:06.753,000 --> 0:06:08,000
why not just criminalize the people who buy sex?

143
0:06:09.854,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is the aim of the third approach

144
0:06:11.716,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I want to talk about --

145
0:06:12.898,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the Swedish or Nordic model of sex-work law.

146
0:06:15.01,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The idea behind this law

147
0:06:16.261,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is that selling sex is intrinsically harmful

148
0:06:18.748,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and so you're, in fact, helping sex workers by removing the option.

149
0:06:22.839,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Despite growing support

150
0:06:24.026,000 --> 0:06:26,000
for what's often described as the "end demand" approach,

151
0:06:26.732,000 --> 0:06:27,000
there's no evidence that it works.

152
0:06:28.399,000 --> 0:06:31,000
There's just as much prostitution in Sweden as there was before.

153
0:06:31.762,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Why might that be?

154
0:06:34.039,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's because people selling sex

155
0:06:35.591,000 --> 0:06:37,000
often don't have other options for income.

156
0:06:37.731,000 --> 0:06:38,000
If you need that money,

157
0:06:38.907,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the only effect that a drop in business is going have

158
0:06:41.413,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is to force you to lower your prices

159
0:06:43.162,000 --> 0:06:45,000
or offer more risky sexual services.

160
0:06:45.591,000 --> 0:06:46,000
If you need to find more clients,

161
0:06:47.188,000 --> 0:06:48,000
you might seek the help of a manager.

162
0:06:49.01,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So you see, rather than putting a stop

163
0:06:51.014,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to what's often descried as pimping,

164
0:06:52.871,000 --> 0:06:54,000
a law like this actually gives oxygen

165
0:06:54.915,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to potentially abusive third parties.

166
0:06:57.606,000 --> 0:06:58,000
To keep safe in my work,

167
0:06:59.443,000 --> 0:07:,000
I try not to take bookings from someone

168
0:07:01.36,000 --> 0:07:02,000
who calls me from a withheld number.

169
0:07:03.134,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If it's a home or a hotel visit,

170
0:07:05.083,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I try to get a full name and details.

171
0:07:07.703,000 --> 0:07:09,000
If I worked under the Swedish model,

172
0:07:09.854,000 --> 0:07:11,000
a client would be too scared to give me that information.

173
0:07:12.576,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I might have no other choice

174
0:07:14.038,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but to accept a booking from a man who is untraceable

175
0:07:17.013,000 --> 0:07:18,000
if he later turns out to be violent.

176
0:07:19.832,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If you need their money,

177
0:07:21.071,000 --> 0:07:23,000
you need to protect your clients from the police.

178
0:07:23.467,000 --> 0:07:24,000
If you work outdoors,

179
0:07:24.648,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that means working alone or in isolated locations,

180
0:07:27.235,000 --> 0:07:29,000
just as if you were criminalized yourself.

181
0:07:29.474,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It might mean getting into cars quicker,

182
0:07:32.084,000 --> 0:07:34,000
less negotiating time means snap decisions.

183
0:07:35.015,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Is this guy dangerous or just nervous?

184
0:07:38.142,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Can you afford to take the risk?

185
0:07:40.492,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Can you afford not to?

186
0:07:43.555,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Something I'm often hearing is,

187
0:07:45.068,000 --> 0:07:46,000
"Prostitution would be fine

188
0:07:46.42,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if we made it legal and regulated it."

189
0:07:48.825,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We call that approach legalization,

190
0:07:50.626,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and it's used by countries like the Netherlands, Germany

191
0:07:53.446,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and Nevada in the US.

192
0:07:55.666,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But it's not a great model for human rights.

193
0:07:57.787,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And in state-controlled prostitution,

194
0:07:59.616,000 --> 0:08:,000
commercial sex can only happen

195
0:08:01.203,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in certain legally-designated areas or venues,

196
0:08:03.52,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and sex workers are made to comply with special restrictions,

197
0:08:06.534,000 --> 0:08:08,000
like registration and forced health checks.

198
0:08:10.014,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Regulation sounds great on paper,

199
0:08:12.187,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but politicians deliberately make regulation around the sex industry

200
0:08:15.491,000 --> 0:08:17,000
expensive and difficult to comply with.

201
0:08:18.182,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It creates a two-tiered system: legal and illegal work.

202
0:08:22.55,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We sometimes call it "backdoor criminalization."

203
0:08:25.576,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Rich, well-connected brothel owners can comply with the regulations,

204
0:08:29.021,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but more marginalized people find those hoops

205
0:08:31.218,000 --> 0:08:32,000
impossible to jump through.

206
0:08:33.196,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And even if it's possible in principle,

207
0:08:35.19,000 --> 0:08:37,000
getting a license or proper venue takes time and costs money.

208
0:08:38.199,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It's not going to be an option

209
0:08:39.702,000 --> 0:08:41,000
for someone who's desperate and needs money tonight.

210
0:08:42.18,000 --> 0:08:45,000
They might be a refugee or fleeing domestic abuse.

211
0:08:45.246,000 --> 0:08:46,000
In this two-tiered system,

212
0:08:46.809,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the most vulnerable people are forced to work illegally,

213
0:08:50.07,000 --> 0:08:53,000
so they're still exposed to all the dangers of criminalization

214
0:08:53.11,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I mentioned earlier.

215
0:08:54.57,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So.

216
0:08:55.753,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's looking like all attempts to control

217
0:08:57.859,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or prevent sex work from happening

218
0:08:59.565,000 --> 0:09:01,000
makes things more dangerous for people selling sex.

219
0:09:02.682,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Fear of law enforcement makes them work alone in isolated locations,

220
0:09:06.132,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and allows clients and even cops

221
0:09:07.863,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to get abusive in the knowledge they'll get away with it.

222
0:09:10.656,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Fines and criminal records force people to keep selling sex,

223
0:09:13.841,000 --> 0:09:14,000
rather than enabling them to stop.

224
0:09:16.325,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Crackdowns on buyers drive sellers to take dangerous risks

225
0:09:19.126,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and into the arms of potentially abusive managers.

226
0:09:21.487,000 --> 0:09:24,000
These laws also reinforce stigma and hatred against sex workers.

227
0:09:25.278,000 --> 0:09:28,000
When France temporarily brought in the Swedish model two years ago,

228
0:09:28.651,000 --> 0:09:29,000
ordinary citizens took it as a cue

229
0:09:30.65,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to start carrying out vigilante attacks

230
0:09:32.625,000 --> 0:09:34,000
against people working on the street.

231
0:09:34.788,000 --> 0:09:35,000
In Sweden, opinion surveys show

232
0:09:36.81,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that significantly more people want sex workers to be arrested now

233
0:09:40.789,000 --> 0:09:41,000
than before the law was brought in.

234
0:09:43.625,000 --> 0:09:45,000
If prohibition is this harmful,

235
0:09:45.771,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you might ask, why it so popular?

236
0:09:48.832,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Firstly, sex work is and always has been a survival strategy

237
0:09:51.799,000 --> 0:09:53,000
for all kinds of unpopular minority groups:

238
0:09:54.731,000 --> 0:09:55,000
people of color,

239
0:09:55.958,000 --> 0:09:56,000
migrants,

240
0:09:57.133,000 --> 0:09:58,000
people with disabilities,

241
0:09:58.381,000 --> 0:09:59,000
LGBTQ people,

242
0:09:59.6,000 --> 0:10:,000
particularly trans women.

243
0:10:01.924,000 --> 0:10:03,000
These are the groups most heavily profiled

244
0:10:04.054,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and punished through prohibitionist law.

245
0:10:06.404,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I don't think this is an accident.

246
0:10:08.404,000 --> 0:10:09,000
These laws have political support

247
0:10:10.267,000 --> 0:10:12,000
precisely because they target people

248
0:10:12.93,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that voters don't want to see or know about.

249
0:10:16.688,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Why else might people support prohibition?

250
0:10:19.465,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Well, lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking.

251
0:10:23.664,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Folks think that foreign women kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery

252
0:10:27.535,000 --> 0:10:29,000
can be saved by shutting a whole industry down.

253
0:10:30.555,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So let's talk about trafficking.

254
0:10:33.156,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Forced labor does occur in many industries,

255
0:10:36.763,000 --> 0:10:39,000
especially those where the workers are migrants or otherwise vulnerable,

256
0:10:40.366,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and this needs to be addressed.

257
0:10:42.535,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But it's best addressed with legislation targeting those specific abuses,

258
0:10:46.838,000 --> 0:10:47,000
not an entire industry.

259
0:10:48.791,000 --> 0:10:5,000
When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants

260
0:10:51.192,000 --> 0:10:53,000
drowned while picking cockles in Morecambe Bay in 2004,

261
0:10:54.133,000 --> 0:10:56,000
there were no calls to outlaw the entire seafood industry

262
0:10:57.093,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to save trafficking victims.

263
0:10:59.178,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections,

264
0:11:02.557,000 --> 0:11:03,000
allowing them to resist abuse

265
0:11:04.35,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and report it to authorities without fear of arrest.

266
0:11:07.414,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The way the term trafficking is thrown around

267
0:11:09.738,000 --> 0:11:13,000
implies that all undocumented migration into prostitution is forced.

268
0:11:14.423,000 --> 0:11:17,000
In fact, many migrants have made a decision,

269
0:11:17.453,000 --> 0:11:18,000
out of economic need,

270
0:11:18.731,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to place themselves into the hands of people smugglers.

271
0:11:21.538,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Many do this with the full knowledge

272
0:11:23.344,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that they'll be selling sex when they reach their destination.

273
0:11:26.571,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And yes, it can often be the case

274
0:11:28.348,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that these people smugglers demand exorbitant fees,

275
0:11:31.617,000 --> 0:11:33,000
coerce migrants into work they don't want to do

276
0:11:34.545,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and abuse them when they're vulnerable.

277
0:11:36.456,000 --> 0:11:37,000
That's true of prostitution,

278
0:11:37.983,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but it's also true of agricultural work,

279
0:11:39.954,000 --> 0:11:41,000
hospitality work and domestic work.

280
0:11:42.653,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Ultimately, nobody wants to be forced to do any kind of work,

281
0:11:46.07,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but that's a risk many migrants are willing to take,

282
0:11:48.595,000 --> 0:11:49,000
because of what they're leaving behind.

283
0:11:50.489,000 --> 0:11:51,000
If people were allowed to migrate legally

284
0:11:52.473,000 --> 0:11:55,000
they wouldn't have to place their lives into the hands of people smugglers.

285
0:11:56.034,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The problems arise

286
0:11:57.209,000 --> 0:11:58,000
from the criminalization of migration,

287
0:11:59.058,000 --> 0:12:,000
just as they do from the criminalization

288
0:12:01.043,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of sex work itself.

289
0:12:02.218,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This is a lesson of history.

290
0:12:03.824,000 --> 0:12:06,000
If you try to prohibit something that people want or need to do,

291
0:12:07.494,000 --> 0:12:1,000
whether that's drinking alcohol or crossing borders

292
0:12:11.093,000 --> 0:12:12,000
or getting an abortion

293
0:12:12.406,000 --> 0:12:13,000
or selling sex,

294
0:12:14.371,000 --> 0:12:16,000
you create more problems than you solve.

295
0:12:16.395,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Prohibition barely makes a difference

296
0:12:18.208,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to the amount of people actually doing those things.

297
0:12:20.672,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But it makes a huge difference

298
0:12:22.177,000 --> 0:12:24,000
as to whether or not they're safe when they do them.

299
0:12:25.591,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Why else might people support prohibition?

300
0:12:28.787,000 --> 0:12:31,000
As a feminist, I know that the sex industry is a site

301
0:12:32.177,000 --> 0:12:34,000
of deeply entrenched social inequality.

302
0:12:35.081,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's a fact that most buyers of sex are men with money,

303
0:12:38.157,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and most sellers are women without.

304
0:12:40.472,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You can agree with all that -- I do --

305
0:12:43.391,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and still think prohibition is a terrible policy.

306
0:12:46.783,000 --> 0:12:48,000
In a better, more equal world,

307
0:12:48.945,000 --> 0:12:51,000
maybe there would be far fewer people selling sex to survive,

308
0:12:52.597,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but you can't simply legislate a better world into existence.

309
0:12:56.232,000 --> 0:12:58,000
If someone needs to sell sex because they're poor

310
0:12:58.742,000 --> 0:12:59,000
or because they're homeless

311
0:13:00.208,000 --> 0:13:03,000
or because they're undocumented and they can't find legal work,

312
0:13:03.374,000 --> 0:13:06,000
taking away that option doesn't make them any less poor

313
0:13:06.953,000 --> 0:13:07,000
or house them

314
0:13:08.6,000 --> 0:13:09,000
or change their immigration status.

315
0:13:10.577,000 --> 0:13:12,000
People worry that selling sex is degrading.

316
0:13:13.634,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Ask yourself: is it more degrading than going hungry

317
0:13:16.926,000 --> 0:13:17,000
or seeing your children go hungry?

318
0:13:19.366,000 --> 0:13:22,000
There's no call to ban rich people from hiring nannies

319
0:13:22.394,000 --> 0:13:23,000
or getting manicures,

320
0:13:23.671,000 --> 0:13:26,000
even though most of the people doing that labor are poor, migrant women.

321
0:13:27.321,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It's the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically

322
0:13:31.489,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that has some feminists uncomfortable.

323
0:13:34.481,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And I can understand

324
0:13:35.658,000 --> 0:13:37,000
why the sex industry provokes strong feelings.

325
0:13:38.407,000 --> 0:13:41,000
People have all kinds of complicated feelings

326
0:13:41.454,000 --> 0:13:42,000
when it comes to sex.

327
0:13:43.546,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But we can't make policy on the basis of mere feelings,

328
0:13:46.815,000 --> 0:13:48,000
especially not over the heads of the people

329
0:13:48.901,000 --> 0:13:49,000
actually effected by those policies.

330
0:13:50.663,000 --> 0:13:52,000
If we get fixated on the abolition of sex work,

331
0:13:53.306,000 --> 0:13:55,000
we end up worrying more about a particular manifestation

332
0:13:55.994,000 --> 0:13:56,000
of gender inequality,

333
0:13:57.431,000 --> 0:13:59,000
rather than about the underlying causes.

334
0:14:00.333,000 --> 0:14:02,000
People get really hung up on the question,

335
0:14:02.788,000 --> 0:14:04,000
"Well, would you want your daughter doing it?"

336
0:14:05.28,000 --> 0:14:06,000
That's the wrong question.

337
0:14:07.217,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Instead, imagine she is doing it.

338
0:14:10.542,000 --> 0:14:11,000
How safe is she at work tonight?

339
0:14:13.155,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Why isn't she safer?

340
0:14:16.497,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So we've looked at full criminalization,

341
0:14:19.442,000 --> 0:14:22,000
partial criminalization, the Swedish or Nordic Model

342
0:14:22.469,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and legalization,

343
0:14:23.683,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and how they all cause harm.

344
0:14:25.359,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Something I never hear asked is:

345
0:14:28.839,000 --> 0:14:29,000
"What do sex workers want?"

346
0:14:31.573,000 --> 0:14:33,000
After all, we're the ones most affected by these laws.

347
0:14:35.115,000 --> 0:14:37,000
New Zealand decriminalized sex work in 2003.

348
0:14:38.532,000 --> 0:14:39,000
It's crucial to remember

349
0:14:40.457,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing.

350
0:14:43.932,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Decriminalization means the removal of laws

351
0:14:46.841,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that punitively target the sex industry,

352
0:14:48.908,000 --> 0:14:51,000
instead treating sex work much like any other kind of work.

353
0:14:52.354,000 --> 0:14:54,000
In New Zealand, people can work together for safety,

354
0:14:55.191,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and employers of sex workers are accountable to the state.

355
0:14:57.968,000 --> 0:14:59,000
A sex worker can refuse to see a client at any time,

356
0:15:00.675,000 --> 0:15:01,000
for any reason,

357
0:15:02.159,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and 96 percent of street workers

358
0:15:04.657,000 --> 0:15:07,000
report that they feel the law protects their rights.

359
0:15:07.822,000 --> 0:15:09,000
New Zealand hasn't actually seen an increase

360
0:15:09.94,000 --> 0:15:11,000
in the amount of people doing sex work,

361
0:15:12.075,000 --> 0:15:14,000
but decriminalizing it has made it a lot safer.

362
0:15:15.274,000 --> 0:15:16,000
But the lesson from New Zealand

363
0:15:16.875,000 --> 0:15:18,000
isn't just that its particular legislation is good,

364
0:15:19.296,000 --> 0:15:2,000
but that crucially,

365
0:15:20.471,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it was written in collaboration with sex workers;

366
0:15:22.814,000 --> 0:15:24,000
namely, the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective.

367
0:15:25.147,000 --> 0:15:27,000
When it came to making sex work safer,

368
0:15:27.5,000 --> 0:15:3,000
they were ready to hear it straight from sex workers themselves.

369
0:15:31.251,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Here in the UK,

370
0:15:32.425,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I'm part of sex worker-led groups like the Sex Worker Open University

371
0:15:35.867,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and the English Collective of Prostitutes.

372
0:15:37.986,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And we form part of a global movement

373
0:15:39.805,000 --> 0:15:42,000
demanding decriminalization and self-determination.

374
0:15:43.653,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The universal symbol of our movement is the red umbrella.

375
0:15:46.417,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We're supported in our demands by global bodies like UNAIDS,

376
0:15:49.542,000 --> 0:15:5,000
the World Health Organization

377
0:15:51.166,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and Amnesty International.

378
0:15:52.924,000 --> 0:15:53,000
But we need more allies.

379
0:15:55.181,000 --> 0:15:57,000
If you care about gender equality

380
0:15:57.541,000 --> 0:15:59,000
or poverty or migration or public health,

381
0:16:00.361,000 --> 0:16:02,000
then sex worker rights matter to you.

382
0:16:03.355,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Make space for us in your movements.

383
0:16:05.402,000 --> 0:16:08,000
That means not only listening to sex workers when we speak

384
0:16:08.662,000 --> 0:16:1,000
but amplifying our voices.

385
0:16:11.219,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Resist those who silence us,

386
0:16:13.364,000 --> 0:16:16,000
those who say that a prostitute is either too victimized,

387
0:16:16.567,000 --> 0:16:18,000
too damaged to know what's best for herself,

388
0:16:19.237,000 --> 0:16:2,000
or else too privileged

389
0:16:20.997,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and too removed from real hardship,

390
0:16:23.209,000 --> 0:16:26,000
not representative of the millions of voiceless victims.

391
0:16:27.709,000 --> 0:16:31,000
This distinction between victim and empowered is imaginary.

392
0:16:32.536,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It exists purely to discredit sex workers

393
0:16:35.013,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and make it easy to ignore us.

394
0:16:37.819,000 --> 0:16:39,000
No doubt many of you work for a living.

395
0:16:40.56,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Well, sex work is work, too.

396
0:16:42.877,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Just like you,

397
0:16:44.057,000 --> 0:16:45,000
some of us like our jobs,

398
0:16:45.687,000 --> 0:16:46,000
some of us hate them.

399
0:16:47.77,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Ultimately, most of us have mixed feelings.

400
0:16:51.238,000 --> 0:16:53,000
But how we feel about our work

401
0:16:54.566,000 --> 0:16:55,000
isn't the point.

402
0:16:56.484,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And how others feel about our work certainly isn't.

403
0:17:00.373,000 --> 0:17:02,000
What's important is that we have the right to work safely

404
0:17:03.145,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and on our own terms.

405
0:17:04.477,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Sex workers are real people.

406
0:17:06.823,000 --> 0:17:08,000
We've had complicated experiences

407
0:17:09.655,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and complicated responses to those experiences.

408
0:17:13.651,000 --> 0:17:15,000
But our demands are not complicated.

409
0:17:16.451,000 --> 0:17:18,000
You can ask expensive escorts in New York City,

410
0:17:19.272,000 --> 0:17:21,000
brothel workers in Cambodia, street workers in South Africa

411
0:17:22.234,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and every girl on the roster at my old job in Soho,

412
0:17:25.377,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and they will all tell you the same thing.

413
0:17:27.741,000 --> 0:17:29,000
You can speak to millions of sex workers

414
0:17:30.006,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and countless sex work-led organizations.

415
0:17:32.487,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We want full decriminalization and labor rights as workers.

416
0:17:36.985,000 --> 0:17:38,000
I'm just one sex worker on the stage today,

417
0:17:39.325,000 --> 0:17:41,000
but I'm bringing a message from all over the world.

418
0:17:41.919,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Thank you.

419
0:17:43.111,000 --> 0:17:49,000
(Applause)

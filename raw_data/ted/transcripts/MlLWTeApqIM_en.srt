1
0:00:12.885,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So I've been thinking about the difference between

2
0:00:14.407,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues.

3
0:00:17.541,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The résumé virtues are the ones you put on your résumé,

4
0:00:20.443,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which are the skills you bring to the marketplace.

5
0:00:23.909,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The eulogy virtues are the ones

6
0:00:25.647,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that get mentioned in the eulogy,

7
0:00:27.129,000 --> 0:00:29,000
which are deeper: who are you, in your depth,

8
0:00:30.067,000 --> 0:00:31,000
what is the nature of your relationships,

9
0:00:31.843,000 --> 0:00:34,000
are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency?

10
0:00:35.407,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And most of us, including me, would say

11
0:00:36.901,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues.

12
0:00:40.127,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But at least in my case, are they the ones that

13
0:00:42.2,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I think about the most? And the answer is no.

14
0:00:45.002,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So I've been thinking about that problem,

15
0:00:47.295,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and a thinker who has helped me think about it

16
0:00:48.463,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi

17
0:00:50.076,000 --> 0:00:53,000
who wrote a book called "The Lonely Man Of Faith" in 1965.

18
0:00:53.446,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures,

19
0:00:56.766,000 --> 0:00:58,000
which he called Adam I and Adam II.

20
0:00:59.156,000 --> 0:01:,000
Adam I is the worldly, ambitious,

21
0:01:00.888,000 --> 0:01:02,000
external side of our nature.

22
0:01:03.111,000 --> 0:01:05,000
He wants to build, create, create companies,

23
0:01:05.184,000 --> 0:01:06,000
create innovation.

24
0:01:06.73,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Adam II is the humble side of our nature.

25
0:01:09.468,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Adam II wants not only to do good but to be good,

26
0:01:12.285,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to live in a way internally

27
0:01:14.232,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that honors God, creation and our possibilities.

28
0:01:18.035,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Adam I wants to conquer the world.

29
0:01:19.923,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world.

30
0:01:22.687,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Adam I savors accomplishment.

31
0:01:25.175,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Adam II savors inner consistency and strength.

32
0:01:27.857,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Adam I asks how things work.

33
0:01:30.6,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Adam II asks why we're here.

34
0:01:32.918,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Adam I's motto is "success."

35
0:01:35.022,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Adam II's motto is "love, redemption and return."

36
0:01:39.268,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And Soloveitchik argued that these two sides

37
0:01:41.118,000 --> 0:01:43,000
of our nature are at war with each other.

38
0:01:43.766,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We live in perpetual self-confrontation

39
0:01:45.83,000 --> 0:01:48,000
between the external success and the internal value.

40
0:01:49.094,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And the tricky thing, I'd say, about these

41
0:01:51.578,000 --> 0:01:52,000
two sides of our nature is they work

42
0:01:53.27,000 --> 0:01:55,000
by different logics.

43
0:01:55.68,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The external logic is an economic logic:

44
0:01:57.914,000 --> 0:02:,000
input leads to output, risk leads to reward.

45
0:02:01.38,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The internal side of our nature

46
0:02:03.156,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is a moral logic and often an inverse logic.

47
0:02:06.577,000 --> 0:02:07,000
You have to give to receive.

48
0:02:08.451,000 --> 0:02:09,000
You have to surrender to something outside yourself

49
0:02:10.167,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to gain strength within yourself.

50
0:02:12.449,000 --> 0:02:14,000
You have to conquer the desire to get what you want.

51
0:02:14.77,000 --> 0:02:16,000
In order to fulfill yourself, you have to forget yourself.

52
0:02:17.561,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In order to find yourself, you have to lose yourself.

53
0:02:21.873,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We happen to live in a society that favors Adam I,

54
0:02:24.809,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and often neglects Adam II.

55
0:02:27.049,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And the problem is, that turns you into a shrewd animal

56
0:02:30.281,000 --> 0:02:31,000
who treats life as a game,

57
0:02:31.838,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and you become a cold, calculating creature

58
0:02:34.563,000 --> 0:02:36,000
who slips into a sort of mediocrity

59
0:02:37.369,000 --> 0:02:38,000
where you realize there's a difference

60
0:02:38.829,000 --> 0:02:4,000
between your desired self and your actual self.

61
0:02:41.401,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want,

62
0:02:45.374,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you hope someone will give to you.

63
0:02:46.934,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You don't have the depth of conviction.

64
0:02:48.66,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You don't have an emotional sonorousness.

65
0:02:51.197,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You don't have commitment to tasks

66
0:02:52.966,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that would take more than a lifetime to commit.

67
0:02:56.18,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I was reminded of a common response through history

68
0:02:59.627,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of how you build a solid Adam II,

69
0:03:02.389,000 --> 0:03:04,000
how you build a depth of character.

70
0:03:04.399,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Through history, people have gone back

71
0:03:07.124,000 --> 0:03:08,000
into their own pasts,

72
0:03:09.01,000 --> 0:03:11,000
sometimes to a precious time in their life,

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to their childhood,

74
0:03:12.719,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and often, the mind gravitates in the past

75
0:03:16.685,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to a moment of shame,

76
0:03:18.073,000 --> 0:03:2,000
some sin committed, some act of selfishness,

77
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
an act of omission, of shallowness,

78
0:03:23.29,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the sin of anger, the sin of self-pity,

79
0:03:26.033,000 --> 0:03:29,000
trying to be a people-pleaser, a lack of courage.

80
0:03:29.618,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Adam I is built by building on your strengths.

81
0:03:34.313,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Adam II is built by fighting your weaknesses.

82
0:03:38.409,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You go into yourself, you find the sin

83
0:03:41.267,000 --> 0:03:42,000
which you've committed over and again through your life,

84
0:03:42.939,000 --> 0:03:43,000
your signature sin

85
0:03:44.74,000 --> 0:03:46,000
out of which the others emerge,

86
0:03:47.431,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin,

87
0:03:50.295,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and out of that wrestling, that suffering,

88
0:03:53.431,000 --> 0:03:56,000
then a depth of character is constructed.

89
0:03:57.049,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And we're often not taught to recognize

90
0:03:58.951,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the sin in ourselves,

91
0:04:00.087,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in that we're not taught in this culture

92
0:04:01.935,000 --> 0:04:02,000
how to wrestle with it,

93
0:04:03.882,000 --> 0:04:05,000
how to confront it, and how to combat it.

94
0:04:06.555,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We live in a culture with an Adam I mentality

95
0:04:09.885,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where we're inarticulate about Adam II.

96
0:04:13.054,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Finally, Reinhold Niebuhr

97
0:04:14.71,000 --> 0:04:16,000
summed up the confrontation, the fully lived

98
0:04:16.845,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Adam I and Adam II life, this way:

99
0:04:20.398,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime;

100
0:04:23.66,000 --> 0:04:25,000
therefore we must be saved by hope.

101
0:04:26.042,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes

102
0:04:29.148,000 --> 0:04:31,000
complete sense in any immediate context of history;

103
0:04:32.104,000 --> 0:04:34,000
therefore we must be saved by faith.

104
0:04:34.782,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone;

105
0:04:38.672,000 --> 0:04:41,000
therefore we must be saved by love.

106
0:04:41.718,000 --> 0:04:43,000
No virtuous act is quite as virtuous

107
0:04:44.155,000 --> 0:04:47,000
from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint.

108
0:04:48.141,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Therefore we must be saved by that final form of love,

109
0:04:50.968,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which is forgiveness.”

110
0:04:52.604,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Thanks.

111
0:04:54.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Applause)

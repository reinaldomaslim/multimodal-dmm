1
0:00:12.797,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'd like to take you back about seven years in my life.

2
0:00:16.05,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Friday afternoon,

3
0:00:17.436,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a few days before Christmas 2009,

4
0:00:20.626,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was the director of operations

5
0:00:22.443,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at a consumer products company in San Francisco,

6
0:00:25.8,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I was called into a meeting that was already in progress.

7
0:00:29.491,000 --> 0:00:31,000
That meeting turned out to be my exit interview.

8
0:00:32.507,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was fired, along with several others.

9
0:00:36.288,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I was 64 years old at the time.

10
0:00:40.083,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It wasn't completely unexpected.

11
0:00:42.01,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I signed a stack of papers,

12
0:00:44.488,000 --> 0:00:45,000
gathered my personal effects,

13
0:00:46.242,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and left to join my wife

14
0:00:48.083,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who was waiting for me at a nearby restaurant,

15
0:00:50.672,000 --> 0:00:51,000
completely unaware.

16
0:00:53.05,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Fast-forward several hours,

17
0:00:55.692,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we both got really silly drunk.

18
0:00:57.756,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:00.551,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So, 40 plus years of continuous employment

20
0:01:05.13,000 --> 0:01:07,000
for a variety of companies, large and small,

21
0:01:07.59,000 --> 0:01:08,000
was over.

22
0:01:09.05,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I had a good a network, a good reputation --

23
0:01:12.071,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I thought I'd be just fine.

24
0:01:14.6,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I was an engineer in manufacturing and packaging,

25
0:01:19.02,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I had a good background.

26
0:01:21.01,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Retirement was, like for so many people,

27
0:01:24.343,000 --> 0:01:25,000
simply not an option for me,

28
0:01:26.295,000 --> 0:01:28,000
so I turned to consulting for the next couple of years

29
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
without any passion whatsoever.

30
0:01:31.779,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And then an idea began to take root,

31
0:01:35.431,000 --> 0:01:38,000
born from my concern for our environment.

32
0:01:39.566,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I wanted to build my own business,

33
0:01:42.01,000 --> 0:01:46,000
designing and manufacturing biodegradable packaging from waste --

34
0:01:46.352,000 --> 0:01:49,000
paper, agricultural, even textile waste --

35
0:01:50.471,000 --> 0:01:53,000
replacing the toxic, disposable plastic packaging

36
0:01:54.367,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to which we've all become addicted.

37
0:01:56.716,000 --> 0:01:57,000
This is called clean technology,

38
0:01:58.696,000 --> 0:02:,000
and it felt really meaningful to me.

39
0:02:01.153,000 --> 0:02:05,000
A venture that could help to reduce the billions of pounds

40
0:02:05.542,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of single-use plastic packaging dumped each year,

41
0:02:09.24,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and polluting our land, our rivers and our oceans,

42
0:02:12.47,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and left for future generations to resolve --

43
0:02:15.684,000 --> 0:02:16,000
our grandchildren,

44
0:02:17.071,000 --> 0:02:18,000
my grandchildren.

45
0:02:19.051,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And so now at the age of 66,

46
0:02:22.575,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with 40 years of experience,

47
0:02:24.694,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I became an entrepreneur for the very first time.

48
0:02:27.465,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Cheers)

49
0:02:28.586,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Applause)

50
0:02:31.267,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Thank you.

51
0:02:34.3,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But there's more.

52
0:02:35.485,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:39.668,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Lots of issues to deal with:

54
0:02:41.787,000 --> 0:02:45,000
manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation,

55
0:02:46.191,000 --> 0:02:49,000
patents, partnerships, funding --

56
0:02:50.1,000 --> 0:02:52,000
these are all typical issues for a start-up,

57
0:02:52.814,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but hardly typical for me.

58
0:02:55.077,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And a word about funding.

59
0:02:57.107,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I live and work in San Francisco,

60
0:02:59.726,000 --> 0:03:,000
and if you're looking for funding,

61
0:03:01.456,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you are typically going to compete with some very young people

62
0:03:05.289,000 --> 0:03:06,000
from the high-tech industry,

63
0:03:07.103,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it can be very discouraging and intimidating.

64
0:03:11.296,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I have shoes older than most of these people.

65
0:03:13.733,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:19.55,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I do.

67
0:03:20.725,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:21.752,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But five years later,

69
0:03:23.65,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I'm thrilled and proud to share with you

70
0:03:26.74,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that our revenues have doubled every year,

71
0:03:29.555,000 --> 0:03:3,000
we have no debt,

72
0:03:31.087,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we have several marquee clients,

73
0:03:33.78,000 --> 0:03:34,000
our patent was issued,

74
0:03:35.104,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I have a wonderful partner

75
0:03:36.532,000 --> 0:03:38,000
who's been with me right from the beginning,

76
0:03:38.619,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and we've won more than 20 awards for the work that we've done.

77
0:03:41.702,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But best of all,

78
0:03:43.483,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we've made a small dent --

79
0:03:44.928,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a very small dent --

80
0:03:46.151,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis.

81
0:03:50.552,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Applause)

82
0:03:55.503,000 --> 0:04:,000
And I am doing the most rewarding and meaningful work of my life right now.

83
0:04:02.182,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I can tell you there's lots of resources available to entrepreneurs of all ages,

84
0:04:07.251,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but what I really yearned for five years ago

85
0:04:10.464,000 --> 0:04:13,000
was to find other first-time entrepreneurs

86
0:04:13.701,000 --> 0:04:14,000
who were my age.

87
0:04:14.876,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I wanted to connect with them.

88
0:04:17.75,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I had no role models, absolutely none.

89
0:04:20.509,000 --> 0:04:23,000
That 20-something app developer from Silicon Valley

90
0:04:23.758,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was not my role model.

91
0:04:25.352,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:26.377,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I'm sure he was very clever --

93
0:04:27.904,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:29.333,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I want to do something about that,

95
0:04:31.024,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I want all of us to do something about that.

96
0:04:33.327,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I want us to start talking more

97
0:04:34.841,000 --> 0:04:37,000
about people who don't become entrepreneurs until they are seniors.

98
0:04:39.345,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Talking about these bold men and women who are checking in

99
0:04:42.287,000 --> 0:04:44,000
when their peers, in essence, are checking out.

100
0:04:45.523,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And then connecting all these people across industries, across regions,

101
0:04:49.395,000 --> 0:04:5,000
across countries --

102
0:04:51.062,000 --> 0:04:52,000
building a community.

103
0:04:52.549,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You know, the Small Business Administration tells us

104
0:04:55.06,000 --> 0:05:,000
that 64 percent of new jobs created in the private sector in the USA

105
0:05:00.293,000 --> 0:05:02,000
are thanks to small businesses like mine.

106
0:05:03.596,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And who's to say that we'll stay forever small?

107
0:05:06.567,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We have an interesting culture

108
0:05:08.56,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that really expects when you reach a certain age,

109
0:05:10.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
you're going to be golfing, or playing checkers,

110
0:05:13.245,000 --> 0:05:15,000
or babysitting the grandkids all of the time.

111
0:05:15.822,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I adore my grandchildren --

112
0:05:18.75,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:20.557,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I'm also passionate

114
0:05:22.588,000 --> 0:05:25,000
about doing something meaningful in the global marketplace.

115
0:05:27.286,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I'm going to have lots of company.

116
0:05:29.15,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The Census Bureau says that by 2050,

117
0:05:31.573,000 --> 0:05:34,000
there will be 84 million seniors in this country.

118
0:05:35.577,000 --> 0:05:37,000
That's an amazing number.

119
0:05:37.825,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That's almost twice as many as we have today.

120
0:05:40.487,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Can you imagine how many first-time entrepreneurs there will be

121
0:05:43.571,000 --> 0:05:45,000
among 84 million people?

122
0:05:46.073,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And they'll all have four decades of experience.

123
0:05:48.676,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:50.495,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So when I say, "Let's start talking more about these wonderful entrepreneurs,"

125
0:05:55.935,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I mean, let's talk about their ventures,

126
0:05:59.099,000 --> 0:06:02,000
just as we do the ventures of their much younger counterparts.

127
0:06:03.48,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The older entrepreneurs in this country have a 70 percent success rate

128
0:06:09.481,000 --> 0:06:1,000
starting new ventures.

129
0:06:10.947,000 --> 0:06:12,000
70 percent success rate.

130
0:06:13.407,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We're like the Golden State Warriors of entrepreneurs --

131
0:06:16.448,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:17.69,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Applause)

133
0:06:20.145,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And that number plummets to 28 percent for younger entrepreneurs.

134
0:06:24.994,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This is according to a UK-based group called CMI.

135
0:06:29.013,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Aren't the accomplishments of a 70-year-old entrepreneur

136
0:06:31.871,000 --> 0:06:32,000
every bit as meaningful,

137
0:06:33.532,000 --> 0:06:34,000
every bit as newsworthy,

138
0:06:34.894,000 --> 0:06:37,000
as the accomplishments of a 30-year-old entrepreneur?

139
0:06:38.035,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Of course they are.

140
0:06:39.446,000 --> 0:06:43,000
That's why I'd like to make the phrase "70 over 70" just as --

141
0:06:44.326,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:45.351,000 --> 0:06:48,000
just as commonplace as the phrase "30 under 30."

143
0:06:49.302,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Applause)

144
0:06:50.327,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Thank you.

145
0:06:51.502,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Cheers)

146
0:06:52.81,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

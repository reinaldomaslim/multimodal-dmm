1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Cholera was reported in Haiti

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for the first time in over 50 years

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
last October.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
There was no way to predict

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
how far it would spread through water supplies

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and how bad the situation would get.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And not knowing where help was needed

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
always ensured that help was in short supply

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in the areas that needed it most.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
before they take innocent lives

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and cause irreversible damage,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but we still can't do that with water,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and here's why.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Right now, if you want to test water in the field,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
you need a trained technician,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
expensive equipment like this,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and you have to wait about a day

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's too slow

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to get a picture of conditions on the ground

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
before they change,

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
too expensive to implement

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in all the places that require testing.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile,

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
people still need to drink water.

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
didn't come from testing water;

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it came from forms like this,

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
which documented all the people

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
we failed to help.

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Countless lives have been saved

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
by canaries in coalmines --

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a simple and invaluable way

35
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
for miners to know whether they're safe.

36
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We think there's a simpler solution to this problem --

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
one that can be used

40
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
by people who face conditions like this everyday.

41
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's in its early stages,

42
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but this is what it looks like right now.

43
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We call it the Water Canary.

44
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's a fast, cheap device

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that answers an important question:

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Is this water contaminated?

47
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It doesn't require any special training.

48
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place,

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
it uses light.

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
That means there's no waiting

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
for chemical reactions to take place,

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
no need to use reagents that can run out

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and no need to be an expert

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to get actionable information.

55
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
To test water, you simply insert a sample

56
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and, within seconds,

57
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water,

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This will make it possible

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for anyone to collect life-saving information

61
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We're also, on top of that,

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
integrating wireless networking

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
into an affordable device

65
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
with GPS and GSM.

66
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers

67
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to be mapped in real time.

68
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
With enough users,

69
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
maps like this will make it possible

70
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to take preventive action,

71
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
containing hazards before they turn into emergencies

72
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
that take years to recover from.

73
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And then, instead of taking days

74
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to disseminate this information to the people who need it most,

75
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it can happen automatically.

76
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We've seen how distributed networks,

77
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
big data and information

78
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
can transform society.

79
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I think it's time for us to apply them to water.

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field

81
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and to open-source the hardware

82
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation,

83
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
so we can tackle this problem together.

84
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Thank you.

85
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Applause)

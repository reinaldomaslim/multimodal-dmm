2
0:00:15.967,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack,

3
0:00:21.389,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and all it requires of you is this:

4
0:00:24.01,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that you change your posture for two minutes.

5
0:00:28.197,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now

6
0:00:31.621,000 --> 0:00:34,000
do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.

7
0:00:35.214,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?

8
0:00:37.929,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs, maybe wrapping your ankles.

9
0:00:41.274,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.

10
0:00:45.013,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)

11
0:00:48.684,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I see you.

12
0:00:50.956,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.

13
0:00:53.971,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We're going to come back to that in a few minutes,

14
0:00:56.329,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit,

15
0:00:59.277,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it could significantly change the way your life unfolds.

16
0:01:02.713,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So, we're really fascinated with body language,

17
0:01:07.237,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and we're particularly interested in other people's body language.

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You know, we're interested in, like, you know — (Laughter) —

19
0:01:15.381,000 --> 0:01:19,000
an awkward interaction, or a smile,

20
0:01:19.779,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink,

21
0:01:24.011,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or maybe even something like a handshake.

22
0:01:27.249,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Narrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10.

23
0:01:30.598,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States.

24
0:01:35.091,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Here comes the Prime Minister -- No. (Laughter) (Applause)

25
0:01:40.018,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

26
0:01:42.693,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Amy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake,

27
0:01:46.4,000 --> 0:01:48,000
can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.

28
0:01:48.924,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Even the BBC and The New York Times.

29
0:01:51.064,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior,

30
0:01:55.015,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists --

31
0:01:58.403,000 --> 0:02:,000
it's language, so we think about communication.

32
0:02:01.283,000 --> 0:02:04,000
When we think about communication, we think about interactions.

33
0:02:04.31,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So what is your body language communicating to me?

34
0:02:06.749,000 --> 0:02:08,000
What's mine communicating to you?

35
0:02:08.815,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this.

36
0:02:14.787,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So social scientists have spent a lot of time

37
0:02:17.055,000 --> 0:02:19,000
looking at the effects of our body language,

38
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or other people's body language, on judgments.

39
0:02:21.469,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.

40
0:02:24.908,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes

41
0:02:28.898,000 --> 0:02:31,000
like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.

42
0:02:32.691,000 --> 0:02:36,000
For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University,

43
0:02:37.376,000 --> 0:02:41,000
shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips

44
0:02:41.848,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of real physician-patient interactions,

45
0:02:44.872,000 --> 0:02:46,000
their judgments of the physician's niceness

46
0:02:47.705,000 --> 0:02:49,000
predict whether or not that physician will be sued.

47
0:02:50.342,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So it doesn't have to do so much

48
0:02:52.024,000 --> 0:02:54,000
with whether or not that physician was incompetent,

49
0:02:54.547,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but do we like that person and how they interacted?

50
0:02:57.377,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Even more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton

51
0:03:00.312,000 --> 0:03:03,000
has shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces

52
0:03:03.989,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in just one second predict 70 percent

53
0:03:07.957,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes,

54
0:03:11.807,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and even, let's go digital,

55
0:03:14.029,000 --> 0:03:18,000
emoticons used well in online negotiations

56
0:03:18.174,000 --> 0:03:2,000
can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation.

57
0:03:21.006,000 --> 0:03:24,000
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?

58
0:03:24.229,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others,

59
0:03:27.326,000 --> 0:03:29,000
how they judge us and what the outcomes are.

60
0:03:30.228,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We tend to forget, though, the other audience

61
0:03:32.348,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves.

62
0:03:35.783,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We are also influenced by our nonverbals,

63
0:03:38.996,000 --> 0:03:4,000
our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.

64
0:03:41.359,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So what nonverbals am I talking about?

65
0:03:44.422,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice,

66
0:03:47.365,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and I teach at a competitive business school,

67
0:03:50.092,000 --> 0:03:54,000
so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.

68
0:03:54.576,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions

69
0:03:58.388,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of power and dominance.

70
0:04:00.391,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?

71
0:04:03.13,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Well, this is what they are.

72
0:04:05.213,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.

73
0:04:08.091,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So you make yourself big, you stretch out,

74
0:04:11.101,000 --> 0:04:13,000
you take up space, you're basically opening up.

75
0:04:14.042,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's about opening up.

76
0:04:15.988,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And this is true across the animal kingdom.

77
0:04:18.743,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's not just limited to primates.

78
0:04:21.504,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)

79
0:04:24.212,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically,

80
0:04:27.923,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment.

81
0:04:30.924,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us

82
0:04:33.996,000 --> 0:04:36,000
how universal and old these expressions of power are.

83
0:04:38.018,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This expression, which is known as pride,

84
0:04:40.617,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Jessica Tracy has studied.

85
0:04:42.87,000 --> 0:04:44,000
She shows that people who are born with sight

86
0:04:45.777,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and people who are congenitally blind do this

87
0:04:48.718,000 --> 0:04:5,000
when they win at a physical competition.

88
0:04:51.032,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So when they cross the finish line and they've won,

89
0:04:53.51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it.

90
0:04:56.011,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They do this.

91
0:04:57.328,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted.

92
0:04:59.85,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What do we do when we feel powerless?

93
0:05:01.937,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We do exactly the opposite.

94
0:05:03.716,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We close up. We wrap ourselves up.

95
0:05:06.244,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We make ourselves small.

96
0:05:07.612,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We don't want to bump into the person next to us.

97
0:05:09.992,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So again, both animals and humans do the same thing.

98
0:05:12.749,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power.

99
0:05:16.729,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So what we tend to do when it comes to power

100
0:05:19.855,000 --> 0:05:21,000
is that we complement the other's nonverbals.

101
0:05:22.508,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So if someone is being really powerful with us,

102
0:05:24.939,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them.

103
0:05:27.583,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We do the opposite of them.

104
0:05:29.197,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom,

105
0:05:32.396,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and what do I notice?

106
0:05:34.933,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals.

107
0:05:42.186,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas,

108
0:05:44.734,000 --> 0:05:47,000
really coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room

109
0:05:48.139,000 --> 0:05:51,000
before class even starts, like they really want to occupy space.

110
0:05:51.576,000 --> 0:05:53,000
When they sit down, they're sort of spread out.

111
0:05:53.839,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They raise their hands like this.

112
0:05:55.597,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You have other people who are virtually collapsing

113
0:05:58.232,000 --> 0:06:,000
when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it.

114
0:06:00.756,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You see it on their faces and their bodies,

115
0:06:03.049,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny,

116
0:06:05.867,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and they go like this when they raise their hand.

117
0:06:08.229,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I notice a couple of things about this.

118
0:06:10.111,000 --> 0:06:11,000
One, you're not going to be surprised.

119
0:06:11.945,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It seems to be related to gender.

120
0:06:13.987,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.

121
0:06:19.452,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Women feel chronically less powerful than men,

122
0:06:22.038,000 --> 0:06:23,000
so this is not surprising.

123
0:06:23.92,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But the other thing I noticed

124
0:06:25.993,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is that it also seemed to be related to the extent

125
0:06:28.659,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to which the students were participating, and how well they were participating.

126
0:06:32.519,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And this is really important in the MBA classroom,

127
0:06:35.101,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because participation counts for half the grade.

128
0:06:37.782,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.

129
0:06:42.255,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You get these equally qualified women and men coming in

130
0:06:45.527,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and then you get these differences in grades,

131
0:06:47.694,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and it seems to be partly attributable to participation.

132
0:06:50.783,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So I started to wonder, you know, okay,

133
0:06:53.806,000 --> 0:06:56,000
so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating.

134
0:06:57.448,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Is it possible that we could get people to fake it

135
0:07:00.001,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and would it lead them to participate more?

136
0:07:02.025,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So my main collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,

137
0:07:06.638,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?

138
0:07:10.193,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Like, can you do this just for a little while

139
0:07:12.744,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and actually experience a behavioral outcome

140
0:07:15.42,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that makes you seem more powerful?

141
0:07:17.146,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people

142
0:07:20.598,000 --> 0:07:22,000
think and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence.

143
0:07:23.003,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But our question really was,

144
0:07:24.449,000 --> 0:07:28,000
do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves?

145
0:07:28.513,000 --> 0:07:3,000
There's some evidence that they do.

146
0:07:31.203,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So, for example, we smile when we feel happy,

147
0:07:35.839,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but also, when we're forced to smile

148
0:07:38.017,000 --> 0:07:42,000
by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.

149
0:07:42.432,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So it goes both ways.

150
0:07:44.374,000 --> 0:07:47,000
When it comes to power, it also goes both ways.

151
0:07:48.18,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So when you feel powerful,

152
0:07:50.728,000 --> 0:07:51,000
you're more likely to do this,

153
0:07:52.523,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful,

154
0:07:58.725,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you are more likely to actually feel powerful.

155
0:08:02.148,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So the second question really was, you know,

156
0:08:05.208,000 --> 0:08:07,000
so we know that our minds change our bodies,

157
0:08:07.791,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but is it also true that our bodies change our minds?

158
0:08:12.208,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful,

159
0:08:14.935,000 --> 0:08:15,000
what am I talking about?

160
0:08:16.307,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings

161
0:08:18.473,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings,

162
0:08:22.069,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and in my case, that's hormones. I look at hormones.

163
0:08:25.136,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?

164
0:08:29.47,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly,

165
0:08:33.766,000 --> 0:08:37,000
more assertive and more confident, more optimistic.

166
0:08:37.99,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance.

167
0:08:41.3,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They also tend to be able to think more abstractly.

168
0:08:45.168,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.

169
0:08:47.812,000 --> 0:08:5,000
There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people.

170
0:08:51.075,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Physiologically, there also are differences

171
0:08:53.919,000 --> 0:08:57,000
on two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone,

172
0:08:57.984,000 --> 0:09:,000
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.

173
0:09:01.678,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies

174
0:09:08.823,000 --> 0:09:11,000
have high testosterone and low cortisol,

175
0:09:12.021,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and powerful and effective leaders

176
0:09:15.547,000 --> 0:09:17,000
also have high testosterone and low cortisol.

177
0:09:17.802,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So what does that mean? When you think about power,

178
0:09:20.207,000 --> 0:09:22,000
people tended to think only about testosterone,

179
0:09:22.53,000 --> 0:09:23,000
because that was about dominance.

180
0:09:24.318,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But really, power is also about how you react to stress.

181
0:09:27.788,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant,

182
0:09:30.917,000 --> 0:09:32,000
high on testosterone, but really stress reactive?

183
0:09:33.659,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Probably not, right?

184
0:09:35.224,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant,

185
0:09:38.278,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back.

186
0:09:41.966,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So we know that in primate hierarchies,

187
0:09:47.116,000 --> 0:09:5,000
if an alpha needs to take over,

188
0:09:50.208,000 --> 0:09:54,000
if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly,

189
0:09:54.446,000 --> 0:09:57,000
within a few days, that individual's testosterone has gone up

190
0:09:57.557,000 --> 0:10:,000
significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly.

191
0:10:01.062,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So we have this evidence, both that the body can shape

192
0:10:04.103,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the mind, at least at the facial level,

193
0:10:06.469,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and also that role changes can shape the mind.

194
0:10:10.598,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So what happens, okay, you take a role change,

195
0:10:13.38,000 --> 0:10:15,000
what happens if you do that at a really minimal level,

196
0:10:15.964,000 --> 0:10:17,000
like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention?

197
0:10:18.417,000 --> 0:10:2,000
"For two minutes," you say, "I want you to stand like this,

198
0:10:21.251,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and it's going to make you feel more powerful."

199
0:10:23.811,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So this is what we did.

200
0:10:26.765,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment,

201
0:10:31.38,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and these people adopted, for two minutes,

202
0:10:34.929,000 --> 0:10:37,000
either high-power poses or low-power poses,

203
0:10:38.413,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and I'm just going to show you five of the poses,

204
0:10:40.754,000 --> 0:10:41,000
although they took on only two.

205
0:10:42.339,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So here's one.

206
0:10:45.069,000 --> 0:10:46,000
A couple more.

207
0:10:47.052,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This one has been dubbed the "Wonder Woman" by the media.

208
0:10:51.906,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Here are a couple more.

209
0:10:53.228,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So you can be standing or you can be sitting.

210
0:10:55.582,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And here are the low-power poses.

211
0:10:57.567,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So you're folding up, you're making yourself small.

212
0:11:01.904,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This one is very low-power.

213
0:11:03.369,000 --> 0:11:06,000
When you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.

214
0:11:07.352,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So this is what happens.

215
0:11:09.467,000 --> 0:11:11,000
They come in, they spit into a vial,

216
0:11:11.697,000 --> 0:11:14,000
for two minutes, we say, "You need to do this or this."

217
0:11:14.87,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They don't look at pictures of the poses.

218
0:11:16.935,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We don't want to prime them with a concept of power.

219
0:11:19.486,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We want them to be feeling power.

220
0:11:21.143,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So two minutes they do this.

221
0:11:22.502,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We then ask them, "How powerful do you feel?" on a series of items,

222
0:11:25.711,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and then we give them an opportunity to gamble,

223
0:11:28.078,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and then we take another saliva sample.

224
0:11:30.843,000 --> 0:11:31,000
That's it. That's the whole experiment.

225
0:11:32.725,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So this is what we find.

226
0:11:34.31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,

227
0:11:36.214,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we find that when you are in the high-power pose condition,

228
0:11:40.352,000 --> 0:11:42,000
86 percent of you will gamble.

229
0:11:42.51,000 --> 0:11:44,000
When you're in the low-power pose condition,

230
0:11:44.63,000 --> 0:11:47,000
only 60 percent, and that's a whopping significant difference.

231
0:11:48.63,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Here's what we find on testosterone.

232
0:11:51.11,000 --> 0:11:53,000
From their baseline when they come in,

233
0:11:53.647,000 --> 0:11:56,000
high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase,

234
0:11:56.977,000 --> 0:12:,000
and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease.

235
0:12:01.598,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So again, two minutes, and you get these changes.

236
0:12:04.415,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Here's what you get on cortisol.

237
0:12:06.416,000 --> 0:12:09,000
High-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease,

238
0:12:10.214,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase.

239
0:12:14.346,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes

240
0:12:17.078,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that configure your brain

241
0:12:18.722,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable,

242
0:12:23.023,000 --> 0:12:28,000
or really stress-reactive, and feeling sort of shut down.

243
0:12:28.1,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And we've all had the feeling, right?

244
0:12:30.887,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves,

245
0:12:36.095,000 --> 0:12:38,000
so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.

246
0:12:38.551,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Also, our bodies change our minds.

247
0:12:40.978,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But the next question, of course,

248
0:12:43.384,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is, can power posing for a few minutes

249
0:12:45.228,000 --> 0:12:47,000
really change your life in meaningful ways?

250
0:12:47.289,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This is in the lab, it's this little task, it's just a couple of minutes.

251
0:12:51.606,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Where can you actually apply this?

252
0:12:53.371,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Which we cared about, of course.

253
0:12:55.206,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations,

254
0:13:01.971,000 --> 0:13:03,000
like social threat situations.

255
0:13:04.448,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Where are you being evaluated, either by your friends?

256
0:13:07.028,000 --> 0:13:09,000
For teenagers, it's at the lunchroom table.

257
0:13:09.109,000 --> 0:13:13,000
For some people it's speaking at a school board meeting.

258
0:13:13.406,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this

259
0:13:17.194,000 --> 0:13:19,000
or doing a job interview.

260
0:13:19.992,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We decided that the one that most people could relate to

261
0:13:22.684,000 --> 0:13:24,000
because most people had been through, was the job interview.

262
0:13:25.603,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So we published these findings,

263
0:13:28.358,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and the media are all over it,

264
0:13:29.943,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and they say, Okay, so this is what you do

265
0:13:32.042,000 --> 0:13:34,000
when you go in for the job interview, right?

266
0:13:34.139,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Laughter)

267
0:13:35.17,000 --> 0:13:37,000
You know, so we were of course horrified, and said,

268
0:13:37.641,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Oh my God, no, that's not what we meant at all.

269
0:13:39.937,000 --> 0:13:41,000
For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.

270
0:13:42.201,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Again, this is not about you talking to other people.

271
0:13:44.792,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's you talking to yourself.

272
0:13:46.377,000 --> 0:13:49,000
What do you do before you go into a job interview? You do this.

273
0:13:49.46,000 --> 0:13:51,000
You're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone --

274
0:13:52.026,000 --> 0:13:54,000
or your Android, not trying to leave anyone out.

275
0:13:54.312,000 --> 0:13:55,000
You're looking at your notes,

276
0:13:56.206,000 --> 0:13:58,000
you're hunching up, making yourself small,

277
0:13:58.23,000 --> 0:14:,000
when really what you should be doing maybe is this,

278
0:14:00.683,000 --> 0:14:03,000
like, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes.

279
0:14:03.744,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So that's what we want to test. Okay?

280
0:14:05.53,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So we bring people into a lab,

281
0:14:07.348,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and they do either high- or low-power poses again,

282
0:14:10.725,000 --> 0:14:12,000
they go through a very stressful job interview.

283
0:14:13.357,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It's five minutes long. They are being recorded.

284
0:14:16.973,000 --> 0:14:17,000
They're being judged also,

285
0:14:18.954,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback,

286
0:14:23.459,000 --> 0:14:24,000
so they look like this.

287
0:14:25.245,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Imagine this is the person interviewing you.

288
0:14:27.35,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.

289
0:14:31.973,000 --> 0:14:32,000
People hate this.

290
0:14:33.637,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls "standing in social quicksand."

291
0:14:37.377,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So this really spikes your cortisol.

292
0:14:39.186,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So this is the job interview we put them through,

293
0:14:41.496,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because we really wanted to see what happened.

294
0:14:43.717,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.

295
0:14:46.824,000 --> 0:14:49,000
They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.

296
0:14:49.996,000 --> 0:14:51,000
They have no idea who's been posing in what pose,

297
0:14:52.781,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and they end up looking at these sets of tapes,

298
0:14:57.871,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and they say, "We want to hire these people,"

299
0:15:00.043,000 --> 0:15:01,000
all the high-power posers.

300
0:15:01.568,000 --> 0:15:02,000
"We don't want to hire these people.

301
0:15:03.365,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall."

302
0:15:07.206,000 --> 0:15:08,000
But what's driving it?

303
0:15:08.87,000 --> 0:15:09,000
It's not about the content of the speech.

304
0:15:10.886,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.

305
0:15:13.762,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Because we rate them on all these variables

306
0:15:16.263,000 --> 0:15:19,000
related to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech?

307
0:15:19.826,000 --> 0:15:21,000
How good is it? What are their qualifications?

308
0:15:22.084,000 --> 0:15:24,000
No effect on those things. This is what's affected.

309
0:15:24.734,000 --> 0:15:25,000
These kinds of things.

310
0:15:26.457,000 --> 0:15:28,000
People are bringing their true selves, basically.

311
0:15:28.872,000 --> 0:15:29,000
They're bringing themselves.

312
0:15:30.286,000 --> 0:15:32,000
They bring their ideas, but as themselves,

313
0:15:32.409,000 --> 0:15:34,000
with no, you know, residue over them.

314
0:15:34.645,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.

315
0:15:39.576,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So when I tell people about this,

316
0:15:42.944,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior,

317
0:15:46.323,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me,

318
0:15:49.099,000 --> 0:15:5,000
"It feels fake." Right?

319
0:15:50.666,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So I said, fake it till you make it.

320
0:15:52.568,000 --> 0:15:53,000
It's not me.

321
0:15:54.445,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.

322
0:15:57.62,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I don't want to feel like an impostor.

323
0:15:59.454,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here.

324
0:16:03.551,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And that really resonated with me,

325
0:16:05.738,000 --> 0:16:08,000
because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor

326
0:16:08.984,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here.

327
0:16:11.206,000 --> 0:16:13,000
When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.

328
0:16:14.147,000 --> 0:16:17,000
I was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.

329
0:16:17.552,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I was thrown from the car.

330
0:16:19.434,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,

331
0:16:22.422,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and I had been withdrawn from college,

332
0:16:24.655,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations,

333
0:16:30.367,000 --> 0:16:32,000
which was very traumatic.

334
0:16:32.955,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart,

335
0:16:35.826,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and I had been called gifted as a child.

336
0:16:37.838,000 --> 0:16:4,000
So I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back.

337
0:16:41.038,000 --> 0:16:43,000
They say, "You're not going to finish college.

338
0:16:43.262,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Just, you know, there are other things for you to do,

339
0:16:45.839,000 --> 0:16:47,000
but that's not going to work out for you."

340
0:16:47.863,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So I really struggled with this, and I have to say,

341
0:16:51.421,000 --> 0:16:53,000
having your identity taken from you, your core identity,

342
0:16:54.195,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and for me it was being smart,

343
0:16:56.054,000 --> 0:16:57,000
having that taken from you,

344
0:16:57.717,000 --> 0:17:,000
there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that.

345
0:17:00.84,000 --> 0:17:01,000
So I felt entirely powerless.

346
0:17:02.643,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I worked and worked, and I got lucky,

347
0:17:04.529,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and worked, and got lucky, and worked.

348
0:17:06.399,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Eventually I graduated from college.

349
0:17:08.651,000 --> 0:17:1,000
It took me four years longer than my peers,

350
0:17:10.675,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,

351
0:17:15.016,000 --> 0:17:17,000
to take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton,

352
0:17:17.96,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and I was like, I am not supposed to be here.

353
0:17:20.811,000 --> 0:17:21,000
I am an impostor.

354
0:17:22.105,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And the night before my first-year talk,

355
0:17:24.034,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.

356
0:17:27.557,000 --> 0:17:28,000
That's it.

357
0:17:28.759,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I was so afraid of being found out the next day

358
0:17:31.246,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that I called her and said, "I'm quitting."

359
0:17:34.059,000 --> 0:17:35,000
She was like, "You are not quitting,

360
0:17:35.915,000 --> 0:17:37,000
because I took a gamble on you, and you're staying.

361
0:17:38.473,000 --> 0:17:4,000
You're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do.

362
0:17:41.264,000 --> 0:17:42,000
You are going to fake it.

363
0:17:42.621,000 --> 0:17:45,000
You're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do.

364
0:17:45.801,000 --> 0:17:47,000
You're just going to do it and do it and do it,

365
0:17:48.064,000 --> 0:17:5,000
even if you're terrified and just paralyzed

366
0:17:50.509,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and having an out-of-body experience,

367
0:17:52.882,000 --> 0:17:55,000
until you have this moment where you say, 'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.

368
0:17:56.252,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this.'"

369
0:17:59.218,000 --> 0:18:,000
So that's what I did.

370
0:18:00.337,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Five years in grad school,

371
0:18:01.745,000 --> 0:18:03,000
a few years, you know, I'm at Northwestern,

372
0:18:03.869,000 --> 0:18:05,000
I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,

373
0:18:05.956,000 --> 0:18:08,000
I'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking,

374
0:18:09.956,000 --> 0:18:1,000
"Not supposed to be here."

375
0:18:11.762,000 --> 0:18:13,000
So at the end of my first year at Harvard,

376
0:18:14.479,000 --> 0:18:18,000
a student who had not talked in class the entire semester,

377
0:18:18.804,000 --> 0:18:21,000
who I had said, "Look, you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail,"

378
0:18:22.495,000 --> 0:18:24,000
came into my office. I really didn't know her at all.

379
0:18:25.043,000 --> 0:18:28,000
She came in totally defeated, and she said,

380
0:18:28.495,000 --> 0:18:31,000
"I'm not supposed to be here."

381
0:18:35.371,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And that was the moment for me.

382
0:18:37.352,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Because two things happened.

383
0:18:38.968,000 --> 0:18:39,000
One was that I realized,

384
0:18:40.262,000 --> 0:18:43,000
oh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore.

385
0:18:43.396,000 --> 0:18:46,000
I don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.

386
0:18:46.42,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And the second was, she is supposed to be here!

387
0:18:48.715,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.

388
0:18:50.692,000 --> 0:18:53,000
So I was like, "Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here!

389
0:18:54.259,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And tomorrow you're going to fake it,

390
0:18:56.045,000 --> 0:18:58,000
you're going to make yourself powerful, and, you know --

391
0:18:58.758,000 --> 0:19:03,000
(Applause)

392
0:19:04.175,000 --> 0:19:08,000
And you're going to go into the classroom,

393
0:19:08.253,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and you are going to give the best comment ever."

394
0:19:10.677,000 --> 0:19:12,000
You know? And she gave the best comment ever,

395
0:19:13.682,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and people turned around and were like,

396
0:19:15.645,000 --> 0:19:17,000
oh my God, I didn't even notice her sitting there. (Laughter)

397
0:19:18.589,000 --> 0:19:19,000
She comes back to me months later,

398
0:19:20.406,000 --> 0:19:23,000
and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it,

399
0:19:23.47,000 --> 0:19:25,000
she had actually faked it till she became it.

400
0:19:25.868,000 --> 0:19:26,000
So she had changed.

401
0:19:27.691,000 --> 0:19:31,000
And so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it.

402
0:19:31.775,000 --> 0:19:33,000
Fake it till you become it.

403
0:19:34.572,000 --> 0:19:37,000
Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.

404
0:19:38.213,000 --> 0:19:4,000
The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.

405
0:19:40.868,000 --> 0:19:44,000
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.

406
0:19:45.34,000 --> 0:19:47,000
So, this is two minutes.

407
0:19:47.837,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.

408
0:19:49.671,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation,

409
0:19:52.819,000 --> 0:19:54,000
for two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator,

410
0:19:55.525,000 --> 0:19:58,000
in a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors.

411
0:19:58.764,000 --> 0:19:59,000
That's what you want to do.

412
0:20:00.191,000 --> 0:20:02,000
Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation.

413
0:20:03.026,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down.

414
0:20:05.991,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.

415
0:20:09.957,000 --> 0:20:1,000
Leave that situation feeling like,

416
0:20:11.681,000 --> 0:20:13,000
I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am.

417
0:20:14.677,000 --> 0:20:19,000
So I want to ask you first, you know, both to try power posing,

418
0:20:20.468,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and also I want to ask you to share the science, because this is simple.

419
0:20:25.582,000 --> 0:20:27,000
I don't have ego involved in this. (Laughter)

420
0:20:27.759,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Give it away. Share it with people,

421
0:20:29.546,000 --> 0:20:31,000
because the people who can use it the most

422
0:20:31.99,000 --> 0:20:34,000
are the ones with no resources and no technology

423
0:20:35.365,000 --> 0:20:37,000
and no status and no power.

424
0:20:37.563,000 --> 0:20:39,000
Give it to them because they can do it in private.

425
0:20:40.135,000 --> 0:20:42,000
They need their bodies, privacy and two minutes,

426
0:20:42.603,000 --> 0:20:45,000
and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life.

427
0:20:45.753,000 --> 0:20:46,000
Thank you.

428
0:20:46.908,000 --> 0:20:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If we look around us,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
much of what surrounds us

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
started life as various rocks and sludge

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
buried in the ground in various places in the world.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
They look like TV cameras, monitors,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
annoying radio mics.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And so this magical transformation

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is what I was trying to get at with my project,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
which became known as the Toaster Project.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And it was also inspired by this quote

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
from Douglas Adams,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And the situation it describes

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man --

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
finds himself alone on a strange planet

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
populated only by a technologically primitive people.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And he kind of assumes that, yes,

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
he'll become -- these villagers --

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
he'll become their emperor

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and transform their society

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
with his wonderful command of technology

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and science and the elements,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but, of course, realizes

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that without the rest of human society,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
he can barely make a sandwich,

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
let alone a toaster.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But he didn't have Wikipedia.

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So I thought, okay,

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And, working on the idea

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that the cheapest electric toaster

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
took it home

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and was kind of dismayed to discover

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that, inside this object,

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
there were 400 different bits

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
made out of a hundred-plus different materials.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I had maybe nine months.

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I thought, okay, I'll start with five.

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And these were steel, mica,

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
plastic, copper and nickel.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, starting with steel: how do you make steel?

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I went and knocked on the door

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of the Rio Tinto Chair

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and said, "How do you make steel?"

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And Professor Cilliers was very kind

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and talked me through it.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And my vague rememberings from GCSE science --

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
well, steel comes from iron,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
so I phoned up an iron mine.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Can I come up and get some iron?"

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray.

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
He had misheard me

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But after some nagging, I got him to do that.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone,

64
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and that was produced

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
by sea creatures

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
350 million years ago

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
in a nice, warm,

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
sunny atmosphere.

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
When you study geology,

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
you can see what's happened in the past,

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and there were terrific changes in the earth.

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.

73
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because, though Ray was a miner there,

75
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the mine had closed

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,

77
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because, of course, it can't compete

78
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
on the scale of operations which are happening

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in South America, Australia, wherever.

80
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore

81
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and dragged it back to London on the train,

82
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and then was faced with the problem:

83
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Okay, how do you make this rock

84
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
into components for a toaster?

85
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So I went back to Professor Cilliers,

86
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and he said, "Go to the library."

87
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So I did

88
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy --

89
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
completely useless for what I was trying to do.

90
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.

92
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So I ended up going to the History of Science Library

93
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and looking at this book.

94
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This is the first textbook on metallurgy

95
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
written in the West, at least.

96
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And there you can see that woodcut

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is basically what I ended up doing.

98
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.

99
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,

101
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was, the smaller the scale you want to work on,

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the further back in time you have to go.

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And so this is after

104
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
a day and about half a night

105
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
smelting this iron.

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I dragged out this stuff,

107
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and it wasn't iron.

108
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But luckily,

109
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I found a patent online

110
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
for industrial furnaces that use microwaves,

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and at 30 minutes at full power,

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and I was able to finish off the process.

113
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So, my next --

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The next thing I was trying to get was copper.

116
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Again, this mine

117
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
was once the largest copper mine in the world.

118
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's not anymore,

119
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but I found a retired geology professor

120
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to take me down,

121
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."

122
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And the reason I was interested in getting water

123
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is because water which goes through mines

124
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
becomes kind of acidic

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and will start picking up,

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
dissolving the minerals from the mine.

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,

128
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which is in Portugal.

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.

130
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So many such

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that it's now just a home for bacteria

132
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
who really like acidic, toxic conditions.

133
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But anyway, the water I dragged back

134
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was --

135
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
there was enough copper in it

136
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
such that I could cast the pins

137
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
of my metal electric plug.

138
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
So my next thing: I was off to Scotland

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to get mica.

140
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And mica is a mineral

141
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which is a very good insulator

142
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and very good at insulating electricity.

143
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
That's me getting mica.

144
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,

145
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and, of course,

146
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
my toaster had to have a plastic case.

147
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Plastic is the defining feature

148
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of cheap electrical goods.

149
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and spent a good half an hour

151
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
trying to convince the PR office at BP

152
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that it would be fantastic for them

153
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
if they flew me to an oil rig

154
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and let me have a jug of oil.

155
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.

156
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But even then

157
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they weren't convinced

158
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" -- never did.

159
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So I looked at other ways of making plastic.

160
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And you can actually make plastic

161
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.

162
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So this is attempting to make

163
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
potato starch plastic.

164
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And for a while that was looking really good.

165
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I poured it into the mold, which you can see there,

166
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
which I've made from a tree trunk.

167
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And it was looking good for a while,

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and unfortunately I came back

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.

171
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So kind of out of desperation,

172
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I decided that I could think laterally.

173
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And geologists have actually christened --

174
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
well, they're debating whether to christen --

175
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the age that we're living in --

176
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch

177
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
called the Anthropocene, the age of Man.

178
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And that's because geologists of the future

179
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
would kind of see a sharp shift

180
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in the strata of rock that is being laid down now.

181
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl

182
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs

183
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that have been set off since 1945.

184
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And there'd also be an extinction event --

185
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
like fossils would suddenly disappear.

186
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And also, I thought

187
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that there would be

188
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
synthetic polymers,

189
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
plastics, embedded in the rock.

190
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So I looked up a plastic --

191
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
so I decided that I could mine

192
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
some of this modern-day rock.

193
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And I went up to Manchester

194
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to visit a place called Axion Recycling.

195
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,

196
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.

197
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And that was brought into force

198
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to try and deal with the mountain of stuff

199
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that is just being made

200
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and then living for a while in our homes

201
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and then going to landfill.

202
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But this is it.

203
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Music)

204
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

205
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So there's a picture

206
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
of my toaster.

207
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Applause)

208
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
That's it without the case on.

209
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And there it is on the shelves.

210
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Thanks.

211
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Applause)

212
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.

213
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
TT: Yeah, I did plug it in.

214
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I don't know if you could see,

215
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but I was never able to make insulation for the wires.

216
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Kew Gardens were insistent

217
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.

218
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So the wires were uninsulated.

219
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So there was 240 volts

220
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
going through these homemade copper wires,

221
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
homemade plug.

222
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And for about five seconds,

223
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the toaster toasted,

224
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but then, unfortunately,

225
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the element kind of melted itself.

226
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest.

227
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
BG: Thomas Thwaites. TT: Thanks.

1
0:00:12.786,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There is some medical news that nobody, absolutely nobody,

2
0:00:16.74,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is prepared to hear.

3
0:00:18.817,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I certainly wasn't.

4
0:00:20.832,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It was three years ago that I got a call in my office

5
0:00:24.497,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with the test results of a recent scan.

6
0:00:27.205,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I was 35 and finally living the life I wanted.

7
0:00:31.711,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I married my high school sweetheart

8
0:00:33.829,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and had finally gotten pregnant after years of infertility.

9
0:00:38.344,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And then suddenly we had a Zach,

10
0:00:41.249,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a perfect one-year-old boy/dinosaur,

11
0:00:44.983,000 --> 0:00:45,000
depending on his mood.

12
0:00:46.944,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And having a Zach suited me perfectly.

13
0:00:51.168,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I had gotten the first job I applied for in academia,

14
0:00:55.215,000 --> 0:00:57,000
land of a thousand crushed dreams.

15
0:00:58.601,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And there I was,

16
0:00:59.912,000 --> 0:01:01,000
working at my dream job

17
0:01:01.959,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with my little baby

18
0:01:03.465,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and the man I had imported from Canada.

19
0:01:06.237,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:07.657,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But a few months before, I'd started feeling pain in my stomach

21
0:01:10.659,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and had gone to every expert to find out why.

22
0:01:13.779,000 --> 0:01:14,000
No one could tell me.

23
0:01:15.444,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And then, out of the blue,

24
0:01:17.968,000 --> 0:01:2,000
some physician's assistant called me at work

25
0:01:21.539,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to tell me that I had stage IV cancer,

26
0:01:24.352,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and that I was going to need to come to the hospital right away.

27
0:01:28.239,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And all I could think of to say was,

28
0:01:31.269,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"But I have a son.

29
0:01:33.945,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I can't end.

30
0:01:35.943,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This world can't end.

31
0:01:38.249,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It has just begun."

32
0:01:41.458,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And then I called my husband, and he rushed to find me

33
0:01:44.125,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I said all the true things that I have known.

34
0:01:46.959,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I said, "I have loved you forever,

35
0:01:50.043,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I have loved you forever.

36
0:01:51.731,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I am so sorry.

37
0:01:53.739,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Please take care of our son."

38
0:01:56.806,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And then as I began the walk to the hospital,

39
0:01:59.559,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it crossed my mind for the first time,

40
0:02:02.526,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Oh. How ironic."

41
0:02:05.285,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I had just written a book called "Blessed."

42
0:02:09.097,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:12.077,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I am a historian

44
0:02:13.353,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and an expert in the idea that good things happen to good people.

45
0:02:17.373,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I research a form of Christianity nicknamed "the prosperity gospel,"

46
0:02:21.663,000 --> 0:02:25,000
for its very bold promise that God wants you to prosper.

47
0:02:25.883,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I never considered myself a follower of the prosperity gospel.

48
0:02:29.666,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I was simply an observer.

49
0:02:32.134,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The prosperity gospel believes that God wants to reward you

50
0:02:35.825,000 --> 0:02:37,000
if you have the right kind of faith.

51
0:02:37.959,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If you're good and faithful,

52
0:02:40.349,000 --> 0:02:42,000
God will give you health and wealth

53
0:02:42.582,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and boundless happiness.

54
0:02:44.817,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Life is like a boomerang:

55
0:02:46.316,000 --> 0:02:47,000
if you're good,

56
0:02:47.649,000 --> 0:02:49,000
good things will always come back to you.

57
0:02:50.245,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Think positively. Speak positively.

58
0:02:53.673,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Nothing is impossible if you believe.

59
0:02:58.11,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I got interested in this very American theology

60
0:03:01.58,000 --> 0:03:02,000
when I was 18 or so,

61
0:03:03.231,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and by 25 I was traveling the country interviewing its celebrities.

62
0:03:08.148,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I spent a decade talking to televangelists

63
0:03:11.878,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with spiritual guarantees for divine money.

64
0:03:15.501,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I interviewed countless megachurch pastors with spectacular hair

65
0:03:19.999,000 --> 0:03:21,000
about how they live their best lives now.

66
0:03:23.545,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I visited with people in hospital waiting rooms

67
0:03:26.176,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and plush offices.

68
0:03:28.221,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I held hands with people in wheelchairs,

69
0:03:30.754,000 --> 0:03:31,000
praying to be cured.

70
0:03:33.252,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I earned my reputation as destroyer of family vacations

71
0:03:37.981,000 --> 0:03:41,000
for always insisting on being dropped off at the fanciest megachurch in town.

72
0:03:42.653,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If there was a river running through the sanctuary,

73
0:03:45.675,000 --> 0:03:48,000
an eagle flying freely in the auditorium,

74
0:03:48.773,000 --> 0:03:5,000
or an enormous spinning golden globe,

75
0:03:51.617,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I was there.

76
0:03:54.199,000 --> 0:03:57,000
When I first started studying this, the whole idea of being "blessed"

77
0:03:57.903,000 --> 0:03:58,000
wasn't what it is today.

78
0:04:00.062,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It was not, like it is now,

79
0:04:02.169,000 --> 0:04:04,000
an entire line of "#blessed" home goods.

80
0:04:05.758,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It was not yet a flood of "#blessed" vanity license plates and T-shirts

81
0:04:10.93,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and neon wall art.

82
0:04:13.275,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I had no idea that "blessed" would become one of the most common cultural cliches,

83
0:04:18.655,000 --> 0:04:2,000
one of the most used hashtags on Instagram,

84
0:04:21.596,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to celebrate barely there bikini shots,

85
0:04:24.195,000 --> 0:04:26,000
as if to say, "I am so blessed.

86
0:04:26.659,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Thank you, Jesus, for this body."

87
0:04:28.952,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:32.233,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I had not yet fully grasped the way that the prosperity gospel

89
0:04:36.089,000 --> 0:04:38,000
had become the great civil religion,

90
0:04:39.03,000 --> 0:04:41,000
offering another transcendent account

91
0:04:41.554,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of the core of the American Dream.

92
0:04:44.176,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Rather than worshipping the founding of America itself,

93
0:04:47.708,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the prosperity gospel worshipped Americans.

94
0:04:51.027,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It deifies and ritualizes their hungers,

95
0:04:54.211,000 --> 0:04:56,000
their hard work and moral fiber.

96
0:04:58.305,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Americans believe in a gospel of optimism,

97
0:05:01.339,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and they are their own proof.

98
0:05:04.459,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But despite telling myself,

99
0:05:06.187,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"I'm just studying this stuff, I'm nothing like them,"

100
0:05:09.499,000 --> 0:05:1,000
when I got my diagnosis,

101
0:05:11.201,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I suddenly understood how deeply invested I was

102
0:05:15.423,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in my own Horatio Alger theology.

103
0:05:19.178,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you live in this culture, whether you are religious or not,

104
0:05:22.413,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it is extremely difficult to avoid falling into the trap

105
0:05:26.24,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of believing that virtue and success go hand in hand.

106
0:05:31.485,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The more I stared down my diagnosis,

107
0:05:34.017,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the more I recognized that I had my own quiet version

108
0:05:37.421,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of the idea that good things happen to good people.

109
0:05:41.15,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Aren't I good?

110
0:05:42.744,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Aren't I special somehow?

111
0:05:45.144,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I have committed zero homicides

112
0:05:47.97,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to date.

113
0:05:49.159,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:51.682,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:53.642,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So why is this happening to me?

116
0:05:56.65,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I wanted God to make me good

117
0:05:58.856,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and to reward my faith with just a few shining awards along the way.

118
0:06:03.377,000 --> 0:06:05,000
OK, like, a lot of shining awards.

119
0:06:05.655,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:06.687,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I believed that hardships were only detours

121
0:06:09.518,000 --> 0:06:12,000
on what I was certain would be my long, long life.

122
0:06:14.27,000 --> 0:06:18,000
As is this case with many of us, it's a mindset that served me well.

123
0:06:19.024,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The gospel of success drove me to achieve,

124
0:06:22.17,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to dream big,

125
0:06:23.764,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to abandon fear.

126
0:06:26.183,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It was a mindset that served me well

127
0:06:28.679,000 --> 0:06:29,000
until it didn't,

128
0:06:30.276,000 --> 0:06:33,000
until I was confronted with something I couldn't manage my way out of;

129
0:06:35.078,000 --> 0:06:37,000
until I found myself saying into the phone,

130
0:06:37.744,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"But I have a son,"

131
0:06:39.776,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because it was all I could think of to say.

132
0:06:45.411,000 --> 0:06:47,000
That was the most difficult moment to accept:

133
0:06:48.637,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the phone call, the walk to the hospital,

134
0:06:51.904,000 --> 0:06:54,000
when I realized that my own personal prosperity gospel

135
0:06:55.627,000 --> 0:06:56,000
had failed me.

136
0:06:57.673,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Anything I thought was good or special about me could not save me --

137
0:07:02.652,000 --> 0:07:04,000
my hard work, my personality,

138
0:07:05.46,000 --> 0:07:07,000
my humor, my perspective.

139
0:07:08.914,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I had to face the fact that my life is built with paper walls,

140
0:07:12.787,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and so is everyone else's.

141
0:07:16.821,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It is a hard thought to accept that we are all a breath away

142
0:07:20.95,000 --> 0:07:23,000
from a problem that could destroy something irreplaceable

143
0:07:24.755,000 --> 0:07:26,000
or alter our lives completely.

144
0:07:27.644,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We know that in life there are befores and afters.

145
0:07:31.743,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I am asked all the time to say that I would never go back,

146
0:07:36.088,000 --> 0:07:38,000
or that I've gained so much in perspective.

147
0:07:39.074,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And I tell them no,

148
0:07:40.907,000 --> 0:07:41,000
before was better.

149
0:07:45.793,000 --> 0:07:47,000
A few months after I got sick, I wrote about this

150
0:07:48.127,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and then I sent it off to an editor at the "New York Times."

151
0:07:51.742,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In retrospect, taking one of the most vulnerable moments of your life

152
0:07:55.963,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and turning into an op-ed

153
0:07:57.517,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is not an amazing way to feel less vulnerable.

154
0:08:00.331,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:01.841,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I got thousands of letters and emails.

156
0:08:04.943,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I still get them every day.

157
0:08:07.274,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I think it is because of the questions I asked.

158
0:08:10.321,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I asked: How do you live without quite so many reasons

159
0:08:14.945,000 --> 0:08:15,000
for the bad things that happen?

160
0:08:17.124,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I asked: Would it be better to live without outrageous formulas

161
0:08:22.41,000 --> 0:08:24,000
for why people deserve what they get?

162
0:08:26.093,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And what was so funny and so terrible was, of course,

163
0:08:29.364,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I thought I asked people to simmer down

164
0:08:31.63,000 --> 0:08:33,000
on needing an explanation for the bad things that happened.

165
0:08:34.417,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So what did thousands of readers do?

166
0:08:37.072,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Yeah, they wrote to defend the idea that there had to be a reason

167
0:08:41.381,000 --> 0:08:42,000
for what happened to me.

168
0:08:43.117,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And they really want me to understand the reason.

169
0:08:46.438,000 --> 0:08:5,000
People want me to reassure them that my cancer is all part of a plan.

170
0:08:51.808,000 --> 0:08:54,000
A few letters even suggested it was God's plan that I get cancer

171
0:08:55.253,000 --> 0:08:57,000
so I could help people by writing about it.

172
0:08:58.669,000 --> 0:09:,000
People are certain it is a test of my character

173
0:09:01.674,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or proof of something terrible I've done.

174
0:09:04.744,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They want me to know without a doubt

175
0:09:07.798,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that there is a hidden logic to this seeming chaos.

176
0:09:12.302,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They tell my husband,

177
0:09:13.957,000 --> 0:09:15,000
while I'm still in the hospital,

178
0:09:15.982,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that everything happens for a reason,

179
0:09:18.489,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and then stammer awkwardly when he says,

180
0:09:21.281,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"I'd love to hear it.

181
0:09:23.111,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I'd love to hear the reason my wife is dying."

182
0:09:27.636,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And I get it.

183
0:09:29.24,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We all want reasons.

184
0:09:31.133,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We want formulas

185
0:09:32.863,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to predict whether our hard work will pay off,

186
0:09:36.462,000 --> 0:09:4,000
whether our love and support will always make our partners happy

187
0:09:40.624,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and our kids love us.

188
0:09:43.46,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We want to live in a world in which not one ounce

189
0:09:46.395,000 --> 0:09:51,000
of our hard work or our pain or our deepest hopes will be for nothing.

190
0:09:52.793,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We want to live in a world in which nothing is lost.

191
0:09:58.92,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But what I have learned in living with stage IV cancer

192
0:10:02.916,000 --> 0:10:04,000
is that there is no easy correlation

193
0:10:05.581,000 --> 0:10:07,000
between how hard I try

194
0:10:08.166,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and the length of my life.

195
0:10:10.92,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In the last three years, I've experienced more pain and trauma

196
0:10:14.944,000 --> 0:10:16,000
than I ever thought I could survive.

197
0:10:18.1,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I realized the other day that I've had so many abdominal surgeries

198
0:10:21.478,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that I'm on my fifth belly button,

199
0:10:23.805,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and this last one is my least favorite.

200
0:10:26.207,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

201
0:10:29.41,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But at the same time, I've experienced love,

202
0:10:32.889,000 --> 0:10:34,000
so much love,

203
0:10:34.92,000 --> 0:10:36,000
love I find hard to explain.

204
0:10:38.23,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The other day, I was reading the findings

205
0:10:40.619,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of the Near Death Experience Research Foundation,

206
0:10:43.835,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and yes, there is such a thing.

207
0:10:45.941,000 --> 0:10:47,000
People were interviewed about their brushes with death

208
0:10:48.561,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in all kinds of circumstances:

209
0:10:50.331,000 --> 0:10:52,000
car accidents, labor and delivery,

210
0:10:52.823,000 --> 0:10:53,000
suicides.

211
0:10:54.28,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And many reported the same odd thing:

212
0:10:57.429,000 --> 0:10:58,000
love.

213
0:10:59.127,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I'm sure I would have ignored it if it hadn't reminded me

214
0:11:01.868,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of something I had experienced,

215
0:11:03.408,000 --> 0:11:05,000
something I felt uncomfortable telling anyone:

216
0:11:06.763,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that when I was sure that I was going to die,

217
0:11:09.641,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I didn't feel angry.

218
0:11:12.626,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I felt loved.

219
0:11:15.123,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It was one of the most surreal things I have experienced.

220
0:11:18.643,000 --> 0:11:22,000
In a time in which I should have felt abandoned by God,

221
0:11:22.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I was not reduced to ashes.

222
0:11:25.598,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I felt like I was floating,

223
0:11:27.967,000 --> 0:11:28,000
floating on the love and prayers

224
0:11:29.755,000 --> 0:11:32,000
of all those who hummed around me like worker bees,

225
0:11:33.04,000 --> 0:11:35,000
bringing me notes and socks and flowers

226
0:11:35.861,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and quilts embroidered with words of encouragement.

227
0:11:39.707,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But when they sat beside me,

228
0:11:41.903,000 --> 0:11:42,000
my hand in their hands,

229
0:11:43.85,000 --> 0:11:46,000
my own suffering began to feel like it had revealed to me

230
0:11:47.492,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the suffering of others.

231
0:11:49.733,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I was entering a world of people just like me,

232
0:11:53.572,000 --> 0:11:55,000
people stumbling around in the debris

233
0:11:55.848,000 --> 0:11:57,000
of dreams they thought they were entitled to

234
0:11:58.688,000 --> 0:12:,000
and plans they didn't realize they had made.

235
0:12:02.126,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It was a feeling of being more connected, somehow, with other people,

236
0:12:06.382,000 --> 0:12:08,000
experiencing the same situation.

237
0:12:09.304,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And that feeling stayed with me for months.

238
0:12:12.493,000 --> 0:12:13,000
In fact, I'd grown so accustomed to it

239
0:12:14.392,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that I started to panic at the prospect of losing it.

240
0:12:17.666,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So I began to ask friends, theologians, historians, nuns I liked,

241
0:12:23.932,000 --> 0:12:26,000
"What I am I going to do when that loving feeling is gone?"

242
0:12:28.143,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And they knew exactly what I was talking about,

243
0:12:30.469,000 --> 0:12:32,000
because they had either experienced it themselves

244
0:12:32.78,000 --> 0:12:35,000
or they'd read about it in great works of Christian theology.

245
0:12:35.834,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And they said,

246
0:12:37.137,000 --> 0:12:39,000
"Yeah, it'll go.

247
0:12:39.872,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The feelings will go.

248
0:12:41.817,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And there will be no formula for how to get it back."

249
0:12:45.672,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But they offered me this little piece of reassurance,

250
0:12:48.214,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and I clung to it.

251
0:12:50.375,000 --> 0:12:51,000
They said,

252
0:12:51.569,000 --> 0:12:54,000
"When the feelings recede like the tides,

253
0:12:54.687,000 --> 0:12:55,000
they will leave an imprint."

254
0:12:57.806,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And they do.

255
0:12:59.887,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And it is not proof of anything,

256
0:13:03.906,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and it is nothing to boast about.

257
0:13:05.764,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It was just a gift.

258
0:13:07.419,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So I can't respond to the thousands of emails I get

259
0:13:10.308,000 --> 0:13:12,000
with my own five-step plan to divine health

260
0:13:13.016,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and magical floating feelings.

261
0:13:16.023,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I see that the world is jolted by events that are wonderful and terrible,

262
0:13:22.03,000 --> 0:13:24,000
gorgeous and tragic.

263
0:13:25.191,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I can't reconcile the contradiction,

264
0:13:28.84,000 --> 0:13:3,000
except that I am beginning to believe that these opposites

265
0:13:31.776,000 --> 0:13:33,000
do not cancel each other out.

266
0:13:35.047,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Life is so beautiful,

267
0:13:37.52,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and life is so hard.

268
0:13:42.372,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Today, I am doing quite well.

269
0:13:46.23,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The immunotherapy drugs appear to be working,

270
0:13:49.085,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and we are watching and waiting with scans.

271
0:13:52.709,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I hope I will live a long time.

272
0:13:55.99,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I hope I will live long enough to embarrass my son

273
0:14:00.248,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and to watch my husband lose his beautiful hair.

274
0:14:04.027,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And I think I might.

275
0:14:06.161,000 --> 0:14:08,000
But I am learning to live

276
0:14:08.334,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and to love

277
0:14:10.145,000 --> 0:14:12,000
without counting the cost,

278
0:14:12.387,000 --> 0:14:16,000
without reasons and assurances that nothing will be lost.

279
0:14:17.143,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Life will break your heart,

280
0:14:20.13,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and life may take everything you have

281
0:14:22.787,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and everything you hope for.

282
0:14:25.063,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But there is one kind of prosperity gospel that I believe in.

283
0:14:29.868,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I believe that in the darkness,

284
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
even there,

285
0:14:33.815,000 --> 0:14:34,000
there will be beauty,

286
0:14:35.637,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and there will be love.

287
0:14:37.342,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And every now and then,

288
0:14:39.849,000 --> 0:14:42,000
it will feel like more than enough.

289
0:14:43.99,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Thank you.

290
0:14:45.215,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.442,000 --> 0:00:16,000
On January 4, 1934,

2
0:00:16.513,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a young man delivered a report

3
0:00:19.529,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to the United States Congress

4
0:00:21.914,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that 80 years on,

5
0:00:23.868,000 --> 0:00:27,000
still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today,

6
0:00:28.528,000 --> 0:00:33,000
still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet.

7
0:00:34.222,000 --> 0:00:36,000
That young man wasn't a politician,

8
0:00:37.102,000 --> 0:00:38,000
he wasn't a businessman,

9
0:00:39.101,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a civil rights activist

10
0:00:40.438,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or a faith leader.

11
0:00:42.213,000 --> 0:00:45,000
He was that most unlikely of heroes,

12
0:00:45.484,000 --> 0:00:47,000
an economist.

13
0:00:49.007,000 --> 0:00:51,000
His name was Simon Kuznets

14
0:00:51.552,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and the report that he delivered was called

15
0:00:54.696,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"National Income, 1929-1932."

16
0:00:59.148,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now, you might think

17
0:01:00.632,000 --> 0:01:03,000
this is a rather dry and dull report.

18
0:01:03.723,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And you're absolutely right.

19
0:01:05.805,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's dry as a bone.

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But this report is the foundation

21
0:01:10.57,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of how, today, we judge the success of countries:

22
0:01:13.503,000 --> 0:01:16,000
what we know best as Gross Domestic Product,

23
0:01:17.052,000 --> 0:01:19,000
GDP.

24
0:01:19.363,000 --> 0:01:21,000
GDP has defined and shaped our lives

25
0:01:22.266,000 --> 0:01:24,000
for the last 80 years.

26
0:01:24.864,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And today I want to talk about

27
0:01:26.681,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a different way to measure the success of countries,

28
0:01:30.52,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a different way to define and shape our lives

29
0:01:33.669,000 --> 0:01:36,000
for the next 80 years.

30
0:01:36.926,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But first, we have to understand

31
0:01:38.817,000 --> 0:01:41,000
how GDP came to dominate our lives.

32
0:01:42.726,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Kuznets' report was delivered

33
0:01:44.986,000 --> 0:01:45,000
at a moment of crisis.

34
0:01:46.708,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The U.S. economy was plummeting

35
0:01:48.734,000 --> 0:01:49,000
into the Great Depression

36
0:01:50.349,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and policy makers were struggling to respond.

37
0:01:53.434,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Struggling because they didn't know what was going on.

38
0:01:56.579,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They didn't have data and statistics.

39
0:01:59.961,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So what Kuznet's report gave them

40
0:02:02.783,000 --> 0:02:05,000
was reliable data on what the U.S. economy

41
0:02:06.061,000 --> 0:02:07,000
was producing,

42
0:02:07.196,000 --> 0:02:1,000
updated year by year.

43
0:02:10.264,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And armed with this information,

44
0:02:12.604,000 --> 0:02:14,000
policy makers were, eventually,

45
0:02:14.612,000 --> 0:02:17,000
able to find a way out of the slump.

46
0:02:18.04,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And because Kuznets' invention

47
0:02:19.922,000 --> 0:02:2,000
was found to be so useful,

48
0:02:21.694,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it spread around the world.

49
0:02:23.382,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And now today, every country

50
0:02:25.851,000 --> 0:02:27,000
produces GDP statistics.

51
0:02:28.815,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But, in that first report,

52
0:02:31.922,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Kuznets himself delivered a warning.

53
0:02:35.466,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's in the introductory chapter.

54
0:02:37.447,000 --> 0:02:39,000
On page seven he says,

55
0:02:39.481,000 --> 0:02:41,000
"The welfare of a nation can, therefore,

56
0:02:42.11,000 --> 0:02:43,000
scarcely be inferred

57
0:02:43.664,000 --> 0:02:45,000
from a measurement of national income

58
0:02:45.664,000 --> 0:02:46,000
as defined above."

59
0:02:47.601,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's not the greatest sound bite in the world,

60
0:02:50.969,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and it's dressed up in the cautious language of the economist.

61
0:02:54.598,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But his message was clear:

62
0:02:56.774,000 --> 0:02:57,000
GDP is a tool

63
0:02:58.508,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to help us measure economic performance.

64
0:03:01.566,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's not a measure of our well-being.

65
0:03:04.534,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And it shouldn't be a guide to all decision making.

66
0:03:09.351,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But we have ignored Kuznets' warning.

67
0:03:12.221,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We live in a world where

68
0:03:13.777,000 --> 0:03:16,000
GDP is the benchmark of success

69
0:03:16.9,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in a global economy.

70
0:03:19.177,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Our politicians boast when GDP goes up.

71
0:03:22.406,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Markets move

72
0:03:23.69,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and trillions of dollars of capital

73
0:03:25.564,000 --> 0:03:26,000
move around the world

74
0:03:26.988,000 --> 0:03:27,000
based on which countries are going up

75
0:03:28.739,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and which countries are going down,

76
0:03:30.58,000 --> 0:03:32,000
all measured in GDP.

77
0:03:33.204,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Our societies have become

78
0:03:34.533,000 --> 0:03:38,000
engines to create more GDP.

79
0:03:38.908,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But we know that GDP is flawed.

80
0:03:42.443,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It ignores the environment.

81
0:03:44.973,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It counts bombs and prisons as progress.

82
0:03:48.629,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It can't count happiness or community.

83
0:03:51.878,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And it has nothing to say about fairness or justice.

84
0:03:56.621,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Is it any surprise that our world,

85
0:03:59.324,000 --> 0:04:01,000
marching to the drumbeat of GDP,

86
0:04:02.155,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is teetering on the brink of environmental disaster

87
0:04:05.432,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and filled with anger and conflict?

88
0:04:08.938,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We need a better way to measure our societies,

89
0:04:13.341,000 --> 0:04:18,000
a measure based on the real things that matter to real people.

90
0:04:18.724,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Do I have enough to eat?

91
0:04:20.686,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Can I read and write?

92
0:04:22.762,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Am I safe?

93
0:04:24.5,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Do I have rights?

94
0:04:26.655,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Do I live in a society where I'm not discriminated against?

95
0:04:29.784,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Is my future and the future of my children prevented from environmental destruction?

96
0:04:36.222,000 --> 0:04:37,000
These are questions that GDP

97
0:04:38.113,000 --> 0:04:42,000
does not and cannot answer.

98
0:04:43.016,000 --> 0:04:44,000
There have, of course,

99
0:04:44.535,000 --> 0:04:45,000
been efforts in the past

100
0:04:45.921,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to move beyond GDP.

101
0:04:48.563,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But I believe that we're living

102
0:04:49.938,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in a moment when we

103
0:04:51.212,000 --> 0:04:54,000
are ready for a measurement revolution.

104
0:04:54.952,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We're ready because we've seen,

105
0:04:57.628,000 --> 0:04:59,000
in the financial crisis of 2008,

106
0:04:59.862,000 --> 0:05:01,000
how our fetish for economic growth

107
0:05:02.681,000 --> 0:05:04,000
led us so far astray.

108
0:05:04.712,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We've seen, in the Arab Spring,

109
0:05:07.096,000 --> 0:05:08,000
how countries like Tunisia

110
0:05:08.941,000 --> 0:05:1,000
were supposedly economic superstars,

111
0:05:11.691,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but they were societies

112
0:05:13.216,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that were seething with discontentment.

113
0:05:16.495,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We're ready, because today we have the technology

114
0:05:20.183,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to gather and analyze data

115
0:05:22.498,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets.

116
0:05:26.545,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Today, I'd like to introduce you to the Social Progress Index.

117
0:05:31.428,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's a measure of the well-being of society,

118
0:05:34.155,000 --> 0:05:36,000
completely separate from GDP.

119
0:05:36.912,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's a whole new way of looking at the world.

120
0:05:40.569,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The Social Progress Index

121
0:05:42.179,000 --> 0:05:43,000
begins by defining what it

122
0:05:43.502,000 --> 0:05:44,000
means to be a good society

123
0:05:45.449,000 --> 0:05:48,000
based around three dimensions.

124
0:05:48.94,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The first is, does everyone have the basic needs for survival:

125
0:05:53.035,000 --> 0:05:55,000
food, water, shelter, safety?

126
0:05:55.885,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Secondly, does everyone have

127
0:05:58.605,000 --> 0:06:,000
access to the building blocks to improve their lives:

128
0:06:01.436,000 --> 0:06:05,000
education, information, health and sustainable environment?

129
0:06:05.948,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And then third, does every individual have access

130
0:06:09.632,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to a chance to pursue their goals

131
0:06:12.412,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and dreams and ambitions

132
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
free from obstacles?

133
0:06:15.417,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Do they have rights,

134
0:06:16.964,000 --> 0:06:17,000
freedom of choice,

135
0:06:18.353,000 --> 0:06:19,000
freedom from discrimination

136
0:06:19.875,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and access to the the world's most advanced knowledge?

137
0:06:23.336,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Together, these 12 components

138
0:06:26.7,000 --> 0:06:29,000
form the Social Progress framework.

139
0:06:30.035,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And for each of these 12 components,

140
0:06:32.123,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we have indicators to measure how countries are performing.

141
0:06:35.554,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Not indicators of effort or intention,

142
0:06:38.683,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but real achievement.

143
0:06:40.931,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We don't measure how much a country spends on healthcare,

144
0:06:44.133,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we measure the length and quality of people's lives.

145
0:06:48.446,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We don't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination,

146
0:06:53.045,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we measure whether people experience discrimination.

147
0:06:57.475,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But what you want to know

148
0:06:58.835,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is who's top, don't you? (Laughter)

149
0:07:01.851,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I knew that, I knew that, I knew that.

150
0:07:03.668,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Okay, I'm going to show you.

151
0:07:05.194,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I'm going to show you on this chart.

152
0:07:07.59,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So here we are,

153
0:07:08.934,000 --> 0:07:12,000
what I've done here is put on the vertical axis social progress.

154
0:07:13.146,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Higher is better.

155
0:07:14.481,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And then, just for comparison,

156
0:07:16.503,000 --> 0:07:17,000
just for fun,

157
0:07:17.825,000 --> 0:07:2,000
on the horizontal axis is GDP per capita.

158
0:07:21.693,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Further to the right is more.

159
0:07:23.583,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So the country in the world

160
0:07:26.737,000 --> 0:07:29,000
with the highest social progress,

161
0:07:30.127,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the number one country on social progress

162
0:07:33.486,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is New Zealand.

163
0:07:36.882,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Applause)

164
0:07:40.398,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Well done! Never been; must go.

165
0:07:43.215,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

166
0:07:45.537,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The country with the least social progress,

167
0:07:48.399,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I'm sorry to say, is Chad.

168
0:07:50.716,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I've never been; maybe next year.

169
0:07:53.638,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:55.447,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Or maybe the year after.

171
0:07:57.639,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now, I know what you're thinking.

172
0:07:59.212,000 --> 0:08:,000
You're thinking, "Aha,

173
0:08:00.592,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but New Zealand has a higher GDP

174
0:08:02.988,000 --> 0:08:03,000
than Chad!"

175
0:08:04.85,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's a good point, well made.

176
0:08:07.344,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But let me show you

177
0:08:08.806,000 --> 0:08:09,000
two other countries.

178
0:08:10.069,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Here's the United States —

179
0:08:12.495,000 --> 0:08:14,000
considerably richer than New Zealand,

180
0:08:15.242,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but with a lower level of social progress.

181
0:08:17.688,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And then here's Senegal —

182
0:08:20.34,000 --> 0:08:23,000
it's got a higher level of social progress than Chad,

183
0:08:24.337,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but the same level of GDP.

184
0:08:26.286,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So what's going on? Well, look.

185
0:08:28.035,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Let me bring in the rest of the countries of the world,

186
0:08:30.536,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the 132 we've been able to measure,

187
0:08:32.744,000 --> 0:08:34,000
each one represented by a dot.

188
0:08:35.082,000 --> 0:08:36,000
There we go. Lots of dots.

189
0:08:36.581,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, obviously I can't do all of them,

190
0:08:38.323,000 --> 0:08:39,000
so a few highlights for you:

191
0:08:40.056,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The highest ranked G7 country is Canada.

192
0:08:44.876,000 --> 0:08:46,000
My country, the United Kingdom,

193
0:08:46.98,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is sort of middling, sort of dull,

194
0:08:49.697,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but who cares —

195
0:08:51.062,000 --> 0:08:53,000
at least we beat the French.

196
0:08:53.24,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

197
0:09:00.737,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And then looking at the emerging economies,

198
0:09:03.004,000 --> 0:09:06,000
top of the BRICS, pleased to say, is Brazil.

199
0:09:06.338,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Applause)

200
0:09:08.044,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Come on, cheer!

201
0:09:09.831,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Go, Brazil!

202
0:09:11.773,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Beating South Africa,

203
0:09:13.306,000 --> 0:09:14,000
then Russia,

204
0:09:14.599,000 --> 0:09:15,000
then China

205
0:09:15.733,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and then India.

206
0:09:17.307,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Tucked away on the right-hand side,

207
0:09:19.672,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you will see a dot of a country with a lot of GDP

208
0:09:23.025,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but not a huge amount of social progress —

209
0:09:24.968,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that's Kuwait.

210
0:09:26.946,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Just above Brazil

211
0:09:28.637,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is a social progress superpower —

212
0:09:30.956,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that's Costa Rica.

213
0:09:32.456,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's got a level of social progress the same as some Western European countries,

214
0:09:36.431,000 --> 0:09:37,000
with a much lower GDP.

215
0:09:38.4,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now, my slide is getting a little cluttered

216
0:09:40.682,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and I'd like to step back a bit.

217
0:09:42.364,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So let me take away these countries,

218
0:09:43.818,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and then pop in the regression line.

219
0:09:46.732,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So this shows the average relationship

220
0:09:48.385,000 --> 0:09:5,000
between GDP and social progress.

221
0:09:50.896,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The first thing to notice,

222
0:09:53.138,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is that there's lots of noise

223
0:09:54.993,000 --> 0:09:55,000
around the trend line.

224
0:09:56.69,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And what this shows,

225
0:09:58.275,000 --> 0:10:,000
what this empirically demonstrates,

226
0:10:01.157,000 --> 0:10:04,000
is that GDP is not destiny.

227
0:10:04.192,000 --> 0:10:07,000
At every level of GDP per capita,

228
0:10:07.395,000 --> 0:10:1,000
there are opportunities for more social progress,

229
0:10:10.593,000 --> 0:10:12,000
risks of less.

230
0:10:12.596,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The second thing to notice

231
0:10:14.056,000 --> 0:10:16,000
is that for poor countries,

232
0:10:16.559,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the curve is really steep.

233
0:10:18.532,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So what this tells us is that

234
0:10:19.807,000 --> 0:10:2,000
if poor countries can get

235
0:10:21.06,000 --> 0:10:22,000
a little bit of extra GDP,

236
0:10:22.954,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and if they reinvest that

237
0:10:24.737,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in doctors, nurses, water supplies,

238
0:10:27.409,000 --> 0:10:28,000
sanitation, etc.,

239
0:10:28.782,000 --> 0:10:3,000
there's a lot of social progress bang

240
0:10:30.801,000 --> 0:10:31,000
for your GDP buck.

241
0:10:32.387,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And that's good news, and that's what we've seen over the last 20, 30 years,

242
0:10:35.962,000 --> 0:10:37,000
with a lot of people lifted out of poverty

243
0:10:37.963,000 --> 0:10:39,000
by economic growth and good policies

244
0:10:40.173,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in poorer countries.

245
0:10:42.045,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But go on a bit further up the curve,

246
0:10:44.242,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and then we see it flattening out.

247
0:10:46.351,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Each extra dollar of GDP

248
0:10:48.603,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is buying less and less social progress.

249
0:10:51.839,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And with more and more of the world's population

250
0:10:54.513,000 --> 0:10:56,000
living on this part of the curve,

251
0:10:57.076,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it means GDP is becoming

252
0:10:59.3,000 --> 0:11:,000
less and less useful

253
0:11:01.084,000 --> 0:11:03,000
as a guide to our development.

254
0:11:03.6,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I'll show you an example of Brazil.

255
0:11:05.747,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Here's Brazil:

256
0:11:06.97,000 --> 0:11:08,000
social progress of about 70 out of 100,

257
0:11:09.841,000 --> 0:11:11,000
GDP per capita about 14,000 dollars a year.

258
0:11:12.335,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And look, Brazil's above the line.

259
0:11:15.256,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Brazil is doing a reasonably good job

260
0:11:17.142,000 --> 0:11:2,000
of turning GDP into social progress.

261
0:11:20.467,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But where does Brazil go next?

262
0:11:22.454,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Let's say that Brazil

263
0:11:23.966,000 --> 0:11:24,000
adopts a bold economic plan

264
0:11:25.738,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to double GDP in the next decade.

265
0:11:28.041,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But that is only half a plan.

266
0:11:31.657,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's less than half a plan,

267
0:11:33.934,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because where does Brazil want to go on social progress?

268
0:11:37.186,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Brazil, it's possible

269
0:11:39.504,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to increase your growth,

270
0:11:41.239,000 --> 0:11:42,000
increase your GDP,

271
0:11:42.816,000 --> 0:11:43,000
while stagnating or going backwards

272
0:11:44.706,000 --> 0:11:45,000
on social progress.

273
0:11:46.055,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We don't want Brazil

274
0:11:47.241,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to become like Russia.

275
0:11:48.973,000 --> 0:11:5,000
What you really want is for Brazil

276
0:11:51.288,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to get ever more efficient at creating social progress from its GDP,

277
0:11:56.241,000 --> 0:11:58,000
so it becomes more like New Zealand.

278
0:11:58.539,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And what that means is that

279
0:12:00.119,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Brazil needs to prioritize social progress

280
0:12:02.776,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in its development plan

281
0:12:04.468,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and see that it's not just growth alone,

282
0:12:06.88,000 --> 0:12:08,000
it's growth with social progress.

283
0:12:09.532,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And that's what the Social Progress Index does:

284
0:12:12.15,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It reframes the debate about development,

285
0:12:14.76,000 --> 0:12:16,000
not just about GDP alone,

286
0:12:16.82,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but inclusive, sustainable growth

287
0:12:19.399,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that brings real improvements in people's lives.

288
0:12:23.818,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And it's not just about countries.

289
0:12:26.394,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Earlier this year,

290
0:12:29.184,000 --> 0:12:33,000
with our friends from the Imazon nonprofit here in Brazil,

291
0:12:33.751,000 --> 0:12:37,000
we launched the first subnational Social Progress Index.

292
0:12:38.408,000 --> 0:12:4,000
We did it for the Amazon region.

293
0:12:40.868,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's an area the size of Europe, 24 million people,

294
0:12:44.656,000 --> 0:12:46,000
one of the most deprived parts of the country.

295
0:12:47.084,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And here are the results,

296
0:12:48.994,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and this is broken down

297
0:12:50.629,000 --> 0:12:53,000
into nearly 800 different municipalities.

298
0:12:54.133,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And with this detailed information

299
0:12:55.816,000 --> 0:12:57,000
about the real quality of life

300
0:12:58.034,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in this part of the country,

301
0:12:59.977,000 --> 0:13:,000
Imazon and other partners

302
0:13:01.957,000 --> 0:13:03,000
from government, business and civil society

303
0:13:04.286,000 --> 0:13:05,000
can work together to construct

304
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:07,000
a development plan

305
0:13:07.677,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that will help really improve people's lives,

306
0:13:10.014,000 --> 0:13:13,000
while protecting that precious global asset

307
0:13:13.25,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that is the Amazon Rainforest.

308
0:13:16.221,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And this is just the beginning,

309
0:13:18.122,000 --> 0:13:2,000
You can create a Social Progress Index

310
0:13:20.501,000 --> 0:13:25,000
for any state, region, city or municipality.

311
0:13:25.656,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We all know and love TEDx;

312
0:13:27.729,000 --> 0:13:29,000
this is Social Pogress-x.

313
0:13:29.971,000 --> 0:13:32,000
This is a tool for anyone to come and use.

314
0:13:33.165,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Contrary to the way we sometimes talk about it,

315
0:13:36.045,000 --> 0:13:42,000
GDP was not handed down from God on tablets of stone. (Laughter)

316
0:13:42.365,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's a measurement tool invented in the 20th century

317
0:13:46.36,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to address the challenges of the 20th century.

318
0:13:51.152,000 --> 0:13:52,000
In the 21st century,

319
0:13:53.004,000 --> 0:13:55,000
we face new challenges:

320
0:13:55.456,000 --> 0:13:58,000
aging, obesity, climate change, and so on.

321
0:13:58.564,000 --> 0:13:59,000
To face those challenges,

322
0:14:00.223,000 --> 0:14:02,000
we need new tools of measurement,

323
0:14:02.243,000 --> 0:14:05,000
new ways of valuing progress.

324
0:14:05.997,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Imagine if we could measure

325
0:14:08.395,000 --> 0:14:1,000
what nonprofits, charities,

326
0:14:10.925,000 --> 0:14:11,000
volunteers, civil society organizations

327
0:14:12.894,000 --> 0:14:15,000
really contribute to our society.

328
0:14:16.7,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Imagine if businesses competed

329
0:14:19.768,000 --> 0:14:22,000
not just on the basis of their economic contribution,

330
0:14:23.179,000 --> 0:14:26,000
but on their contribution to social progress.

331
0:14:27.003,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Imagine if we could hold politicians to account

332
0:14:30.95,000 --> 0:14:34,000
for really improving people's lives.

333
0:14:35.146,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Imagine if we could work together —

334
0:14:38.131,000 --> 0:14:43,000
government, business, civil society, me, you —

335
0:14:43.199,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and make this century the century of social progress.

336
0:14:48.704,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Thank you.

337
0:14:49.783,000 --> 0:14:55,000

1
0:00:12.606,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I recently retired

2
0:00:13.744,000 --> 0:00:15,000
from the California Highway Patrol

3
0:00:15.788,000 --> 0:00:17,000
after 23 years of service.

4
0:00:18.725,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The majority of those 23 years

5
0:00:20.691,000 --> 0:00:22,000
was spent patrolling the southern end

6
0:00:23.319,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of Marin County,

7
0:00:24.852,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.

8
0:00:28.029,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The bridge is an iconic structure,

9
0:00:30.316,000 --> 0:00:31,000
known worldwide

10
0:00:31.569,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for its beautiful views of San Francisco,

11
0:00:34.245,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.

12
0:00:38.636,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,

13
0:00:43.052,000 --> 0:00:47,000
being one of the most utilized sites in the world.

14
0:00:47.631,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.

15
0:00:50.761,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Joseph Strauss, chief engineer in charge of building the bridge,

16
0:00:55.084,000 --> 0:00:56,000
was quoted as saying,

17
0:00:56.688,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.

18
0:01:00.084,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Suicide from the bridge

19
0:01:01.793,000 --> 0:01:04,000
is neither practical nor probable."

20
0:01:05.559,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But since its opening,

21
0:01:07.853,000 --> 0:01:1,000
over 1,600 people have leapt to their death

22
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
from that bridge.

23
0:01:13.162,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Some believe that traveling

24
0:01:15.366,000 --> 0:01:17,000
between the two towers

25
0:01:17.431,000 --> 0:01:19,000
will lead you to another dimension --

26
0:01:19.554,000 --> 0:01:22,000
this bridge has been romanticized as such —

27
0:01:23.01,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that the fall from that

28
0:01:24.589,000 --> 0:01:27,000
frees you from all your worries and grief,

29
0:01:27.623,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and the waters below

30
0:01:29.407,000 --> 0:01:31,000
will cleanse your soul.

31
0:01:31.531,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But let me tell you what actually occurs

32
0:01:33.855,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when the bridge is used

33
0:01:35.041,000 --> 0:01:37,000
as a means of suicide.

34
0:01:37.095,000 --> 0:01:4,000
After a free fall of four to five seconds,

35
0:01:40.549,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the body strikes the water

36
0:01:43.218,000 --> 0:01:46,000
at about 75 miles an hour.

37
0:01:46.9,000 --> 0:01:48,000
That impact shatters bones,

38
0:01:49.617,000 --> 0:01:52,000
some of which then puncture vital organs.

39
0:01:52.969,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Most die on impact.

40
0:01:55.318,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Those that don't

41
0:01:57.07,000 --> 0:01:59,000
generally flail in the water helplessly,

42
0:01:59.663,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and then drown.

43
0:02:01.882,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I don't think that those who contemplate

44
0:02:04.05,000 --> 0:02:05,000
this method of suicide

45
0:02:05.872,000 --> 0:02:1,000
realize how grisly a death that they will face.

46
0:02:11.048,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This is the cord.

47
0:02:13.176,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Except for around the two towers,

48
0:02:15.233,000 --> 0:02:17,000
there is 32 inches of steel

49
0:02:17.521,000 --> 0:02:18,000
paralleling the bridge.

50
0:02:19.051,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is where most folks stand

51
0:02:21.336,000 --> 0:02:23,000
before taking their lives.

52
0:02:23.87,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I can tell you from experience

53
0:02:25.904,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that once the person is on that cord,

54
0:02:28.638,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and at their darkest time,

55
0:02:30.396,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it is very difficult to bring them back.

56
0:02:33.69,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I took this photo last year

57
0:02:35.732,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as this young woman spoke to an officer

58
0:02:37.668,000 --> 0:02:38,000
contemplating her life.

59
0:02:39.666,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I want to tell you very happily

60
0:02:41.922,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that we were successful that day

61
0:02:44.03,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in getting her back over the rail.

62
0:02:46.954,000 --> 0:02:48,000
When I first began working on the bridge,

63
0:02:49.346,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we had no formal training.

64
0:02:51.83,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You struggled to funnel your way through these calls.

65
0:02:55.624,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This was not only a disservice

66
0:02:58.088,000 --> 0:03:,000
to those contemplating suicide,

67
0:03:00.127,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but to the officers as well.

68
0:03:02.92,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We've come a long, long way since then.

69
0:03:06.1,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, veteran officers and psychologists

70
0:03:09.669,000 --> 0:03:11,000
train new officers.

71
0:03:12.34,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This is Jason Garber.

72
0:03:14.549,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I met Jason on July 22 of last year

73
0:03:17.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when I get received a call

74
0:03:18.875,000 --> 0:03:19,000
of a possible suicidal subject

75
0:03:20.817,000 --> 0:03:22,000
sitting on the cord near midspan.

76
0:03:23.566,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I responded, and when I arrived,

77
0:03:26.263,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I observed Jason

78
0:03:28.077,000 --> 0:03:31,000
speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.

79
0:03:31.448,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Jason was just 32 years old

80
0:03:33.972,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and had flown out here from New Jersey.

81
0:03:36.804,000 --> 0:03:37,000
As a matter of fact,

82
0:03:38.348,000 --> 0:03:39,000
he had flown out here on two other occasions

83
0:03:40.166,000 --> 0:03:41,000
from New Jersey

84
0:03:41.928,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to attempt suicide on this bridge.

85
0:03:45.342,000 --> 0:03:48,000
After about an hour of speaking with Jason,

86
0:03:48.9,000 --> 0:03:51,000
he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.

87
0:03:52.635,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Recalling your Greek mythology,

88
0:03:55.07,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Zeus created Pandora,

89
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:04:,000
and sent her down to Earth with a box,

90
0:04:00.394,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and told her, "Never, ever open that box."

91
0:04:04.298,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,

92
0:04:06.94,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and she did open the box.

93
0:04:09.342,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Out flew plagues, sorrows,

94
0:04:12.194,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and all sorts of evils against man.

95
0:04:15.406,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The only good thing in the box was hope.

96
0:04:19.985,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Jason then asked us,

97
0:04:22.558,000 --> 0:04:24,000
"What happens when you open the box

98
0:04:25.542,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and hope isn't there?"

99
0:04:28.724,000 --> 0:04:31,000
He paused a few moments,

100
0:04:31.774,000 --> 0:04:33,000
leaned to his right,

101
0:04:34.213,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and was gone.

102
0:04:36.414,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey

103
0:04:40.284,000 --> 0:04:43,000
had just committed suicide.

104
0:04:44.064,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,

105
0:04:47.064,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,

106
0:04:49.626,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,

107
0:04:53.39,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because that very next day,

108
0:04:55.61,000 --> 0:04:58,000
their family rabbi called to check on me.

109
0:04:59.13,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Jason's parents had asked him to do so.

110
0:05:02.924,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The collateral damage of suicide

111
0:05:05.132,000 --> 0:05:1,000
affects so many people.

112
0:05:10.235,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I pose these questions to you:

113
0:05:13.216,000 --> 0:05:15,000
What would you do if your family member,

114
0:05:15.884,000 --> 0:05:18,000
friend or loved one was suicidal?

115
0:05:18.992,000 --> 0:05:2,000
What would you say?

116
0:05:21.426,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Would you know what to say?

117
0:05:24.656,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,

118
0:05:28.582,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but the listening.

119
0:05:30.83,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Listen to understand.

120
0:05:35.446,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Don't argue, blame,

121
0:05:37.974,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or tell the person you know how they feel,

122
0:05:41.742,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because you probably don't.

123
0:05:44.353,000 --> 0:05:46,000
By just being there,

124
0:05:47.264,000 --> 0:05:51,000
you may just be the turning point that they need.

125
0:05:51.587,000 --> 0:05:54,000
If you think someone is suicidal,

126
0:05:54.691,000 --> 0:05:57,000
don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question.

127
0:05:58.405,000 --> 0:06:02,000
One way of asking them the question is like this:

128
0:06:02.615,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Others in similar circumstances

129
0:06:05.029,000 --> 0:06:07,000
have thought about ending their life;

130
0:06:07.197,000 --> 0:06:09,000
have you had these thoughts?"

131
0:06:09.956,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Confronting the person head-on

132
0:06:12.752,000 --> 0:06:15,000
may just save their life and be the turning point for them.

133
0:06:16.702,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Some other signs to look for:

134
0:06:19.151,000 --> 0:06:23,000
hopelessness, believing that things are terrible

135
0:06:23.299,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and never going to get better;

136
0:06:26.426,000 --> 0:06:29,000
helplessness, believing that there is nothing

137
0:06:29.871,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that you can do about it;

138
0:06:32.303,000 --> 0:06:34,000
recent social withdrawal;

139
0:06:34.9,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and a loss of interest in life.

140
0:06:39.717,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,

141
0:06:43.639,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and I received an email from a lady

142
0:06:46.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that I'd like to read you her letter.

143
0:06:51.325,000 --> 0:06:59,000
She lost her son on January 19 of this year,

144
0:06:59.437,000 --> 0:07:,000
and she wrote this me this email

145
0:07:01.25,000 --> 0:07:04,000
just a couple of days ago,

146
0:07:04.62,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and it's with her permission and blessing

147
0:07:06.62,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that I read this to you.

148
0:07:09.645,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.

149
0:07:13.647,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That must be quite the experience to be there.

150
0:07:16.581,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend.

151
0:07:20.213,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Just wanted to drop you a note.

152
0:07:22.746,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Hope you get the word out to many people

153
0:07:24.967,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and they go home talking about it

154
0:07:27.079,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to their friends who tell their friends, etc.

155
0:07:31.745,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I'm still pretty numb,

156
0:07:34.189,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but noticing more moments of really realizing

157
0:07:37.261,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Mike isn't coming home.

158
0:07:39.973,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco

159
0:07:42.72,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to watch the 49ers game with his father

160
0:07:44.637,000 --> 0:07:46,000
on January 19.

161
0:07:46.67,000 --> 0:07:48,000
He never made it there.

162
0:07:49.614,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I called Petaluma police

163
0:07:51.661,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and reported him missing that evening.

164
0:07:54.157,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The next morning,

165
0:07:56.059,000 --> 0:07:59,000
two officers came to my home

166
0:07:59.782,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.

167
0:08:04.286,000 --> 0:08:06,000
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge

168
0:08:06.75,000 --> 0:08:1,000
at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.

169
0:08:11.002,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Thanks so much

170
0:08:13.622,000 --> 0:08:14,000
for standing up for those

171
0:08:14.806,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who may be only temporarily too weak

172
0:08:17.358,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to stand for themselves.

173
0:08:19.9,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Who hasn't been low before

174
0:08:21.92,000 --> 0:08:24,000
without suffering from a true mental illness?

175
0:08:25.696,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.

176
0:08:29.057,000 --> 0:08:32,000
My prayers are with you for your fight.

177
0:08:32.454,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,

178
0:08:36.05,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is supposed to be a passage across

179
0:08:38.776,000 --> 0:08:4,000
our beautiful bay,

180
0:08:40.859,000 --> 0:08:42,000
not a graveyard.

181
0:08:43.546,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Good luck this week. Vicky."

182
0:08:48.81,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I can't imagine the courage it takes for her

183
0:08:51.853,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to go down to that bridge and walk the path

184
0:08:53.795,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that her son took that day,

185
0:08:57.233,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and also the courage just to carry on.

186
0:09:02.307,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I'd like to introduce you to a man

187
0:09:06.053,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I refer to as hope and courage.

188
0:09:11.695,000 --> 0:09:13,000
On March 11 of 2005,

189
0:09:14.334,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I responded to a radio call of a possible

190
0:09:16.997,000 --> 0:09:18,000
suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk

191
0:09:19.211,000 --> 0:09:2,000
near the north tower.

192
0:09:20.699,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk

193
0:09:23.387,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,

194
0:09:26.099,000 --> 0:09:28,000
standing on the sidewalk.

195
0:09:28.635,000 --> 0:09:31,000
When he saw me, he immediately traversed

196
0:09:32.06,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that pedestrian rail,

197
0:09:34.237,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and stood on that small pipe

198
0:09:35.109,000 --> 0:09:38,000
which goes around the tower.

199
0:09:38.181,000 --> 0:09:4,000
For the next hour and a half,

200
0:09:40.515,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I listened as Kevin spoke about

201
0:09:43.443,000 --> 0:09:45,000
his depression and hopelessness.

202
0:09:46.331,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Kevin decided on his own that day

203
0:09:49.005,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to come back over that rail

204
0:09:50.687,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and give life another chance.

205
0:09:53.419,000 --> 0:09:54,000
When Kevin came back over,

206
0:09:55.19,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I congratulated him.

207
0:09:57.231,000 --> 0:09:59,000
"This is a new beginning, a new life."

208
0:09:59.981,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But I asked him, "What was it

209
0:10:03.015,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that made you come back

210
0:10:04.74,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and give hope and life another chance?"

211
0:10:07.53,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And you know what he told me?

212
0:10:10.221,000 --> 0:10:12,000
He said, "You listened.

213
0:10:12.751,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You let me speak, and you just listened."

214
0:10:17.951,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Shortly after this incident,

215
0:10:19.91,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I received a letter from Kevin's mother,

216
0:10:23.169,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and I have that letter with me,

217
0:10:26.081,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and I'd like to read it to you.

218
0:10:28.931,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"Dear Mr. Briggs,

219
0:10:31.087,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Nothing will erase the events of March 11,

220
0:10:33.952,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.

221
0:10:37.08,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.

222
0:10:41.373,000 --> 0:10:43,000
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness

223
0:10:44.095,000 --> 0:10:46,000
for which he has been properly medicated.

224
0:10:46.929,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,

225
0:10:50.297,000 --> 0:10:53,000
completely unaware of any hereditary traits,

226
0:10:54.245,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but, thank God, now we know.

227
0:10:58.429,000 --> 0:11:,000
Kevin is straight, as he says.

228
0:11:01.255,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We truly thank God for you.

229
0:11:03.94,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Sincerely indebted to you,

230
0:11:06.341,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Narvella Berthia."

231
0:11:09.033,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And on the bottom she writes,

232
0:11:11.081,000 --> 0:11:16,000
"P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening,

233
0:11:16.517,000 --> 0:11:17,000
you were listed as the patient.

234
0:11:18.445,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."

235
0:11:23.427,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Today, Kevin is a loving father

236
0:11:27.557,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and contributing member of society.

237
0:11:30.242,000 --> 0:11:31,000
He speaks openly

238
0:11:31.711,000 --> 0:11:33,000
about the events that day and his depression

239
0:11:34.645,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in the hopes that his story

240
0:11:36.327,000 --> 0:11:39,000
will inspire others.

241
0:11:39.401,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job.

242
0:11:42.831,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's personal.

243
0:11:44.863,000 --> 0:11:47,000
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.

244
0:11:48.737,000 --> 0:11:51,000
That act, although ending his own pain,

245
0:11:52.611,000 --> 0:11:56,000
robbed me from ever getting to know him.

246
0:11:57.157,000 --> 0:11:59,000
This is what suicide does.

247
0:11:59.823,000 --> 0:12:01,000
For most suicidal folks,

248
0:12:02.171,000 --> 0:12:03,000
or those contemplating suicide,

249
0:12:04.125,000 --> 0:12:06,000
they wouldn't think of hurting another person.

250
0:12:06.831,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They just want their own pain to end.

251
0:12:10.415,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:

252
0:12:14.451,000 --> 0:12:19,000
sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.

253
0:12:20.109,000 --> 0:12:22,000
In my career, I've responded to

254
0:12:22.829,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and been involved in hundreds

255
0:12:25.182,000 --> 0:12:27,000
of mental illness and suicide calls

256
0:12:27.96,000 --> 0:12:28,000
around the bridge.

257
0:12:29.754,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,

258
0:12:33.265,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I've only lost two,

259
0:12:35.237,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but that's two too many.

260
0:12:37.423,000 --> 0:12:39,000
One was Jason.

261
0:12:39.435,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The other was a man I spoke to

262
0:12:41.691,000 --> 0:12:42,000
for about an hour.

263
0:12:43.374,000 --> 0:12:45,000
During that time, he shook my hand

264
0:12:45.79,000 --> 0:12:47,000
on three occasions.

265
0:12:48.527,000 --> 0:12:5,000
On that final handshake,

266
0:12:50.603,000 --> 0:12:52,000
he looked at me, and he said,

267
0:12:52.937,000 --> 0:12:57,000
"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."

268
0:12:58.34,000 --> 0:13:,000
And he leapt.

269
0:13:00.473,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Horrible, absolutely horrible.

270
0:13:03.279,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I do want to tell you, though,

271
0:13:05.255,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the vast majority of folks

272
0:13:07.607,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that we do get to contact on that bridge

273
0:13:11.129,000 --> 0:13:14,000
do not commit suicide.

274
0:13:14.325,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Additionally, that very few

275
0:13:17.315,000 --> 0:13:19,000
who have jumped off the bridge and lived

276
0:13:19.971,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and can talk about it,

277
0:13:21.317,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that one to two percent,

278
0:13:24.13,000 --> 0:13:25,000
most of those folks have said

279
0:13:25.961,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that the second that they let go of that rail,

280
0:13:29.315,000 --> 0:13:31,000
they knew that they had made a mistake

281
0:13:31.88,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and they wanted to live.

282
0:13:34.931,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I tell people, the bridge not only connects

283
0:13:39.364,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Marin to San Francisco,

284
0:13:41.645,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but people together also.

285
0:13:44.837,000 --> 0:13:47,000
That connection, or bridge that we make,

286
0:13:48.63,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is something that each and every one of us

287
0:13:51.059,000 --> 0:13:52,000
should strive to do.

288
0:13:53.053,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Suicide is preventable.

289
0:13:56.077,000 --> 0:13:59,000
There is help. There is hope.

290
0:13:59.411,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Thank you very much.

291
0:14:02.441,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
As an Indian, and now as a politician

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and a government minister,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I've become rather concerned about

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the hype we're hearing about our own country,

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
all this talk about India becoming a world leader,

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
even the next superpower.

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In fact, the American publishers of my book,

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
added a gratuitous subtitle saying,

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"India: The next 21st-century power."

11
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I just don't think that's what India's all about,

12
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or should be all about.

13
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
seems to me terribly archaic.

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's redolent of James Bond movies

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and Kipling ballads.

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
After all, what constitutes a world leader?

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We will overtake China by 2034.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The Americans have even recognized it,

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in an agreement.

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Is it the economy? Well, we have now

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the fifth-largest economy in the world

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in purchasing power parity terms.

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we grew at 6.7 percent.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But, somehow, none of that adds up to me,

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in this part of the 21st century.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And so I wondered, could

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
what the future beckons for India to be all about

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
be a combination of these things allied to something else,

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the power of example,

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the attraction of India's culture,

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
what, in other words, people like to call "soft power."

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because of its culture, its political values,

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
its foreign policies.

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but we know the Alliance Francaise

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is all about French soft power, the British Council.

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But, the fact is, in fact,

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds

51
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
have done more for American soft power

52
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
around the world than any specifically government activity.

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So soft power is something that really emerges

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
partly because of governments,

55
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but partly despite governments.

56
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And in the information era we all live in today,

57
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
what we might call the TED age,

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
by a global public that's been fed

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
on an incessant diet of Internet news,

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of televised images,

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of cellphone videos, of email gossip.

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
In other words, all sorts of communication devices

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
are telling us the stories of countries,

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.

66
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, in this age, again, countries with access

67
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to multiple channels of communication

68
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and information have a particular advantage.

69
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
India has more all-news TV channels

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
than any country in the world,

72
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But, the fact still is that it's not just that.

74
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
One might argue that India has become

76
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
an astonishingly connected country.

77
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I think you've already heard the figures.

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.

79
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Currently there are 509 million cellphones

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in Indian hands, in India.

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.

82
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
In fact, those 15 million cellphones

83
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
are the most connections that any country,

84
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
including the U.S. and China,

85
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
has ever established in the history of telecommunications.

86
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But, what perhaps some of you don't realize

87
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is how far we've come to get there.

88
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You know, when I grew up in India,

89
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
telephones were a rarity.

90
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament

91
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
as a favor to those they deemed worthy.

93
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman

94
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But sometimes it just sat there.

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I went to high school in Calcutta.

97
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.

98
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But half the time we would pick it up

99
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
with an expectant look on our faces,

100
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
there would be no dial tone.

101
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,

102
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.

103
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."

104
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
If you then wanted to connect to another city,

106
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,

107
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you'd have to book something called a trunk call,

108
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.

109
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Or you could pay eight times the going rate

110
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
for something called a lightning call.

111
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,

112
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.

113
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
In fact, so woeful was our telephone service

114
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.

115
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner

116
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that in a developing country

117
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
communications are a luxury, not a right,

118
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that the government had no obligation to provide better service,

119
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,

120
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list

121
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
for telephones in India.

122
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:

123
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the 15 million cell phones a month.

124
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.

125
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart

127
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that looks like it was designed in the 16th century,

128
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
wielding a coal-fired steam iron

129
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that might have been invented in the 18th century.

130
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.

131
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,

132
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,

133
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.

134
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The other day I was in Kerala, my home state,

135
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
at the country farm of a friend,

136
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.

137
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"

138
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink

139
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.

140
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,

141
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and a voice said, "I'm up here."

142
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And right on top of the nearest coconut tree,

143
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,

144
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
was a local toddy tapper,

145
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.

146
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.

147
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast

148
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to find out where they get the best possible prices.

149
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor

150
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to find out if the market town was open,

151
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
if the market was on,

152
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.

153
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge

154
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to the market town to get that information and come back,

155
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
then they'd load the cart.

156
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.

157
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So this empowerment of the underclass

158
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is the real result of India being connected.

159
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.

160
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.

161
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized

162
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --

163
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --

164
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.

165
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."

166
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And the second goat says, "No, the book was better."

167
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I usually tend to think that the book is usually better,

169
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but, having said that,

170
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the fact is that Bollywood is now

171
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,

172
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,

173
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.

174
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother

175
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in a village in Senegal

176
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,

177
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
just to watch a Bollywood movie.

178
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
She can't understand the dialogue.

179
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.

180
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,

181
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.

182
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.

183
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And this is happening more and more.

184
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem

185
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.

186
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
India doesn't have a military mission there.

187
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?

188
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
One simple fact:

189
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.

190
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Why? Because that was the moment

191
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
when the Indian television soap opera,

192
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.

193
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.

194
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.

195
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They had to suspend functions at 8:30.

196
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Weddings were reported to be interrupted

197
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
so guests could cluster around the T.V. set,

198
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.

199
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --

200
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --

201
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*

202
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,

203
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,

204
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
any moving part they could find, at 8:30,

205
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.

206
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,

207
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."

208
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That's soft power. And that is what India is developing

210
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
through the "E" part of TED:

211
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
its own entertainment industry.

212
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --

213
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but it's true of our music, of our dance,

214
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.

215
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants

216
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,

217
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America

218
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.

219
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But, today in Britain, for example,

220
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Indian restaurants in Britain

221
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
employ more people than the coal mining,

222
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
ship building and iron and steel industries combined.

223
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So the empire can strike back.

224
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Applause)

225
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But, with this increasing awareness of India,

226
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
with yoga and ayurveda, and so on,

227
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
with tales like Afghanistan,

228
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
comes something vital in the information era,

229
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the sense that in today's world

230
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it's not the side of the bigger army that wins,

231
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
it's the country that tells a better story that prevails.

232
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.

233
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.

234
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
as a student in the mid '70s,

235
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.

236
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere

237
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology

238
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.

239
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.

240
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I had a friend, a history major like me,

241
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,

242
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
by an anxiously perspiring European saying,

243
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"

244
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

245
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We've gone from the image of India as

246
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
land of fakirs lying on beds of nails,

247
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,

248
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,

249
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
computer wizards, software gurus.

250
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.

251
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But, there is something more substantive to that.

252
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
The story rests on a fundamental platform

253
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
of political pluralism.

254
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It's a civilizational story to begin with.

255
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Because India has been an open society for millennia.

256
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple

257
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.

258
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,

259
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state,

260
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
somewhere around 52 A.D.,

261
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.

262
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora

263
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered

264
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
a single incident of anti-semitism.

265
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Applause)

266
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
That's the Indian story.

267
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Islam came peacefully to the south,

268
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
slightly more differently complicated history in the north.

269
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.

270
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,

271
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.

272
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population

273
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
keeps growing by 20 million a year.

274
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But, the fact is

275
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
that the last elections, five years ago,

276
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
gave the world extraordinary phenomenon

277
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
of an election being won by a woman political leader

278
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,

279
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,

280
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to be sworn in as Prime Minister

281
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,

282
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
in a country 81 percent Hindu.

283
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Applause)

284
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
This is India, and of course it's all the more striking

285
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
because it was four years later that we all applauded

286
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,

287
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
more than 220 years of free and fair elections,

288
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president

289
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
who wasn't white, male or Christian.

290
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --

291
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and he is male, but he isn't white.

292
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
All the others have been all those three.

293
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Laughter)

294
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
All his predecessors have been all those three,

295
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and that's the point I was trying to make.

296
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Laughter)

297
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But, the issue is

298
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that when I talked about that example,

299
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.

300
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Because ultimately, that electoral outcome

301
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
had nothing to do with the rest of the world.

302
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It was essentially India being itself.

303
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And ultimately, it seems to me,

304
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that always works better than propaganda.

305
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Governments aren't very good at telling stories.

306
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But people see a society for what it is,

307
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately

308
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
will make a difference in today's information era,

309
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
in today's TED age.

310
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So India now is no longer

311
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,

312
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,

313
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
we've every religion know to mankind,

314
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
with the possible exception of Shintoism,

315
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.

316
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.

317
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And those of you who cashed your money here

318
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
might be surprised to see how many scripts there are

319
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.

320
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We've got all of that.

321
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We don't even have geography uniting us,

322
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
because the natural geography of the subcontinent

323
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked

324
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
by the partition with Pakistan in 1947.

325
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,

326
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
because the name "India" comes from the river Indus,

327
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
which flows in Pakistan.

328
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But, the whole point is that India

329
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
is the nationalism of an idea.

330
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land,

331
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
emerging from an ancient civilization,

332
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
united by a shared history,

333
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.

334
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.

335
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And it's the nationalism of an idea that

336
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,

337
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,

338
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and still rally around a consensus.

339
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And the consensus is of a very simple principle,

340
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
that in a diverse plural democracy like India

341
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
you don't really have to agree on everything all the time,

342
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
so long as you agree on the ground rules

343
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
of how you will disagree.

344
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
The great success story of India,

345
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
a country that so many learned scholars and journalists

346
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,

347
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.

348
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.

349
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And I do want to make the point

350
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that if there is anything worth celebrating about India,

351
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
it isn't military muscle, economic power.

352
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
All of that is necessary,

353
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.

354
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.

355
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
We can't really be both of those.

356
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the

357
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
hardware of development,

358
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
the ports, the roads, the airports,

359
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
all the infrastructural things we need to do,

360
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and the software of development,

361
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India

362
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
to be able to have a couple of square meals a day,

363
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
to be able to send his or her children

364
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
to a decent school,

365
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and to aspire to work a job

366
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that will give them opportunities in their lives

367
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that can transform themselves.

368
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,

369
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.

370
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
But, it's all taking place in an open society,

371
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,

372
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill

373
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
the creative energies of its people.

374
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
That's why India belongs at TED,

375
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and that's why TED belongs in India.

376
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Thank you very much.

377
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
(Applause)

0:00:16.093,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.

3
0:00:19.97,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I do experiments to test how different chemicals

4
0:00:22.277,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in the brain influence the choices we make.

5
0:00:25.877,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making:

6
0:00:32.625,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a cheese sandwich.

7
0:00:34.863,000 --> 0:00:37,000
That's right. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich

8
0:00:38.523,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is the solution to all your tough decisions.

9
0:00:42.145,000 --> 0:00:47,000
How do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study.

10
0:00:47.202,000 --> 0:00:49,000
A few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested

11
0:00:49.502,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in how a brain chemical called serotonin

12
0:00:51.795,000 --> 0:00:54,000
would influence people's decisions in social situations.

13
0:00:55.065,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Specifically, we wanted to know how serotonin would affect

14
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the way people react when they're treated unfairly.

15
0:01:01.975,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So we did an experiment.

16
0:01:03.513,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them

17
0:01:06.659,000 --> 0:01:1,000
this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink

18
0:01:11.282,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin

19
0:01:14.914,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in the brain.

20
0:01:16.092,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This is the amino acid tryptophan.

21
0:01:19.069,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So what we found was, when tryptophan was low,

22
0:01:21.43,000 --> 0:01:23,000
people were more likely to take revenge

23
0:01:23.882,000 --> 0:01:26,000
when they're treated unfairly.

24
0:01:27.43,000 --> 0:01:3,000
That's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines

25
0:01:31.253,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that came out afterwards.

26
0:01:33.982,000 --> 0:01:35,000
("A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making")

27
0:01:36.477,000 --> 0:01:38,000
("What a friend we have in cheeses")

28
0:01:38.572,000 --> 0:01:41,000
("Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?

29
0:01:41.772,000 --> 0:01:46,000
("Official! Chocolate stops you being grumpy") Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?

30
0:01:47.167,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I thought the same thing myself when these came out,

31
0:01:49.3,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.

32
0:01:53.545,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We gave people this horrible-tasting drink

33
0:01:55.874,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that affected their tryptophan levels.

34
0:01:59.076,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found

35
0:02:02.757,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in cheese and chocolate.

36
0:02:05.558,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And of course when science says cheese and chocolate

37
0:02:07.868,000 --> 0:02:11,000
help you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention.

38
0:02:11.949,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So there you have it:

39
0:02:13.916,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the evolution of a headline.

40
0:02:17.423,000 --> 0:02:19,000
When this happened, a part of me thought, well,

41
0:02:19.765,000 --> 0:02:21,000
what's the big deal?

42
0:02:21.769,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end,

43
0:02:25.648,000 --> 0:02:27,000
it's just a news story.

44
0:02:27.724,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.

45
0:02:31.077,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time,

46
0:02:34.974,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and it affects not just the stories you read in the news

47
0:02:38.101,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but also the products you see on the shelves.

48
0:02:40.88,000 --> 0:02:42,000
When the headlines rolled, what happened was,

49
0:02:43.547,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the marketers came calling.

50
0:02:46.373,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement

51
0:02:49.592,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of a mood-boosting bottled water?

52
0:02:52.853,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Or would I go on television to demonstrate,

53
0:02:54.997,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in front of a live audience,

54
0:02:56.022,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that comfort foods really do make you feel better?

55
0:02:59.621,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I think these folks meant well, but had I taken them up on their offers,

56
0:03:03.582,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I would have been going beyond the science,

57
0:03:05.956,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and good scientists are careful not to do this.

58
0:03:09.213,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.

59
0:03:13.581,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Here's one example: Neuro drinks,

60
0:03:16.141,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a line of products, including Nuero Bliss here,

61
0:03:19.382,000 --> 0:03:21,000
which according to its label helps reduce stress,

62
0:03:22.283,000 --> 0:03:25,000
enhances mood, provides focused concentration,

63
0:03:25.709,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and promotes a positive outlook.

64
0:03:28.397,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I have to say, this sounds awesome. (Laughter)

65
0:03:33.022,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.

66
0:03:36.898,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was

67
0:03:40.328,000 --> 0:03:43,000
curious about some of the research backing these claims.

68
0:03:43.877,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So I went to the company's website looking to find

69
0:03:46.803,000 --> 0:03:49,000
some controlled trials of their products.

70
0:03:50.229,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But I didn't find any.

71
0:03:51.906,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Trial or no trial, these claims are front and center

72
0:03:55.644,000 --> 0:03:58,000
on their label right next to a picture of a brain.

73
0:03:59.606,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.

74
0:04:05.309,000 --> 0:04:07,000
A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people

75
0:04:07.771,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to read a scientific article.

76
0:04:10.462,000 --> 0:04:13,000
For half the people, the article included a brain image,

77
0:04:13.789,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and for the other half, it was the same article

78
0:04:15.652,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but it didn't have a brain image.

79
0:04:18.356,000 --> 0:04:19,000
At the end — you see where this is going —

80
0:04:19.988,000 --> 0:04:21,000
people were asked whether they agreed

81
0:04:22.098,000 --> 0:04:25,000
with the conclusions of the article.

82
0:04:25.42,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions

83
0:04:27.693,000 --> 0:04:28,000
with no image.

84
0:04:29.606,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And this is how much they agree with the same article

85
0:04:33.253,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that did include a brain image.

86
0:04:36.02,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So the take-home message here is,

87
0:04:37.969,000 --> 0:04:41,000
do you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.

88
0:04:42.876,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that

89
0:04:44.989,000 --> 0:04:47,000
neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades,

90
0:04:48.687,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and we're constantly discovering amazing things

91
0:04:51.14,000 --> 0:04:52,000
about the brain.

92
0:04:52.413,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Like, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT

93
0:04:55.557,000 --> 0:04:57,000
figured out how to break habits in rats

94
0:04:58.357,000 --> 0:05:01,000
just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.

95
0:05:02.35,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Really cool stuff.

96
0:05:03.94,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really

97
0:05:07.233,000 --> 0:05:12,000
high expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.

98
0:05:12.469,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot

99
0:05:15.508,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really,

100
0:05:19.054,000 --> 0:05:21,000
for what's variously been called neuro-bunk,

101
0:05:21.85,000 --> 0:05:26,000
neuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle.

102
0:05:27.542,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans

103
0:05:31.88,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to read people's thoughts and emotions.

104
0:05:35.792,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Here's a study published by a team of researchers

105
0:05:38.839,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as an op-ed in The New York Times.

106
0:05:41.672,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."

107
0:05:45.917,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It quickly became the most emailed article on the site.

108
0:05:50.367,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So how'd they figure this out?

109
0:05:52.536,000 --> 0:05:55,000
They put 16 people inside a brain scanner

110
0:05:55.564,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and showed them videos of ringing iPhones.

111
0:05:58.846,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain

112
0:06:02.308,000 --> 0:06:04,000
called the insula, a region they say

113
0:06:04.96,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is linked to feelings of love and compassion.

114
0:06:08.744,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula,

115
0:06:12.404,000 --> 0:06:16,000
this meant the subjects loved their iPhones.

116
0:06:16.691,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning,

117
0:06:18.835,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and that's that the insula does a lot.

118
0:06:22.351,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Sure, it is involved in positive emotions

119
0:06:24.656,000 --> 0:06:26,000
like love and compassion,

120
0:06:26.998,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but it's also involved in tons of other processes,

121
0:06:29.671,000 --> 0:06:32,000
like memory, language, attention,

122
0:06:32.744,000 --> 0:06:36,000
even anger, disgust and pain.

123
0:06:36.78,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So based on the same logic, I could equally conclude

124
0:06:41.243,000 --> 0:06:43,000
you hate your iPhone.

125
0:06:43.696,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The point here is, when you see activation in the insula,

126
0:06:46.54,000 --> 0:06:49,000
you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation

127
0:06:49.566,000 --> 0:06:53,000
from off this list, and it's a really long list.

128
0:06:54.232,000 --> 0:06:56,000
My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack

129
0:06:56.566,000 --> 0:06:59,000
have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third

130
0:06:59.688,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.

131
0:07:04.424,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So chances are really, really good

132
0:07:05.938,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that your insula is going off right now,

133
0:07:09.064,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but I won't kid myself

134
0:07:10.686,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to think this means you love me.

135
0:07:14.363,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So speaking of love and the brain,

136
0:07:17.27,000 --> 0:07:2,000
there's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love,

137
0:07:21.135,000 --> 0:07:24,000
who claims that scientists have found the glue

138
0:07:24.62,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that holds society together,

139
0:07:27.267,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the source of love and prosperity.

140
0:07:31.043,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This time it's not a cheese sandwich.

141
0:07:33.232,000 --> 0:07:36,000
No, it's a hormone called oxytocin.

142
0:07:37.089,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You've probably heard of it.

143
0:07:38.956,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing

144
0:07:41.848,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that when you boost people's oxytocin,

145
0:07:44.793,000 --> 0:07:48,000
this increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.

146
0:07:48.966,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule."

147
0:07:53.046,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now these studies are scientifically valid,

148
0:07:55.888,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.

149
0:08:00.024,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin

150
0:08:02.737,000 --> 0:08:06,000
increases envy. It increases gloating.

151
0:08:07.48,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group

152
0:08:10.796,000 --> 0:08:13,000
at the expense of other groups.

153
0:08:13.888,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation.

154
0:08:18.14,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So based on these studies, I could say oxytocin

155
0:08:21.96,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is an immoral molecule, and call myself Dr. Strangelove.

156
0:08:26.711,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter)

157
0:08:30.071,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines.

158
0:08:34.181,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We see it in supermarkets, on book covers.

159
0:08:36.959,000 --> 0:08:38,000
What about the clinic?

160
0:08:39.63,000 --> 0:08:42,000
SPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology

161
0:08:43.045,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that uses a radioactive tracer

162
0:08:45.114,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to track blood flow in the brain.

163
0:08:48.154,000 --> 0:08:51,000
For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars,

164
0:08:51.238,000 --> 0:08:55,000
there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you

165
0:08:55.356,000 --> 0:08:58,000
one of these SPECT scans and use the image

166
0:08:58.809,000 --> 0:09:,000
to help diagnose your problems.

167
0:09:01.446,000 --> 0:09:03,000
These scans, the clinics say, can help

168
0:09:03.975,000 --> 0:09:05,000
prevent Alzheimer's disease,

169
0:09:06.877,000 --> 0:09:08,000
solve weight and addiction issues,

170
0:09:09.341,000 --> 0:09:11,000
overcome marital conflicts,

171
0:09:12.013,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses

172
0:09:15.163,000 --> 0:09:18,000
ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.

173
0:09:18.742,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This sounds great. A lot of people agree.

174
0:09:21.312,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions

175
0:09:23.478,000 --> 0:09:26,000
of dollars a year in business.

176
0:09:26.782,000 --> 0:09:28,000
There's just one problem.

177
0:09:28.866,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The broad consensus in neuroscience

178
0:09:31.543,000 --> 0:09:34,000
is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness

179
0:09:34.728,000 --> 0:09:36,000
from a single brain scan.

180
0:09:37.511,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But these clinics have treated

181
0:09:39.742,000 --> 0:09:41,000
tens of thousands of patients to date,

182
0:09:42.182,000 --> 0:09:43,000
many of them children,

183
0:09:43.944,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection,

184
0:09:47.422,000 --> 0:09:52,000
so exposing people to radiation, potentially harmful.

185
0:09:53.419,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist,

186
0:09:56.533,000 --> 0:10:,000
about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness

187
0:10:00.814,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and even maybe to make us better and smarter.

188
0:10:05.538,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate

189
0:10:08.238,000 --> 0:10:12,000
help us make better decisions, count me in.

190
0:10:12.542,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But we're not there yet.

191
0:10:15.118,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain,

192
0:10:18.853,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love

193
0:10:22.551,000 --> 0:10:25,000
just by looking at their brain scans,

194
0:10:25.934,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.

195
0:10:30.198,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Maybe someday we will, but until then,

196
0:10:32.402,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims

197
0:10:35.245,000 --> 0:10:38,000
detract resources and attention away from the real science

198
0:10:38.631,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that's playing a much longer game.

199
0:10:42.39,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So here's where you come in.

200
0:10:44.828,000 --> 0:10:47,000
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it,

201
0:10:47.999,000 --> 0:10:49,000
don't just take them at their word.

202
0:10:50.878,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.

203
0:10:54.124,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Ask for the part of the story that's not being told.

204
0:10:58.022,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.

205
0:11:03.11,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.

206
0:11:07.605,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Thank you. (Applause)

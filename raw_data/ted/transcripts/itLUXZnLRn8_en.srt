1
0:00:12.78,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The longest journey that I have ever taken.

2
0:00:16.47,000 --> 0:00:17,000
That was in 2002.

3
0:00:18.869,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was only 19 years old.

4
0:00:21.146,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It was the first time I had ever been on an airplane

5
0:00:24.499,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and the first time that I had left my country,

6
0:00:27.328,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Rwanda.

7
0:00:29.423,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I had to move thousands of kilometers away

8
0:00:32.638,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to follow a dream.

9
0:00:34.262,000 --> 0:00:37,000
A dream I have had ever since I was a child.

10
0:00:37.889,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And that dream was to become an architect.

11
0:00:43.264,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That was impossible at the time in my country.

12
0:00:45.889,000 --> 0:00:46,000
There were no schools of architecture.

13
0:00:48.426,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So when I got a scholarship to study in China,

14
0:00:51.511,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I left my life and my family behind

15
0:00:54.241,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I moved to Shanghai.

16
0:00:56.724,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It was an amazing time.

17
0:00:59.252,000 --> 0:01:03,000
This country was going through a major building boom.

18
0:01:03.603,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Shanghai, my new home,

19
0:01:05.41,000 --> 0:01:07,000
was quickly turning into a skyscraper city.

20
0:01:09.241,000 --> 0:01:1,000
China was changing.

21
0:01:10.959,000 --> 0:01:14,000
World-class projects were built to convey a new image of development.

22
0:01:15.889,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Modern, striking engineering marvels were going up literally everywhere.

23
0:01:22.493,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But behind these facades,

24
0:01:25.212,000 --> 0:01:29,000
exploitation of huge numbers of migrant workers,

25
0:01:29.458,000 --> 0:01:32,000
massive displacement of thousands of people

26
0:01:32.639,000 --> 0:01:34,000
made these projects possible.

27
0:01:35.042,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And this fast-paced development

28
0:01:36.992,000 --> 0:01:38,000
also contributed significantly to the pollution

29
0:01:40.003,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that is haunting China today.

30
0:01:42.758,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Fast-forward to 2010,

31
0:01:44.72,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when I went back home to Rwanda.

32
0:01:47.32,000 --> 0:01:51,000
There, I found development patterns similar to what I saw in China.

33
0:01:52.087,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The country was and still is experiencing its own population and economic growth.

34
0:01:58.574,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The pressure to build cities, infrastructure and buildings

35
0:02:01.773,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is at its peak,

36
0:02:03.693,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and as a result,

37
0:02:04.939,000 --> 0:02:06,000
there is a massive building boom as well.

38
0:02:08.392,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This is the reality across the entire continent of Africa,

39
0:02:13.29,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and here's why.

40
0:02:14.913,000 --> 0:02:17,000
By 2050, Africa's population will double,

41
0:02:18.045,000 --> 0:02:21,000
reaching 2.5 billion people.

42
0:02:22.323,000 --> 0:02:23,000
At this point,

43
0:02:23.959,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the African population will be slightly less than the current population

44
0:02:29.014,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of China and India combined.

45
0:02:34.963,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The infrastructure and buildings needed to accommodate this many people

46
0:02:39.956,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is unprecedented in the history of humankind.

47
0:02:44.072,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We have estimated that by 2050,

48
0:02:47.434,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we have to build 700,000,000 more housing units,

49
0:02:52.676,000 --> 0:02:54,000
more than 300,000 schools

50
0:02:55.688,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and nearly 100,000 health centers.

51
0:03:01.173,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Let me put that into perspective for you.

52
0:03:04.902,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Every day for the next 35 years,

53
0:03:08.608,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we have to build seven health centers,

54
0:03:11.545,000 --> 0:03:12,000
25 schools

55
0:03:13.427,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and nearly 60,000 housing units each day,

56
0:03:18.153,000 --> 0:03:19,000
every day.

57
0:03:22.039,000 --> 0:03:24,000
How are we going to build all of this?

58
0:03:25.698,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Are we going to follow a model of unsustainable building and construction

59
0:03:30.079,000 --> 0:03:32,000
similar to what I witnessed in China?

60
0:03:32.319,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Or can we develop a uniquely African model

61
0:03:36.376,000 --> 0:03:39,000
of sustainable and equitable development?

62
0:03:39.905,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm optimistic we can.

63
0:03:41.992,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I know Africans who are already doing it.

64
0:03:45.334,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Take Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi for instance,

65
0:03:48.398,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and his work in slums of coastal megacities.

66
0:03:52.121,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Places like Makoko in Lagos,

67
0:03:55.066,000 --> 0:03:59,000
where hundreds of thousands of people live in makeshift structures on stilts

68
0:03:59.851,000 --> 0:04:,000
on water,

69
0:04:01.052,000 --> 0:04:03,000
without government infrastructure or services.

70
0:04:04.272,000 --> 0:04:09,000
A community at great risk of rising sea levels and climate change.

71
0:04:10.223,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And yet, people who live here are examples of great ingenuity

72
0:04:14.6,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and the will to survive.

73
0:04:16.645,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Kunlé and his team have designed a prototype school

74
0:04:19.744,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that is resilient to rising sea levels.

75
0:04:22.737,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This is Makoko School.

76
0:04:26.502,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's a floating prototype structure that can be adapted to clinics,

77
0:04:30.731,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to housing, to markets

78
0:04:33.504,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and other vital infrastructure this community needs.

79
0:04:36.076,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's an ingenious solution

80
0:04:38.14,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that can ensure this community lives safely on the waters of Lagos.

81
0:04:43.895,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This is Francis Kéré.

82
0:04:46.726,000 --> 0:04:48,000
He works in the country where he comes from,

83
0:04:48.799,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Burkina Faso.

84
0:04:50.374,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Kéré and his team have designed projects that use traditional building techniques.

85
0:04:56.434,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Kéré and his team working in the communities

86
0:04:59.113,000 --> 0:05:01,000
have developed prototype schools

87
0:05:01.958,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that the whole community,

88
0:05:03.474,000 --> 0:05:06,000
similar to every project in the villages of this country,

89
0:05:07.122,000 --> 0:05:08,000
comes together to build.

90
0:05:10.028,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Children bring stones for the foundation,

91
0:05:13.035,000 --> 0:05:16,000
women bring water for the brick manufacturing,

92
0:05:16.39,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and everybody works together to pound the clay floors.

93
0:05:20.946,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Working with the community,

94
0:05:22.256,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Kéré and his team have created projects that function better,

95
0:05:25.915,000 --> 0:05:27,000
with adequate lighting and adequate ventilation.

96
0:05:29.231,000 --> 0:05:32,000
They're appropriate for this particular context

97
0:05:32.327,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and really, really beautiful as well.

98
0:05:34.881,000 --> 0:05:35,000
For the past seven years,

99
0:05:36.668,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I have been working as an architect at MASS Design Group.

100
0:05:40.266,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's a design firm that began in Rwanda.

101
0:05:44.48,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We have worked in several countries in Africa,

102
0:05:47.734,000 --> 0:05:51,000
focusing on this more equitable and sustainable model

103
0:05:52.071,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of architectural practice,

104
0:05:53.935,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and Malawi is one of those countries.

105
0:05:56.587,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It's a country with beautiful, remote landscapes

106
0:06:00.015,000 --> 0:06:02,000
with high-peak mountains and fertile valleys.

107
0:06:03.44,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But it also has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the world.

108
0:06:09.067,000 --> 0:06:12,000
A pregnant woman in Malawi either gives birth at home,

109
0:06:12.568,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or she has to walk a really long journey to the nearest clinic.

110
0:06:17.535,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And one out of 36 of these mothers dies during childbirth.

111
0:06:24.647,000 --> 0:06:25,000
In Malawi,

112
0:06:25.822,000 --> 0:06:26,000
with our team at MASS Design Group,

113
0:06:27.736,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we designed the Kasungu Maternity Waiting Village.

114
0:06:30.856,000 --> 0:06:34,000
This is a place women come to six weeks before their due dates.

115
0:06:35.733,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Here they receive prenatal care

116
0:06:37.615,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and train in nutrition and family planning.

117
0:06:41.604,000 --> 0:06:43,000
At the same time, they form a community

118
0:06:44.196,000 --> 0:06:46,000
with other expectant mothers and their families.

119
0:06:48.96,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The design of the of Kasungu Maternity Waiting Village

120
0:06:51.509,000 --> 0:06:55,000
borrows from the vernacular typologies of Malawi villages

121
0:06:55.637,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and is built using really simple materials and techniques.

122
0:07:00.23,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The earth blocks that we used were made from the same soil of this site.

123
0:07:05.803,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This reduces the carbon footprint of this building,

124
0:07:09.12,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but first and foremost,

125
0:07:11.215,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it provides a safe and dignified space for these expectant mothers.

126
0:07:17.361,000 --> 0:07:19,000
These examples show that architecture and design

127
0:07:20.329,000 --> 0:07:25,000
have the power and the agency to address complex problems.

128
0:07:27.885,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But more to point,

129
0:07:30.641,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that we can develop a model of effective solutions

130
0:07:34.362,000 --> 0:07:35,000
for our communities.

131
0:07:36.476,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But these three examples are not enough.

132
0:07:40.128,000 --> 0:07:43,000
300 more examples will not be enough.

133
0:07:44.198,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We need a whole community of African architects and designers

134
0:07:49.58,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to lead with thousands more examples.

135
0:07:53.182,000 --> 0:07:54,000
In May of this year,

136
0:07:55.048,000 --> 0:07:58,000
we convened a symposium on African architecture, in Kigali,

137
0:07:58.643,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and we invited many of the leading African designers

138
0:08:02.365,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and architectural educators working across the continent.

139
0:08:06.617,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We all had one thing in common.

140
0:08:10.398,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Every single one of us went to school abroad

141
0:08:14.589,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and outside of Africa.

142
0:08:16.494,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This has to change.

143
0:08:19.271,000 --> 0:08:22,000
If we are to develop solutions unique to us,

144
0:08:22.652,000 --> 0:08:25,000
rather than attempting to turn Kigali into Beijing,

145
0:08:26.152,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or Lagos into Shenzhen,

146
0:08:28.661,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we need a community

147
0:08:30.439,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that will build the design confidence of the next generation

148
0:08:33.788,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of African architects and designers.

149
0:08:36.846,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

150
0:08:44.719,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In September last year,

151
0:08:46.055,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we launched the African Design Centre

152
0:08:49.159,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to start building this community.

153
0:08:53.7,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We admitted 11 fellows from across the continent.

154
0:08:58.021,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's a 20-month-long, design-build fellowship program.

155
0:09:03.091,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Here, they are learning to tackle big challenges

156
0:09:06.005,000 --> 0:09:08,000
such as urbanism and climate change,

157
0:09:08.541,000 --> 0:09:09,000
as Kunlé and his team have.

158
0:09:11.367,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They're working with communities

159
0:09:12.974,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to develop innovative building solutions and processes,

160
0:09:17.082,000 --> 0:09:19,000
as Kéré and his team have.

161
0:09:20.23,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They're learning to understand the health impact of better buildings

162
0:09:24.255,000 --> 0:09:27,000
as we at MASS Design Group have been researching

163
0:09:27.755,000 --> 0:09:28,000
for the past several years.

164
0:09:29.896,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The crowning moment of the fellowship

165
0:09:32.232,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is a real project that they designed and built.

166
0:09:36.407,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is Ruhehe Primary School,

167
0:09:38.948,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the project they designed.

168
0:09:40.431,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They immersed themselves in the community to understand the challenges

169
0:09:44.758,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but also uncover opportunities,

170
0:09:47.087,000 --> 0:09:51,000
like using a wall made of local volcanic stone

171
0:09:51.243,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to turn the entire campus into a space of play and active learning.

172
0:09:56.644,000 --> 0:09:58,000
They evaluated the environmental conditions

173
0:09:59.514,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and developed a roof system that maximizes daylight

174
0:10:02.792,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and improves acoustic performance.

175
0:10:05.243,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The construction at Ruhehe Primary School will begin this year.

176
0:10:10.861,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Applause)

177
0:10:16.759,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And over the coming months,

178
0:10:18.267,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the African Design Centre fellows are going to work hand-in-hand

179
0:10:21.897,000 --> 0:10:23,000
with the Ruhehe community to build it.

180
0:10:25.493,000 --> 0:10:26,000
When we asked the fellows

181
0:10:26.76,000 --> 0:10:29,000
what they want to do after their African Design Centre fellowship,

182
0:10:30.576,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Tshepo from South Africa said

183
0:10:32.859,000 --> 0:10:35,000
he wants to introduce this new way of building into his country,

184
0:10:36.138,000 --> 0:10:39,000
so he plans to open a private practice in Johannesburg.

185
0:10:39.985,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Zani wants to expand opportunities for women to become engineers.

186
0:10:44.966,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Before joining the African Design Centre,

187
0:10:47.126,000 --> 0:10:48,000
she helped start, in Nairobi,

188
0:10:48.882,000 --> 0:10:52,000
an organization to bridge the gender gaps for women in engineering fields,

189
0:10:53.597,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and she hopes to take this movement across Africa,

190
0:10:56.871,000 --> 0:10:57,000
eventually the whole world.

191
0:10:59.574,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Moses, from South Sudan,

192
0:11:02.041,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the world's newest country,

193
0:11:04.24,000 --> 0:11:06,000
wants to open the first polytechnic school

194
0:11:07.256,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that will teach people how to build using local materials from his country.

195
0:11:13.746,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Moses had to be determined to become an architect.

196
0:11:18.105,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The civil war in his country frequently interrupted his architectural education.

197
0:11:24.43,000 --> 0:11:27,000
At the time he was applying to join the African Design Centre,

198
0:11:27.81,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we could hear gunshots going off in the background of his interview call.

199
0:11:33.546,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But even in the middle of this civil war,

200
0:11:36.896,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Moses hangs on to this idea

201
0:11:38.755,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that architecture can be a way to bridge communities back together.

202
0:11:44.727,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You have to be inspired by this fellow's belief

203
0:11:48.061,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that great architecture can make a difference

204
0:11:50.609,000 --> 0:11:52,000
on how the future of Africa is built.

205
0:11:54.514,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The unprecedented growth of Africa cannot be ignored.

206
0:11:59.258,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Imagine Africa's future cities,

207
0:12:02.905,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but not as vast slums,

208
0:12:05.411,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but the most resilient

209
0:12:07.316,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and the most socially inclusive places on earth.

210
0:12:10.721,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is achievable.

211
0:12:13.909,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And we have the talent to make it a reality.

212
0:12:18.052,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But the journey to ready that talent for the task ahead,

213
0:12:22.063,000 --> 0:12:23,000
like my own journey,

214
0:12:23.754,000 --> 0:12:24,000
is far too long.

215
0:12:26.674,000 --> 0:12:3,000
For the next generation of African creative leaders,

216
0:12:31.131,000 --> 0:12:34,000
we have to shorten and streamline that journey.

217
0:12:35.106,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But most importantly --

218
0:12:36.516,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and I cannot stress this enough --

219
0:12:38.863,000 --> 0:12:4,000
we have to build their design confidence

220
0:12:41.165,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and empower them to develop solutions that are truly African

221
0:12:45.382,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but globally inspiring.

222
0:12:48.082,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Thank you very much.

223
0:12:49.257,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Applause)

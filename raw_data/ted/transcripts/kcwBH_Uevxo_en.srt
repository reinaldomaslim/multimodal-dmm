1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We invent.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My company invents

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
all kinds of new technology

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in lots of different areas.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And we do that for a couple of reasons.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We invent for fun --

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
invention is a lot of fun to do --

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and we also invent for profit.

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The two are related because

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun,

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you wouldn't have the time to do it.

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So we do this

13
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
fun and profit-oriented inventing

14
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for most of what we do,

15
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but we also have a program where we invent for humanity --

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
where we take some of our best inventors,

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we say, "Are there problems

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?" --

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems,

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which is with dramatic, crazy,

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
out-of-the-box solutions.

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours

23
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that work on these problems

24
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and he also funds this work, so thank you.

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So I'm going to briefly discuss

26
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
a couple of problems that we have

27
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and a couple of problems where

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
we've got some solutions underway.

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Vaccination is one of the

30
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
key techniques in public health,

31
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a fantastic thing.

32
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
spoil before they're administered,

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and that's because they need to be kept cold.

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures.

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They go bad very quickly if you don't,

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and if you don't have stable power grid, this doesn't happen,

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so kids die.

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters;

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This is one of the ways that

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
vaccines are carried:

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people,

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks.

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
We've got a different solution.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, one of these Styrofoam chests

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
will last for about four hours with ice in it.

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And we thought, well, that's not really good enough.

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So we made this thing.

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This lasts six months with no power;

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
absolutely zero power,

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because it loses less

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
than a half a watt.

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, this is our second generations prototype.

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The third generation prototype is, right now,

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in Uganda being tested.

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, the reason we were able to come up with this

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is two key ideas:

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar,

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They have incredible insulation,

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so let's put some incredible insulation here.

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The other idea is kind of interesting,

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is, you can't reach inside anymore.

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Because if you open it up and reach inside,

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
you'd let the heat in, the game would be over.

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It vends out little individual vials.

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So a simple idea,

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in Africa and around the world.

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We'll move on to malaria.

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Malaria is one of the great public health problems.

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this.

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Two hundred million people a year.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies;

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
27 will die during my talk.

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And there's no way for us here in this country

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to grasp really what that means to the people involved.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Another comment of Esther's

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
was that we react when there's

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
a tragedy like Haiti,

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but that tragedy is ongoing.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So what can we do about it?

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, there are a lot of things people have tried

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for many years for solving malaria.

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You can spray; the problem is there are environmental issues.

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
You can try to treat people and create awareness.

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad,

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
they don't have health care systems.

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
A vaccine would be a terrific thing,

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
only they don't work yet.

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for.

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You can distribute bed nets,

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and bed nets are very effective if you use them.

97
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You don't always use them for that. People fish with them.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They don't always get to everyone.

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And bed nets

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
have an effect on the epidemic,

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now, malaria is

103
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
an incredibly complicated disease.

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We could spend hours going over this.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle;

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
they have sex, they burrow into your liver,

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they tunnel into your blood cells ...

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it's an incredibly complicated disease,

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and why we work on malaria:

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
There's a lot of potential ways in.

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
One of those ways might be better diagnosis.

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So we hope this year

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to prototype each of these devices.

115
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works:

117
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You take a drop of blood,

118
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you put it in there and it automatically tells you.

119
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Today, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure,

120
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
create a bunch of microscope slides

121
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and have a trained person examine it.

122
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The other thing is, you know,

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And if you look through the eye,

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye,

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in fact, you may be able to do this

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
directly, without drawing any blood at all,

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or through your nail beds.

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels,

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.

131
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We can see it because of this molecule

132
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
called hemozoin.

133
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's produced by the malaria parasite

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it's a very interesting crystalline substance.

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Interesting, anyway, if you're a solid-state physicist.

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it.

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This is our femtosecond laser lab.

138
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So this creates pulses of light

139
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that last a femtosecond.

140
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
That's really, really, really short.

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
This is a pulse of light that's

142
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
only about one wavelength of light long,

143
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so it's a whole bunch of photons

144
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
all coming and hitting simultaneously.

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It creates a very high peak power

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things;

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in particular, it lets you find hemozoin.

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So here's an image of red blood cells,

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and now we can actually map

150
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are

151
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
inside those red blood cells.

152
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And using both this technique

153
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and other optical techniques,

154
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we think we can make those diagnostics.

155
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We also have another hemozoin-oriented

156
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
therapy for malaria:

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a way, in acute cases, to actually

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system.

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Sort of like doing dialysis,

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but for relieving the parasite load.

161
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is our thousand-core supercomputer.

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We're kind of software guys,

163
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and so nearly any problem that you pose,

164
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
we like to try to solve with some software.

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria

166
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
or reduce it

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.

168
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Okay, we heard about bed nets earlier.

169
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You spend a certain amount per bed net.

170
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Or you could spray.

171
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You can give drug administration.

172
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
There's all these different interventions

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but they have different kinds of effectiveness.

174
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
How can you tell?

175
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So we've created, using our supercomputer,

176
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the world's best computer model of malaria,

177
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which we'll show you now.

178
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We picked Madagascar.

179
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We have every road,

180
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
every village,

181
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
every, almost, square inch of Madagascar.

182
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We have all of the precipitation data

183
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the temperature data.

184
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation

185
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
tell you whether you've got

186
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.

187
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So that sets the stage on which you do this.

188
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
You then have to introduce the mosquitoes,

189
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and you have to model that

190
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and how they come and go.

191
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Ultimately, it gives you this.

192
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This is malaria spreading

193
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
across Madagascar.

194
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And this is this latter part of the rainy season.

195
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We're going to the dry season now.

196
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It nearly goes away in the dry season,

197
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.

199
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
By doing these kinds of simulations,

200
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we want to eradicate or control malaria

201
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
thousands of times in software

202
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
before we actually have to do it in real life;

203
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs --

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
how many bed nets versus how much spraying? --

205
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or the social trade-offs --

206
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
what happens if unrest breaks out?

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We also try to study our foe.

208
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is a high-speed camera view

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
of a mosquito.

210
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And, in a moment,

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
we're going to see a view of the airflow.

212
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Here, we're trying to visualize the airflow

213
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
around the wings of the mosquito

214
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with little particles we're illuminating with a laser.

215
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
By understanding how mosquitoes fly,

216
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we hope to understand how to make them not fly.

217
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, one of the ways you can make them not fly

218
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is with DDT.

219
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is a real ad.

220
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This is one of those things you just can't make up.

221
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Once upon a time, this was the primary technique,

222
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.

223
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The United States did.

224
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year

225
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
of malaria in the United States,

226
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but DDT and a massive public health effort

227
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
managed to squelch it.

228
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So we thought,

229
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium,

230
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the parasite involved.

231
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
What can we do to the mosquito?

232
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Well, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics."

233
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Now, that sounds silly,

234
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but each of these devices

235
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
has something interesting in it that maybe you could use.

236
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Your Blu-ray player has

237
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
a very cheap blue laser.

238
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer

239
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately;

240
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that's what makes those little dots on the page.

241
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And, of course, there's signal processing

242
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and digital cameras.

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So what if we could put all that together

244
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to shoot them out of the sky with lasers?

245
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Laughter)

246
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Applause)

247
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now, in our company, this is what we call

248
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"the pinky-suck moment."

249
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

250
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
What if we could do that?

251
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment,

252
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and let's think of what could happen

253
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
if we could do that.

254
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Well, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics.

255
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Clinics are full of people that have malaria.

256
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
They're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.

257
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You really want to protect them.

258
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Of course, if you do that,

259
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you could also protect your backyard.

260
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And farmers could protect their crops

261
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that they want to sell to Whole Foods

262
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because our photons

263
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
are 100 percent organic. (Laughter)

264
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They're completely natural.

265
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now, it actually gets better than this.

266
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
You could, if you're really smart,

267
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug

268
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
before you zap it,

269
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and you could listen to the wing beat frequency

270
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and you could measure the size.

271
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And then you could decide:

272
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"Is this an insect I want to kill,

273
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
or an insect I don't want to kill?"

274
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Moore's law made computing cheap;

275
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
so cheap we can weigh

276
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the life of an individual insect

277
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and decide thumbs up

278
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
or thumbs down. (Laughter)

279
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Now, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.

280
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
They're the only ones that are dangerous.

281
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Mosquitoes only drink blood

282
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to lay eggs.

283
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition

284
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
comes from nectar, from flowers --

285
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins --

286
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but the female needs the blood meal.

287
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So, this sounds really crazy, right?

288
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
Would you like to see it?

289
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Audience: Yeah!

290
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Nathan Myhrvold: Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer,

291
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and here it is.

292
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Laughter)

293
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Now, after thinking about this a little bit

294
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we thought, you know, it probably would be simpler

295
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to do this with a nonlethal laser.

296
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So, Eric Johanson, who built the device,

297
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
actually, with parts from eBay;

298
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and Pablos Holman over here,

299
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
he's got mosquitoes in the tank.

300
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We have the device over here.

301
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And we're going to show you,

302
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
instead of the kill laser,

303
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse,

304
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we're going to have a green laser pointer

305
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time;

306
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
otherwise, you can't see it very well.

307
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Take it away Eric.

308
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Eric Johanson: What we have here

309
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
is a tank on the other side of the stage.

310
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And we have ... this computer screen

311
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around.

312
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And Pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit

313
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we can see them flying around.

314
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Now, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine,

315
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and let me show you how it works.

316
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked

317
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
as they're flying around,

318
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
which is kind of fun.

319
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Next we can actually light them up with a laser. (Laughter)

320
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Now, this is a low powered laser,

321
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency.

322
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.

323
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
NM: That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing.

324
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
EJ: Finally, let's see what this looks like.

325
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up.

326
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
This is slowed way down

327
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening.

328
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Here we have it running at high-speed mode.

329
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate

330
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this,

331
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and we're looking very hard at how to make it

332
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world.

333
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Applause)

334
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
NM: So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that

335
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em.

336
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Laughter)

337
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

338
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
This is very satisfying.

339
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Laughter)

340
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
This is one of the first ones we did.

341
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The energy's a little bit high here.

342
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
(Laughter)

343
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We'll loop around here in just a second, and you'll see another one.

344
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Here's another one. Bang.

345
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
An interesting thing is, we kill them all the time;

346
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair.

347
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The wing motor is very resilient.

348
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I mean, here we're blowing wings off

349
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
but the wing motor keeps all the way down.

350
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So, that's what I have. Thanks very much.

351
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
(Applause)

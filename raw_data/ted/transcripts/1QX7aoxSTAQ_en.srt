1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I've been in Afghanistan for 21 years.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I work for the Red Cross

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I'm a physical therapist.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My job is to make arms and legs --

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
well it's not completely true.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We do more than that.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We provide the patients,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the Afghan disabled,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
first with the physical rehabilitation

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
then with the social reintegration.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's a very logical plan,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but it was not always like this.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
For many years, we were just providing them

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with artificial limbs.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It took quite many years

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the program to become what it is now.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Today, I would like to tell you a story,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the story of a big change,

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and the story of the people

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
who made this change possible.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I arrived in Afghanistan

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in 1990

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to work in a hospital

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
for war victims.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And then, not only for war victims,

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but it was for any kind of patient.

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I was also working

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in the orthopedic center, we call it.

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is the place where we make the legs.

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
At that time

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I found myself

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in a strange situation.

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I felt not quite ready

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
for that job.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
There was so much to learn.

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
There were so many things new to me.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But it was a terrific job.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But as soon as the fighting intensified,

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the physical rehabilitation was suspended.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
There were many other things to do.

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So the orthopedic center was closed

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
because physical rehabilitation

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
was not considered a priority.

44
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It was a strange sensation.

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Anyway, you know every time I make this speech --

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion.

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's something that comes out from the past.

48
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's 21 years,

49
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but they are still all there.

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Anyway, in 1992,

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan.

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And the orthopedic center was closed.

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I was assigned to work for the homeless,

54
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
for the internally displaced people.

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But one day, something happened.

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I was coming back

57
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
from a big food distribution in a mosque

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
where tens and tens of people

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
were squatting in terrible conditions.

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I wanted to go home. I was driving.

61
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You know, when you want to forget,

62
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you don't want to see things,

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so you just want to go to your room, to lock yourself inside

64
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and say, "That's enough."

65
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
A bomb fell not far from my car --

66
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
well, far enough, but big noise.

67
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And everybody disappeared from the street.

68
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The cars disappeared as well.

69
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I ducked.

70
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And only one figure

71
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
remained in the middle of the road.

72
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It was a man in a wheelchair

73
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
desperately trying to move away.

74
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Well I'm not a particularly brave person,

75
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I have to confess it,

76
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but I could not just ignore him.

77
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So I stopped the car

78
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and I went to help.

79
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The man was without legs

80
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and only with one arm.

81
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Behind him there was a child, his son,

82
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
red in the face

83
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in an effort to push the father.

84
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So I took him into a safe place.

85
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I ask, "What are you doing out in the street

86
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
in this situation?"

87
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"I work," he said.

88
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I wondered, what work?

89
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And then I ask an even more stupid question:

90
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"Why don't you have the prostheses?

91
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Why don't you have the artificial legs?"

92
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And he said, "The Red Cross has closed."

93
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Well without thinking, I told him

94
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"Come tomorrow.

95
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We will provide you with a pair of legs."

96
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The man, his name was Mahmoud,

97
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the child, whose name was Rafi, left.

98
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say?

99
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The center is closed,

100
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
no staff around.

101
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Maybe the machinery is broken.

102
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Who is going to make the legs for him?"

103
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So I hoped that he would not come.

104
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
This is the streets of Kabul

105
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in those days.

106
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So I said, "Well I will give him some money."

107
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And so the following day,

108
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I went to the orthopedic center.

109
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I spoke with a gatekeeper.

110
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I was ready to tell him,

111
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
"Listen, if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow,

112
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
please tell him that it was a mistake.

113
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Nothing can be done.

114
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Give him some money."

115
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But Mahmoud and his son were already there.

116
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And they were not alone.

117
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
There were 15, maybe 20, people like him waiting.

118
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And there was some staff too.

119
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Among them there was my right-hand man,

120
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Najmuddin.

121
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And the gatekeeper told me,

122
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
"They come everyday to see if the center will open."

123
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I said, "No.

124
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We have to go away. We cannot stay here."

125
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
They were bombing -- not very close -- but you could hear the noise of the bombs.

126
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So, "We cannot stay here, it's dangerous.

127
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's not a priority."

128
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But Najmuddin told me, "Listen now, we're here."

129
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
At least we can start repairing the prostheses, the broken prostheses of the people

130
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and maybe try to do something

131
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
for people like Mahmoud."

132
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I said, "No, please. We cannot do that.

133
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It's really dangerous.

134
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We have other things to do."

135
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But they insisted.

136
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
When you have 20 people

137
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in front of you, looking at you

138
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and you are the one who has to decide ...

139
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So we started doing some repairs.

140
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Also one of the physical therapists

141
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
reported that Mahmoud

142
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
could be provided with a leg,

143
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but not immediately.

144
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The legs were swollen

145
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and the knees were stiff,

146
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
so he needed a long preparation.

147
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Believe me, I was worried

148
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because I was breaking the rules.

149
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I was doing something

150
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that I was not supposed to do.

151
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In the evening,

152
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters,

153
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and I told them -- I lied --

154
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I told them, "Listen, we are going to start

155
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
a couple of hours per day,

156
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
just a few repairs."

157
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Maybe some of them are here now.

158
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So we started.

160
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I was working, I was going everyday

161
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to work for the homeless.

162
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And Najmuddin was staying there,

163
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
doing everything and reporting on the patients.

164
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
He was telling me, "Patients are coming."

165
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We knew that many more patients

166
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
could not come, prevented by the fighting.

167
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But people were coming.

168
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And Mahmoud was coming every day.

169
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And slowly, slowly

170
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
week after week

171
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
his legs were improving.

172
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The stump or cast prosthesis was made,

173
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and he was starting

174
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the real physical rehabilitation.

175
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
He was coming every day,

176
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
crossing the front line.

177
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
A couple of times I crossed the front line

178
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing.

179
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I tell you, it was something so sinister

180
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that I was astonished he could do it every day.

181
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But finally, the great day arrived.

182
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Mahmoud was going to be discharged

183
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
with his new legs.

184
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It was April, I remember,

185
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a very beautiful day.

186
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
April in Kabul is beautiful,

187
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
full of roses, full of flowers.

188
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We could not possibly stay indoors,

189
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
with all these sandbags at the windows.

190
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Very sad, dark.

191
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So we chose a small spot in the garden.

192
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And Mahmoud put on his prostheses,

193
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the other patients did the same,

194
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and they started practicing

195
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
for the last time before being discharged.

196
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Suddenly, they started fighting.

197
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting.

198
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We could hear in the air

199
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the bullets passing.

200
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So we dashed, all of us,

201
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
towards the shelter.

202
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Mahmoud grabbed his son, I grabbed someone else.

203
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Everybody was grabbing something.

204
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And we ran.

205
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
You know, 50 meters can be a long distance

206
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
if you are totally exposed,

207
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but we managed to reach the shelter.

208
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Inside, all of us panting,

209
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father,

210
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"Father, you can run faster than me."

211
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

212
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And Mahmoud, "Of course I can.

213
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I can run, and now you can go to school.

214
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
No need of staying with me all the day

215
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
pushing my wheelchair."

216
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Later on, we took them home.

217
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I will never forget

218
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Mahmoud and his son walking together

219
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
pushing the empty wheelchair.

220
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And then I understood,

221
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
physical rehabilitation is a priority.

222
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Dignity cannot wait for better times.

223
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
From that day on, we never closed a single day.

224
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours,

225
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but we never, we never closed it again.

226
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I met Mahmoud one year later.

227
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
He was in good shape --

228
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
a bit thinner.

229
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
He needed to change his prostheses --

230
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
a new pair of prostheses.

231
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I asked about his son.

232
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
He told me, "He's at school. He'd doing quite well."

233
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But I understood he wanted to tell me something.

234
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So I asked him, "What is that?"

235
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
He was sweating.

236
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
He was clearly embarrassed.

237
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And he was standing in front of me,

238
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
his head down.

239
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
He said, "You have taught me to walk.

240
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Thank you very much.

241
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now help me not to be a beggar anymore."

242
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
That was the job.

243
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
"My children are growing.

244
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I feel ashamed.

245
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I don't want them to be teased at school

246
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
by the other students."

247
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I said, "Okay."

248
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I thought, how much money do I have in my pocket?

249
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Just to give him some money.

250
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It was the easiest way.

251
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
He read my mind,

252
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and he said, "I ask for a job."

253
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And then he added something

254
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I will never forget for the rest of my life.

255
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
He said, "I am a scrap of a man,

256
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but if you help me,

257
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I'm ready to do anything,

258
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
even if I have to crawl on the ground."

259
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And then he sat down.

260
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere.

261
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Legless, with only one arm,

262
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
illiterate,

263
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
unskilled --

264
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
what job for him?

265
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Najmuddin told me, "Well we have a vacancy

266
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
in the carpentry shop."

267
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
"What?" I said, "Stop."

268
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
"Well yes, we need to increase the production of feet.

269
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
We need to employ someone

270
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to glue and to screw the sole of the feet.

271
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We need to increase the production."

272
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
"Excuse me?"

273
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I could not believe.

274
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And then he said,

275
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
"No, we can modify the workbench

276
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
maybe to put a special stool,

277
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
a special anvil, special vice,

278
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and maybe an electric screwdriver."

279
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I said, "Listen, it's insane.

280
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And it's even cruel to think of anything like this.

281
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
That's a production line and a very fast one.

282
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It's cruel

283
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to offer him a job

284
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
knowing that he's going to fail."

285
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss.

286
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So the only things I could manage to obtain

287
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
was a kind of a compromise.

288
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Only one week --

289
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
one week try and not a single day more.

290
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
One week later,

291
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Mahmoud was the fastest in the production line.

292
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I told Najmuddin, "That's a trick.

293
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I can't believe it."

294
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The production was up 20 percent.

295
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
"It's a trick, it's a trick," I said.

296
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And then I asked for verification.

297
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
It was true.

298
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove.

299
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I understood

300
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that I was wrong again.

301
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Mahmoud had looked taller.

302
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling.

303
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
He was a new man,

304
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
taller again.

305
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Of course, I understood

306
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that what made him stand tall --

307
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
yeah they were the legs, thank you very much --

308
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but as a first step,

309
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
it was the dignity.

310
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
He has regained his full dignity

311
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
thanks to that job.

312
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So of course, I understood.

313
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And then we started a new policy --

314
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
a new policy completely different.

315
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We decided to employ

316
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
as many disabled as possible

317
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to train them in any possible job.

318
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It became a policy of "positive discrimination,"

319
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
we call it now.

320
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And you know what?

321
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It's good for everybody.

322
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Everybody benefits from that --

323
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
those employed, of course,

324
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
because they get a job

325
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and dignity.

326
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
But also for the newcomers.

327
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
They are 7,000 every year --

328
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
people coming for the first time.

329
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And you should see the faces of these people

330
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
when they realize that those assisting them are like them.

331
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Sometimes you see them,

332
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
they look, "Oh."

333
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And you see the faces.

334
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And then the surprise turns into hope.

335
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And it's easy for me as well to train someone

336
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
who has already passed through the experience of disability.

337
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Poof, they learn much faster -- the motivation,

338
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
the empathy they can establish with the patient

339
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
is completely different, completely.

340
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Scraps of men do not exist.

341
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
People like Mahmoud

342
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
are agents of change.

343
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And when you start changing, you cannot stop.

344
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
So employing people, yes,

345
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but also we started programming projects

346
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
of microfinance, education.

347
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And when you start, you cannot stop.

348
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So you do vocational training,

349
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
home education for those who cannot go to school.

350
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Physical therapies can be done, not only in the orthopedic center,

351
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but also in the houses of the people.

352
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
There is always a better way to do things.

353
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
That's Najmuddin, the one with the white coat.

354
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Terrible Najmuddin, is that one.

355
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I have learned a lot

356
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
from people like Najmuddin, Mahmoud, Rafi.

357
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
They are my teachers.

358
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I have a wish, a big wish,

359
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that this way of working, this way of thinking,

360
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
is going to be implemented in other countries.

361
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan.

362
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
It is possible and it is not difficult.

363
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
All we have to do

364
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
is to listen to the people

365
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
that we are supposed assist,

366
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
to make them part

367
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
of the decision-making process

368
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and then, of course, to adapt.

369
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
This is my big wish.

370
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over;

371
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
not at all. We are going on.

372
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Recently we have just started a program,

373
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
a sport program --

374
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
basketball for wheelchair users.

375
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
We transport the wheelchairs everywhere.

376
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan.

377
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
At the beginning,

378
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
when Anajulina told me,

379
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
"We would like to start it,"

380
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I hesitated.

381
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
I said, "No," you can imagine.

382
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I said, "No, no, no, no, we can't."

383
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And then I asked the usual question:

384
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
"Is it a priority?

385
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Is it really necessary?"

386
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Well now you should see me.

387
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
I never miss a single training session.

388
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
The night before a match I'm very nervous.

389
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
And you should see me during the match.

390
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
I shout like a true Italian.

391
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
(Laughter)

392
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
What's next? What is going to be the next change?

393
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Well I don't know yet,

394
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends,

395
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
they have it already in mind.

396
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
That was my story. Thank you very much.

397
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
(Applause)

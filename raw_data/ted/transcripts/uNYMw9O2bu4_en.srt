1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
so I thought I'd make my life more complex, as a serious play.

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So, I'm going to, like, go through some slides

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from way back when,

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here.

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So, basically it all began with

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
this whole idea of a computer.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Who has a computer? Yeah.

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
O.K., so, everyone has a computer.

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Even a mobile phone, it's a computer.

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And -- anyone remember this workbook,

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Instant Activities for Your Apple" --

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
free poster in each book?

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This was how computing began.

15
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Don't forget: a computer came out; it had no software.

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in,

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and it would do absolutely nothing at all.

18
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
So, you had to program it,

19
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this.

20
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I mean, this was great.

21
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It's, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.

22
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's such a great way to --

23
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I mean, they should make Java books like this,

24
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and we've have no problem learning a program.

25
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But this was a great, grand time of the computer,

26
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era.

27
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And, you see,

28
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
this era coincided with my own childhood.

29
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.

30
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Who of you grew up in a family business,

31
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
suffered the torture? Yes, yes.

32
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture?

33
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu;

34
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
it was a family business.

35
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And my mother was a kind of a designer, also.

36
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
She'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking,

37
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and it would confuse the customers,

38
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because they all thought it was a restaurant.

39
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
A bad sort of branding thing, or whatever.

40
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But, anyway, that's where I grew up,

41
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in this little tofu factory in Seattle,

42
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it was kind of like this:

43
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture.

44
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really:

45
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.

46
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Like back here, there's like, concrete block technology here,

47
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu,

48
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing,

49
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and so you have to have heavy stuff

50
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to push out the liquid and make it hard.

51
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Tofu comes out in these big batches,

52
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and my father would sort of cut them by hand.

53
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I can't tell you -- family business story: you'd understand this --

54
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
my father was the most sincere man possible.

55
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,

56
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
slipped, broke his arm, rushed out:

57
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway.

58
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken

59
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
for two weeks in the store, and that week --

60
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
now, those two weeks were when my older brother and I

61
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
had to do everything.

62
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And that was torture, real torture.

63
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Because, you see, we'd seen my father

64
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
taking the big block of tofu and cutting it,

65
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow.

66
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this.

67
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Bad blocks. But anyways,

68
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.

69
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And because working in a store was so hard,

70
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I liked going to school; it was like heaven.

71
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And I was really good at school.

72
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So, when I got to MIT, you know,

73
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as most of you who are creatives,

74
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
your parents all told you not to be creative, right?

75
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So, same way, you know,

76
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's --

77
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
John's good at math.

78
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I went to MIT, did my math,

79
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but I had this wonderful opportunity,

80
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
because computers had just become visual.

81
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The Apple -- Macintosh just came out;

82
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.

83
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And it was a time when a guy who, kind of,

84
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
could cross the two sides --

85
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it was a good time.

86
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And so, I remember that my first major piece of software

87
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
was on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker.

88
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I made a desktop publishing system way back when,

89
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to --

90
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.

91
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And the problem when you're younger --

92
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
for all you students out there --

93
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is, your head gets kind of big really easy.

94
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And when I was making icons, I was, like,

95
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the icon master,

96
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know.

97
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And then luckily, you know,

98
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I had the fortune of going to something called a library,

99
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and in the library I came upon this very book.

100
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I found this book. It's called,

101
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.

102
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this.

103
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand,

104
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
who was one of the greatest graphic designers,

105
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and also a great writer as well.

106
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And when I saw this man's work,

107
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I realized how bad I was at design,

108
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
or whatever I called it back then,

109
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and I suddenly had a kind of career goal,

110
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
kind of in hot pursuit.

111
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished.

112
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I got my masters, and then went to art school after that.

113
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
And just began to design stuff,

114
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus -- whatever I could get a handle on:

115
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
sort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever.

116
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?

117
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs?

118
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Remember that moment? It felt so good, didn't it?

119
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, I was published, you know,

120
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so, wow, my design's in a book, you know?

121
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
After that, things kind of got strange,

122
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and I got thinking about the computer,

123
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me.

124
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand

125
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
was a kind of crusty designer,

126
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you know, a crusty designer, like a good -- kind of like a good French bread?

127
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You know, he wrote in one of his books:

128
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
"A Yale student once said,

129
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.'

130
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Design schools take heed."

131
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This is in the '80s,

132
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in the great clash of computer/non-computer people.

133
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
A very difficult time, actually.

134
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And this to me was an important message from Rand.

135
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.

136
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play.

137
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing.

138
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw.

139
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It was very hard to make this, actually.

140
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It took a month to make this part.

141
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And then I thought, what if I added this feature,

142
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
where I can say, this point,

143
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.

144
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So I could, sort of, change the kind of stability

145
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
with a little control there on the dial,

146
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and I can sort of watch it flip around.

147
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And this is in 1993.

148
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me.

149
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
They were saying, Why's it moving?

150
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
They were saying, Make it stop now.

151
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.

152
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And he says, Well, when's it going to stop?

153
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And I said, Never.

154
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.

155
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I started studying this whole idea,

156
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.

157
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's not like print. It's not like video.

158
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium.

159
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, I went off with this,

160
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and began to look for things even more.

161
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people.

162
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This is actually bad: human experiments.

163
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I would do these things where I'd have students become pens:

164
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
there's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen.

165
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And someone sits down and draws a picture.

166
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They're laughing because he said,

167
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.

168
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
See, humans don't know how to take orders;

169
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the computer's so good at it.

170
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once:

171
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.

172
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And so began to have multiple pens on the page --

173
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
again, hard to do with our hands.

174
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And then someone discovered this "a-ha moment"

175
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
where you could use coordinate systems.

176
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen.

177
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.

178
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It became computerish; we began to think computerish --

179
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the X, Y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation.

180
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people,

181
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
called a human-powered computer.

182
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So, this happened in 1993.

183
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Sound down, please.

184
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's a computer where the people are the parts.

185
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU,

186
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
a graphics card, a memory system.

187
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.

188
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's put inside the computer.

189
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And that little program's on that cardboard disk.

190
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So, she wears the disk,

191
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and reads the data off the sectors of the disk,

192
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.

193
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,

194
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I had a moment of -- what is it called? --

195
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast.

196
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard,

197
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.

198
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,

199
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
if you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen.

200
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around.

201
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour

202
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
for the mouse cursor to change.

203
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
To give you a sense of the speed, the scale:

204
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?

205
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.

206
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This is something I did for Sony in 1996.

207
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It was three Sony "H" devices

208
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that responded to sound.

209
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So, if you talk into the mike,

210
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
you'll hear some music in your headphones;

211
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
if you talk in the phone, then video would happen.

212
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So, I began to experiment with industry in different ways

213
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
with this kind of mixture of skills.

214
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes.

215
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects.

216
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And also, one thing I realized is that

217
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I like to make things.

218
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We like to make things. It's fun to make things.

219
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And so I never developed the ability to have a staff.

220
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand --

221
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
these sort of broken hands.

222
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And these hands were influenced

223
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
by this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.

224
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This guy was my kind of like mentor.

225
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.

226
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
He's the guy that kind of discovered me,

227
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and kind of got me going in digital media.

228
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
He was such an inspirational guy.

229
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m.,

230
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and then he'd show up from some client meeting.

231
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
He'd come in and say, you know,

232
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
If I am here, everything is okay.

233
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And you'd feel so much better, you know.

234
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I'll never forget how, like, but -- I'll never forget how, like,

235
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an aneurysm.

236
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
He went into a coma.

237
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink,

238
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow --

239
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
how fragile is this thing we're wearing,

240
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
this body and mind we're wearing,

241
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and so I thought, How do you go for it more?

242
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
How do you take that time you have left and go after it?

243
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So, Naomi was pivotal in that.

244
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.

245
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This was a moment where I was thinking about,

246
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
so, you have a computer program,

247
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it responds to motion -- X and Y --

248
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and I realized that each computer program

249
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
has all these images inside the program.

250
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So, if you can see here, you know,

251
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that program you're seeing in the corner,

252
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
if you spread it out, it's all these things all at once.

253
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with.

254
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We're so used to working in one vector.

255
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
This is all at the same time.

256
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The computer lives in so many dimensions.

257
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And also, at the same time I was frustrated,

258
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere,

259
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know,

260
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and this is, like, in the late 1990s,

261
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and this is in Basel,

262
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
a great graphic design school.

263
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And here's this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy,

264
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
kind of, dark computer room.

265
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And I began to wonder, Is this the goal?

266
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Is this what we want, you know?

267
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And also, I began to be fascinated by machines --

268
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel.

269
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive --

270
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
this is, like, a touch screen --

271
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and I noticed how you can only touch five places,

272
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and so, "why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?"

273
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
became a question. And also, the sound:

274
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone.

275
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
You get it? No? O.K.

276
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And also, I discovered in Logan airport,

277
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
this was, like, calling out to me.

278
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Do you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan.

279
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So, I was wondering, like,

280
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?

281
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It didn't make any sense.

282
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects

283
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
made of old computers from my basement.

284
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I made -- I took my old Macintoshes

285
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and made different objects out of them from Tokyo.

286
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves,

287
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots.

288
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I made this series of works.

289
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle

290
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
as a kind of display that's sort of thinking,

291
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract.

292
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction.

293
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I began to be fascinated by plastic,

294
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks

295
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
perfectly optically transparent,

296
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
as a kind of release of stress.

297
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Because of that, I became interested in blue tape,

298
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
so in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.

299
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I made a whole installation out of blue tape -- blue painters' tape.

300
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me,

301
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think,

302
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Well, what else is there in life?

303
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And so computers, as you know,

304
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
these big computers, there are now tiny computers.

305
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
They're littler computers, so the one-chip computers,

306
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I began to program one-chip computers

307
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.

308
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I began to make LED sculptures

309
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that would live inside little boxes out of MDF.

310
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy.

311
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.

312
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp:

313
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
it's sort of a plastic rice lamp;

314
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
it's very friendly.

315
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
I did a show in London last year made out of iPods --

316
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I used iPods as a material.

317
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So I took 16 iPod Nanos

318
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and made a kind of a Nano fish, basically.

319
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Recently, this is for Reebok.

320
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I've done shoes for Reebok as well,

321
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
as a kind of a hobby for apparel.

322
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So anyways, there are all these things you can do,

323
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but the thing I love the most is to

324
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
experience, taste the world.

325
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The world is just so tasty.

326
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are.

327
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
No, they're all out there.

328
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,

329
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
actually, around the Louvre area.

330
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This I found, where nature had made a picture for me.

331
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature.

332
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
In this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.

333
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We all are creative people.

334
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We have this gene defect in our mind.

335
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing.

336
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It's the forever-always-on museum.

337
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This is from the Cape last year.

338
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design,

339
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
which we know as circle-triangle-square.

340
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's everywhere on the beach, I discovered.

341
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
I began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square.

342
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I put these all back, by the way.

343
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And I also discovered how .

344
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
some rocks are twins separated at birth.

345
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
This is also out there, you know.

346
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing?

347
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I brought you guys together again.

348
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T

349
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
occurring in simplicity and complexity.

350
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
My alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment --

351
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment --

352
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
where I thought, Whoa! I have to do this.

353
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And I went after it with passion.

354
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose --

355
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
going to RISD -- and I couldn't reconcile this real easy,

356
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
because the letters had told me, MIT forever.

357
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
But I discovered in the French word raison d'être.

358
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I was, like, aha, wait a second.

359
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And there RISD appeared.

360
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And so I realized it was O.K. to go.

361
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So, I'm going to RISD, actually.

362
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Who's a RISD alum out there?

363
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
RISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD.

364
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center -- Art Center is good, too.

365
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
RISD is kind of my new kind of passion,

366
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and I'll tell you a little bit about that.

367
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So, RISD is --

368
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I was outside RISD,

369
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and some student wrote this on some block, and I thought,

370
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Wow, RISD wants to know what itself is.

371
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And I have no idea what RISD should be, actually,

372
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
or what it wants to be, but one thing I have to tell you is that

373
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
although I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much.

374
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
It's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever.

375
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
People say,

376
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Are you going to bring RISD into the future?

377
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD.

378
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
There's my perspective. Because in reality,

379
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
the problem isn't how to make the world more technological.

380
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
It's about how to make it more humane again.

381
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA.

382
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
It's a strange exuberance

383
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
about materials, about the world:

384
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
a fascination that I think the world needs

385
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
quite very much right now.

386
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
So, thank you everyone.

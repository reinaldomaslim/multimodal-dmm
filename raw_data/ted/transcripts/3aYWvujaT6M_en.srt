1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I published this article

2
0:00:14.44,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.

3
0:00:18.84,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."

4
0:00:21.2,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the article is about a psychological study

5
0:00:23.52,000 --> 0:00:26,000
designed to create romantic love in the laboratory,

6
0:00:26.96,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and my own experience trying the study myself

7
0:00:29.72,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one night last summer.

8
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So the procedure is fairly simple:

9
0:00:34.36,000 --> 0:00:4,000
two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions

10
0:00:41.24,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and then they stare into each other's eyes

11
0:00:44.159,000 --> 0:00:46,000
without speaking for four minutes.

12
0:00:47.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So here are a couple of sample questions.

13
0:00:50.76,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability,

14
0:00:56.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
what would it be?

15
0:00:58.24,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Number 28: When did you last cry in front of another person?

16
0:01:02.96,000 --> 0:01:03,000
By yourself?

17
0:01:04.2,000 --> 0:01:08,000
As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.

18
0:01:08.48,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Number 30, I really like this one:

19
0:01:10.88,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Tell your partner what you like about them;

20
0:01:13.76,000 --> 0:01:14,000
be very honest this time,

21
0:01:15.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
saying things you might not say to someone you just met.

22
0:01:20.84,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So when I first came across this study a few years earlier,

23
0:01:25.4,000 --> 0:01:27,000
one detail really stuck out to me,

24
0:01:27.52,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and that was the rumor that two of the participants

25
0:01:30.6,000 --> 0:01:32,000
had gotten married six months later,

26
0:01:33.12,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony.

27
0:01:37.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I was of course very skeptical

28
0:01:40.2,000 --> 0:01:43,000
about this process of just manufacturing romantic love,

29
0:01:43.88,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but of course I was intrigued.

30
0:01:46.76,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And when I got the chance to try this study myself,

31
0:01:50.2,000 --> 0:01:53,000
with someone I knew but not particularly well,

32
0:01:53.36,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I wasn't expecting to fall in love.

33
0:01:56.52,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But then we did, and --

34
0:01:59.24,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column

36
0:02:05.56,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a few months later.

37
0:02:07.4,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, this was published in January,

38
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and now it is August,

39
0:02:13.6,000 --> 0:02:16,000
so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering,

40
0:02:17.24,000 --> 0:02:19,000
are we still together?

41
0:02:19.64,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And the reason I think you might be wondering this

42
0:02:22.039,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is because I have been asked this question

43
0:02:24.72,000 --> 0:02:27,000
again and again and again for the past seven months.

44
0:02:28.68,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And this question is really what I want to talk about today.

45
0:02:32.4,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But let's come back to it.

46
0:02:33.88,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:36.88,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So the week before the article came out,

48
0:02:38.88,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was very nervous.

49
0:02:41.6,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I had been working on a book about love stories

50
0:02:44.2,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for the past few years,

51
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:48,000
so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences

52
0:02:48.88,000 --> 0:02:51,000
with romantic love on my blog.

53
0:02:51.92,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most,

54
0:02:56.52,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and those were usually just my Facebook friends,

55
0:02:59.64,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I figured my article in the New York Times

56
0:03:02.24,000 --> 0:03:04,000
would probably get a few thousand views.

57
0:03:06.08,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that felt like a lot of attention

58
0:03:08.88,000 --> 0:03:11,000
on a relatively new relationship.

59
0:03:12.08,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But as it turned out, I had no idea.

60
0:03:16.24,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So the article was published online

61
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
on a Friday evening,

62
0:03:20.24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog.

63
0:03:26.4,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called.

64
0:03:32.72,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views,

65
0:03:37.28,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I was, to say the least,

66
0:03:39.6,000 --> 0:03:42,000
underprepared for this sort of attention.

67
0:03:43.52,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly

68
0:03:46.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
about your experiences with love,

69
0:03:48.64,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but it is another thing to discover

70
0:03:51.12,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that your love life has made international news --

71
0:03:54.12,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:55.36,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and to realize that people across the world

73
0:03:59.2,000 --> 0:04:03,000
are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship.

74
0:04:04.2,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:06.4,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks,

76
0:04:11.24,000 --> 0:04:14,000
they always asked the same question first:

77
0:04:14.6,000 --> 0:04:16,000
are you guys still together?

78
0:04:17.28,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In fact, as I was preparing this talk,

79
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I did a quick search of my email inbox

80
0:04:21.92,000 --> 0:04:22,000
for the phrase "Are you still together?"

81
0:04:23.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and several messages popped up immediately.

82
0:04:26.6,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They were from students and journalists

83
0:04:29.279,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and friendly strangers like this one.

84
0:04:32.32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I did radio interviews and they asked.

85
0:04:34.8,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage,

86
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:41,000
"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"

87
0:04:42.12,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I promptly turned bright red.

88
0:04:45.44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I understand that this is part of the deal.

89
0:04:48.28,000 --> 0:04:51,000
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper,

90
0:04:51.84,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.

91
0:04:55.52,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.

92
0:05:00.48,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.

93
0:05:04.36,000 --> 0:05:07,000
In fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article

94
0:05:07.8,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for Valentine's Day,

95
0:05:09.04,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves,

96
0:05:13.56,000 --> 0:05:15,000
with varying degrees of success.

97
0:05:16.96,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention

98
0:05:21.2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
was to become very protective of my own relationship.

99
0:05:25.92,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I said no to every request for the two of us

100
0:05:28.96,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to do a media appearance together.

101
0:05:31.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I turned down TV interviews,

102
0:05:33.04,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and I said no to every request for photos of the two us.

103
0:05:37.2,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I think I was afraid that we would become

104
0:05:39.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love,

105
0:05:43.96,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a position I did not at all feel qualified for.

106
0:05:48.76,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And I get it:

107
0:05:51.24,000 --> 0:05:53,000
people didn't just want to know if the study worked,

108
0:05:54.04,000 --> 0:05:56,000
they wanted to know if it really worked:

109
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last,

110
0:06:01.72,000 --> 0:06:06,000
not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.

111
0:06:07.12,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering.

112
0:06:11.24,000 --> 0:06:13,000
My own relationship was only a few months old,

113
0:06:13.96,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.

114
0:06:20.04,000 --> 0:06:24,000
What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?

115
0:06:24.2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
If the answer was no,

116
0:06:25.88,000 --> 0:06:28,000
would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions

117
0:06:29.88,000 --> 0:06:31,000
any less worthwhile?

118
0:06:32.8,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions

119
0:06:35.6,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in this study here in 1997,

120
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love.

121
0:06:44.76,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Instead, they wanted to foster

122
0:06:46.72,000 --> 0:06:49,000
interpersonal closeness among college students,

123
0:06:50.2,000 --> 0:06:52,000
by using what Aron called

124
0:06:52.96,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure."

125
0:06:57.88,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Sounds romantic, doesn't it?

126
0:07:01.6,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But the study did work.

127
0:07:03.28,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The participants did feel closer after doing it,

128
0:07:06.36,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol

129
0:07:11.68,000 --> 0:07:15,000
as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers.

130
0:07:15.84,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They've used it between members of the police and members of community,

131
0:07:19.293,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies.

132
0:07:23.8,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The original version of the story,

133
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the one that I tried last summer,

134
0:07:28.12,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact,

135
0:07:32.36,000 --> 0:07:34,000
was referenced in this article,

136
0:07:34.48,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but unfortunately it was never published.

137
0:07:38.64,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So a few months ago, I was giving a talk

138
0:07:41.68,000 --> 0:07:43,000
at a small liberal arts college,

139
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and a student came up to me afterwards

140
0:07:46.72,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and he said, kind of shyly,

141
0:07:49.36,000 --> 0:07:54,000
"So, I tried your study, and it didn't work."

142
0:07:54.4,000 --> 0:07:57,000
He seemed a little mystified by this.

143
0:07:57.68,000 --> 0:08:01,000
"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?" I asked.

144
0:08:02.48,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"Well..." He paused.

145
0:08:04.92,000 --> 0:08:06,000
"I think she just wants to be friends."

146
0:08:09.48,000 --> 0:08:12,000
"But did you become better friends?" I asked.

147
0:08:13.24,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?"

148
0:08:16.92,000 --> 0:08:17,000
He nodded.

149
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"So, then it worked," I said.

150
0:08:21.2,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I don't think this is the answer he was looking for.

151
0:08:25.44,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for

152
0:08:29.8,000 --> 0:08:31,000
when it comes to love.

153
0:08:32.08,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I first came across this study

154
0:08:33.84,000 --> 0:08:34,000
when I was 29

155
0:08:35.32,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I was going through a really difficult breakup.

156
0:08:38.76,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I had been in the relationship since I was 20,

157
0:08:41.4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
which was basically my entire adult life,

158
0:08:44.2,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and he was my first real love,

159
0:08:46.32,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.

160
0:08:51.44,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So I turned to science.

161
0:08:53.84,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love,

162
0:08:58.44,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache.

163
0:09:03.56,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I don't know if I realized this at the time --

164
0:09:07.12,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing --

165
0:09:10.44,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but it seems really obvious in retrospect.

166
0:09:13.88,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love,

167
0:09:18.32,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.

168
0:09:24.32,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.

169
0:09:28.64,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I am more patient with love. I am more relaxed.

170
0:09:31.96,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I am more confident about asking for what I want.

171
0:09:35.56,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But I can also see myself more clearly,

172
0:09:39.32,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and I can see that what I want is sometimes more

173
0:09:43.6,000 --> 0:09:46,000
than can reasonably be asked for.

174
0:09:46.68,000 --> 0:09:49,000
What I want from love is a guarantee,

175
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
not just that I am loved today

176
0:09:52.4,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and that I will be loved tomorrow,

177
0:09:54.84,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.

178
0:10:01.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee

179
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that people were really asking about

180
0:10:06.76,000 --> 0:10:08,000
when they wanted to know if we were still together.

181
0:10:10.8,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So the story that the media told about the 36 questions

182
0:10:14.76,000 --> 0:10:17,000
was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love.

183
0:10:18.08,000 --> 0:10:21,000
There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved,

184
0:10:21.84,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and this is a very appealing story,

185
0:10:24.48,000 --> 0:10:27,000
because falling in love feels amazing,

186
0:10:27.68,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but it's also terrifying.

187
0:10:30.44,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The moment you admit to loving someone,

188
0:10:33.04,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you admit to having a lot to lose,

189
0:10:36.64,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism

190
0:10:40.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
for getting to know someone quickly,

191
0:10:43.2,000 --> 0:10:45,000
which is also a mechanism for being known,

192
0:10:45.76,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love:

193
0:10:50.24,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to be known, to be seen, to be understood.

194
0:10:55.2,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But I think when it comes to love,

195
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.

196
0:11:01.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?"

197
0:11:05.28,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and is content with a yes or no answer.

198
0:11:09.56,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So rather than that question,

199
0:11:11.52,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I would propose we ask some more difficult questions,

200
0:11:15.2,000 --> 0:11:16,000
questions like:

201
0:11:17.08,000 --> 0:11:2,000
How do you decide who deserves your love

202
0:11:20.12,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and who does not?

203
0:11:22.84,000 --> 0:11:25,000
How do you stay in love when things get difficult,

204
0:11:26.12,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and how do you know when to just cut and run?

205
0:11:29.88,000 --> 0:11:3,000
How do you live with the doubt

206
0:11:31.8,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that inevitably creeps into every relationship,

207
0:11:34.84,000 --> 0:11:35,000
or even harder,

208
0:11:36.48,000 --> 0:11:38,000
how do you live with your partner's doubt?

209
0:11:39.8,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions,

210
0:11:43.44,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation

211
0:11:48.6,000 --> 0:11:5,000
about what it means to love someone.

212
0:11:52.08,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So, if you want it,

213
0:11:54.44,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the short version of the story of my relationship is this:

214
0:11:58.76,000 --> 0:12:01,000
a year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study

215
0:12:01.88,000 --> 0:12:03,000
designed to create romantic love,

216
0:12:04.6,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and we fell in love,

217
0:12:06.32,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and we are still together,

218
0:12:08.2,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and I am so glad.

219
0:12:11.04,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.

220
0:12:16.44,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Falling in love is the easy part.

221
0:12:20.36,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So at the end of my article, I wrote, "Love didn't happen to us.

222
0:12:24.76,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We're in love because we each made the choice to be."

223
0:12:28.08,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And I cringe a little when I read that now,

224
0:12:32.28,000 --> 0:12:34,000
not because it isn't true,

225
0:12:34.6,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but because at the time, I really hadn't considered

226
0:12:37.84,000 --> 0:12:4,000
everything that was contained in that choice.

227
0:12:41.48,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice,

228
0:12:46.72,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice

229
0:12:50.32,000 --> 0:12:53,000
without knowing whether or not he will always choose me.

230
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions,

231
0:12:59.68,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun

232
0:13:04.92,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America.

233
0:13:10.88,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But what I have done instead is turn my relationship

234
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:18,000
into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in.

235
0:13:18.2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting,

236
0:13:22.48,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is for that myth to be true.

237
0:13:25.2,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article,

238
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:31,000
which is, incidentally,

239
0:13:31.52,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.

240
0:13:35.2,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Laughter)

241
0:13:38.52,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone,

242
0:13:43.24,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and the hope that he will choose to love me back,

243
0:13:46.72,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and it is terrifying,

244
0:13:49.44,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but that's the deal with love.

245
0:13:51.2,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Thank you.

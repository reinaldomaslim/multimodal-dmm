1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So in the oasis of intelligentsia that is TED,

2
0:00:18.567,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I stand here before you this evening

3
0:00:21.285,000 --> 0:00:26,000
as an expert in dragging heavy stuff around cold places.

4
0:00:27.159,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I've been leading polar expeditions for most of my adult life,

5
0:00:30.145,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and last month, my teammate Tarka L'Herpiniere and I

6
0:00:33.847,000 --> 0:00:38,000
finished the most ambitious expedition I've ever attempted.

7
0:00:39.025,000 --> 0:00:41,000
In fact, it feels like I've been transported straight here

8
0:00:42.014,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from four months in the middle of nowhere,

9
0:00:44.666,000 --> 0:00:49,000
mostly grunting and swearing, straight to the TED stage.

10
0:00:49.754,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So you can imagine that's a transition that hasn't been entirely seamless.

11
0:00:53.935,000 --> 0:00:54,000
One of the interesting side effects

12
0:00:55.815,000 --> 0:00:57,000
seems to be that my short-term memory is entirely shot.

13
0:00:58.403,000 --> 0:01:,000
So I've had to write some notes

14
0:01:00.665,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to avoid too much grunting and swearing in the next 17 minutes.

15
0:01:05.363,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This is the first talk I've given about this expedition,

16
0:01:08.211,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and while we weren't sequencing genomes or building space telescopes,

17
0:01:13.69,000 --> 0:01:17,000
this is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something

18
0:01:18.474,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that hadn't been done before.

19
0:01:20.31,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So I hope in that you might find some food for thought.

20
0:01:24.455,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It was a journey, an expedition in Antarctica,

21
0:01:28.066,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the coldest, windiest, driest and highest altitude continent on Earth.

22
0:01:32.757,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's a fascinating place. It's a huge place.

23
0:01:34.804,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's twice the size of Australia,

24
0:01:37.119,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a continent that is the same size as China and India put together.

25
0:01:42.22,000 --> 0:01:43,000
As an aside, I have experienced

26
0:01:44.088,000 --> 0:01:46,000
an interesting phenomenon in the last few days,

27
0:01:46.312,000 --> 0:01:49,000
something that I expect Chris Hadfield may get at TED in a few years' time,

28
0:01:50.089,000 --> 0:01:52,000
conversations that go something like this:

29
0:01:52.144,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"Oh, Antarctica. Awesome.

30
0:01:53.767,000 --> 0:01:58,000
My husband and I did Antarctica with Lindblad for our anniversary."

31
0:01:59.604,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Or, "Oh cool, did you go there for the marathon?"

32
0:02:02.951,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:06.445,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Our journey was, in fact, 69 marathons back to back

34
0:02:10.485,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in 105 days, an 1,800-mile round trip on foot from the coast of Antarctica

35
0:02:16.476,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to the South Pole and back again.

36
0:02:19.247,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In the process, we broke the record

37
0:02:21.491,000 --> 0:02:26,000
for the longest human-powered polar journey in history by more than 400 miles.

38
0:02:27.087,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Applause)

39
0:02:31.498,000 --> 0:02:33,000
For those of you from the Bay Area,

40
0:02:33.913,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it was the same as walking from here to San Francisco,

41
0:02:38.03,000 --> 0:02:4,000
then turning around and walking back again.

42
0:02:40.908,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So as camping trips go, it was a long one,

43
0:02:45.827,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and one I've seen summarized most succinctly here

44
0:02:48.994,000 --> 0:02:51,000
on the hallowed pages of Business Insider Malaysia.

45
0:02:52.72,000 --> 0:02:57,000
["Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition That Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted"]

46
0:02:58.247,000 --> 0:03:,000
Chris Hadfield talked so eloquently

47
0:03:00.917,000 --> 0:03:05,000
about fear and about the odds of success, and indeed the odds of survival.

48
0:03:06.139,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Of the nine people in history that had attempted this journey before us,

49
0:03:10.019,000 --> 0:03:12,000
none had made it to the pole and back,

50
0:03:12.712,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and five had died in the process.

51
0:03:16.59,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This is Captain Robert Falcon Scott.

52
0:03:19.237,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He led the last team to attempt this expedition.

53
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Scott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton,

54
0:03:24.438,000 --> 0:03:26,000
over the space of a decade,

55
0:03:27.154,000 --> 0:03:31,000
both led expeditions battling to become the first to reach the South Pole,

56
0:03:31.427,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to chart and map the interior of Antarctica,

57
0:03:34.446,000 --> 0:03:36,000
a place we knew less about, at the time,

58
0:03:36.581,000 --> 0:03:37,000
than the surface of the moon,

59
0:03:38.485,000 --> 0:03:4,000
because we could see the moon through telescopes.

60
0:03:40.83,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Antarctica was, for the most part, a century ago, uncharted.

61
0:03:44.964,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Some of you may know the story.

62
0:03:46.475,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Scott's last expedition, the Terra Nova Expedition in 1910,

63
0:03:49.288,000 --> 0:03:51,000
started as a giant siege-style approach.

64
0:03:51.802,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He had a big team using ponies,

65
0:03:54.031,000 --> 0:03:56,000
using dogs, using petrol-driven tractors,

66
0:03:56.778,000 --> 0:03:59,000
dropping multiple, pre-positioned depots of food and fuel

67
0:04:00.175,000 --> 0:04:03,000
through which Scott's final team of five would travel to the Pole,

68
0:04:03.883,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where they would turn around and ski back to the coast again on foot.

69
0:04:07.187,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Scott and his final team of five

70
0:04:09.599,000 --> 0:04:12,000
arrived at the South Pole in January 1912

71
0:04:13.284,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to find they had been beaten to it by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen,

72
0:04:18.274,000 --> 0:04:19,000
who rode on dogsled.

73
0:04:19.908,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Scott's team ended up on foot.

74
0:04:21.997,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And for more than a century this journey has remained unfinished.

75
0:04:26.595,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Scott's team of five died on the return journey.

76
0:04:29.52,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And for the last decade,

77
0:04:31.633,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I've been asking myself why that is.

78
0:04:34.954,000 --> 0:04:37,000
How come this has remained the high-water mark?

79
0:04:38.246,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Scott's team covered 1,600 miles on foot.

80
0:04:40.596,000 --> 0:04:41,000
No one's come close to that ever since.

81
0:04:42.497,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So this is the high-water mark of human endurance,

82
0:04:45.318,000 --> 0:04:47,000
human endeavor, human athletic achievement

83
0:04:47.839,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in arguably the harshest climate on Earth.

84
0:04:50.51,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It was as if the marathon record

85
0:04:53.018,000 --> 0:04:56,000
has remained unbroken since 1912.

86
0:04:56.037,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And of course some strange and predictable combination of curiosity,

87
0:05:01.145,000 --> 0:05:02,000
stubbornness, and probably hubris

88
0:05:03.095,000 --> 0:05:07,000
led me to thinking I might be the man to try to finish the job.

89
0:05:07.182,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Unlike Scott's expedition, there were just two of us,

90
0:05:10.873,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and we set off from the coast of Antarctica in October last year,

91
0:05:13.996,000 --> 0:05:15,000
dragging everything ourselves,

92
0:05:16.214,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a process Scott called "man-hauling."

93
0:05:18.814,000 --> 0:05:21,000
When I say it was like walking from here to San Francisco and back,

94
0:05:21.837,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I actually mean it was like dragging something that weighs a shade more

95
0:05:25.214,000 --> 0:05:27,000
than the heaviest ever NFL player.

96
0:05:27.638,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Our sledges weighed 200 kilos,

97
0:05:29.681,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or 440 pounds each at the start,

98
0:05:32.746,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the same weights that the weakest of Scott's ponies pulled.

99
0:05:37.02,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Early on, we averaged 0.5 miles per hour.

100
0:05:40.2,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Perhaps the reason no one had attempted this journey until now,

101
0:05:43.887,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in more than a century,

102
0:05:45.145,000 --> 0:05:5,000
was that no one had been quite stupid enough to try.

103
0:05:50.418,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And while I can't claim we were exploring

104
0:05:52.437,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in the genuine Edwardian sense of the word —

105
0:05:55.454,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we weren't naming any mountains or mapping any uncharted valleys —

106
0:05:59.192,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I think we were stepping into uncharted territory in a human sense.

107
0:06:03.573,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Certainly, if in the future we learn there is an area of the human brain

108
0:06:06.962,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that lights up when one curses oneself,

109
0:06:10.779,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I won't be at all surprised.

110
0:06:13.945,000 --> 0:06:17,000
You've heard that the average American spends 90 percent of their time indoors.

111
0:06:17.997,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We didn't go indoors for nearly four months.

112
0:06:21.253,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We didn't see a sunset either.

113
0:06:23.495,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It was 24-hour daylight.

114
0:06:25.151,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Living conditions were quite spartan.

115
0:06:27.306,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I changed my underwear three times in 105 days

116
0:06:32.148,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and Tarka and I shared 30 square feet on the canvas.

117
0:06:36.072,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Though we did have some technology that Scott could never have imagined.

118
0:06:40.813,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And we blogged live every evening from the tent via a laptop

119
0:06:44.18,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and a custom-made satellite transmitter,

120
0:06:46.225,000 --> 0:06:47,000
all of which were solar-powered:

121
0:06:48.085,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we had a flexible photovoltaic panel over the tent.

122
0:06:50.482,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And the writing was important to me.

123
0:06:53.94,000 --> 0:06:59,000
As a kid, I was inspired by the literature of adventure and exploration,

124
0:07:00.493,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and I think we've all seen here this week

125
0:07:03.021,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the importance and the power of storytelling.

126
0:07:07.265,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So we had some 21st-century gear,

127
0:07:09.081,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but the reality is that the challenges that Scott faced

128
0:07:11.868,000 --> 0:07:12,000
were the same that we faced:

129
0:07:13.865,000 --> 0:07:16,000
those of the weather and of what Scott called glide,

130
0:07:17.603,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the amount of friction between the sledges and the snow.

131
0:07:20.951,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The lowest wind chill we experienced was in the -70s,

132
0:07:24.801,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and we had zero visibility, what's called white-out,

133
0:07:27.378,000 --> 0:07:3,000
for much of our journey.

134
0:07:30.391,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We traveled up and down one of the largest

135
0:07:32.742,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and most dangerous glaciers in the world, the Beardmore glacier.

136
0:07:35.955,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's 110 miles long; most of its surface is what's called blue ice.

137
0:07:39.381,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You can see it's a beautiful, shimmering steel-hard blue surface

138
0:07:42.979,000 --> 0:07:45,000
covered with thousands and thousands of crevasses,

139
0:07:46.817,000 --> 0:07:49,000
these deep cracks in the glacial ice up to 200 feet deep.

140
0:07:50.798,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Planes can't land here,

141
0:07:52.315,000 --> 0:07:55,000
so we were at the most risk,

142
0:07:55.775,000 --> 0:07:59,000
technically, when we had the slimmest chance of being rescued.

143
0:08:00.219,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We got to the South Pole after 61 days on foot,

144
0:08:04.115,000 --> 0:08:06,000
with one day off for bad weather,

145
0:08:06.694,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and I'm sad to say, it was something of an anticlimax.

146
0:08:09.261,000 --> 0:08:11,000
There's a permanent American base,

147
0:08:11.726,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station at the South Pole.

148
0:08:15.044,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They have an airstrip, they have a canteen,

149
0:08:16.995,000 --> 0:08:17,000
they have hot showers,

150
0:08:18.448,000 --> 0:08:19,000
they have a post office, a tourist shop,

151
0:08:20.353,000 --> 0:08:23,000
a basketball court that doubles as a movie theater.

152
0:08:24.091,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So it's a bit different these days,

153
0:08:26.066,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and there are also acres of junk.

154
0:08:27.862,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I think it's a marvelous thing

155
0:08:29.292,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that humans can exist 365 days of the year

156
0:08:34.586,000 --> 0:08:37,000
with hamburgers and hot showers and movie theaters,

157
0:08:38.131,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but it does seem to produce a lot of empty cardboard boxes.

158
0:08:40.887,000 --> 0:08:42,000
You can see on the left of this photograph,

159
0:08:42.949,000 --> 0:08:43,000
several square acres of junk

160
0:08:44.384,000 --> 0:08:46,000
waiting to be flown out from the South Pole.

161
0:08:46.897,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But there is also a pole at the South Pole,

162
0:08:50.929,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and we got there on foot, unassisted,

163
0:08:54.325,000 --> 0:08:55,000
unsupported, by the hardest route,

164
0:08:55.971,000 --> 0:08:57,000
900 miles in record time,

165
0:08:58.316,000 --> 0:09:,000
dragging more weight than anyone in history.

166
0:09:00.364,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And if we'd stopped there and flown home,

167
0:09:02.333,000 --> 0:09:05,000
which would have been the eminently sensible thing to do,

168
0:09:05.467,000 --> 0:09:06,000
then my talk would end here

169
0:09:07.348,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and it would end something like this.

170
0:09:10.938,000 --> 0:09:14,000
If you have the right team around you, the right tools, the right technology,

171
0:09:15.743,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and if you have enough self-belief and enough determination,

172
0:09:19.481,000 --> 0:09:22,000
then anything is possible.

173
0:09:24.656,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But then we turned around,

174
0:09:27.289,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and this is where things get interesting.

175
0:09:30.048,000 --> 0:09:32,000
High on the Antarctic plateau,

176
0:09:32.842,000 --> 0:09:35,000
over 10,000 feet, it's very windy, very cold, very dry, we were exhausted.

177
0:09:36.841,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We'd covered 35 marathons,

178
0:09:38.711,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we were only halfway,

179
0:09:40.297,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and we had a safety net, of course,

180
0:09:42.328,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of ski planes and satellite phones

181
0:09:44.452,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and live, 24-hour tracking beacons that didn't exist for Scott,

182
0:09:48.515,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but in hindsight,

183
0:09:50.257,000 --> 0:09:52,000
rather than making our lives easier,

184
0:09:52.323,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the safety net actually allowed us

185
0:09:54.482,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to cut things very fine indeed,

186
0:09:58.337,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to sail very close to our absolute limits as human beings.

187
0:10:02.104,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And it is an exquisite form of torture

188
0:10:05.577,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to exhaust yourself to the point of starvation day after day

189
0:10:08.414,000 --> 0:10:12,000
while dragging a sledge full of food.

190
0:10:12.686,000 --> 0:10:15,000
For years, I'd been writing glib lines in sponsorship proposals

191
0:10:16.613,000 --> 0:10:19,000
about pushing the limits of human endurance,

192
0:10:19.724,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but in reality, that was a very frightening place to be indeed.

193
0:10:24.136,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We had, before we'd got to the Pole,

194
0:10:26.045,000 --> 0:10:29,000
two weeks of almost permanent headwind, which slowed us down.

195
0:10:29.509,000 --> 0:10:31,000
As a result, we'd had several days of eating half rations.

196
0:10:32.159,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We had a finite amount of food in the sledges to make this journey,

197
0:10:34.878,000 --> 0:10:36,000
so we were trying to string that out

198
0:10:36.88,000 --> 0:10:39,000
by reducing our intake to half the calories we should have been eating.

199
0:10:40.793,000 --> 0:10:43,000
As a result, we both became increasingly hypoglycemic —

200
0:10:44.412,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we had low blood sugar levels day after day —

201
0:10:47.236,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and increasingly susceptible to the extreme cold.

202
0:10:51.994,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Tarka took this photo of me one evening

203
0:10:54.097,000 --> 0:10:56,000
after I'd nearly passed out with hypothermia.

204
0:10:56.227,000 --> 0:11:,000
We both had repeated bouts of hypothermia, something I hadn't experienced before,

205
0:11:01.035,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and it was very humbling indeed.

206
0:11:02.746,000 --> 0:11:05,000
As much as you might like to think, as I do,

207
0:11:06.414,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that you're the kind of person who doesn't quit,

208
0:11:08.67,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that you'll go down swinging,

209
0:11:10.664,000 --> 0:11:12,000
hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice.

210
0:11:12.916,000 --> 0:11:14,000
You become utterly incapacitated.

211
0:11:15.726,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's like being a drunk toddler.

212
0:11:18.907,000 --> 0:11:19,000
You become pathetic.

213
0:11:20.88,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I remember just wanting to lie down and quit.

214
0:11:24.999,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It was a peculiar, peculiar feeling,

215
0:11:27.173,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and a real surprise to me to be debilitated to that degree.

216
0:11:32.412,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And then we ran out of food completely,

217
0:11:36.894,000 --> 0:11:39,000
46 miles short of the first of the depots

218
0:11:40.352,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that we'd laid on our outward journey.

219
0:11:42.217,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We'd laid 10 depots of food,

220
0:11:43.56,000 --> 0:11:45,000
literally burying food and fuel, for our return journey —

221
0:11:46.277,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the fuel was for a cooker so you could melt snow to get water —

222
0:11:49.554,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and I was forced to make the decision to call for a resupply flight,

223
0:11:55.361,000 --> 0:11:59,000
a ski plane carrying eight days of food to tide us over that gap.

224
0:11:59.93,000 --> 0:12:02,000
They took 12 hours to reach us from the other side of Antarctica.

225
0:12:03.289,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Calling for that plane was one of the toughest decisions of my life.

226
0:12:06.998,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And I sound like a bit of a fraud standing here now with a sort of belly.

227
0:12:10.474,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I've put on 30 pounds in the last three weeks.

228
0:12:13.314,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar,

229
0:12:16.389,000 --> 0:12:2,000
which is that I've been hoovering up every hotel buffet that I can find.

230
0:12:20.996,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Laughter)

231
0:12:22.774,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But we were genuinely quite hungry, and in quite a bad way.

232
0:12:28.468,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I don't regret calling for that plane for a second,

233
0:12:30.909,000 --> 0:12:32,000
because I'm still standing here alive,

234
0:12:32.911,000 --> 0:12:34,000
with all digits intact, telling this story.

235
0:12:34.971,000 --> 0:12:38,000
But getting external assistance like that was never part of the plan,

236
0:12:39.709,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and it's something my ego is still struggling with.

237
0:12:42.913,000 --> 0:12:45,000
This was the biggest dream I've ever had,

238
0:12:45.955,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and it was so nearly perfect.

239
0:12:48.967,000 --> 0:12:49,000
On the way back down to the coast,

240
0:12:50.648,000 --> 0:12:52,000
our crampons — they're the spikes on our boots

241
0:12:52.839,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier —

242
0:12:55.765,000 --> 0:12:56,000
broke on the top of the Beardmore.

243
0:12:57.42,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We still had 100 miles to go downhill

244
0:12:59.185,000 --> 0:13:01,000
on very slippery rock-hard blue ice.

245
0:13:01.419,000 --> 0:13:03,000
They needed repairing almost every hour.

246
0:13:03.81,000 --> 0:13:04,000
To give you an idea of scale,

247
0:13:05.761,000 --> 0:13:07,000
this is looking down towards the mouth of the Beardmore Glacier.

248
0:13:08.758,000 --> 0:13:11,000
You could fit the entirety of Manhattan in the gap on the horizon.

249
0:13:12.233,000 --> 0:13:15,000
That's 20 miles between Mount Hope and Mount Kiffin.

250
0:13:15.447,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I've never felt as small as I did in Antarctica.

251
0:13:21.68,000 --> 0:13:23,000
When we got down to the mouth of the glacier,

252
0:13:23.785,000 --> 0:13:27,000
we found fresh snow had obscured the dozens of deep crevasses.

253
0:13:28.431,000 --> 0:13:3,000
One of Shackleton's men described crossing this sort of terrain

254
0:13:31.381,000 --> 0:13:35,000
as like walking over the glass roof of a railway station.

255
0:13:36.375,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We fell through more times than I can remember,

256
0:13:39.289,000 --> 0:13:42,000
usually just putting a ski or a boot through the snow.

257
0:13:42.721,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Occasionally we went in all the way up to our armpits,

258
0:13:45.324,000 --> 0:13:48,000
but thankfully never deeper than that.

259
0:13:48.767,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And less than five weeks ago, after 105 days,

260
0:13:52.947,000 --> 0:13:55,000
we crossed this oddly inauspicious finish line,

261
0:13:56.522,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the coast of Ross Island on the New Zealand side of Antarctica.

262
0:13:59.544,000 --> 0:14:01,000
You can see the ice in the foreground

263
0:14:01.694,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and the sort of rubbly rock behind that.

264
0:14:04.556,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Behind us lay an unbroken ski trail of nearly 1,800 miles.

265
0:14:08.358,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We'd made the longest ever polar journey on foot,

266
0:14:10.866,000 --> 0:14:14,000
something I'd been dreaming of doing for a decade.

267
0:14:15.256,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And looking back,

268
0:14:17.271,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I still stand by all the things

269
0:14:19.666,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I've been saying for years

270
0:14:21.248,000 --> 0:14:23,000
about the importance of goals

271
0:14:23.367,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and determination and self-belief,

272
0:14:26.809,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but I'll also admit that I hadn't given much thought to what happens

273
0:14:31.52,000 --> 0:14:34,000
when you reach the all-consuming goal

274
0:14:35.432,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that you've dedicated most of your adult life to,

275
0:14:38.75,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and the reality is that I'm still figuring that bit out.

276
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
As I said, there are very few superficial signs that I've been away.

277
0:14:45.931,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I've put on 30 pounds.

278
0:14:47.382,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I've got some very faint, probably covered in makeup now, frostbite scars.

279
0:14:50.91,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I've got one on my nose, one on each cheek, from where the goggles are,

280
0:14:54.383,000 --> 0:14:58,000
but inside I am a very different person indeed.

281
0:14:59.128,000 --> 0:15:01,000
If I'm honest,

282
0:15:01.625,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Antarctica challenged me and humbled me so deeply

283
0:15:06.8,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to put it into words.

284
0:15:10.503,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I'm still struggling to piece together my thoughts.

285
0:15:14.603,000 --> 0:15:17,000
That I'm standing here telling this story

286
0:15:18.248,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is proof that we all can accomplish great things,

287
0:15:23.026,000 --> 0:15:25,000
through ambition, through passion,

288
0:15:25.18,000 --> 0:15:27,000
through sheer stubbornness,

289
0:15:27.342,000 --> 0:15:28,000
by refusing to quit,

290
0:15:28.857,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that if you dream something hard enough, as Sting said,

291
0:15:31.813,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it does indeed come to pass.

292
0:15:34.884,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But I'm also standing here saying, you know what,

293
0:15:38.23,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that cliche about the journey being more important than the destination?

294
0:15:44.211,000 --> 0:15:47,000
There's something in that.

295
0:15:47.532,000 --> 0:15:49,000
The closer I got to my finish line,

296
0:15:49.901,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that rubbly, rocky coast of Ross Island,

297
0:15:53.657,000 --> 0:15:56,000
the more I started to realize that the biggest lesson

298
0:15:56.851,000 --> 0:16:,000
that this very long, very hard walk might be teaching me

299
0:16:01.431,000 --> 0:16:04,000
is that happiness is not a finish line,

300
0:16:05.124,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that for us humans,

301
0:16:06.694,000 --> 0:16:09,000
the perfection that so many of us seem to dream of

302
0:16:10.17,000 --> 0:16:14,000
might not ever be truly attainable,

303
0:16:14.25,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and that if we can't feel content here, today, now, on our journeys

304
0:16:22.716,000 --> 0:16:26,000
amidst the mess and the striving that we all inhabit,

305
0:16:27.184,000 --> 0:16:29,000
the open loops, the half-finished to-do lists,

306
0:16:29.904,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the could-do-better-next-times,

307
0:16:32.756,000 --> 0:16:35,000
then we might never feel it.

308
0:16:36.055,000 --> 0:16:39,000
A lot of people have asked me, what next?

309
0:16:39.631,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Right now, I am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets.

310
0:16:46.629,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But as Bob Hope put it,

311
0:16:50.982,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I feel very humble,

312
0:16:53.278,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but I think I have the strength of character to fight it. (Laughter)

313
0:16:57.347,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Thank you.

314
0:16:59.297,000 --> 0:17:02,000
(Applause)

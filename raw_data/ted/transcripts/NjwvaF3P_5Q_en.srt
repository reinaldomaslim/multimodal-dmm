1
0:00:13.458,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I stand before you as an evolutionary biologist,

2
0:00:17.833,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a professor of evolutionary biology,

3
0:00:20.167,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which sounds like a rather fancy title, if I may say so myself.

4
0:00:25.208,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I'm going to talk about two topics

5
0:00:27.708,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that aren't normally talked about together,

6
0:00:31.042,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and that's market economies and fungi.

7
0:00:34.125,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Or is it fun-GUY, or, as we say in Europe now, fun-GEE?

8
0:00:38.25,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There's still no consensus on how to say this word.

9
0:00:42.958,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So I want you to imagine a market economy

10
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that's 400 million years old,

11
0:00:51.667,000 --> 0:00:56,000
one that's so ubiquitous that it operates in almost every ecosystem of the world,

12
0:00:57.5,000 --> 0:01:03,000
so huge that it can connect millions of traders simultaneously,

13
0:01:03.75,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and so persistent

14
0:01:05.542,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that it survived mass extinctions.

15
0:01:08.375,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's here, right now, under our feet.

16
0:01:11.875,000 --> 0:01:12,000
You just can't see it.

17
0:01:14.083,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And unlike human economies

18
0:01:17.167,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that rely on cognition to make decisions,

19
0:01:20.292,000 --> 0:01:24,000
traders in this market, they beg, borrow, steal, cheat,

20
0:01:24.667,000 --> 0:01:26,000
all in the absence of thought.

21
0:01:26.75,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So hidden from our eyes,

22
0:01:28.542,000 --> 0:01:31,000
plant roots are colonized by a fungus called arbuscule mycorrhizae.

23
0:01:32.375,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now the fungus forms these complex networks underground

24
0:01:35.875,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of fine filaments thinner than even threads of cotton.

25
0:01:40.125,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So follow one of these fungi,

26
0:01:42.125,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and it connects multiple plants simultaneously.

27
0:01:45.792,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You can think of it as an underground subway system,

28
0:01:49.583,000 --> 0:01:51,000
where each root is a station,

29
0:01:52.083,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where resources are loaded and unloaded.

30
0:01:55.375,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And it's also very dense,

31
0:01:57.458,000 --> 0:02:02,000
so roughly the length of many meters, even a kilometer,

32
0:02:02.667,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in a single gram of dirt.

33
0:02:04.25,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So that's the length of 10 football fields

34
0:02:09.333,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in just a thimbleful of soil.

35
0:02:11.5,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And it's everywhere.

36
0:02:12.792,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So if you passed over a tree, a shrub, a vine, even a tiny weed,

37
0:02:18.792,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you passed over a mycorrhizal network.

38
0:02:21.75,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Roughly 80 percent of all plant species

39
0:02:25.458,000 --> 0:02:28,000
are associated with these mycorrhizal fungi.

40
0:02:29.292,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So what does a root covered in fungi

41
0:02:33.167,000 --> 0:02:35,000
have to do with our global economy?

42
0:02:35.833,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And why as an evolutionary biologist have I spent the last 10 years of my life

43
0:02:40.417,000 --> 0:02:42,000
learning economic jargon?

44
0:02:42.792,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Well, the first thing you need to understand

45
0:02:48.167,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is that trade deals made by plant and fungal partners

46
0:02:50.708,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are surprisingly similar

47
0:02:52.917,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to those made by us,

48
0:02:55.167,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but perhaps even more strategic.

49
0:02:57.583,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You see, plant and fungal partners,

50
0:02:59.333,000 --> 0:03:03,000
they're not exchanging stocks and bonds,

51
0:03:03.75,000 --> 0:03:05,000
they're exchanging essential resources,

52
0:03:06.208,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and for the fungus, that's sugars and fats.

53
0:03:09.25,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It gets all of its carbon directly from the plant partner.

54
0:03:13.833,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So much carbon, so every year, roughly five billion tons of carbon

55
0:03:19.167,000 --> 0:03:23,000
from plants go into this network underground.

56
0:03:23.708,000 --> 0:03:27,000
For the root, what they need is phosphorus and nitrogen,

57
0:03:28.708,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so by exchanging their carbon

58
0:03:30.542,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they get access to all of the nutrients collected by that fungal network.

59
0:03:36.75,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So to make the trade,

60
0:03:38.708,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the fungus penetrates into the root cell of the host

61
0:03:43.458,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and forms a tiny structure called an arbuscule,

62
0:03:47.208,000 --> 0:03:49,000
which is Latin for "little tree."

63
0:03:49.875,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, you can think of this as the physical stock exchange

64
0:03:54.208,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of the trade market.

65
0:03:55.5,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So up until now, it seems very harmonious.

66
0:03:58.708,000 --> 0:04:,000
Right? I scratch your back, you scratch mine,

67
0:04:01.583,000 --> 0:04:03,000
both partners get what they need.

68
0:04:03.75,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But here is where we need to pause

69
0:04:06.958,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and understand the power of evolution and natural selection.

70
0:04:11.875,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You see, there's no room for amateur traders on this market.

71
0:04:16.958,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Making the right trade strategy

72
0:04:19.75,000 --> 0:04:22,000
determines who lives and who dies.

73
0:04:24.417,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now, I use the word strategy,

74
0:04:28.083,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but of course plant and fungi, they don't have brains.

75
0:04:31.583,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They're making these exchanges

76
0:04:33.083,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in the absence of anything that we would consider as thought.

77
0:04:38.5,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But, as scientists, we use behavioral terms

78
0:04:42.875,000 --> 0:04:45,000
such as strategy

79
0:04:46.167,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to describe behaviors to certain conditions,

80
0:04:50.292,000 --> 0:04:52,000
actions and reactions

81
0:04:52.417,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that are actually programmed into the DNA of the organism.

82
0:04:58.458,000 --> 0:05:,000
So I started studying these trade strategies

83
0:05:01.25,000 --> 0:05:03,000
when I was 19 years old

84
0:05:03.833,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I was living in the tropical rainforests of Panama.

85
0:05:07.375,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now, everybody at the time was interested in this incredible diversity aboveground.

86
0:05:13.542,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And it was hyperdiversity. These are tropical rainforests.

87
0:05:16.833,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But I was interested in the complexity belowground.

88
0:05:20.5,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We knew that the networks existed, and we knew they were important,

89
0:05:23.917,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and I'm going to say it again, by important I mean important,

90
0:05:26.875,000 --> 0:05:28,000
so the basis of all plant nutrition

91
0:05:29.583,000 --> 0:05:32,000
for all the diversity that you do see aboveground.

92
0:05:34.083,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But at the time, we didn't know how these networks worked.

93
0:05:38.625,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We didn't know how they functioned.

94
0:05:40.833,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Why did only certain plants interact with certain fungi?

95
0:05:45.917,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So fast-forward to when I started my own group,

96
0:05:48.625,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and we really began to play with this trade market.

97
0:05:51.792,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You see, we would manipulate conditions.

98
0:05:53.875,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We would create a good trading partner by growing a plant in the sun

99
0:05:57.917,000 --> 0:06:,000
and a poor trading partner by growing it in the shade.

100
0:06:00.958,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We would then connect these with a fungal network.

101
0:06:04.25,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And we found that the fungi were consistently good

102
0:06:07.958,000 --> 0:06:11,000
at discriminating among good and bad trading partners.

103
0:06:12.125,000 --> 0:06:16,000
They would allocate more resources to the host plant giving them more carbon.

104
0:06:18.042,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, we would run the reciprocal experiments

105
0:06:20.833,000 --> 0:06:23,000
where we would inoculate a host plant with good and bad fungi,

106
0:06:24.667,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and they were also good at discriminating between these trade partners.

107
0:06:29.75,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So what you have there is the perfect conditions for a market to emerge.

108
0:06:36.125,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's a simple market,

109
0:06:38.042,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but it's a market nonetheless,

110
0:06:40.25,000 --> 0:06:44,000
where the better trading partner is consistently favored.

111
0:06:45.708,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But is it a fair market?

112
0:06:47.208,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now this is where you need to understand that, like humans,

113
0:06:50.958,000 --> 0:06:54,000
plants and fungi are incredibly opportunistic.

114
0:06:56.25,000 --> 0:07:01,000
There's evidence that the fungus, once it penetrates into the plant cell,

115
0:07:01.292,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it can actually hijack the plant's own nutrient uptake system.

116
0:07:06.417,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It does this by suppressing the plant's own ability

117
0:07:09.5,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to take up nutrients from the soil.

118
0:07:12.625,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So this creates a dependency of the plant on the fungus.

119
0:07:17.25,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's a false addiction, of sorts,

120
0:07:20.208,000 --> 0:07:22,000
whereby the plant has to feed the fungus

121
0:07:22.917,000 --> 0:07:26,000
just to get access to the resources right around its own root.

122
0:07:28.333,000 --> 0:07:33,000
There's also evidence that the fungi are good at inflating the price of nutrients.

123
0:07:33.958,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They do this by extracting the nutrients from the soil,

124
0:07:38.167,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but then rather than trading them with the host,

125
0:07:41.292,000 --> 0:07:43,000
they hoard them in their network,

126
0:07:43.542,000 --> 0:07:48,000
so this makes them unavailable to the plant and other competing fungi.

127
0:07:49.792,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So basic economics,

128
0:07:51.333,000 --> 0:07:55,000
as resource availability goes down, the value goes up.

129
0:07:55.5,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The plant is forced to pay more for the same amount of resources.

130
0:08:00.458,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But it's not all in favor of the fungus.

131
0:08:03.708,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Plants can be extremely cunning as well.

132
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:08,000
There are some orchids --

133
0:08:08.333,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and I always think orchids somehow seem like the most devious

134
0:08:11.292,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of the plant species in the world --

135
0:08:13.208,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and there are some orchids

136
0:08:15.583,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that just tap directly into the network

137
0:08:19.417,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and steal all their carbon.

138
0:08:21.833,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So these orchids, they don't even make green leaves to photosynthesize.

139
0:08:26.292,000 --> 0:08:27,000
They're just white.

140
0:08:27.667,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So rather than photosynthesizing,

141
0:08:29.833,000 --> 0:08:3,000
tap into the network,

142
0:08:31.292,000 --> 0:08:32,000
steal the carbon

143
0:08:32.75,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and give nothing in return.

144
0:08:35.583,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now I think it's fair to say that these types of parasites

145
0:08:38.375,000 --> 0:08:4,000
also flourish in our human markets.

146
0:08:40.958,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So as we began to decode these strategies,

147
0:08:44.917,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we learned some lessons.

148
0:08:46.792,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And the first one was that there's no altruism in this system.

149
0:08:52.125,000 --> 0:08:53,000
There's no trade favors.

150
0:08:54.042,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We don't see strong evidence

151
0:08:57.708,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of the fungus helping dying or struggling plants

152
0:09:02.5,000 --> 0:09:08,000
unless it directly benefits the fungus itself.

153
0:09:10.333,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now I'm not saying if this is good or bad.

154
0:09:13.458,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Unlike humans, a fungus, of course, cannot judge its own morality.

155
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And as a biologist,

156
0:09:19.292,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I'm not advocating for these types of ruthless neoliberal market dynamics

157
0:09:26.083,000 --> 0:09:27,000
enacted by the fungi.

158
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But the trade system,

159
0:09:33.25,000 --> 0:09:35,000
it provides us with a benchmark

160
0:09:36.833,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to study what an economy looks like

161
0:09:40.208,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when it's been shaped by natural selection

162
0:09:43.042,000 --> 0:09:46,000
for hundreds of millions of years

163
0:09:46.708,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in the absence of morality,

164
0:09:49.375,000 --> 0:09:51,000
when strategies are just based

165
0:09:51.958,000 --> 0:09:55,000
on the gathering and processing of information,

166
0:09:56.833,000 --> 0:09:58,000
uncontaminated by cognition:

167
0:09:59.292,000 --> 0:10:01,000
no jealousy, no spite,

168
0:10:01.833,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but no hope, no joy.

169
0:10:04.583,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So we've made progress

170
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in decoding the most basic trade principles at this point,

171
0:10:11.583,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but as scientists we always want to take it one step further,

172
0:10:14.75,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and we're interested in more complex economic dilemmas.

173
0:10:20.417,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And specifically we're interested in the effects of inequality.

174
0:10:25.5,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So inequality has really become a defining feature

175
0:10:31.208,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of today's economic landscape.

176
0:10:34.333,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But the challenges of inequality

177
0:10:36.833,000 --> 0:10:38,000
are not unique to the human world.

178
0:10:39.5,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I think as humans we tend to think that everything's unique to us,

179
0:10:43.292,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but organisms in nature

180
0:10:45.958,000 --> 0:10:5,000
must face relentless variation in their access to resources.

181
0:10:51.25,000 --> 0:10:54,000
How does a fungus that can again be meters long

182
0:10:54.542,000 --> 0:10:58,000
change its trade strategy when it's exposed simultaneously

183
0:10:59.458,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to a rich patch and a poor patch?

184
0:11:02.417,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And, more generally,

185
0:11:03.708,000 --> 0:11:06,000
how do organisms in nature use trade to their advantage

186
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
when they're faced with uncertainty

187
0:11:09.75,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in terms of their access to resources?

188
0:11:12.292,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Here's where I have to let you in on a secret:

189
0:11:14.5,000 --> 0:11:18,000
studying trade underground is incredibly difficult.

190
0:11:19.417,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You can't see where or when important trade deals take place.

191
0:11:25.458,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So our group helped pioneer a method, a technology,

192
0:11:29.458,000 --> 0:11:33,000
whereby we could tag nutrients with nanoparticles,

193
0:11:34.125,000 --> 0:11:37,000
fluorescing nanoparticles called quantum dots.

194
0:11:38.083,000 --> 0:11:4,000
What the quantum dots allow us to do

195
0:11:40.5,000 --> 0:11:42,000
is actually light up the nutrients

196
0:11:43.375,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so we can visually track their movements

197
0:11:46.542,000 --> 0:11:48,000
across the fungal network

198
0:11:48.958,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and into the host root.

199
0:11:51.125,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So this allows us finally to see the unseen,

200
0:11:54.792,000 --> 0:11:59,000
so we can study how fungi bargain at a small scale with their plant hosts.

201
0:12:00.125,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So to study inequality,

202
0:12:01.792,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we exposed a fungal network

203
0:12:03.958,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to these varying concentrations of fluorescing phosphorus,

204
0:12:07.875,000 --> 0:12:1,000
mimicking patches of abundance and scarcity

205
0:12:11.583,000 --> 0:12:13,000
across this artificial landscape.

206
0:12:14.458,000 --> 0:12:17,000
We then carefully quantified fungal trade.

207
0:12:19.167,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And we found two things.

208
0:12:21.667,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The first thing we found

209
0:12:23.375,000 --> 0:12:27,000
was that inequality encouraged the fungus to trade more.

210
0:12:29.333,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So I can use the word "encouraged" or "stimulated" or "forced,"

211
0:12:34.083,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but the bottom line is that compared to control conditions,

212
0:12:37.375,000 --> 0:12:41,000
inequality was associated with higher levels of trade.

213
0:12:43.292,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This is important,

214
0:12:45.167,000 --> 0:12:5,000
because it suggests that evolving a trade partnership in nature

215
0:12:50.333,000 --> 0:12:54,000
can help organisms cope with the uncertainty of accessing resources.

216
0:12:55.833,000 --> 0:13:,000
Second, we found that, exposed to inequality,

217
0:13:02.792,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the fungus would move resources from the rich patch of the network,

218
0:13:07.75,000 --> 0:13:11,000
actively transport them to the poor side of the network.

219
0:13:11.917,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Now, of course, we could see this

220
0:13:13.583,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because the patches were fluorescing in different colors.

221
0:13:16.5,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So at first, this result was incredibly puzzling.

222
0:13:22.042,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Was it to help the poor side of the network?

223
0:13:25.917,000 --> 0:13:3,000
No. We found that the fungus gained more by first moving the resources

224
0:13:31.792,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to where demand was higher.

225
0:13:34.375,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Simply by changing where across the network the fungus was trading,

226
0:13:40.75,000 --> 0:13:43,000
it could manipulate the value of those resources.

227
0:13:45.375,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Now this stimulated us to really dig deeper into how information is shared.

228
0:13:51.625,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It suggests a high level of sophistication,

229
0:13:54.333,000 --> 0:13:57,000
or at least a medium level of sophistication

230
0:13:57.5,000 --> 0:14:,000
in an organism with no cognition.

231
0:14:00.625,000 --> 0:14:05,000
How is it that a fungus can sense market conditions across its network

232
0:14:06.042,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and then make calculations of where and when to trade?

233
0:14:10.083,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So we wanted to look about information and how it's shared across this network,

234
0:14:14.667,000 --> 0:14:16,000
how the fungus integrates cues.

235
0:14:19.208,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So to do that, what you need to do is dive deep in and get a higher resolution

236
0:14:24.625,000 --> 0:14:25,000
into the network itself.

237
0:14:27.375,000 --> 0:14:31,000
We began to study complex flows inside the hyphal network.

238
0:14:31.792,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So what you're looking at right now is a living fungal network

239
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:4,000
with the cellular contents moving across it.

240
0:14:40.125,000 --> 0:14:41,000
This is happening in real time,

241
0:14:42.083,000 --> 0:14:44,000
so you can see the time stamp up there.

242
0:14:44.458,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So this is happening right now. This video isn't sped up.

243
0:14:47.167,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This is what is happening under our feet right now.

244
0:14:49.625,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And there's a couple of things that I want you to notice.

245
0:14:52.958,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It speeds up, it slows down, it switches directions.

246
0:14:57.583,000 --> 0:14:59,000
So we're working now with biophysicists

247
0:15:00.375,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to try to dissect this complexity.

248
0:15:03.792,000 --> 0:15:06,000
How is the fungus using these complex flow patterns

249
0:15:07.792,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to share and process information

250
0:15:10.458,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and make these trade decisions?

251
0:15:13.875,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Are fungi better at making trade calculations than us?

252
0:15:20.25,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Now here's where we can potentially borrow models from nature.

253
0:15:24.25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
We're increasingly reliant on computer algorithms

254
0:15:27.583,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to make us profitable trades in split-second time scales.

255
0:15:32.208,000 --> 0:15:35,000
But computer algorithms and fungi,

256
0:15:35.792,000 --> 0:15:38,000
they both operate in similar, uncognitive ways.

257
0:15:40.875,000 --> 0:15:43,000
The fungi just happens to be a living machine.

258
0:15:44.125,000 --> 0:15:47,000
What would happen if we compare and compete

259
0:15:47.458,000 --> 0:15:5,000
the trading strategies of these two?

260
0:15:50.625,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Who would win?

261
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
The tiny capitalist that's been around

262
0:15:55.5,000 --> 0:16:,000
since before and the fall of the dinosaurs?

263
0:16:00.875,000 --> 0:16:01,000
My money is on the fungus.

264
0:16:03.417,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Thank you.

265
0:16:04.708,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.788,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Chris Anderson: Welcome to this next edition of TED Dialogues.

2
0:00:17.424,000 --> 0:00:2,000
We're trying to do some bridging here today.

3
0:00:20.514,000 --> 0:00:22,000
You know, the American dream has inspired millions of people

4
0:00:23.458,000 --> 0:00:25,000
around the world for many years.

5
0:00:26.757,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Today, I think, you can say that America is divided,

6
0:00:32.498,000 --> 0:00:33,000
perhaps more than ever,

7
0:00:34.183,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the divisions seem to be getting worse.

8
0:00:36.262,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's actually really hard for people on different sides

9
0:00:40.127,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to even have a conversation.

10
0:00:41.605,000 --> 0:00:43,000
People almost feel...

11
0:00:43.941,000 --> 0:00:44,000
disgusted with each other.

12
0:00:46.468,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Some families can't even speak to each other right now.

13
0:00:51.501,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Our purpose in this dialogue today is to try to do something about that,

14
0:00:56.073,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to try to have a different kind of conversation,

15
0:00:58.757,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to do some listening, some thinking, some understanding.

16
0:01:03.022,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I have two people with us to help us do that.

17
0:01:06.474,000 --> 0:01:09,000
They're not going to come at this hammer and tong against each other.

18
0:01:09.737,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is not like cable news.

19
0:01:11.525,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This is two people who have both spent a lot of their working life

20
0:01:17.042,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in the political center or right of the center.

21
0:01:19.353,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They've immersed themselves in conservative worldviews, if you like.

22
0:01:23.341,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They know that space very well.

23
0:01:25.488,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And we're going to explore together

24
0:01:27.221,000 --> 0:01:3,000
how to think about what is happening right now,

25
0:01:30.266,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and whether we can find new ways to bridge

26
0:01:33.435,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and just to have wiser, more connected conversations.

27
0:01:36.676,000 --> 0:01:39,000
With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,

28
0:01:39.803,000 --> 0:01:44,000
who has spent a decade working at Fox News,

29
0:01:45.117,000 --> 0:01:49,000
hosting "Fox and Friends" and then "The Real Story,"

30
0:01:49.619,000 --> 0:01:54,000
before taking a courageous stance in filing sexual harassment claims

31
0:01:55.416,000 --> 0:01:56,000
against Roger Ailes,

32
0:01:56.656,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which eventually led to his departure from Fox News.

33
0:02:00.482,000 --> 0:02:02,000
David Brooks, who has earned the wrath

34
0:02:03.309,000 --> 0:02:05,000
of many of [The New York Times's] left-leaning readers

35
0:02:06.247,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because of his conservative views,

36
0:02:09.159,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and more recently, perhaps, some of the right-leaning readers

37
0:02:12.117,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because of his criticism of some aspects of Trump.

38
0:02:16.168,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Yet, his columns are usually

39
0:02:18.568,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the top one, two or three most-read content of the day

40
0:02:22.988,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because they're brilliant,

41
0:02:24.252,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because they bring psychology and social science

42
0:02:26.575,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to providing understanding for what's going on.

43
0:02:30.052,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So without further ado, a huge welcome to Gretchen and David.

44
0:02:33.349,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Come and join me.

45
0:02:34.531,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Applause)

46
0:02:38.268,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So, Gretchen.

47
0:02:41.294,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Sixty-three million Americans voted for Donald Trump.

48
0:02:46.325,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Why did they do this?

49
0:02:48.063,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.

50
0:02:51.607,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I mean, I think it was a movement of sorts, but it started long ago.

51
0:02:54.906,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It didn't just happen overnight.

52
0:02:56.738,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"Anger" would be the first word that I would think of --

53
0:02:59.673,000 --> 0:03:03,000
anger with nothing being done in Washington,

54
0:03:03.96,000 --> 0:03:06,000
anger about not being heard.

55
0:03:07.796,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I think there was a huge swath of the population

56
0:03:10.215,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that feels like Washington never listens to them,

57
0:03:12.988,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you know, a good part of the middle of America, not just the coasts,

58
0:03:17.246,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and he was somebody they felt was listening to their concerns.

59
0:03:21.976,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So I think those two issues would be the main reason.

60
0:03:26.226,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I have to throw in there also celebrity.

61
0:03:29.212,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I think that had a huge impact on Donald Trump becoming president.

62
0:03:34.902,000 --> 0:03:36,000
CA: Was the anger justified?

63
0:03:37.871,000 --> 0:03:38,000
David Brooks: Yeah, I think so.

64
0:03:39.468,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In 2015 and early 2016, I wrote about 30 columns

65
0:03:43.566,000 --> 0:03:44,000
with the following theme:

66
0:03:44.941,000 --> 0:03:46,000
don't worry, Donald Trump will never be the Republican nominee.

67
0:03:47.952,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:49.136,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And having done that and gotten that so wrong,

69
0:03:51.358,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I decided to spend the ensuing year just out in Trumpworld,

70
0:03:54.566,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and I found a lot of economic dislocation.

71
0:03:57.46,000 --> 0:04:,000
I ran into a woman in West Virginia who was going to a funeral for her mom.

72
0:04:01.054,000 --> 0:04:04,000
She said, "The nice thing about being Catholic is we don't have to speak,

73
0:04:04.546,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that's good, because we're not word people."

74
0:04:06.842,000 --> 0:04:07,000
That phrase rung in my head: word people.

75
0:04:08.848,000 --> 0:04:1,000
A lot of us in the TED community are word people,

76
0:04:11.648,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but if you're not, the economy has not been angled toward you,

77
0:04:14.799,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and so 11 million men, for example, are out of the labor force

78
0:04:18.46,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because those jobs are done away.

79
0:04:20.093,000 --> 0:04:21,000
A lot of social injury.

80
0:04:21.657,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You used to be able to say, "I'm not the richest person in the world,

81
0:04:24.978,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I'm not the most famous,

82
0:04:26.22,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but my neighbors can count on me and I get some dignity out of that."

83
0:04:29.549,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And because of celebritification or whatever, if you're not rich or famous,

84
0:04:33.127,000 --> 0:04:34,000
you feel invisible.

85
0:04:34.309,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And a lot of moral injury, sense of feeling betrayed,

86
0:04:37.645,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and frankly, in this country, we almost have one success story,

87
0:04:41.524,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which is you go to college, get a white-collar job, and you're a success,

88
0:04:45.118,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and if you don't fit in that formula,

89
0:04:47.23,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you feel like you're not respected.

90
0:04:49.011,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And so that accumulation of things --

91
0:04:50.853,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and when I talked to Trump voters and still do,

92
0:04:53.069,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I found most of them completely realistic about his failings,

93
0:04:56.778,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but they said, this is my shot.

94
0:04:59.154,000 --> 0:05:02,000
GC: And yet I predicted that he would be the nominee,

95
0:05:02.424,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because I've known him for 27 years.

96
0:05:04.632,000 --> 0:05:05,000
He's a master marketer,

97
0:05:06.446,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and one of the things he did extremely well

98
0:05:08.473,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that President Obama also did extremely well,

99
0:05:10.691,000 --> 0:05:12,000
was simplifying the message,

100
0:05:12.753,000 --> 0:05:14,000
simplifying down to phrases

101
0:05:15.565,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and to a populist message.

102
0:05:17.638,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Even if he can't achieve it, it sounded good.

103
0:05:21.395,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And many people latched on to that simplicity again.

104
0:05:24.649,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's something they could grasp onto:

105
0:05:26.618,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"I get that. I want that. That sounds fantastic."

106
0:05:30.771,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And I remember when he used to come on my show originally,

107
0:05:33.719,000 --> 0:05:35,000
before "The Apprentice" was even "The Apprentice,"

108
0:05:36.144,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and he'd say it was the number one show on TV.

109
0:05:38.347,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I'd say back to him, "No, it's not."

110
0:05:40.128,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And he would say, "Yes it is, Gretchen."

111
0:05:42.062,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I would say, "No it's not."

112
0:05:43.97,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But people at home would see that, and they'd be like,

113
0:05:46.529,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"Wow, I should be watching the number one show on TV."

114
0:05:49.129,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And -- lo and behold -- it became the number one show on TV.

115
0:05:52.106,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So he had this, I've seen this ability in him

116
0:05:55.432,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to be the master marketer.

117
0:05:57.654,000 --> 0:05:59,000
CA: It's puzzling to a lot of people on the left

118
0:06:00.262,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that so many women voted for him,

119
0:06:03.545,000 --> 0:06:04,000
despite some of his comments.

120
0:06:05.106,000 --> 0:06:07,000
GC: I wrote a column about this for Time Motto,

121
0:06:07.845,000 --> 0:06:11,000
saying that I really believe that lot of people put on blinders,

122
0:06:13.144,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and maybe for the first time,

123
0:06:16.027,000 --> 0:06:18,000
some people decided that policies they believed in

124
0:06:18.823,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and being heard and not being invisible anymore

125
0:06:21.395,000 --> 0:06:22,000
was more important to them

126
0:06:23.37,000 --> 0:06:26,000
than the way in which he had acted or acts as a human.

127
0:06:27.731,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And so human dignity --

128
0:06:29.803,000 --> 0:06:32,000
whether it would be the dust-up about the disabled reporter,

129
0:06:33.295,000 --> 0:06:35,000
or what happened in that audiotape with Billy Bush

130
0:06:35.859,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and the way in which he spoke about women --

131
0:06:39.121,000 --> 0:06:4,000
they put that aside

132
0:06:41.092,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and pretended as if they hadn't seen that or heard that,

133
0:06:43.737,000 --> 0:06:47,000
because to them, policies were more important.

134
0:06:47.797,000 --> 0:06:49,000
CA: Right, so just because someone voted for Trump,

135
0:06:50.632,000 --> 0:06:53,000
it's not blind adherence to everything that he's said or stood for.

136
0:06:54.383,000 --> 0:06:56,000
GC: No. I heard a lot of people that would say to me,

137
0:06:57.229,000 --> 0:07:,000
"Wow, I just wish he would shut up before the election.

138
0:07:00.316,000 --> 0:07:02,000
If he would just stay quiet, he'd get elected."

139
0:07:03.903,000 --> 0:07:05,000
CA: And so, maybe for people on the left there's a trap there,

140
0:07:06.864,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to sort of despise or just be baffled by the support,

141
0:07:12.466,000 --> 0:07:15,000
assuming that it's for some of the unattractive features.

142
0:07:15.574,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Actually, maybe they're supporting him despite those,

143
0:07:18.143,000 --> 0:07:19,000
because they see something exciting.

144
0:07:19.953,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They see a man of action.

145
0:07:21.319,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They see the choking hold of government being thrown off in some way

146
0:07:26.401,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and they're excited by that.

147
0:07:27.764,000 --> 0:07:3,000
GC: But don't forget we saw that on the left as well -- Bernie Sanders.

148
0:07:31.164,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So this is one of the commonalities that I think we can talk about today,

149
0:07:35.142,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"The Year of the Outsider," David -- right?

150
0:07:38.823,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And even though Bernie Sanders has been in Congress for a long time,

151
0:07:42.112,000 --> 0:07:44,000
he was deemed an outsider this time.

152
0:07:44.349,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And so there was anger on the left as well,

153
0:07:46.715,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and so many people were in favor of Bernie Sanders.

154
0:07:50.674,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So I see it as a commonality.

155
0:07:54.586,000 --> 0:07:56,000
People who like Trump, people who like Bernie Sanders,

156
0:07:57.189,000 --> 0:08:,000
they were liking different policies, but the underpinning was anger.

157
0:08:01.016,000 --> 0:08:05,000
CA: David, there's often this narrative, then,

158
0:08:05.61,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that the sole explanation for Trump's victory and his rise

159
0:08:10.825,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is his tapping into anger in a very visceral way.

160
0:08:15.801,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But you've written a bit about that it's actually more than that,

161
0:08:20.483,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that there's a worldview that's being worked on here.

162
0:08:23.705,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Could you talk about that?

163
0:08:25.002,000 --> 0:08:27,000
DB: I would say he understood what, frankly, I didn't,

164
0:08:27.581,000 --> 0:08:28,000
which is what debate we were having.

165
0:08:29.461,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan,

166
0:08:31.918,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and it was the big government versus small government debate.

167
0:08:34.846,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It was Barry Goldwater versus George McGovern,

168
0:08:37.059,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and that was the debate we had been having for a generation.

169
0:08:41.188,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It was: Democrats wanted to use government to enhance equality,

170
0:08:45.377,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Republicans wanted to limit government to enhance freedom.

171
0:08:48.149,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That was the debate.

172
0:08:49.356,000 --> 0:08:51,000
He understood what I think the two major parties did not,

173
0:08:52.19,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which was that's not the debate anymore.

174
0:08:54.158,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The debate is now open versus closed.

175
0:08:56.511,000 --> 0:08:59,000
On one side are those who have the tailwinds of globalization

176
0:08:59.801,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and the meritocracy blowing at their back,

177
0:09:02.058,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and they tend to favor open trade,

178
0:09:04.481,000 --> 0:09:05,000
open borders, open social mores,

179
0:09:06.49,000 --> 0:09:07,000
because there are so many opportunities.

180
0:09:08.476,000 --> 0:09:11,000
On the other side are those who feel the headwinds of globalization

181
0:09:11.956,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and the meritocracy just blasting in their faces,

182
0:09:14.372,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and they favor closed trade, closed borders, closed social mores,

183
0:09:18.327,000 --> 0:09:2,000
because they just want some security.

184
0:09:20.442,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And so he was right on that fundamental issue,

185
0:09:22.61,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and people were willing to overlook a lot to get there.

186
0:09:25.286,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And so he felt that sense of security.

187
0:09:27.417,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We're speaking the morning after Trump's joint session speech.

188
0:09:31.77,000 --> 0:09:33,000
There are three traditional groups in the Republican Party.

189
0:09:34.62,000 --> 0:09:35,000
There are the foreign policies hawks

190
0:09:36.422,000 --> 0:09:38,000
who believe in America as global policeman.

191
0:09:38.501,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Trump totally repudiated that view.

192
0:09:40.378,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Second, there was the social conservatives

193
0:09:42.448,000 --> 0:09:43,000
who believed in religious liberty,

194
0:09:44.179,000 --> 0:09:45,000
pro-life,

195
0:09:46.116,000 --> 0:09:48,000
prayer in schools.

196
0:09:49.53,000 --> 0:09:5,000
He totally ignored that.

197
0:09:51.199,000 --> 0:09:54,000
There was not a single mention of a single social conservative issue.

198
0:09:54.658,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And then there were the fiscal hawks,

199
0:09:56.501,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the people who wanted to cut down on the national debt, Tea Party,

200
0:09:59.643,000 --> 0:10:,000
cut the size of government.

201
0:10:00.973,000 --> 0:10:01,000
He's expanding the size of government!

202
0:10:02.852,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Here's a man who has single-handedly revolutionized a major American party

203
0:10:06.558,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because he understood where the debate was headed

204
0:10:09.555,000 --> 0:10:1,000
before other people.

205
0:10:10.926,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And then guys like Steve Bannon come in

206
0:10:12.965,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and give him substance to his impulses.

207
0:10:16.027,000 --> 0:10:17,000
CA: And so take that a bit further,

208
0:10:17.82,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and maybe expand a bit more on your insights

209
0:10:21.599,000 --> 0:10:23,000
into Steve Bannon's worldview.

210
0:10:23.886,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Because he's sometimes tarred in very simple terms

211
0:10:26.642,000 --> 0:10:32,000
as this dangerous, racist, xenophobic, anger-sparking person.

212
0:10:33.277,000 --> 0:10:37,000
There's more to the story; that is perhaps an unfair simplification.

213
0:10:37.817,000 --> 0:10:38,000
DB: I think that part is true,

214
0:10:39.277,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but there's another part that's probably true, too.

215
0:10:41.771,000 --> 0:10:43,000
He's part of a global movement.

216
0:10:43.955,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's like being around Marxists in 1917.

217
0:10:46.664,000 --> 0:10:5,000
There's him here, there's the UKIP party, there's the National Front in France,

218
0:10:50.884,000 --> 0:10:53,000
there's Putin, there's a Turkish version, a Philippine version.

219
0:10:53.953,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So we have to recognize that this is a global intellectual movement.

220
0:10:57.448,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And it believes

221
0:10:58.687,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that wisdom and virtue is not held in individual conversation and civility

222
0:11:03.968,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the way a lot of us in the enlightenment side of the world do.

223
0:11:07.394,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It's held in -- the German word is the "volk" -- in the people,

224
0:11:10.996,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in the common, instinctive wisdom of the plain people.

225
0:11:14.55,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And the essential virtue of that people is always being threatened by outsiders.

226
0:11:19.522,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And he's got a strategy for how to get there.

227
0:11:22.229,000 --> 0:11:26,000
He's got a series of policies to bring the people up

228
0:11:26.281,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and repudiate the outsiders,

229
0:11:28.631,000 --> 0:11:32,000
whether those outsiders are Islam, Mexicans, the media,

230
0:11:33.424,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the coastal elites...

231
0:11:35.318,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And there's a whole worldview there; it's a very coherent worldview.

232
0:11:38.655,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I sort of have more respect for him.

233
0:11:40.578,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I loathe what he stands for and I think he's wrong on the substance,

234
0:11:43.853,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but it's interesting to see someone with a set of ideas

235
0:11:46.584,000 --> 0:11:47,000
find a vehicle, Donald Trump,

236
0:11:48.581,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and then try to take control of the White House

237
0:11:51.723,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in order to advance his viewpoint.

238
0:11:53.849,000 --> 0:11:57,000
CA: So it's almost become, like, that the core question of our time now is:

239
0:11:58.699,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Can you be patriotic but also have a global mindset?

240
0:12:03.744,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Are these two things implacably opposed to each other?

241
0:12:08.039,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I mean, a lot of conservatives

242
0:12:11.524,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and, to the extent that it's a different category,

243
0:12:13.995,000 --> 0:12:14,000
a lot of Trump supporters,

244
0:12:15.3,000 --> 0:12:18,000
are infuriated by the coastal elites and the globalists

245
0:12:19.25,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because they see them as, sort of, not cheering for America,

246
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
not embracing fully American values.

247
0:12:25.946,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I mean, have you seen that in your conversations with people,

248
0:12:29.522,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in your understanding of their mindset?

249
0:12:31.45,000 --> 0:12:34,000
GC: I do think that there's a huge difference between --

250
0:12:34.675,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I hate to put people in categories, but,

251
0:12:36.681,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Middle America versus people who live on the coasts.

252
0:12:40.666,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It's an entirely different existence.

253
0:12:42.756,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have an understanding of Middle America,

254
0:12:46.446,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and I've never forgotten it.

255
0:12:47.826,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And maybe that's why I have an understanding of what happened here,

256
0:12:51.357,000 --> 0:12:55,000
because those people often feel like nobody's listening to them,

257
0:12:56.205,000 --> 0:13:,000
and that we're only concentrating on California and New York.

258
0:13:00.717,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And so I think that was a huge reason why Trump was elected.

259
0:13:05.265,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I mean, these people felt like they were being heard.

260
0:13:09.377,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Whether or not patriotism falls into that,

261
0:13:13.551,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I'm not sure about that.

262
0:13:14.744,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I do know one thing:

263
0:13:15.939,000 --> 0:13:19,000
a lot of things Trump talked about last night are not conservative things.

264
0:13:20.018,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Had Hillary Clinton gotten up and given that speech,

265
0:13:22.519,000 --> 0:13:24,000
not one Republican would have stood up to applaud.

266
0:13:24.9,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I mean, he's talking about spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure.

267
0:13:28.551,000 --> 0:13:29,000
That is not a conservative viewpoint.

268
0:13:30.413,000 --> 0:13:32,000
He talked about government-mandated maternity leave.

269
0:13:34.132,000 --> 0:13:37,000
A lot of women may love that; it's not a conservative viewpoint.

270
0:13:37.174,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So it's fascinating

271
0:13:38.349,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that people who loved what his message was during the campaign,

272
0:13:42.073,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I'm not sure -- how do you think they'll react to that?

273
0:13:44.699,000 --> 0:13:46,000
DB: I should say I grew up in Lower Manhattan,

274
0:13:46.909,000 --> 0:13:48,000
in the triangle between ABC Carpets, the Strand Bookstore

275
0:13:49.664,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and The Odeon restaurant.

276
0:13:51.002,000 --> 0:13:52,000
(Laughter)

277
0:13:52.657,000 --> 0:13:53,000
GC: Come to Minnesota sometime!

278
0:13:54.535,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Laughter)

279
0:13:55.792,000 --> 0:14:,000
CA: You are a card-carrying member of the coastal elite, my man.

280
0:14:01.466,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But what did you make of the speech last night?

281
0:14:03.742,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It seemed to be a move to a more moderate position,

282
0:14:07.213,000 --> 0:14:08,000
on the face of it.

283
0:14:08.388,000 --> 0:14:1,000
DB: Yeah, I thought it was his best speech,

284
0:14:10.439,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and it took away the freakishness of him.

285
0:14:12.501,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I do think he's a moral freak,

286
0:14:14.381,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and I think he'll be undone by that fact,

287
0:14:17.207,000 --> 0:14:19,000
the fact that he just doesn't know anything about anything

288
0:14:20.01,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and is uncurious about it.

289
0:14:21.287,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Laughter)

290
0:14:22.404,000 --> 0:14:24,000
But if you take away these minor flaws,

291
0:14:24.593,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I think we got to see him at his best,

292
0:14:26.689,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and it was revealing for me to see him at his best,

293
0:14:29.831,000 --> 0:14:33,000
because to me, it exposed a central contradiction that he's got to confront,

294
0:14:34.372,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that a lot of what he's doing is offering security.

295
0:14:37.4,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So, "I'm ordering closed borders,

296
0:14:39.222,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I'm going to secure the world for you, for my people."

297
0:14:42.109,000 --> 0:14:45,000
But then if you actually look at a lot of his economic policies,

298
0:14:45.181,000 --> 0:14:48,000
like health care reform, which is about private health care accounts,

299
0:14:48.986,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that's not security, that's risk.

300
0:14:51.875,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Educational vouchers: that's risk. Deregulation: that's risk.

301
0:14:55.595,000 --> 0:14:58,000
There's really a contradiction between the security of the mindset

302
0:14:59.596,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and a lot of the policies, which are very risk-oriented.

303
0:15:02.404,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And what I would say, especially having spent this year,

304
0:15:05.929,000 --> 0:15:08,000
the people in rural Minnesota, in New Mexico --

305
0:15:09.818,000 --> 0:15:11,000
they've got enough risk in their lives.

306
0:15:11.907,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And so they're going to say, "No thank you."

307
0:15:15.246,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And I think his health care repeal will fail for that reason.

308
0:15:19.038,000 --> 0:15:21,000
CA: But despite the criticisms you just made of him,

309
0:15:22.007,000 --> 0:15:26,000
it does at least seem that he's listening

310
0:15:26.243,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to a surprisingly wide range of voices;

311
0:15:28.441,000 --> 0:15:3,000
it's not like everyone is coming from the same place.

312
0:15:31.236,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And maybe that leads to a certain amount of chaos and confusion, but --

313
0:15:36.52,000 --> 0:15:39,000
GC: I actually don't think he's listening to a wide range of voices.

314
0:15:39.766,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I think he's listening to very few people.

315
0:15:41.82,000 --> 0:15:42,000
That's just my impression of it.

316
0:15:43.647,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I believe that some of the things he said last night

317
0:15:46.126,000 --> 0:15:48,000
had Ivanka all over them.

318
0:15:48.173,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So I believe he was listening to her before that speech.

319
0:15:52.111,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And he was Teleprompter Trump last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.

320
0:15:56.358,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And that's why, before we came out here,

321
0:15:58.507,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I said, "We better check Twitter to see if anything's changed."

322
0:16:02.742,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And also I think you have to keep in mind

323
0:16:04.955,000 --> 0:16:07,000
that because he's such a unique character,

324
0:16:08.162,000 --> 0:16:1,000
what was the bar that we were expecting last night?

325
0:16:11.031,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Was it here or here or here?

326
0:16:13.911,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And so he comes out and gives a looking political speech,

327
0:16:17.697,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and everyone goes, "Wow! He can do it."

328
0:16:21.109,000 --> 0:16:23,000
It just depends on which direction he goes.

329
0:16:23.155,000 --> 0:16:25,000
DB: Yeah, and we're trying to build bridges here,

330
0:16:25.544,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and especially for an audience that may have contempt for Trump,

331
0:16:28.605,000 --> 0:16:3,000
it's important to say, no, this is a real thing.

332
0:16:30.878,000 --> 0:16:33,000
But as I try my best to go an hour showing respect for him,

333
0:16:34.756,000 --> 0:16:35,000
my thyroid is surging,

334
0:16:36.771,000 --> 0:16:39,000
because I think the oddities of his character

335
0:16:40.167,000 --> 0:16:42,000
really are condemnatory and are going to doom him.

336
0:16:42.672,000 --> 0:16:47,000
CA: Your reputation is as a conservative.

337
0:16:48.154,000 --> 0:16:5,000
People would you describe you as right of center,

338
0:16:50.552,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and yet here you are with this visceral reaction against him

339
0:16:54.809,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and some of what he stands for.

340
0:16:56.459,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I mean, I'm -- how do you have a conversation?

341
0:17:00.11,000 --> 0:17:02,000
The people who support him, on evidence so far,

342
0:17:03.063,000 --> 0:17:05,000
are probably pretty excited.

343
0:17:05.279,000 --> 0:17:1,000
He's certainly shown real engagement

344
0:17:10.461,000 --> 0:17:12,000
in a lot of what he promised to do,

345
0:17:12.601,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and there is a strong desire to change the system radically.

346
0:17:16.726,000 --> 0:17:2,000
People hate what government has become and how it's left them out.

347
0:17:20.88,000 --> 0:17:21,000
GC: I totally agree with that,

348
0:17:22.686,000 --> 0:17:25,000
but I think that when he was proposing a huge government program last night

349
0:17:26.377,000 --> 0:17:3,000
that we used to call the bad s-word, "stimulus," I find it completely ironic.

350
0:17:30.469,000 --> 0:17:32,000
To spend a trillion dollars on something --

351
0:17:32.501,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that is not a conservative viewpoint.

352
0:17:34.3,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Then again, I don't really believe he's a Republican.

353
0:17:36.81,000 --> 0:17:39,000
DB: And I would say, as someone who identifies as conservative:

354
0:17:39.855,000 --> 0:17:4,000
first of all,

355
0:17:41.042,000 --> 0:17:44,000
to be conservative is to believe in the limitations of politics.

356
0:17:44.104,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Samuel Johnson said, "Of all the things that human hearts endure,

357
0:17:47.246,000 --> 0:17:49,000
how few are those that kings can cause and cure."

358
0:17:49.717,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Politics is a limited realm;

359
0:17:51.386,000 --> 0:17:54,000
what matters most is the moral nature of the society.

360
0:17:54.447,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And so I have to think character comes first,

361
0:17:56.64,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and a man who doesn't pass the character threshold

362
0:17:59.037,000 --> 0:18:,000
cannot be a good president.

363
0:18:00.401,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Second, I'm the kind of conservative who --

364
0:18:03.09,000 --> 0:18:05,000
I harken back to Alexander Hamilton,

365
0:18:05.801,000 --> 0:18:07,000
who was a Latino hip-hop star from the heights --

366
0:18:08.155,000 --> 0:18:12,000
(Laughter)

367
0:18:12.254,000 --> 0:18:17,000
but his definition of America was very future-oriented.

368
0:18:17.649,000 --> 0:18:19,000
He was a poor boy from the islands

369
0:18:20.029,000 --> 0:18:24,000
who had this rapid and amazing rise to success,

370
0:18:24.366,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and he wanted government to give poor boys and girls like him

371
0:18:27.343,000 --> 0:18:28,000
a chance to succeed,

372
0:18:28.521,000 --> 0:18:31,000
using limited but energetic government to create social mobility.

373
0:18:31.766,000 --> 0:18:34,000
For him and for Lincoln and for Teddy Roosevelt,

374
0:18:35.374,000 --> 0:18:37,000
the idea of America was the idea of the future.

375
0:18:37.733,000 --> 0:18:39,000
We may have division and racism and slavery in our past,

376
0:18:40.648,000 --> 0:18:41,000
but we have a common future.

377
0:18:42.564,000 --> 0:18:46,000
The definition of America that Steve Bannon stands for is backwards-looking.

378
0:18:46.786,000 --> 0:18:47,000
It's nostalgic; it's for the past.

379
0:18:48.757,000 --> 0:18:5,000
And that is not traditionally the American identity.

380
0:18:51.261,000 --> 0:18:53,000
That's traditionally, frankly, the Russian identity.

381
0:18:53.745,000 --> 0:18:54,000
That's how they define virtue.

382
0:18:55.251,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And so I think it is a fundamental and foundational betrayal

383
0:18:58.128,000 --> 0:18:59,000
of what conservatism used to stand for.

384
0:19:00.081,000 --> 0:19:02,000
CA: Well, I'd like actually like to hear from you,

385
0:19:02.453,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and if we see some comments coming in from some of you, we'll --

386
0:19:05.499,000 --> 0:19:06,000
oh, well here's one right now.

387
0:19:06.995,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried to convince progressive friends

388
0:19:10.159,000 --> 0:19:12,000
that they need to understand what motivates Trump supporters,

389
0:19:13.075,000 --> 0:19:15,000
yet many of them have given up trying to understand

390
0:19:15.516,000 --> 0:19:18,000
in the face of what they perceive as lies, selfishness and hatred.

391
0:19:18.684,000 --> 0:19:21,000
How would you reach out to such people, the Tea Party of the left,

392
0:19:21.893,000 --> 0:19:22,000
to try to bridge this divide?

393
0:19:24.898,000 --> 0:19:27,000
GC: I actually think there are commonalities in anger,

394
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:29,000
as I expressed earlier.

395
0:19:29.462,000 --> 0:19:33,000
So I think you can come to the table, both being passionate about something.

396
0:19:33.916,000 --> 0:19:34,000
So at least you care.

397
0:19:36.255,000 --> 0:19:39,000
And I would like to believe -- the c-word has also become

398
0:19:39.986,000 --> 0:19:41,000
a horrible word -- "compromise," right?

399
0:19:42.586,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So you have the far left and the far right,

400
0:19:44.681,000 --> 0:19:45,000
and compromise -- forget it.

401
0:19:46.088,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Those groups don't want to even think about it.

402
0:19:48.393,000 --> 0:19:51,000
But you have a huge swath of voters, myself included,

403
0:19:51.507,000 --> 0:19:52,000
who are registered independents,

404
0:19:53.259,000 --> 0:19:54,000
like 40 percent of us, right?

405
0:19:55.251,000 --> 0:19:59,000
So there is a huge faction of America that wants to see change

406
0:19:59.576,000 --> 0:20:01,000
and wants to see people come together.

407
0:20:02.234,000 --> 0:20:03,000
It's just that we have to figure out

408
0:20:04.024,000 --> 0:20:05,000
how to do that.

409
0:20:05.459,000 --> 0:20:07,000
CA: So let's talk about that for a minute,

410
0:20:07.601,000 --> 0:20:1,000
because we're having these TED Dialogues, we're trying to bridge.

411
0:20:10.845,000 --> 0:20:13,000
There's a lot of people out there, right now, perhaps especially on the left,

412
0:20:14.545,000 --> 0:20:15,000
who think this is a terrible idea,

413
0:20:16.36,000 --> 0:20:21,000
that actually, the only moral response to the great tyranny

414
0:20:22.323,000 --> 0:20:26,000
that may be about to emerge in America

415
0:20:26.358,000 --> 0:20:29,000
is to resist it at every stage, is to fight it tooth and nail,

416
0:20:30.014,000 --> 0:20:31,000
it's a mistake to try and do this.

417
0:20:31.919,000 --> 0:20:32,000
Just fight!

418
0:20:33.821,000 --> 0:20:35,000
Is there a case for that?

419
0:20:36.19,000 --> 0:20:39,000
DB: It depends what "fight" means. If it means literal fighting, then no.

420
0:20:39.794,000 --> 0:20:42,000
If it means marching, well maybe marching to raise consciousness,

421
0:20:42.942,000 --> 0:20:43,000
that seems fine.

422
0:20:44.231,000 --> 0:20:48,000
But if you want change in this country, we do it through parties and politics.

423
0:20:48.386,000 --> 0:20:52,000
We organize parties, and those parties are big, diverse, messy coalitions,

424
0:20:53.187,000 --> 0:20:54,000
and we engage in politics,

425
0:20:54.829,000 --> 0:20:56,000
and politics is always morally unsatisfying

426
0:20:57.181,000 --> 0:20:59,000
because it's always a bunch of compromises.

427
0:20:59.682,000 --> 0:21:02,000
But politics is essentially a competition between partial truths.

428
0:21:03.488,000 --> 0:21:05,000
The Trump people have a piece of the truth in America.

429
0:21:06.147,000 --> 0:21:09,000
I think Trump himself is the wrong answer to the right question,

430
0:21:09.284,000 --> 0:21:11,000
but they have some truth,

431
0:21:11.319,000 --> 0:21:15,000
and it's truth found in the epidemic of opiates around the country,

432
0:21:15.492,000 --> 0:21:17,000
it's truth found in the spread of loneliness,

433
0:21:18.508,000 --> 0:21:2,000
it's the truth found in people whose lives are inverted.

434
0:21:21.491,000 --> 0:21:23,000
They peaked professionally at age 30,

435
0:21:23.937,000 --> 0:21:25,000
and it's all been downhill since.

436
0:21:25.986,000 --> 0:21:27,000
And so, understanding that doesn't take fighting,

437
0:21:28.524,000 --> 0:21:29,000
it takes conversation and then asking,

438
0:21:30.499,000 --> 0:21:32,000
"What are we going to replace Trump with?"

439
0:21:32.533,000 --> 0:21:34,000
GC: But you saw fighting last night, even at the speech,

440
0:21:35.224,000 --> 0:21:37,000
because you saw the Democratic women who came and wore white

441
0:21:38.116,000 --> 0:21:39,000
to honor the suffragette movement.

442
0:21:39.848,000 --> 0:21:41,000
I remember back during the campaign

443
0:21:41.899,000 --> 0:21:44,000
where some Trump supporters wanted to actually get rid of the amendment

444
0:21:45.412,000 --> 0:21:46,000
that allowed us to vote as women.

445
0:21:47.15,000 --> 0:21:49,000
It was like, what?

446
0:21:49.342,000 --> 0:21:51,000
So I don't know if that's the right way to fight.

447
0:21:51.692,000 --> 0:21:53,000
It was interesting, because I was looking in the audience,

448
0:21:54.524,000 --> 0:21:56,000
trying to see Democratic women who didn't wear white.

449
0:21:57.103,000 --> 0:21:58,000
So there's a lot going on there,

450
0:21:58.677,000 --> 0:22:04,000
and there's a lot of ways to fight that are not necessarily doing that.

451
0:22:05.336,000 --> 0:22:07,000
CA: I mean, one of the key questions, to me, is:

452
0:22:07.834,000 --> 0:22:12,000
The people who voted for Trump but, if you like, are more in the center,

453
0:22:13.507,000 --> 0:22:16,000
like they're possibly amenable to persuasion --

454
0:22:17.113,000 --> 0:22:22,000
are they more likely to be persuaded by seeing a passionate uprising

455
0:22:22.928,000 --> 0:22:25,000
of people saying, "No, no, no, you can't!"

456
0:22:26.465,000 --> 0:22:29,000
or will that actually piss them off and push them away?

457
0:22:30.403,000 --> 0:22:31,000
DB: How are any of us persuaded?

458
0:22:32.075,000 --> 0:22:35,000
Am I going to persuade you by saying, "Well, you're kind of a bigot,

459
0:22:35.426,000 --> 0:22:37,000
you're supporting bigotry, you're supporting sexism.

460
0:22:38.391,000 --> 0:22:42,000
You're a primitive, fascistic rise from some authoritarian past"?

461
0:22:43.043,000 --> 0:22:45,000
That's probably not going to be too persuasive to you.

462
0:22:45.752,000 --> 0:22:47,000
And so the way any of us are persuaded is by:

463
0:22:48.417,000 --> 0:22:52,000
a) some basic show of respect for the point of view, and saying,

464
0:22:52.783,000 --> 0:22:55,000
"I think this guy is not going to get you where you need to go."

465
0:22:56.126,000 --> 0:22:59,000
And there are two phrases you've heard over and over again,

466
0:22:59.53,000 --> 0:23:,000
wherever you go in the country.

467
0:23:01.047,000 --> 0:23:02,000
One, the phrase "flyover country."

468
0:23:02.962,000 --> 0:23:03,000
And that's been heard for years,

469
0:23:04.834,000 --> 0:23:07,000
but I would say this year, I heard it almost on an hourly basis,

470
0:23:08.554,000 --> 0:23:09,000
a sense of feeling invisible.

471
0:23:10.089,000 --> 0:23:13,000
And then the sense a sense of the phrase "political correctness."

472
0:23:13.871,000 --> 0:23:17,000
Just that rebellion: "They're not even letting us say what we think."

473
0:23:17.974,000 --> 0:23:18,000
And I teach at Yale.

474
0:23:19.323,000 --> 0:23:23,000
The narrowing of debate is real.

475
0:23:24.269,000 --> 0:23:27,000
CA: So you would say this is a trap that liberals have fallen into

476
0:23:27.497,000 --> 0:23:3,000
by celebrating causes they really believe in,

477
0:23:30.617,000 --> 0:23:33,000
often expressed through the language of "political correctness."

478
0:23:34.603,000 --> 0:23:38,000
They have done damage. They have pushed people away.

479
0:23:38.962,000 --> 0:23:4,000
DB: I would say a lot of the argument, though,

480
0:23:41.134,000 --> 0:23:43,000
with "descent to fascism," "authoritarianism" --

481
0:23:43.519,000 --> 0:23:45,000
that just feels over-the-top to people.

482
0:23:45.732,000 --> 0:23:47,000
And listen, I've written eight million anti-Trump columns,

483
0:23:48.539,000 --> 0:23:5,000
but it is a problem, especially for the coastal media,

484
0:23:51.233,000 --> 0:23:55,000
that every time he does something slightly wrong, we go to 11,

485
0:23:55.43,000 --> 0:23:57,000
and we're at 11 every day.

486
0:23:57.64,000 --> 0:23:59,000
And it just strains credibility at some point.

487
0:24:00.504,000 --> 0:24:02,000
CA: Crying wolf a little too loud and a little too early.

488
0:24:03.254,000 --> 0:24:05,000
But there may be a time when we really do have to cry wolf.

489
0:24:06.145,000 --> 0:24:08,000
GC: But see -- one of the most important things to me

490
0:24:08.741,000 --> 0:24:1,000
is how the conservative media handles Trump.

491
0:24:12.259,000 --> 0:24:16,000
Will they call him out when things are not true,

492
0:24:16.856,000 --> 0:24:18,000
or will they just go along with it?

493
0:24:19.063,000 --> 0:24:23,000
To me, that is what is essential in this entire discussion,

494
0:24:23.116,000 --> 0:24:27,000
because when you have followers of somebody

495
0:24:27.724,000 --> 0:24:3,000
who don't really care if he tells the truth or not,

496
0:24:31.38,000 --> 0:24:33,000
that can be very dangerous.

497
0:24:33.689,000 --> 0:24:37,000
So to me, it's: How is the conservative media going to respond to it?

498
0:24:37.999,000 --> 0:24:39,000
I mean, you've been calling them out.

499
0:24:40.517,000 --> 0:24:44,000
But how will other forms of conservative media deal with that

500
0:24:44.926,000 --> 0:24:45,000
as we move forward?

501
0:24:46.108,000 --> 0:24:47,000
DB: It's all shifted, though.

502
0:24:47.528,000 --> 0:24:5,000
The conservative media used to be Fox or Charles Krauthammer or George Will.

503
0:24:51.19,000 --> 0:24:53,000
They're no longer the conservative media.

504
0:24:53.218,000 --> 0:24:55,000
Now there's another whole set of institutions further right,

505
0:24:56.073,000 --> 0:25:01,000
which is Breitbart and Infowars, Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham,

506
0:25:01.694,000 --> 0:25:04,000
and so they're the ones who are now his base, not even so much Fox.

507
0:25:05.519,000 --> 0:25:09,000
CA: My last question for the time being is just on this question of the truth.

508
0:25:09.63,000 --> 0:25:11,000
I mean, it's one of the scariest things to people right now,

509
0:25:12.533,000 --> 0:25:15,000
that there is no agreement, nationally, on what is true.

510
0:25:16.24,000 --> 0:25:17,000
I've never seen anything like it,

511
0:25:18.054,000 --> 0:25:21,000
where facts are so massively disputed.

512
0:25:21.415,000 --> 0:25:24,000
Your whole newspaper, sir, is delivering fake news every day.

513
0:25:24.99,000 --> 0:25:25,000
DB: And failing.

514
0:25:26.522,000 --> 0:25:27,000
(Laughter)

515
0:25:27.634,000 --> 0:25:28,000
CA: And failing. My commiserations.

516
0:25:29.614,000 --> 0:25:35,000
But is there any path

517
0:25:35.928,000 --> 0:25:38,000
whereby we can start to get some kind of consensus,

518
0:25:39.762,000 --> 0:25:41,000
to believe the same things?

519
0:25:42.646,000 --> 0:25:45,000
Can online communities play a role here?

520
0:25:46.238,000 --> 0:25:47,000
How do we fix this?

521
0:25:47.431,000 --> 0:25:49,000
GC: See, I understand how that happened.

522
0:25:49.493,000 --> 0:25:51,000
That's another groundswell kind of emotion

523
0:25:51.716,000 --> 0:25:53,000
that was going on in the middle of America

524
0:25:53.755,000 --> 0:25:54,000
and not being heard,

525
0:25:55.012,000 --> 0:25:58,000
in thinking that the mainstream media was biased.

526
0:25:58.067,000 --> 0:26:02,000
There's a difference, though, between being biased and being fake.

527
0:26:02.157,000 --> 0:26:05,000
To me, that is a very important distinction in this conversation.

528
0:26:05.754,000 --> 0:26:09,000
So let's just say that there was some bias in the mainstream media.

529
0:26:10.276,000 --> 0:26:12,000
OK. So there are ways to try and mend that.

530
0:26:13.233,000 --> 0:26:17,000
But what Trump's doing is nuclearizing that and saying,

531
0:26:17.332,000 --> 0:26:19,000
"Look, we're just going to call all of that fake."

532
0:26:19.894,000 --> 0:26:2,000
That's where it gets dangerous.

533
0:26:21.464,000 --> 0:26:23,000
CA: Do you think enough of his supporters

534
0:26:24.349,000 --> 0:26:28,000
have a greater loyalty to the truth than to any ...

535
0:26:28.618,000 --> 0:26:32,000
Like, the principle of not supporting something

536
0:26:33.281,000 --> 0:26:34,000
that is demonstrably not true

537
0:26:35.303,000 --> 0:26:37,000
actually matters, so there will be a correction at some point?

538
0:26:38.288,000 --> 0:26:4,000
DB: I think the truth eventually comes out.

539
0:26:40.602,000 --> 0:26:43,000
So for example, Donald Trump has based a lot of his economic policy

540
0:26:43.782,000 --> 0:26:46,000
on this supposition that Americans have lost manufacturing jobs

541
0:26:46.81,000 --> 0:26:48,000
because they've been stolen by the Chinese.

542
0:26:48.876,000 --> 0:26:5,000
That is maybe 13 percent of the jobs that left.

543
0:26:51.826,000 --> 0:26:54,000
The truth is that 87 percent of the jobs were replaced by technology.

544
0:26:55.432,000 --> 0:26:56,000
That is just the truth.

545
0:26:57.234,000 --> 0:26:59,000
And so as a result, when he says,

546
0:26:59.92,000 --> 0:27:02,000
"I'm going to close TPP and all the jobs will come roaring back,"

547
0:27:03.911,000 --> 0:27:04,000
they will not come roaring back.

548
0:27:05.496,000 --> 0:27:08,000
So that is an actual fact, in my belief.

549
0:27:08.604,000 --> 0:27:09,000
And --

550
0:27:09.786,000 --> 0:27:1,000
(Laughter)

551
0:27:11.109,000 --> 0:27:13,000
GC: But I'm saying what his supporters think is the truth,

552
0:27:13.849,000 --> 0:27:15,000
no matter how many times you might say that,

553
0:27:16.008,000 --> 0:27:17,000
they still believe him.

554
0:27:17.238,000 --> 0:27:2,000
DB: But eventually either jobs will come back or they will not come back,

555
0:27:21.021,000 --> 0:27:24,000
and at that point, either something will work or it doesn't work,

556
0:27:24.14,000 --> 0:27:26,000
and it doesn't work or not work because of great marketing,

557
0:27:26.959,000 --> 0:27:28,000
it works because it actually addresses a real problem

558
0:27:29.528,000 --> 0:27:31,000
and so I happen to think the truth will out.

559
0:27:32.038,000 --> 0:27:35,000
CA: If you've got a question, please raise your hand here.

560
0:27:36.005,000 --> 0:27:38,000
Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.

561
0:27:38.649,000 --> 0:27:4,000
My name's Yael Eisenstat.

562
0:27:41.667,000 --> 0:27:42,000
I hear a lot of this talk

563
0:27:43.302,000 --> 0:27:45,000
about how we all need to start talking to each other more

564
0:27:46.005,000 --> 0:27:47,000
and understanding each other more,

565
0:27:47.705,000 --> 0:27:5,000
and I've even written about this, published on this subject as well,

566
0:27:51.269,000 --> 0:27:56,000
but now today I keep hearing liberals -- yes, I live in New York,

567
0:27:56.403,000 --> 0:27:57,000
I can be considered a liberal --

568
0:27:58.15,000 --> 0:27:59,000
we sit here and self-analyze:

569
0:27:59.873,000 --> 0:28:01,000
What did we do to not understand the Rust Belt?

570
0:28:02.206,000 --> 0:28:04,000
Or: What can we do to understand Middle America better?

571
0:28:05.08,000 --> 0:28:06,000
And what I'd like to know:

572
0:28:06.552,000 --> 0:28:09,000
Have you seen any attempts or conversations from Middle America

573
0:28:10.502,000 --> 0:28:13,000
of what can I do to understand the so-called coastal elites better?

574
0:28:13.743,000 --> 0:28:17,000
Because I'm just offended as being put in a box as a coastal elite

575
0:28:17.77,000 --> 0:28:2,000
as someone in Middle America is as being considered a flyover state

576
0:28:21.018,000 --> 0:28:22,000
and not listened to.

577
0:28:22.519,000 --> 0:28:24,000
CA: There you go, I can hear Facebook cheering as you --

578
0:28:25.286,000 --> 0:28:26,000
(Laughter)

579
0:28:26.41,000 --> 0:28:29,000
DB: I would say -- and this is someone who has been conservative

580
0:28:29.984,000 --> 0:28:3,000
all my adult life --

581
0:28:31.174,000 --> 0:28:32,000
when you grow up conservative,

582
0:28:32.965,000 --> 0:28:33,000
you learn to speak both languages.

583
0:28:35.626,000 --> 0:28:37,000
Because if I'm going to listen to music,

584
0:28:38.054,000 --> 0:28:4,000
I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.

585
0:28:40.196,000 --> 0:28:44,000
So a lot of my favorite rock bands are all on the left.

586
0:28:44.901,000 --> 0:28:45,000
If I'm going to go to a school,

587
0:28:46.463,000 --> 0:28:48,000
I'm going probably to school where the culture is liberal.

588
0:28:49.24,000 --> 0:28:5,000
If I'm going to watch a sitcom

589
0:28:50.871,000 --> 0:28:52,000
or a late-night comedy show, it's going to be liberal.

590
0:28:53.458,000 --> 0:28:56,000
If I'm going to read a good newspaper, it'll be the New York Times.

591
0:28:56.665,000 --> 0:28:58,000
As a result, you learn to speak both languages.

592
0:28:58.955,000 --> 0:29:,000
And that actually, at least for a number of years,

593
0:29:01.863,000 --> 0:29:03,000
when I started at National Review with William F. Buckley,

594
0:29:04.705,000 --> 0:29:05,000
it made us sharper,

595
0:29:06.209,000 --> 0:29:09,000
because we were used to arguing against people every day.

596
0:29:09.86,000 --> 0:29:12,000
The problem now that's happened is you have ghettoization on the right

597
0:29:13.193,000 --> 0:29:15,000
and you can live entirely in rightworld,

598
0:29:15.578,000 --> 0:29:18,000
so as a result, the quality of argument on the right has diminished,

599
0:29:19.073,000 --> 0:29:21,000
because you're not in the other side

600
0:29:21.64,000 --> 0:29:22,000
all the time.

601
0:29:22.917,000 --> 0:29:26,000
But I do think if you're living in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona,

602
0:29:27.893,000 --> 0:29:29,000
the coastal elites make themselves aware to you,

603
0:29:30.252,000 --> 0:29:31,000
so you know that language as well,

604
0:29:31.962,000 --> 0:29:32,000
but it's not the reverse.

605
0:29:33.414,000 --> 0:29:37,000
CA: But what does Middle America not get about coastal elites?

606
0:29:37.669,000 --> 0:29:4,000
So the critique is,

607
0:29:40.733,000 --> 0:29:42,000
you are not dealing with the real problems.

608
0:29:43.519,000 --> 0:29:49,000
There's a feeling of a snobbishness, an elitism that is very off-putting.

609
0:29:50.004,000 --> 0:29:51,000
What are they missing?

610
0:29:51.196,000 --> 0:29:54,000
If you could plant one piece of truth

611
0:29:54.723,000 --> 0:29:59,000
from the mindset of someone in this room, for example,

612
0:29:59.937,000 --> 0:30:01,000
what would you say to them?

613
0:30:02.689,000 --> 0:30:03,000
DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are.

614
0:30:04.628,000 --> 0:30:05,000
(Laughter)

615
0:30:06.255,000 --> 0:30:08,000
No, I reject the category.

616
0:30:08.629,000 --> 0:30:11,000
The problem with populism is the same problem with elitism.

617
0:30:12.137,000 --> 0:30:14,000
It's just a prejudice on the basis

618
0:30:14.459,000 --> 0:30:16,000
of probably an over-generalized social class distinction

619
0:30:17.433,000 --> 0:30:2,000
which is too simplistic to apply in reality.

620
0:30:20.512,000 --> 0:30:22,000
Those of us in New York know there are some people in New York

621
0:30:23.478,000 --> 0:30:25,000
who are completely awesome, and some people who are pathetic,

622
0:30:26.429,000 --> 0:30:29,000
and if you live in Iowa, some people are awesome and some people are pathetic.

623
0:30:30.187,000 --> 0:30:32,000
It's not a question of what degree you have

624
0:30:32.279,000 --> 0:30:34,000
or where you happen to live in the country.

625
0:30:34.351,000 --> 0:30:37,000
The distinction is just a crude simplification to arouse political power.

626
0:30:37.849,000 --> 0:30:41,000
GC: But I would encourage people to watch a television news show

627
0:30:42.458,000 --> 0:30:44,000
or read a column that they normally wouldn't.

628
0:30:46.041,000 --> 0:30:51,000
So if you are a Trump supporter, watch the other side for a day,

629
0:30:51.091,000 --> 0:30:53,000
because you need to come out of the bubble

630
0:30:53.136,000 --> 0:30:55,000
if you're ever going to have a conversation.

631
0:30:55.262,000 --> 0:30:57,000
And both sides -- so if you're a liberal,

632
0:30:57.9,000 --> 0:30:59,000
then watch something that's very conservative.

633
0:31:00.755,000 --> 0:31:03,000
Read a column that is not something you would normally read,

634
0:31:04.427,000 --> 0:31:07,000
because then you gain perspective of what the other side is thinking,

635
0:31:07.741,000 --> 0:31:09,000
and to me, that's a start of coming together.

636
0:31:10.225,000 --> 0:31:12,000
I worry about the same thing you worry about, these bubbles.

637
0:31:13.09,000 --> 0:31:15,000
I think if you only watch certain entities,

638
0:31:15.134,000 --> 0:31:17,000
you have no idea what the rest of the world is talking about.

639
0:31:18.089,000 --> 0:31:2,000
DB: I think not only watching,

640
0:31:20.622,000 --> 0:31:23,000
being part of an organization that meets at least once a month

641
0:31:23.66,000 --> 0:31:26,000
that puts you in direct contact with people completely unlike yourself

642
0:31:27.014,000 --> 0:31:29,000
is something we all have a responsibility for.

643
0:31:29.189,000 --> 0:31:3,000
I may get this a little wrong,

644
0:31:30.68,000 --> 0:31:33,000
but I think of the top-selling automotive models in this country,

645
0:31:33.949,000 --> 0:31:36,000
I think the top three or four are all pickup trucks.

646
0:31:37.295,000 --> 0:31:4,000
So ask yourself: How many people do I know who own a pickup truck?

647
0:31:41.131,000 --> 0:31:44,000
And it could be very few or zero for a lot of people.

648
0:31:44.584,000 --> 0:31:46,000
And that's sort of a warning sign kind of a problem.

649
0:31:47.562,000 --> 0:31:48,000
Where can I join a club

650
0:31:49.335,000 --> 0:31:52,000
where I'll have a lot in common with a person who drives a pickup truck

651
0:31:52.773,000 --> 0:31:54,000
because we have a common interest in whatever?

652
0:31:54.972,000 --> 0:31:56,000
CA: And so the internet is definitely contributing to this.

653
0:31:57.808,000 --> 0:31:59,000
A question here from Chris Ajemian:

654
0:31:59.985,000 --> 0:32:01,000
"How do you feel structure of communications,

655
0:32:02.134,000 --> 0:32:05,000
especially the prevalence of social media and individualized content,

656
0:32:05.888,000 --> 0:32:07,000
can be used to bring together a political divide,

657
0:32:08.382,000 --> 0:32:11,000
instead of just filing communities into echo chambers?"

658
0:32:11.641,000 --> 0:32:15,000
I mean, it looks like Facebook and Google, since the election,

659
0:32:16.114,000 --> 0:32:17,000
are working hard on this question.

660
0:32:17.817,000 --> 0:32:2,000
They're trying to change the algorithms

661
0:32:21.659,000 --> 0:32:24,000
so that they don't amplify fake news

662
0:32:25.322,000 --> 0:32:27,000
to the extent that it happened last time round.

663
0:32:27.752,000 --> 0:32:29,000
Do you see any other promising signs of ...?

664
0:32:3,000 --> 0:32:32,000
GC: ... or amplify one side of the equation.

665
0:32:32.127,000 --> 0:32:33,000
CA: Exactly.

666
0:32:33.302,000 --> 0:32:37,000
GC: I think that was the constant argument from the right,

667
0:32:37.691,000 --> 0:32:39,000
that social media and the internet in general

668
0:32:40.285,000 --> 0:32:43,000
was putting articles towards the top that were not their worldview.

669
0:32:44.131,000 --> 0:32:46,000
I think, again, that fed into the anger.

670
0:32:47.097,000 --> 0:32:48,000
It fed into the anger of:

671
0:32:48.656,000 --> 0:32:5,000
"You're pushing something that's not what I believe."

672
0:32:51.46,000 --> 0:32:53,000
But social media has obviously changed everything,

673
0:32:53.904,000 --> 0:32:57,000
and I think Trump is the example of Twitter changing absolutely everything.

674
0:32:58.305,000 --> 0:33:,000
And from his point of view,

675
0:33:00.332,000 --> 0:33:04,000
he's reaching the American people without a filter,

676
0:33:04.653,000 --> 0:33:06,000
which he believes the media is.

677
0:33:09.185,000 --> 0:33:11,000
CA: Question from the audience.

678
0:33:12.318,000 --> 0:33:13,000
Destiny: Hi. I'm Destiny.

679
0:33:14.167,000 --> 0:33:18,000
I have a question regarding political correctness, and I'm curious:

680
0:33:18.521,000 --> 0:33:22,000
When did political correctness become synonymous with silencing,

681
0:33:23.215,000 --> 0:33:28,000
versus a way that we speak about other people

682
0:33:28.354,000 --> 0:33:31,000
to show them respect and preserve their dignity?

683
0:33:31.517,000 --> 0:33:34,000
GC: Well, I think the conservative media really pounded this issue

684
0:33:34.929,000 --> 0:33:35,000
for the last 10 years.

685
0:33:36.817,000 --> 0:33:39,000
I think that they really, really spent a lot of time

686
0:33:40.202,000 --> 0:33:41,000
talking about political correctness,

687
0:33:42.032,000 --> 0:33:45,000
and how people should have the ability to say what they think.

688
0:33:45.459,000 --> 0:33:47,000
Another reason why Trump became so popular:

689
0:33:47.653,000 --> 0:33:48,000
because he says what he thinks.

690
0:33:49.555,000 --> 0:33:53,000
It also makes me think about the fact

691
0:33:55.576,000 --> 0:33:58,000
that I do believe there are a lot of people in America

692
0:33:58.635,000 --> 0:34:01,000
who agree with Steve Bannon,

693
0:34:02.551,000 --> 0:34:03,000
but they would never say it publicly,

694
0:34:04.514,000 --> 0:34:07,000
and so voting for Trump gave them the opportunity

695
0:34:07.622,000 --> 0:34:08,000
to agree with it silently.

696
0:34:10.636,000 --> 0:34:14,000
DB: On the issue of immigration, it's a legitimate point of view

697
0:34:15.624,000 --> 0:34:17,000
that we have too many immigrants in the country,

698
0:34:18.075,000 --> 0:34:19,000
that it's economically costly.

699
0:34:19.565,000 --> 0:34:2,000
CA: That we have too many --

700
0:34:20.945,000 --> 0:34:22,000
DB: Immigrants in the country, especially from Britain.

701
0:34:23.578,000 --> 0:34:24,000
(Laughter)

702
0:34:24.776,000 --> 0:34:26,000
GC: I kind of like the British accent, OK?

703
0:34:27.55,000 --> 0:34:29,000
CA: I apologize. America, I am sorry.

704
0:34:29.921,000 --> 0:34:3,000
(Laughter)

705
0:34:31.6,000 --> 0:34:32,000
I'll go now.

706
0:34:33.341,000 --> 0:34:38,000
DB: But it became sort of impermissible to say that,

707
0:34:39.289,000 --> 0:34:42,000
because it was a sign that somehow you must be a bigot of some sort.

708
0:34:42.758,000 --> 0:34:45,000
So the political correctness was not only cracking down on speech

709
0:34:46.733,000 --> 0:34:48,000
that we would all find completely offensive,

710
0:34:48.98,000 --> 0:34:5,000
it was cracking down on some speech that was legitimate,

711
0:34:51.786,000 --> 0:34:55,000
and then it was turning speech and thought into action

712
0:34:56.358,000 --> 0:34:58,000
and treating it as a crime,

713
0:34:58.442,000 --> 0:35:,000
and people getting fired and people thrown out of schools,

714
0:35:01.386,000 --> 0:35:02,000
and there were speech codes written.

715
0:35:03.152,000 --> 0:35:04,000
Now there are these diversity teams,

716
0:35:04.97,000 --> 0:35:06,000
where if you say something that somebody finds offensive,

717
0:35:07.674,000 --> 0:35:1,000
like, "Smoking is really dangerous," you can say "You're insulting my group,"

718
0:35:11.394,000 --> 0:35:14,000
and the team from the administration will come down into your dorm room

719
0:35:14.956,000 --> 0:35:16,000
and put thought police upon you.

720
0:35:17.521,000 --> 0:35:22,000
And so there has been a genuine narrowing of what is permissible to say.

721
0:35:22.734,000 --> 0:35:23,000
And some of it is legitimate.

722
0:35:24.626,000 --> 0:35:29,000
There are certain words that there should be some social sanction against,

723
0:35:30.013,000 --> 0:35:32,000
but some of it was used to enforce a political agenda.

724
0:35:33.011,000 --> 0:35:34,000
CA: So is that a project

725
0:35:34.248,000 --> 0:35:36,000
you would urge on liberals, if you like -- progressives --

726
0:35:37.252,000 --> 0:35:41,000
to rethink the ground rules around political correctness

727
0:35:42.193,000 --> 0:35:47,000
and accept a little more uncomfortable language

728
0:35:47.912,000 --> 0:35:49,000
in certain circumstances?

729
0:35:50.77,000 --> 0:35:51,000
Can you see that being solved

730
0:35:52.528,000 --> 0:35:56,000
to an extent that others won't be so offended?

731
0:35:56.755,000 --> 0:35:59,000
DB: I mean, most American universities, especially elite universities,

732
0:36:00.103,000 --> 0:36:01,000
are overwhelmingly on the left,

733
0:36:01.66,000 --> 0:36:02,000
and there's just an ease of temptation

734
0:36:03.546,000 --> 0:36:07,000
to use your overwhelming cultural power to try to enforce some sort of thought

735
0:36:07.763,000 --> 0:36:09,000
that you think is right and correct thought.

736
0:36:10.076,000 --> 0:36:13,000
So, be a little more self-suspicious of, are we doing that?

737
0:36:13.303,000 --> 0:36:16,000
And second, my university, the University of Chicago,

738
0:36:16.803,000 --> 0:36:18,000
sent out this letter saying, we will have no safe spaces.

739
0:36:19.557,000 --> 0:36:21,000
There will be no critique of micro-aggression.

740
0:36:21.991,000 --> 0:36:24,000
If you get your feelings hurt, well, welcome to the world of education.

741
0:36:25.476,000 --> 0:36:26,000
I do think that policy --

742
0:36:26.914,000 --> 0:36:29,000
which is being embraced by a lot of people on the left, by the way --

743
0:36:30.272,000 --> 0:36:32,000
is just a corrective to what's happened.

744
0:36:32.462,000 --> 0:36:34,000
CA: So here's a question from Karen Holloway:

745
0:36:34.595,000 --> 0:36:36,000
How do we foster an American culture

746
0:36:36.949,000 --> 0:36:38,000
that's forward-looking, like Hamilton,

747
0:36:39.497,000 --> 0:36:41,000
that expects and deals with change,

748
0:36:42.049,000 --> 0:36:45,000
rather than wanting to have everything go back to some fictional past?

749
0:36:46.924,000 --> 0:36:47,000
That's an easy question, right?

750
0:36:48.526,000 --> 0:36:5,000
GC: Well, I'm still a believer in the American dream,

751
0:36:51.141,000 --> 0:36:54,000
and I think what we can teach our children is the basics,

752
0:36:54.599,000 --> 0:36:57,000
which is that hard work

753
0:36:58.02,000 --> 0:37:,000
and believing in yourself

754
0:37:01.417,000 --> 0:37:03,000
in America, you can achieve whatever you want.

755
0:37:03.661,000 --> 0:37:04,000
I was told that every single day.

756
0:37:05.346,000 --> 0:37:09,000
When I got in the real world, I was like, wow, that's maybe not always so true.

757
0:37:09.401,000 --> 0:37:1,000
But I still believe in that.

758
0:37:11.096,000 --> 0:37:12,000
Maybe I'm being too optimistic.

759
0:37:12.693,000 --> 0:37:15,000
So I still look towards the future for that to continue.

760
0:37:16.928,000 --> 0:37:18,000
DB: I think you're being too optimistic.

761
0:37:19.114,000 --> 0:37:2,000
GC: You do?

762
0:37:20.296,000 --> 0:37:24,000
DB: The odds of an American young person exceeding their parents' salary --

763
0:37:24.352,000 --> 0:37:26,000
a generation ago, like 86 percent did it.

764
0:37:26.913,000 --> 0:37:27,000
Now 51 percent do it.

765
0:37:28.696,000 --> 0:37:31,000
There's just been a problem in social mobility in the country.

766
0:37:31.988,000 --> 0:37:35,000
CA: You've written that this entire century has basically been a disaster,

767
0:37:36.841,000 --> 0:37:41,000
that the age of sunny growth is over and we're in deep trouble.

768
0:37:42.498,000 --> 0:37:46,000
DB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged, in real terms, population-adjusted,

769
0:37:46.981,000 --> 0:37:48,000
two or three percent growth for 50 years,

770
0:37:49.125,000 --> 0:37:51,000
and now we've had less than one percent growth.

771
0:37:51.693,000 --> 0:37:53,000
And so there's something seeping out.

772
0:37:54.216,000 --> 0:37:58,000
And so if I'm going to tell people that they should take risks,

773
0:37:58.813,000 --> 0:38:01,000
one of the things we're seeing is a rapid decline in mobility,

774
0:38:01.884,000 --> 0:38:04,000
the number of people who are moving across state lines,

775
0:38:05.277,000 --> 0:38:08,000
and that's especially true among millennials.

776
0:38:08.316,000 --> 0:38:09,000
It's young people that are moving less.

777
0:38:10.23,000 --> 0:38:13,000
So how do we give people the security from which they can take risk?

778
0:38:14.155,000 --> 0:38:17,000
And I'm a big believer in attachment theory of raising children,

779
0:38:17.761,000 --> 0:38:19,000
and attachment theory is based on the motto

780
0:38:20.369,000 --> 0:38:24,000
that all of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base.

781
0:38:25.399,000 --> 0:38:27,000
Have you parents given you a secure base?

782
0:38:27.796,000 --> 0:38:29,000
And as a society, we do not have a secure base,

783
0:38:30.193,000 --> 0:38:34,000
and we won't get to that "Hamilton," risk-taking, energetic ethos

784
0:38:34.605,000 --> 0:38:36,000
until we can supply a secure base.

785
0:38:37.086,000 --> 0:38:4,000
CA: So I wonder whether there's ground here

786
0:38:40.509,000 --> 0:38:44,000
to create almost like a shared agenda, a bridging conversation,

787
0:38:45.29,000 --> 0:38:5,000
on the one hand recognizing that there is this really deep problem

788
0:38:50.66,000 --> 0:38:52,000
that the system, the economic system that we built,

789
0:38:53.189,000 --> 0:38:55,000
seems to be misfiring right now.

790
0:38:57.064,000 --> 0:39:02,000
Second, that maybe, if you're right that it's not all about immigrants,

791
0:39:02.458,000 --> 0:39:03,000
it's probably more about technology,

792
0:39:04.44,000 --> 0:39:06,000
if you could win that argument,

793
0:39:06.488,000 --> 0:39:11,000
that de-emphasizes what seems to me the single most divisive territory

794
0:39:11.681,000 --> 0:39:15,000
between Trump supporters and others, which is around the role of the other.

795
0:39:15.759,000 --> 0:39:19,000
It's very offensive to people on the left to have the other demonized

796
0:39:19.833,000 --> 0:39:21,000
to the extent that the other seems to be demonized.

797
0:39:22.562,000 --> 0:39:24,000
That feels deeply immoral,

798
0:39:25.164,000 --> 0:39:27,000
and maybe people on the left could agree, as you said,

799
0:39:28.058,000 --> 0:39:3,000
that immigration may have happened too fast,

800
0:39:30.943,000 --> 0:39:34,000
and there is a limit beyond which human societies struggle,

801
0:39:35.544,000 --> 0:39:39,000
but nonetheless this whole problem becomes de-emphasized

802
0:39:39.657,000 --> 0:39:41,000
if automation is the key issue,

803
0:39:41.816,000 --> 0:39:43,000
and then we try to work together on recognizing that it's real,

804
0:39:44.794,000 --> 0:39:47,000
recognizing that the problem probably wasn't properly addressed

805
0:39:47.947,000 --> 0:39:48,000
or seen or heard,

806
0:39:49.317,000 --> 0:39:52,000
and try to figure out how to rebuild communities

807
0:39:52.65,000 --> 0:39:54,000
using, well, using what?

808
0:39:54.682,000 --> 0:39:58,000
That seems to me to become the fertile conversation of the future:

809
0:39:58.742,000 --> 0:40:01,000
How do we rebuild communities in this modern age,

810
0:40:01.886,000 --> 0:40:03,000
with technology doing what it's doing,

811
0:40:04.242,000 --> 0:40:06,000
and reimagine this bright future?

812
0:40:06.461,000 --> 0:40:08,000
GC: That's why I go back to optimism.

813
0:40:08.588,000 --> 0:40:11,000
I'm not being ... it's not like I'm not looking at the facts,

814
0:40:12.487,000 --> 0:40:14,000
where we've come or where we've come from.

815
0:40:14.949,000 --> 0:40:17,000
But for gosh sakes, if we don't look at it from an optimistic point of view --

816
0:40:18.96,000 --> 0:40:19,000
I'm refusing to do that just yet.

817
0:40:20.688,000 --> 0:40:24,000
I'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old to say, "Look, the world is dim."

818
0:40:24.926,000 --> 0:40:26,000
CA; We're going to have one more question from the room here.

819
0:40:27.946,000 --> 0:40:3,000
Questioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry.

820
0:40:31.636,000 --> 0:40:34,000
You both mentioned the infrastructure plan and Russia

821
0:40:35.164,000 --> 0:40:4,000
and some other things that wouldn't be traditional Republican priorities.

822
0:40:40.553,000 --> 0:40:46,000
What do you think, or when, will Republicans be motivated

823
0:40:47.146,000 --> 0:40:5,000
to take a stand against Trumpism?

824
0:40:51.559,000 --> 0:40:53,000
GC: After last night, not for a while.

825
0:40:54.506,000 --> 0:40:56,000
He changed a lot last night, I believe.

826
0:40:56.88,000 --> 0:40:59,000
DB: His popularity among Republicans -- he's got 85 percent approval,

827
0:41:00.555,000 --> 0:41:02,000
which is higher than Reagan had at this time,

828
0:41:02.799,000 --> 0:41:04,000
and that's because society has just gotten more polarized.

829
0:41:05.739,000 --> 0:41:07,000
So people follow the party much more than they used to.

830
0:41:08.412,000 --> 0:41:11,000
So if you're waiting for Paul Ryan and the Republicans in Congress

831
0:41:11.592,000 --> 0:41:12,000
to flake away,

832
0:41:12.775,000 --> 0:41:13,000
it's going to take a little while.

833
0:41:14.448,000 --> 0:41:17,000
GC: But also because they're all concerned about reelection,

834
0:41:17.954,000 --> 0:41:2,000
and Trump has so much power with getting people either for you

835
0:41:21.673,000 --> 0:41:22,000
or against you,

836
0:41:23.138,000 --> 0:41:25,000
and so, they're vacillating every day, probably:

837
0:41:25.5,000 --> 0:41:27,000
"Well, should I go against or should I not?"

838
0:41:27.64,000 --> 0:41:3,000
But last night, where he finally sounded presidential,

839
0:41:31.163,000 --> 0:41:34,000
I think most Republicans are breathing a sigh of relief today.

840
0:41:34.919,000 --> 0:41:36,000
DB: The half-life of that is short.

841
0:41:37.233,000 --> 0:41:4,000
GC: Right -- I was just going to say, until Twitter happens again.

842
0:41:40.512,000 --> 0:41:43,000
CA: OK, I want to give each of you the chance

843
0:41:43.604,000 --> 0:41:46,000
to imagine you're speaking to -- I don't know --

844
0:41:47.455,000 --> 0:41:48,000
the people online who are watching this,

845
0:41:49.43,000 --> 0:41:5,000
who may be Trump supporters,

846
0:41:51,000 --> 0:41:54,000
who may be on the left, somewhere in the middle.

847
0:41:54.649,000 --> 0:42:,000
How would you advise them to bridge or to relate to other people?

848
0:42:01.468,000 --> 0:42:05,000
Can you share any final wisdom on this?

849
0:42:05.641,000 --> 0:42:08,000
Or if you think that they shouldn't, tell them that as well.

850
0:42:09.439,000 --> 0:42:1,000
GC: I would just start by saying

851
0:42:11.099,000 --> 0:42:15,000
that I really think any change and coming together starts from the top,

852
0:42:15.434,000 --> 0:42:16,000
just like any other organization.

853
0:42:18.534,000 --> 0:42:2,000
And I would love if, somehow,

854
0:42:21.436,000 --> 0:42:25,000
Trump supporters or people on the left could encourage their leaders

855
0:42:26.023,000 --> 0:42:28,000
to show that compassion from the top,

856
0:42:28.599,000 --> 0:42:31,000
because imagine the change that we could have

857
0:42:32.297,000 --> 0:42:34,000
if Donald Trump tweeted out today,

858
0:42:34.449,000 --> 0:42:35,000
to all of his supporters,

859
0:42:36.134,000 --> 0:42:38,000
"Let's not be vile anymore to each other.

860
0:42:38.818,000 --> 0:42:39,000
Let's have more understanding.

861
0:42:40.516,000 --> 0:42:42,000
As a leader, I'm going to be more inclusive

862
0:42:43.37,000 --> 0:42:44,000
to all of the people of America."

863
0:42:46.212,000 --> 0:42:48,000
To me, it starts at the top.

864
0:42:48.329,000 --> 0:42:51,000
Is he going to do that? I have no idea.

865
0:42:51.73,000 --> 0:42:53,000
But I think that everything starts from the top,

866
0:42:54.454,000 --> 0:42:55,000
and the power that he has

867
0:42:56.207,000 --> 0:42:58,000
in encouraging his supporters

868
0:42:59.22,000 --> 0:43:02,000
to have an understanding of where people are coming from on the other side.

869
0:43:04.317,000 --> 0:43:06,000
CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say

870
0:43:06.84,000 --> 0:43:08,000
I don't think we can teach each other to be civil,

871
0:43:09.606,000 --> 0:43:1,000
and give us sermons on civility.

872
0:43:11.373,000 --> 0:43:12,000
That's not going to do it.

873
0:43:12.641,000 --> 0:43:13,000
It's substance and how we act,

874
0:43:14.349,000 --> 0:43:17,000
and the nice thing about Donald Trump is he smashed our categories.

875
0:43:17.992,000 --> 0:43:21,000
All the categories that we thought we were thinking in, they're obsolete.

876
0:43:22.138,000 --> 0:43:25,000
They were great for the 20th century. They're not good for today.

877
0:43:25.244,000 --> 0:43:28,000
He's got an agenda which is about closing borders and closing trade.

878
0:43:28.499,000 --> 0:43:29,000
I just don't think it's going to work.

879
0:43:30.348,000 --> 0:43:32,000
I think if we want to rebuild communities, recreate jobs,

880
0:43:33.193,000 --> 0:43:34,000
we need a different set of agenda

881
0:43:34.871,000 --> 0:43:37,000
that smashes through all our current divisions and our current categories.

882
0:43:38.466,000 --> 0:43:41,000
For me, that agenda is Reaganism on macroeconomic policy,

883
0:43:42.006,000 --> 0:43:44,000
Sweden on welfare policy

884
0:43:44.2,000 --> 0:43:46,000
and cuts across right and left.

885
0:43:46.426,000 --> 0:43:48,000
I think we have to have a dynamic economy that creates growth.

886
0:43:49.387,000 --> 0:43:5,000
That's the Reagan on economic policy.

887
0:43:51.244,000 --> 0:43:52,000
But people have to have that secure base.

888
0:43:53.233,000 --> 0:43:55,000
There have to be nurse-family partnerships;

889
0:43:55.308,000 --> 0:43:56,000
there has to be universal preschool;

890
0:43:57.11,000 --> 0:43:58,000
there have to be charter schools;

891
0:43:59.129,000 --> 0:44:01,000
there have to be college programs with wraparound programs

892
0:44:02.121,000 --> 0:44:03,000
for parents and communities.

893
0:44:03.626,000 --> 0:44:07,000
We need to help heal the crisis of social solidarity in this country

894
0:44:08.646,000 --> 0:44:09,000
and help heal families,

895
0:44:10.166,000 --> 0:44:12,000
and government just has to get a lot more involved

896
0:44:12.524,000 --> 0:44:15,000
in the way liberals like to rebuild communities.

897
0:44:16.211,000 --> 0:44:19,000
At the other hand, we have to have an economy that's free and open

898
0:44:19.457,000 --> 0:44:2,000
the way conservatives used to like.

899
0:44:21.407,000 --> 0:44:24,000
And so getting the substance right is how you smash through

900
0:44:24.489,000 --> 0:44:25,000
the partisan identities,

901
0:44:25.905,000 --> 0:44:28,000
because the substance is what ultimately shapes our polarization.

902
0:44:30.572,000 --> 0:44:31,000
CA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much

903
0:44:32.565,000 --> 0:44:34,000
for an absolutely fascinating conversation.

904
0:44:34.724,000 --> 0:44:37,000
Thank you. That was really, really interesting.

905
0:44:37.885,000 --> 0:44:4,000
(Applause)

906
0:44:41.232,000 --> 0:44:45,000
Hey, let's keep the conversation going.

907
0:44:45.524,000 --> 0:44:47,000
We're continuing to try and figure out

908
0:44:47.665,000 --> 0:44:48,000
whether we can add something here,

909
0:44:49.325,000 --> 0:44:51,000
so keep the conversation going on Facebook.

910
0:44:51.39,000 --> 0:44:54,000
Give us your thoughts from whatever part of the political spectrum you're on,

911
0:44:55.104,000 --> 0:44:57,000
and actually, wherever in the world you are.

912
0:44:57.189,000 --> 0:44:59,000
This is not just about America. It's about the world, too.

913
0:45:01.296,000 --> 0:45:03,000
But we're not going to end today without music,

914
0:45:03.654,000 --> 0:45:07,000
because if we put music in every political conversation,

915
0:45:08.47,000 --> 0:45:1,000
the world would be completely different, frankly.

916
0:45:10.932,000 --> 0:45:11,000
It just would.

917
0:45:12.734,000 --> 0:45:14,000
(Applause)

918
0:45:15.365,000 --> 0:45:17,000
Up in Harlem, this extraordinary woman,

919
0:45:17.479,000 --> 0:45:19,000
Vy Higginsen, who's actually right here --

920
0:45:19.928,000 --> 0:45:2,000
let's get a shot of her.

921
0:45:21.193,000 --> 0:45:24,000
(Applause)

922
0:45:24.586,000 --> 0:45:28,000
She created this program that brings teens together,

923
0:45:28.893,000 --> 0:45:31,000
teaches them the joy and the impact of gospel music,

924
0:45:32.361,000 --> 0:45:35,000
and hundreds of teens have gone through this program.

925
0:45:36.364,000 --> 0:45:37,000
It's transformative for them.

926
0:45:37.907,000 --> 0:45:39,000
The music they made, as you already heard,

927
0:45:40.119,000 --> 0:45:41,000
is extraordinary,

928
0:45:41.449,000 --> 0:45:45,000
and I can't think of a better way of ending this TED Dialogue

929
0:45:45.847,000 --> 0:45:48,000
than welcoming Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir from Harlem.

930
0:45:49.678,000 --> 0:45:5,000
Thank you.

931
0:45:50.879,000 --> 0:45:53,000
(Applause)

932
0:46:10.708,000 --> 0:46:14,000
(Singing) Choir: O beautiful for spacious skies

933
0:46:15.366,000 --> 0:46:19,000
For amber waves of grain

934
0:46:20.322,000 --> 0:46:24,000
For purple mountain majesties

935
0:46:25.07,000 --> 0:46:29,000
Above the fruited plain

936
0:46:29.8,000 --> 0:46:31,000
America!

937
0:46:34.469,000 --> 0:46:36,000
America!

938
0:46:39.002,000 --> 0:46:41,000
America!

939
0:46:42.366,000 --> 0:46:45,000
America!

940
0:46:48.138,000 --> 0:46:52,000
God shed his grace on thee

941
0:46:52.814,000 --> 0:46:56,000
And crown thy good with brotherhood

942
0:46:57.253,000 --> 0:47:03,000
From sea to shining sea

943
0:47:11.468,000 --> 0:47:17,000
From sea to shining sea

944
0:47:25.237,000 --> 0:47:31,000
(Applause)

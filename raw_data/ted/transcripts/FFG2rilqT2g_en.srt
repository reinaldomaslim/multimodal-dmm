1
0:00:16.831,000 --> 0:00:19,000
George and Charlotte Blonsky, who were

2
0:00:20.237,000 --> 0:00:23,000
a married couple living in the Bronx in New York City,

3
0:00:23.609,000 --> 0:00:24,000
invented something.

4
0:00:24.854,000 --> 0:00:27,000
They got a patent in 1965 for what they call,

5
0:00:28.833,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"a device to assist women in giving birth."

6
0:00:34.508,000 --> 0:00:37,000
This device consists of a large, round table

7
0:00:38.438,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and some machinery.

8
0:00:40.191,000 --> 0:00:43,000
When the woman is ready to deliver her child,

9
0:00:43.4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
she lies on her back,

10
0:00:44.801,000 --> 0:00:46,000
she is strapped down to the table,

11
0:00:47.232,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and the table is rotated at high speed.

12
0:00:50.311,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The child comes flying out

13
0:00:53.736,000 --> 0:01:,000
through centrifugal force.

14
0:01:01.717,000 --> 0:01:05,000
If you look at their patent carefully,

15
0:01:06.246,000 --> 0:01:09,000
especially if you have any engineering background or talent,

16
0:01:10.115,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you may decide that you see

17
0:01:11.574,000 --> 0:01:17,000
one or two points where the design is not perfectly adequate. (Laughter)

18
0:01:18.261,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Doctor Ivan Schwab in California

19
0:01:21.03,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is one of the people, one of the main people,

20
0:01:22.984,000 --> 0:01:23,000
who helped answer the question,

21
0:01:24.57,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?"

22
0:01:30.281,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And it turns out the answer to that

23
0:01:31.498,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is because their brains

24
0:01:33.722,000 --> 0:01:34,000
are packaged inside their skulls

25
0:01:35.493,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in a way different from the way

26
0:01:37.993,000 --> 0:01:39,000
our brains, we being human beings,

27
0:01:40.497,000 --> 0:01:43,000
true, have our brains packaged.

28
0:01:44.456,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They, the woodpeckers, typically

29
0:01:46.839,000 --> 0:01:48,000
will peck, they will bang their head

30
0:01:49.027,000 --> 0:01:54,000
on a piece of wood thousands of times every day. Every day!

31
0:01:54.318,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And as far as anyone knows,

32
0:01:56.231,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that doesn't bother them in the slightest.

33
0:01:57.437,000 --> 0:01:59,000
How does this happen?

34
0:01:59.703,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Their brain does not slosh around like ours does.

35
0:02:02.629,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Their brain is packed in very tightly,

36
0:02:05.341,000 --> 0:02:07,000
at least for blows coming right from the front.

37
0:02:08.197,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Not too many people paid attention

38
0:02:10.14,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to this research until the last few years

39
0:02:13.224,000 --> 0:02:15,000
when, in this country especially,

40
0:02:15.839,000 --> 0:02:16,000
people are becoming curious about

41
0:02:17.227,000 --> 0:02:19,000
what happens to the brains of football players

42
0:02:19.422,000 --> 0:02:21,000
who bang their heads repeatedly.

43
0:02:22.15,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And the woodpecker maybe relates to that.

44
0:02:27.218,000 --> 0:02:29,000
There was a paper published

45
0:02:29.311,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in the medical journal The Lancet

46
0:02:31.056,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in England a few years ago called

47
0:02:32.486,000 --> 0:02:39,000
" A man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for 5 years."

48
0:02:39.903,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Dr. Caroline Mills and her team

49
0:02:41.711,000 --> 0:02:45,000
received this patient and didn't really know what to do about it.

50
0:02:45.81,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The man had cut his finger,

51
0:02:47.67,000 --> 0:02:5,000
he worked processing chickens,

52
0:02:51.143,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and then he started to smell really, really bad.

53
0:02:53.579,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So bad that when he got in a room

54
0:02:54.798,000 --> 0:02:55,000
with the doctors and the nurses,

55
0:02:56.115,000 --> 0:02:58,000
they couldn't stand being in the room with him.

56
0:02:58.874,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It was intolerable.

57
0:03:00.675,000 --> 0:03:01,000
They tried every drug,

58
0:03:02.174,000 --> 0:03:03,000
every other treatment they could think of.

59
0:03:03.992,000 --> 0:03:05,000
After a year, he still smelled putrid.

60
0:03:06.223,000 --> 0:03:07,000
After two years, still smelled putrid.

61
0:03:08.032,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Three years, four years, still smelled putrid.

62
0:03:11.262,000 --> 0:03:14,000
After five years, it went away on its own.

63
0:03:14.299,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It's a mystery.

64
0:03:17.998,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin

65
0:03:20.347,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and her team tested an old tradition in her city.

66
0:03:25.909,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They live in a city that has huge hills,

67
0:03:28.636,000 --> 0:03:29,000
San Francisco-grade hills.

68
0:03:30.255,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And in the winter there, it gets very cold

69
0:03:32.372,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and very icy.

70
0:03:33.556,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There are lots of injuries.

71
0:03:35.15,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The tradition that they tested,

72
0:03:37.415,000 --> 0:03:38,000
they tested by asking people

73
0:03:39.047,000 --> 0:03:41,000
who were on their way to work in the morning,

74
0:03:41.446,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to stop and try something out.

75
0:03:43.389,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Try one of two conditions.

76
0:03:45.392,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The tradition is that in the winter,

77
0:03:48.145,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in that city, you wear your socks on the outside of your boots.

78
0:03:52.861,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And what they discovered by experiment,

79
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and it was quite graphic when they saw it,

80
0:03:58.429,000 --> 0:03:59,000
was that it's true.

81
0:03:59.844,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That if you wear your socks on the outside rather than the inside,

82
0:04:03.163,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you're much more likely to survive and not slip and fall.

83
0:04:08.516,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, I hope you will agree with me that these things

84
0:04:13.894,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I've just described to you,

85
0:04:16.109,000 --> 0:04:22,000
each of them, deserves some kind of prize. (Laughter)

86
0:04:22.289,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And that's what they got,

87
0:04:23.924,000 --> 0:04:26,000
each of them got an Ig Nobel prize.

88
0:04:27.199,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In 1991, I, together with bunch of other people,

89
0:04:31.191,000 --> 0:04:33,000
started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.

90
0:04:34.094,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Every year we give out 10 prizes.

91
0:04:37.026,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The prizes are based on just one criteria. It's very simple.

92
0:04:44.009,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It's that you've done something that makes people laugh and then think.

93
0:04:49.993,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What you've done makes people laugh and then think.

94
0:04:58.582,000 --> 0:05:01,000
their only possible reaction is to laugh.

95
0:05:01.893,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And then a week later,

96
0:05:03.816,000 --> 0:05:04,000
it's still rattling around in their heads

97
0:05:05.507,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and all they want to do is tell their friends about it.

98
0:05:08.267,000 --> 0:05:1,000
That's the quality we look for.

99
0:05:10.465,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Every year, we get in the neighborhood

100
0:05:13.25,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of 9,000 new nominations for the Ig Nobel prize.

101
0:05:17.692,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Of those, consistently between 10 percent

102
0:05:20.521,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and 20 percent of those nominations

103
0:05:23.004,000 --> 0:05:26,000
are people who nominate themselves.

104
0:05:26.914,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Those self-nominees almost never win.

105
0:05:30.881,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's very difficult, numerically, to win a prize if you want to.

106
0:05:35.2,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Even if you don't want to,

107
0:05:37.045,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it's very difficult numerically.

108
0:05:39.761,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You should know that when we choose somebody

109
0:05:43.411,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to win an Ig Nobel prize,

110
0:05:44.683,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We get in touch with that person, very quietly.

111
0:05:48.259,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We offer them the chance to decline

112
0:05:50.82,000 --> 0:05:53,000
this great honor if they want to.

113
0:05:54.202,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Happily for us, almost everyone who's offered a prize

114
0:05:57.526,000 --> 0:06:,000
decides to accept.

115
0:06:01.035,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What do you get if you win an Ig Nobel prize?

116
0:06:03.976,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Well, you get several things.

117
0:06:05.553,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You get an Ig Nobel prize.

118
0:06:09.083,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The design is different every year.

119
0:06:11.414,000 --> 0:06:15,000
These are always handmade from extremely cheap materials.

120
0:06:16.22,000 --> 0:06:17,000
You're looking at a picture

121
0:06:17.881,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of the prize we gave last year, 2013.

122
0:06:21.91,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Most prizes in the world also give

123
0:06:23.946,000 --> 0:06:27,000
their winners some cash, some money.

124
0:06:28.644,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We don't have any money,

125
0:06:29.707,000 --> 0:06:3,000
so we can't give them.

126
0:06:31.218,000 --> 0:06:33,000
In fact, the winners have to pay their own way

127
0:06:34.094,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony,

128
0:06:36.898,000 --> 0:06:37,000
which most of them do.

129
0:06:38.761,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Last year, though, we did manage to scrape up some money.

130
0:06:41.754,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Last year, each of the 10 Ig Nobel prize winners

131
0:06:46.265,000 --> 0:06:51,000
received from us 10 trillion dollars.

132
0:06:52.043,000 --> 0:06:57,000
A $10 trillion bill from Zimbabwe. (Laughter)

133
0:06:57.476,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You may remember that Zimbabwe had a little adventure

134
0:07:00.3,000 --> 0:07:02,000
for a few years there of inflation.

135
0:07:02.895,000 --> 0:07:03,000
They ended up printing bills

136
0:07:04.515,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that were in denominations as large as 100 trillion dollars.

137
0:07:08.371,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The man responsible, who runs the national bank there, by the way,

138
0:07:11.156,000 --> 0:07:13,000
won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics.

139
0:07:13.929,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The other thing you win is an invitation

140
0:07:15.681,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to come to the ceremony,

141
0:07:17.184,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which happens at Harvard University.

142
0:07:18.926,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And when you get there,

143
0:07:20.061,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you come to Harvard's biggest meeting place and classroom.

144
0:07:22.778,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It fits 1,100 people,

145
0:07:24.063,000 --> 0:07:25,000
it's jammed to the gills,

146
0:07:25.189,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and up on the stage,

147
0:07:26.02,000 --> 0:07:27,000
waiting to shake your hand,

148
0:07:27.814,000 --> 0:07:29,000
waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize,

149
0:07:30.086,000 --> 0:07:32,000
are a bunch of Nobel prize winners.

150
0:07:32.735,000 --> 0:07:33,000
That's the heart of the ceremony.

151
0:07:34.034,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The winners are kept secret until that moment,

152
0:07:36.184,000 --> 0:07:38,000
even the Nobel laureates who will shake their hand

153
0:07:38.611,000 --> 0:07:41,000
don't know who they are until they're announced.

154
0:07:41.854,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I am going to tell you about just a very few

155
0:07:44.974,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of the other medical-related prizes we've given.

156
0:07:48.028,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Keep in mind, we've given 230 prizes.

157
0:07:50.284,000 --> 0:07:52,000
There are lots of these people who walk among you.

158
0:07:52.578,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Maybe you have one.

159
0:07:54.698,000 --> 0:07:56,000
A paper was published about 30 years ago

160
0:07:56.842,000 --> 0:07:58,000
called "Injuries due to Falling Coconuts."

161
0:07:59.352,000 --> 0:08:,000
It was written by Dr. Peter Barss,

162
0:08:01.307,000 --> 0:08:03,000
who is Canadian.

163
0:08:03.518,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Dr. Barss came to the ceremony

164
0:08:05.704,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and explained that as a young doctor,

165
0:08:07.571,000 --> 0:08:08,000
he wanted to see the world.

166
0:08:09.052,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So he went to Papua New Guinea.

167
0:08:11.341,000 --> 0:08:13,000
When he got there, he went to work in a hospital, and he was curious

168
0:08:13.68,000 --> 0:08:18,000
what kinds of things happen to people that bring them to the hospital.

169
0:08:19.195,000 --> 0:08:2,000
He looked through the records, and he discovered

170
0:08:20.493,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that a surprisingly large number of people

171
0:08:23.283,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in that hospital were there

172
0:08:24.449,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because of injuries due to falling coconuts.

173
0:08:27.996,000 --> 0:08:28,000
One typical thing that happens is

174
0:08:29.782,000 --> 0:08:32,000
people will come from the highlands, where there are not many coconut trees,

175
0:08:33.581,000 --> 0:08:35,000
down to visit their relatives on the coast,

176
0:08:35.829,000 --> 0:08:36,000
where there are lots.

177
0:08:37.289,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And they'll think that a coconut tree

178
0:08:38.679,000 --> 0:08:4,000
is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down.

179
0:08:41.348,000 --> 0:08:43,000
A coconut tree that is 90 feet tall,

180
0:08:43.955,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and has coconuts that weigh two pounds

181
0:08:46.178,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that can drop off at any time.

182
0:08:50.23,000 --> 0:08:51,000
A team of doctors in Europe

183
0:08:52.023,000 --> 0:08:55,000
published a series of papers about colonoscopies.

184
0:08:55.532,000 --> 0:08:57,000
You're all familiar with colonoscopies,

185
0:08:57.562,000 --> 0:08:58,000
one way or another.

186
0:08:58.854,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Or in some cases,

187
0:09:00.169,000 --> 0:09:03,000
one way and another.

188
0:09:03.674,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They, in these papers,

189
0:09:07.023,000 --> 0:09:11,000
explained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies,

190
0:09:11.191,000 --> 0:09:12,000
how to minimize the chance

191
0:09:13.162,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that when you perform a colonoscopy,

192
0:09:15.823,000 --> 0:09:18,000
your patient will explode. (Laughter)

193
0:09:19.413,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Dr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan

194
0:09:21.373,000 --> 0:09:22,000
one of the authors,

195
0:09:22.547,000 --> 0:09:25,000
flew in from Paris to the ceremony,

196
0:09:25.706,000 --> 0:09:26,000
where he explained the history of this,

197
0:09:27.597,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that in the 1950s,

198
0:09:28.773,000 --> 0:09:33,000
when colonoscopies were becoming a common technique for the first time,

199
0:09:34.101,000 --> 0:09:36,000
people were figuring out how to do it well.

200
0:09:36.74,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And there were some difficulties at first.

201
0:09:39.5,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The basic problem, I'm sure you're familiar with,

202
0:09:43.471,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that you're looking inside a long, narrow, dark place.

203
0:09:48.8,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And so, you want to have a larger space.

204
0:09:52.355,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You add some gas to inflate it

205
0:09:54.486,000 --> 0:09:55,000
so you have room to look around.

206
0:09:56.4,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Now, that's added to the gas, the methane gas,

207
0:09:59.127,000 --> 0:10:,000
that's already inside.

208
0:10:00.635,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The gas that they used at first, in many cases, was oxygen.

209
0:10:03.635,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So they added oxygen to methane gas.

210
0:10:06.084,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And then they wanted to be able to see,

211
0:10:07.799,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they needed light,

212
0:10:09.047,000 --> 0:10:1,000
so they'd put in a light source,

213
0:10:10.452,000 --> 0:10:11,000
which in the 1950s was very hot.

214
0:10:12.228,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So you had methane gas, which is flammable,

215
0:10:15.546,000 --> 0:10:17,000
oxygen and heat.

216
0:10:18.338,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They stopped using oxygen pretty quickly. (Laughter)

217
0:10:23.476,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now it's rare that patients will explode,

218
0:10:25.997,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but it does still happen.

219
0:10:31.736,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The final thing that I want to tell you about is a prize

220
0:10:35.311,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar.

221
0:10:37.742,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Dr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere

222
0:10:41.867,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that in an emergency

223
0:10:43.425,000 --> 0:10:44,000
can be quickly separated

224
0:10:44.618,000 --> 0:10:47,000
into a pair of protective face masks.

225
0:10:48.137,000 --> 0:10:49,000
One to save your life,

226
0:10:49.904,000 --> 0:10:54,000
one to save the life of some lucky bystander. (Laughter)

227
0:10:55.228,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Why would someone do this, you might wonder.

228
0:10:58.255,000 --> 0:11:,000
Dr. Bodnar came to the ceremony

229
0:11:00.387,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and she explained that she grew up in Ukraine.

230
0:11:03.348,000 --> 0:11:04,000
She was one of the doctors who treated victims

231
0:11:05.064,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown.

232
0:11:07.108,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And they later discovered that

233
0:11:09.692,000 --> 0:11:1,000
a lot of the worst medical problems

234
0:11:11.617,000 --> 0:11:13,000
came from the particles people breathed in.

235
0:11:13.739,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So she was always thinking after that

236
0:11:15.667,000 --> 0:11:16,000
about could there be some simple mask

237
0:11:17.294,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that was available everywhere when the unexpected happens.

238
0:11:21.99,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Years later, she moved to America.

239
0:11:23.603,000 --> 0:11:23,000
She had a baby,

240
0:11:24.447,000 --> 0:11:25,000
One day she looked, and on the floor,

241
0:11:26.203,000 --> 0:11:29,000
her infant son had picked up her bra,

242
0:11:29.274,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and had her bra on his face.

243
0:11:31.133,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And that's where the idea came from.

244
0:11:32.814,000 --> 0:11:34,000
She came to the Ig Nobel ceremony

245
0:11:34.817,000 --> 0:11:36,000
with the first prototype of the bra

246
0:11:37.157,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and she demonstrated:

247
0:11:41.511,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

248
0:12:10.265,000 --> 0:12:18,000
["Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate (2008) in economics"]

249
0:12:40.574,000 --> 0:12:47,000
["Wolfgang Ketterle, Nobel laureate (2001) in physics"]

250
0:12:55.663,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I myself own an emergency bra. (Laughter)

251
0:12:59.283,000 --> 0:13:01,000
It's my favorite bra,

252
0:13:01.621,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but I would be happy to share it with any of you,

253
0:13:04.273,000 --> 0:13:05,000
should the need arise.

254
0:13:06.122,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Thank you.

255
0:13:07.078,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Applause)

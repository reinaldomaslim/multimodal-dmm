2
0:00:15.902,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Companies are losing control.

3
0:00:19.062,000 --> 0:00:2,000
What happens on Wall Street

4
0:00:20.667,000 --> 0:00:22,000
no longer stays on Wall Street.

5
0:00:22.998,000 --> 0:00:25,000
What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube. (Laughter)

6
0:00:26.884,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.

7
0:00:31.1,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Management teams seem increasingly

8
0:00:33.676,000 --> 0:00:36,000
disconnected from their staff. (Laughter)

9
0:00:36.7,000 --> 0:00:39,000
A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe

10
0:00:40.225,000 --> 0:00:42,000
their employees are inspired by their firm.

11
0:00:42.869,000 --> 0:00:44,000
However, in the same survey, only four percent

12
0:00:45.016,000 --> 0:00:47,000
of employees agreed.

13
0:00:47.459,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Companies are losing control

14
0:00:49.509,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of their customers and their employees.

15
0:00:53.151,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But are they really?

16
0:00:55.401,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I'm a marketer, and as a marketer, I know

17
0:00:58.698,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that I've never really been in control.

18
0:01:01.725,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Your brand is what other people say about you

19
0:01:04.368,000 --> 0:01:07,000
when you're not in the room, the saying goes.

20
0:01:07.563,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies

21
0:01:11.694,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to be in that room now, 24/7.

22
0:01:14.575,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They can listen and join the conversation.

23
0:01:17.05,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In fact, they have more control over the loss of control

24
0:01:20.25,000 --> 0:01:22,000
than ever before.

25
0:01:22.64,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They can design for it. But how?

26
0:01:25.69,000 --> 0:01:28,000
First of all, they can give employees and customers more control.

27
0:01:29.256,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas,

28
0:01:32.652,000 --> 0:01:35,000
knowledge, content, designs and product.

29
0:01:36.03,000 --> 0:01:38,000
They can give them more control over pricing,

30
0:01:38.478,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which is what the band Radiohead did

31
0:01:40.438,000 --> 0:01:43,000
with its pay-as-you-like online release of its album

32
0:01:43.512,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"In Rainbows." Buyers could determine the price,

33
0:01:46.46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but the offer was exclusive, and only stood for a limited period of time.

34
0:01:51.31,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band.

35
0:01:55.269,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg

36
0:01:58.466,000 --> 0:02:01,000
opened a so-called "generous store" in Copenhagen.

37
0:02:01.648,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It asked customers to purchase chocolate

38
0:02:04.067,000 --> 0:02:07,000
with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones.

39
0:02:07.566,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It turned transactions into interactions,

40
0:02:10.48,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and generosity into a currency.

41
0:02:13.033,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Companies can even give control to hackers.

42
0:02:15.994,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When Microsoft Kinect came out,

43
0:02:18.445,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console,

44
0:02:22.596,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it immediately drew the attention of hackers.

45
0:02:25.532,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Microsoft first fought off the hacks, but then shifted course

46
0:02:29.425,000 --> 0:02:31,000
when it realized that actively supporting the community

47
0:02:32.288,000 --> 0:02:33,000
came with benefits.

48
0:02:34.047,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The sense of co-ownership, the free publicity,

49
0:02:37.283,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the added value, all helped drive sales.

50
0:02:40.3,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The ultimate empowerment of customers

51
0:02:42.629,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is to ask them not to buy.

52
0:02:45.722,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers

53
0:02:49.649,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to check out eBay for its used products

54
0:02:52.618,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones.

55
0:02:56.185,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In an even more radical stance against consumerism,

56
0:02:59.423,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the company placed a "Don't Buy This Jacket"

57
0:03:01.516,000 --> 0:03:04,000
advertisement during the peak of shopping season.

58
0:03:05.016,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It may have jeopardized short-term sales,

59
0:03:07.818,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but it builds lasting, long-term loyalty

60
0:03:10.472,000 --> 0:03:12,000
based on shared values.

61
0:03:12.642,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Research has shown that giving employees more control

62
0:03:15.862,000 --> 0:03:18,000
over their work makes them happier and more productive.

63
0:03:19.631,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The Brazilian company Semco Group famously

64
0:03:22.6,000 --> 0:03:24,000
lets employees set their own work schedules

65
0:03:25.27,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and even their salaries.

66
0:03:27.282,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Hulu and Netflix, among other companies,

67
0:03:29.553,000 --> 0:03:31,000
have open vacation policies.

68
0:03:32.005,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Companies can give people more control,

69
0:03:34.923,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but they can also give them less control.

70
0:03:39.195,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Traditional business wisdom holds that trust

71
0:03:41.942,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is earned by predictable behavior,

72
0:03:44.651,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but when everything is consistent and standardized,

73
0:03:47.296,000 --> 0:03:49,000
how do you create meaningful experiences?

74
0:03:50.219,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Giving people less control might be a wonderful way

75
0:03:53.686,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to counter the abundance of choice

76
0:03:55.948,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and make them happier.

77
0:03:57.63,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Take the travel service Nextpedition.

78
0:04:00.443,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Nextpedition turns the trip into a game,

79
0:04:03.648,000 --> 0:04:06,000
with surprising twists and turns along the way.

80
0:04:07.22,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It does not tell the traveler where she's going

81
0:04:09.044,000 --> 0:04:12,000
until the very last minute, and information is provided

82
0:04:12.113,000 --> 0:04:15,000
just in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLM

83
0:04:16.096,000 --> 0:04:19,000
launched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomly

84
0:04:19.281,000 --> 0:04:21,000
handing out small gifts to travelers

85
0:04:22.073,000 --> 0:04:24,000
en route to their destination.

86
0:04:24.235,000 --> 0:04:26,000
U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitter

87
0:04:27.068,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for users who were having a bad day,

88
0:04:29.578,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers.

89
0:04:33.669,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Is there anything companies can do to make

90
0:04:35.682,000 --> 0:04:38,000
their employees feel less pressed for time? Yes.

91
0:04:38.789,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Force them to help others.

92
0:04:41.714,000 --> 0:04:44,000
A recent study suggests that having employees complete

93
0:04:45.048,000 --> 0:04:47,000
occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day

94
0:04:47.859,000 --> 0:04:51,000
increases their sense of overall productivity.

95
0:04:51.928,000 --> 0:04:54,000
At Frog, the company I work for, we hold internal

96
0:04:55.597,000 --> 0:04:59,000
speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees,

97
0:05:00.198,000 --> 0:05:02,000
helping them get to know each other fast.

98
0:05:03.158,000 --> 0:05:06,000
By applying a strict process, we give them less control,

99
0:05:06.48,000 --> 0:05:1,000
less choice, but we enable more and richer social interactions.

100
0:05:11.214,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Companies are the makers of their fortunes,

101
0:05:14.07,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and like all of us, they are utterly exposed to serendipity.

102
0:05:18.333,000 --> 0:05:21,000
That should make them more humble, more vulnerable

103
0:05:21.938,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and more human.

104
0:05:24.758,000 --> 0:05:26,000
At the end of the day, as hyperconnectivity

105
0:05:27.604,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and transparency expose companies' behavior

106
0:05:29.914,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in broad daylight, staying true to their true selves

107
0:05:33.548,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is the only sustainable value proposition.

108
0:05:37.099,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said,

109
0:05:39.744,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"What's interesting about you is you."

110
0:05:42.754,000 --> 0:05:45,000
For the true selves of companies to come through,

111
0:05:45.808,000 --> 0:05:47,000
openness is paramount,

112
0:05:48.439,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but radical openness is not a solution,

113
0:05:51.431,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because when everything is open, nothing is open.

114
0:05:54.841,000 --> 0:05:58,000
"A smile is a door that is half open and half closed,"

115
0:05:59.758,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the author Jennifer Egan wrote.

116
0:06:01.812,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Companies can give their employees and customers

117
0:06:04.392,000 --> 0:06:07,000
more control or less. They can worry about how much

118
0:06:07.879,000 --> 0:06:1,000
openness is good for them, and what needs to stay closed.

119
0:06:11.537,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Or they can simply smile, and remain open

120
0:06:15.778,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to all possibilities.

121
0:06:17.395,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Thank you. (Applause)

122
0:06:21.506,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.317,000 --> 0:00:14,000
How do you find a dinosaur?

2
0:00:15.928,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Sounds impossible, doesn't it?

3
0:00:18.65,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's not.

4
0:00:19.969,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the answer relies on a formula that all paleontologists use.

5
0:00:24.722,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I'm going to tell you the secret.

6
0:00:27.35,000 --> 0:00:29,000
First, find rocks of the right age.

7
0:00:31.226,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Second, those rocks must be sedimentary rocks.

8
0:00:35.863,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And third, layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed.

9
0:00:40.768,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That's it.

10
0:00:41.943,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Find those three things and get yourself on the ground,

11
0:00:45.378,000 --> 0:00:47,000
chances are good that you will find fossils.

12
0:00:48.313,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now let me break down this formula.

13
0:00:50.812,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Organisms exist only during certain geological intervals.

14
0:00:55.207,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So you have to find rocks of the right age,

15
0:00:57.661,000 --> 0:00:59,000
depending on what your interests are.

16
0:00:59.853,000 --> 0:01:,000
If you want to find trilobites,

17
0:01:01.387,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you have to find the really, really old rocks of the Paleozoic --

18
0:01:04.562,000 --> 0:01:07,000
rocks between a half a billion and a quarter-billion years old.

19
0:01:08.306,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs,

20
0:01:10.418,000 --> 0:01:12,000
don't look in the Paleozoic, you won't find them.

21
0:01:12.799,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They hadn't evolved yet.

22
0:01:14.304,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You have to find the younger rocks of the Mesozoic,

23
0:01:17.415,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and in the case of dinosaurs,

24
0:01:18.836,000 --> 0:01:21,000
between 235 and 66 million years ago.

25
0:01:23.495,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point,

26
0:01:26.694,000 --> 0:01:29,000
because the Earth is, to a coarse degree,

27
0:01:29.85,000 --> 0:01:3,000
geologically mapped.

28
0:01:31.578,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This is hard-won information.

29
0:01:34.323,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The annals of Earth history are written in rocks,

30
0:01:37.151,000 --> 0:01:38,000
one chapter upon the next,

31
0:01:38.476,000 --> 0:01:4,000
such that the oldest pages are on bottom

32
0:01:41.104,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and the youngest on top.

33
0:01:43.583,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now, were it quite that easy, geologists would rejoice.

34
0:01:47.66,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's not.

35
0:01:48.942,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The library of Earth is an old one.

36
0:01:51.02,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It has no librarian to impose order.

37
0:01:54.111,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Operating over vast swaths of time,

38
0:01:57.265,000 --> 0:02:01,000
myriad geological processes offer every possible insult

39
0:02:02.136,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to the rocks of ages.

40
0:02:04.277,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Most pages are destroyed soon after being written.

41
0:02:07.41,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Some pages are overwritten,

42
0:02:09.186,000 --> 0:02:13,000
creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests of long-gone landscapes.

43
0:02:14.384,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Pages that do find sanctuary under the advancing sands of time

44
0:02:19.173,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are never truly safe.

45
0:02:21.41,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Unlike the Moon -- our dead, rocky companion --

46
0:02:24.778,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the Earth is alive, pulsing with creative and destructive forces

47
0:02:28.442,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that power its geological metabolism.

48
0:02:31.864,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Lunar rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts

49
0:02:34.261,000 --> 0:02:36,000
all date back to about the age of the Solar System.

50
0:02:37.609,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Moon rocks are forever.

51
0:02:40.96,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Earth rocks, on the other hand, face the perils of a living lithosphere.

52
0:02:45.11,000 --> 0:02:46,000
All will suffer ruination,

53
0:02:46.718,000 --> 0:02:48,000
through some combination of mutilation, compression,

54
0:02:49.568,000 --> 0:02:51,000
folding, tearing, scorching and baking.

55
0:02:53.14,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Thus, the volumes of Earth history are incomplete and disheveled.

56
0:02:59.079,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The library is vast and magnificent --

57
0:03:03.964,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but decrepit.

58
0:03:06.273,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And it was this tattered complexity in the rock record

59
0:03:09.163,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that obscured its meaning until relatively recently.

60
0:03:13.031,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Nature provided no card catalog for geologists --

61
0:03:15.381,000 --> 0:03:16,000
this would have to be invented.

62
0:03:18.079,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Five thousand years after the Sumerians learned to record their thoughts

63
0:03:21.734,000 --> 0:03:22,000
on clay tablets,

64
0:03:22.91,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the Earth's volumes remained inscrutable to humans.

65
0:03:26.495,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We were geologically illiterate,

66
0:03:29.637,000 --> 0:03:32,000
unaware of the antiquity of our own planet

67
0:03:32.843,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and ignorant of our connection

68
0:03:34.376,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to deep time.

69
0:03:37.04,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It wasn't until the turn of the 19th century

70
0:03:40.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that our blinders were removed,

71
0:03:42.66,000 --> 0:03:46,000
first, with the publication of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,"

72
0:03:47.078,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in which he told us that the Earth reveals no vestige of a beginning

73
0:03:50.974,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and no prospect of an end;

74
0:03:53.545,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and then, with the printing of William Smith's map of Britain,

75
0:03:57.515,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the first country-scale geological map,

76
0:03:59.724,000 --> 0:04:,000
giving us for the first time

77
0:04:01.114,000 --> 0:04:04,000
predictive insight into where certain types of rocks might occur.

78
0:04:05.504,000 --> 0:04:07,000
After that, you could say things like,

79
0:04:07.551,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"If we go over there, we should be in the Jurassic,"

80
0:04:10.578,000 --> 0:04:13,000
or, "If we go up over that hill, we should find the Cretaceous."

81
0:04:15.129,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So now, if you want to find trilobites,

82
0:04:18.008,000 --> 0:04:2,000
get yourself a good geological map

83
0:04:20.161,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.

84
0:04:23.023,000 --> 0:04:25,000
If you want to find dinosaurs like I do,

85
0:04:25.366,000 --> 0:04:28,000
find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.

86
0:04:29.217,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now of course, you can only make a fossil in a sedimentary rock,

87
0:04:32.34,000 --> 0:04:33,000
a rock made by sand and mud.

88
0:04:34.489,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You can't have a fossil

89
0:04:35.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in an igneous rock formed by magma, like a granite,

90
0:04:39.028,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or in a metamorphic rock that's been heated and squeezed.

91
0:04:42.773,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And you have to get yourself in a desert.

92
0:04:45.378,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's not that dinosaurs particularly lived in deserts;

93
0:04:48.483,000 --> 0:04:49,000
they lived on every land mass

94
0:04:50.071,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and in every imaginable environment.

95
0:04:52.596,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's that you need to go to a place that's a desert today,

96
0:04:55.565,000 --> 0:04:58,000
a place that doesn't have too many plants covering up the rocks,

97
0:04:58.763,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface.

98
0:05:03.302,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So find those three things:

99
0:05:04.859,000 --> 0:05:05,000
rocks of the right age,

100
0:05:06.438,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,

101
0:05:09.511,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and get yourself on the ground,

102
0:05:11.092,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and you literally walk

103
0:05:12.628,000 --> 0:05:14,000
until you see a bone sticking out of the rock.

104
0:05:16.562,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Here's a picture that I took in Southern Patagonia.

105
0:05:20.347,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Every pebble that you see on the ground there

106
0:05:23.133,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is a piece of dinosaur bone.

107
0:05:25.478,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So when you're in that right situation,

108
0:05:27.368,000 --> 0:05:29,000
it's not a question of whether you'll find fossils or not;

109
0:05:30.146,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you're going to find fossils.

110
0:05:31.559,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The question is: Will you find something that is scientifically significant?

111
0:05:35.631,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And to help with that, I'm going to add a fourth part to our formula,

112
0:05:39.625,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which is this:

113
0:05:41.431,000 --> 0:05:44,000
get as far away from other paleontologists as possible.

114
0:05:44.915,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:46.91,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It's not that I don't like other paleontologists.

116
0:05:49.289,000 --> 0:05:51,000
When you go to a place that's relatively unexplored,

117
0:05:51.838,000 --> 0:05:53,000
you have a much better chance of not only finding fossils

118
0:05:54.676,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but of finding something that's new to science.

119
0:05:57.788,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So that's my formula for finding dinosaurs,

120
0:05:59.923,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I've applied it all around the world.

121
0:06:01.98,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In the austral summer of 2004,

122
0:06:04.332,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I went to the bottom of South America,

123
0:06:06.181,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,

124
0:06:08.322,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to prospect for dinosaurs:

125
0:06:10.599,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age,

126
0:06:13.996,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in a desert,

127
0:06:15.223,000 --> 0:06:18,000
a place that had been barely visited by paleontologists.

128
0:06:19.166,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And we found this.

129
0:06:21.206,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This is a femur, a thigh bone,

130
0:06:23.343,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.

131
0:06:25.736,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That bone is 2.2 meters across.

132
0:06:28.594,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That's over seven feet long.

133
0:06:31.807,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now, unfortunately, that bone was isolated.

134
0:06:33.931,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We dug and dug and dug, and there wasn't another bone around.

135
0:06:36.994,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But it made us hungry to go back the next year for more.

136
0:06:39.713,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And on the first day of that next field season,

137
0:06:42.34,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I found this: another two-meter femur,

138
0:06:45.733,000 --> 0:06:46,000
only this time not isolated,

139
0:06:47.4,000 --> 0:06:5,000
this time associated with 145 other bones

140
0:06:50.519,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of a giant plant eater.

141
0:06:53.064,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And after three more hard, really brutal field seasons,

142
0:06:57.184,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the quarry came to look like this.

143
0:06:59.597,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me.

144
0:07:03.739,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The giant that lay in this grave, the new species of dinosaur,

145
0:07:07.315,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we would eventually call "Dreadnoughtus schrani."

146
0:07:11.513,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet from snout to tail.

147
0:07:15.03,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It stood two-and-a-half stories at the shoulder,

148
0:07:18.217,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and all fleshed out in life, it weighed 65 tons.

149
0:07:23.29,000 --> 0:07:26,000
People ask me sometimes, "Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"

150
0:07:26.896,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.

151
0:07:30.669,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now, one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist

152
0:07:33.733,000 --> 0:07:35,000
is when you find a new species, you get to name it.

153
0:07:36.526,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I've always thought it a shame that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs

154
0:07:40.384,000 --> 0:07:44,000
are too often portrayed as passive, lumbering platters of meat

155
0:07:44.887,000 --> 0:07:45,000
on the landscape.

156
0:07:46.156,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:47.585,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They're not.

158
0:07:48.908,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Big herbivores can be surly, and they can be territorial --

159
0:07:51.951,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you do not want to mess with a hippo or a rhino or a water buffalo.

160
0:07:56.871,000 --> 0:08:,000
The bison in Yellowstone injure far more people than do the grizzly bears.

161
0:08:01.846,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So can you imagine a big bull, 65-ton Dreadnoughtus

162
0:08:07.011,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in the breeding season,

163
0:08:08.738,000 --> 0:08:09,000
defending a territory?

164
0:08:10.99,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That animal would have been incredibly dangerous,

165
0:08:13.334,000 --> 0:08:17,000
a menace to all around, and itself would have had nothing to fear.

166
0:08:18.507,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,"

167
0:08:20.756,000 --> 0:08:21,000
or, "fears nothing."

168
0:08:24.047,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, to grow so large,

169
0:08:25.237,000 --> 0:08:27,000
an animal like Dreadnoughtus would've had to have been

170
0:08:27.873,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a model of efficiency.

171
0:08:29.054,000 --> 0:08:32,000
That long neck and long tail help it radiate heat into the environment,

172
0:08:32.841,000 --> 0:08:34,000
passively controlling its temperature.

173
0:08:35.403,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And that long neck also serves as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.

174
0:08:38.932,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Dreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck

175
0:08:41.736,000 --> 0:08:43,000
clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,

176
0:08:44.052,000 --> 0:08:47,000
taking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few.

177
0:08:48.621,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And these animals evolved a bulldog-like wide-gait stance,

178
0:08:52.945,000 --> 0:08:53,000
giving them immense stability,

179
0:08:55.625,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because when you're 65 tons, when you're literally as big as a house,

180
0:08:59.725,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the penalty for falling over

181
0:09:01.856,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is death.

182
0:09:03.677,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Yeah, these animals are big and tough,

183
0:09:05.606,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but they won't take a blow like that.

184
0:09:07.407,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Dreadnoughtus falls over, ribs break and pierce lungs.

185
0:09:10.012,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Organs burst.

186
0:09:11.561,000 --> 0:09:12,000
If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,

187
0:09:13.371,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you don't get to fall down in life -- even once.

188
0:09:17.664,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Now, after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried

189
0:09:21.254,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and de-fleshed by a multitude of bacteria, worms and insects,

190
0:09:25.998,000 --> 0:09:27,000
its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,

191
0:09:28.187,000 --> 0:09:3,000
exchanging molecules with the groundwater

192
0:09:30.227,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and becoming more and more like the entombing rock.

193
0:09:33.603,000 --> 0:09:35,000
As layer upon layer of sediment accumulated,

194
0:09:36.003,000 --> 0:09:38,000
pressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove

195
0:09:38.853,000 --> 0:09:43,000
whose firm and enduring grip held each bone in a stabilizing embrace.

196
0:09:45.654,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And then came the long ...

197
0:09:48.044,000 --> 0:09:49,000
nothing.

198
0:09:49.868,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Epoch after epoch of sameness,

199
0:09:53.21,000 --> 0:09:54,000
nonevents without number.

200
0:09:55.501,000 --> 0:09:58,000
All the while, the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging

201
0:09:58.947,000 --> 0:10:,000
in perfect equilibrium

202
0:10:01.334,000 --> 0:10:02,000
within its rocky grave.

203
0:10:03.995,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.

204
0:10:06.036,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The dinosaurs would reign for another 12 million years

205
0:10:08.707,000 --> 0:10:12,000
before their hegemony was snuffed out in a fiery apocalypse.

206
0:10:13.542,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The continents drifted. The mammals rose.

207
0:10:16.244,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The Ice Age came.

208
0:10:18.623,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And then, in East Africa,

209
0:10:20.894,000 --> 0:10:25,000
an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.

210
0:10:27.752,000 --> 0:10:3,000
These brainy primates were not particularly fast or strong.

211
0:10:32.062,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But they excelled at covering ground,

212
0:10:34.292,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and in a remarkable diaspora

213
0:10:36.185,000 --> 0:10:39,000
surpassing even the dinosaurs' record of territorial conquest,

214
0:10:39.351,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they dispersed across the planet,

215
0:10:41.305,000 --> 0:10:44,000
ravishing every ecosystem they encountered,

216
0:10:44.509,000 --> 0:10:47,000
along the way, inventing culture and metalworking and painting

217
0:10:47.714,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and dance and music

218
0:10:49.786,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and science

219
0:10:51.793,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and rocket ships that would eventually take 12 particularly excellent apes

220
0:10:56.346,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to the surface of the Moon.

221
0:11:00.9,000 --> 0:11:03,000
With seven billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet,

222
0:11:05.253,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it was perhaps inevitable

223
0:11:06.494,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan

224
0:11:10.556,000 --> 0:11:12,000
buried beneath the badlands of Southern Patagonia.

225
0:11:14.614,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I was that ape.

226
0:11:17.038,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And standing there, alone in the desert,

227
0:11:20.64,000 --> 0:11:21,000
it was not lost on me

228
0:11:21.815,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record

229
0:11:25.469,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is vanishingly small.

230
0:11:28.039,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But the Earth is very, very old.

231
0:11:30.111,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And over vast tracts of time, the improbable becomes the probable.

232
0:11:34.395,000 --> 0:11:36,000
That's the magic of the geological record.

233
0:11:37.11,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Thus, multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet

234
0:11:40.316,000 --> 0:11:41,000
leave behind immense numbers of fossils,

235
0:11:42.267,000 --> 0:11:43,000
each one a small miracle,

236
0:11:44.691,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but collectively, inevitable.

237
0:11:48.572,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Sixty-six million years ago, an asteroid hits the Earth

238
0:11:51.953,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and wipes out the dinosaurs.

239
0:11:54.771,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This easily might not have been.

240
0:11:57.312,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But we only get one history, and it's the one that we have.

241
0:12:00.191,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But this particular reality was not inevitable.

242
0:12:02.491,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The tiniest perturbation of that asteroid far from Earth

243
0:12:05.317,000 --> 0:12:08,000
would have caused it to miss our planet by a wide margin.

244
0:12:08.754,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The pivotal, calamitous day during which the dinosaurs were wiped out,

245
0:12:12.131,000 --> 0:12:15,000
setting the stage for the modern world as we know it

246
0:12:15.366,000 --> 0:12:16,000
didn't have to be.

247
0:12:16.922,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It could've just been another day --

248
0:12:19.443,000 --> 0:12:2,000
a Thursday, perhaps --

249
0:12:21.856,000 --> 0:12:25,000
among the 63 billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.

250
0:12:27.313,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But over geological time,

251
0:12:28.722,000 --> 0:12:3,000
improbable, nearly impossible events

252
0:12:31.631,000 --> 0:12:32,000
do occur.

253
0:12:32.806,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Along the path from our wormy, Cambrian ancestors

254
0:12:35.753,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to primates dressed in suits,

255
0:12:38.18,000 --> 0:12:42,000
innumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular reality.

256
0:12:43.982,000 --> 0:12:47,000
The bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years.

257
0:12:48.899,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Who could have imagined

258
0:12:50.094,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that a single species of shrew-like mammal

259
0:12:53.082,000 --> 0:12:55,000
living in the cracks of the dinosaur world

260
0:12:55.15,000 --> 0:12:57,000
would evolve into sentient beings

261
0:12:57.226,000 --> 0:12:59,000
capable of characterizing and understanding

262
0:12:59.606,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?

263
0:13:04.775,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I once stood at the head of the Missouri River

264
0:13:09.107,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and bestraddled it.

265
0:13:11.123,000 --> 0:13:13,000
There, it's nothing more than a gurgle of water

266
0:13:13.349,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture,

267
0:13:17.984,000 --> 0:13:18,000
high in the Bitterroot Mountains.

268
0:13:20.165,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The stream next to it runs a few hundred yards

269
0:13:23.407,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and ends in a small pond.

270
0:13:25.97,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Those two streams -- they look identical.

271
0:13:29.732,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But one is an anonymous trickle of water,

272
0:13:32.295,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and the other is the Missouri River.

273
0:13:35.667,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Now go down to the mouth of the Missouri, near St. Louis,

274
0:13:39.188,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and it's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal.

275
0:13:42.64,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But go up into the Bitterroots and look at the Missouri,

276
0:13:45.378,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and human prospection does not allow us to see it as anything special.

277
0:13:51.03,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period

278
0:13:53.008,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.

279
0:13:55.477,000 --> 0:13:56,000
You would never guess

280
0:13:56.938,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that they would amount to anything special,

281
0:13:59.039,000 --> 0:14:,000
and they probably wouldn't have,

282
0:14:00.711,000 --> 0:14:02,000
were it not for that pesky asteroid.

283
0:14:03.797,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Now, make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems

284
0:14:07.182,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and let them run.

285
0:14:09.047,000 --> 0:14:11,000
You will never get the same result.

286
0:14:11.225,000 --> 0:14:14,000
No doubt, those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable,

287
0:14:14.654,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but they would not be our world and they would not have our history.

288
0:14:17.986,000 --> 0:14:19,000
There are an infinite number of histories that we could've had.

289
0:14:20.989,000 --> 0:14:22,000
We only get one, and wow, did we ever get a good one.

290
0:14:23.539,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.

291
0:14:27.058,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.

292
0:14:31.216,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car

293
0:14:35.336,000 --> 0:14:36,000
really existed.

294
0:14:39.192,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Why study the ancient past?

295
0:14:42.652,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Because it gives us perspective

296
0:14:45.065,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and humility.

297
0:14:46.977,000 --> 0:14:49,000
The dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction,

298
0:14:50.433,000 --> 0:14:53,000
snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own.

299
0:14:55.114,000 --> 0:14:58,000
They didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice.

300
0:15:00.009,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.

301
0:15:03.943,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet

302
0:15:07.958,000 --> 0:15:09,000
is both precarious and potentially fleeting.

303
0:15:11.127,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Right now, our species is propagating an environmental disaster

304
0:15:14.919,000 --> 0:15:17,000
of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe,

305
0:15:18.526,000 --> 0:15:2,000
it can rightly be called the sixth extinction.

306
0:15:22.429,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Only unlike the dinosaurs,

307
0:15:25.128,000 --> 0:15:26,000
we can see it coming.

308
0:15:27.438,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And unlike the dinosaurs,

309
0:15:29.708,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we can do something about it.

310
0:15:32.406,000 --> 0:15:34,000
That choice is ours.

311
0:15:35.49,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you.

312
0:15:36.665,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Applause)

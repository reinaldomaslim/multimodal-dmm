2
0:00:13.06,000 --> 0:00:16,000
This is a tuberculosis ward,

3
0:00:16.1,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and at the time this picture was taken in the late 1800s,

4
0:00:19.939,000 --> 0:00:21,000
one in seven of all people

5
0:00:22.58,000 --> 0:00:23,000
died from tuberculosis.

6
0:00:24.78,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We had no idea what was causing this disease.

7
0:00:28.14,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The hypothesis was actually

8
0:00:30.22,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it was your constitution that made you susceptible.

9
0:00:33.5,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And it was a highly romanticized disease.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It was also called consumption,

11
0:00:39.1,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and it was the disorder of poets

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and artists and intellectuals.

13
0:00:45.02,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity

14
0:00:48.78,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and conferred creative genius.

15
0:00:52.7,000 --> 0:00:54,000
By the 1950s,

16
0:00:54.86,000 --> 0:00:56,000
we instead knew that tuberculosis was caused

17
0:00:57.46,000 --> 0:01:,000
by a highly contagious bacterial infection,

18
0:01:00.86,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which is slightly less romantic,

19
0:01:03.06,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but that had the upside

20
0:01:05.34,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of us being able to maybe develop drugs to treat it.

21
0:01:08.7,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So doctors had discovered a new drug, iproniazid,

22
0:01:11.74,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that they were optimistic might cure tuberculosis,

23
0:01:15.14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and they gave it to patients,

24
0:01:16.94,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and patients were elated.

25
0:01:18.74,000 --> 0:01:21,000
They were more social, more energetic.

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
One medical report actually says they were "dancing in the halls."

27
0:01:27.5,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And unfortunately,

28
0:01:29.14,000 --> 0:01:31,000
this was not necessarily because they were getting better.

29
0:01:32.42,000 --> 0:01:34,000
A lot of them were still dying.

30
0:01:35.66,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Another medical report describes them as being "inappropriately happy."

31
0:01:43.22,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And that is how the first antidepressant was discovered.

32
0:01:47.98,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So accidental discovery is not uncommon in science,

33
0:01:52.06,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but it requires more than just a happy accident.

34
0:01:55.22,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur.

35
0:01:59.5,000 --> 0:02:01,000
As a neuroscientist, I'm going to talk to you a little bit

36
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
about my firsthand experience

37
0:02:03.7,000 --> 0:02:06,000
with whatever you want to call the opposite of dumb luck --

38
0:02:06.94,000 --> 0:02:07,000
let's call it smart luck.

39
0:02:08.58,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But first, a bit more background.

40
0:02:12.46,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Thankfully, since the 1950s,

41
0:02:15.14,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we've developed some other drugs and we can actually now cure tuberculosis.

42
0:02:19.14,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And at least in the United States, though not necessarily in other countries,

43
0:02:22.82,000 --> 0:02:23,000
we have closed our sanitoriums

44
0:02:24.34,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and probably most of you are not too worried about TB.

45
0:02:28.9,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But a lot of what was true in the early 1900s

46
0:02:31.58,000 --> 0:02:32,000
about infectious disease,

47
0:02:33.46,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we can say now about psychiatric disorders.

48
0:02:36.82,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We are in the middle of an epidemic of mood disorders

49
0:02:39.86,000 --> 0:02:42,000
like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.

50
0:02:44.3,000 --> 0:02:47,000
One in four of all adults in the United States

51
0:02:48.18,000 --> 0:02:49,000
suffers from mental illness,

52
0:02:50.18,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which means that if you haven't experienced it personally

53
0:02:53.34,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or someone in your family hasn't,

54
0:02:55.66,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it's still very likely that someone you know has,

55
0:02:58.94,000 --> 0:02:59,000
though they may not talk about it.

56
0:03:02.22,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Depression has actually now surpassed

57
0:03:05.54,000 --> 0:03:09,000
HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war

58
0:03:10.42,000 --> 0:03:13,000
as the leading cause of disability worldwide.

59
0:03:13.7,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s,

60
0:03:17.34,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we don't know what causes it.

61
0:03:19.42,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Once it's developed, it's chronic,

62
0:03:21.38,000 --> 0:03:22,000
lasts a lifetime,

63
0:03:22.9,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and there are no known cures.

64
0:03:26.66,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The second antidepressant we discovered,

65
0:03:28.9,000 --> 0:03:3,000
also by accident, in the 1950s,

66
0:03:31.38,000 --> 0:03:34,000
from an antihistamine that was making people manic,

67
0:03:35.86,000 --> 0:03:36,000
imipramine.

68
0:03:38.22,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And in both the case of the tuberculosis ward and the antihistamine,

69
0:03:41.9,000 --> 0:03:42,000
someone had to be able to recognize

70
0:03:43.62,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that a drug that was designed to do one thing --

71
0:03:46.06,000 --> 0:03:48,000
treat tuberculosis or suppress allergies --

72
0:03:48.66,000 --> 0:03:5,000
could be used to do something very different --

73
0:03:51.42,000 --> 0:03:52,000
treat depression.

74
0:03:53.38,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging.

75
0:03:56.42,000 --> 0:03:59,000
When doctors first saw this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,

76
0:04:00.38,000 --> 0:04:02,000
they didn't really recognize what they saw.

77
0:04:02.86,000 --> 0:04:03,000
They were so used to thinking about it

78
0:04:04.74,000 --> 0:04:06,000
from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug

79
0:04:07.54,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that they actually just listed it

80
0:04:09.62,000 --> 0:04:11,000
as a side effect, an adverse side effect.

81
0:04:12.42,000 --> 0:04:13,000
As you can see here,

82
0:04:13.596,000 --> 0:04:17,000
a lot of these patients in 1954 are experiencing severe euphoria.

83
0:04:18.9,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And they were worried that this might somehow interfere

84
0:04:22.54,000 --> 0:04:24,000
with their recovering from tuberculosis.

85
0:04:25.42,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases of extreme TB

86
0:04:31.7,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and in patients that were highly emotionally stable,

87
0:04:36.22,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which is of course the exact opposite of how we use it as an antidepressant.

88
0:04:40.14,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease,

89
0:04:44.62,000 --> 0:04:47,000
they could not see the larger implications for another disease.

90
0:04:49.38,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And to be fair, it's not entirely their fault.

91
0:04:52.1,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Functional fixedness is a bias that affects all of us.

92
0:04:54.9,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's a tendency to only be able to think of an object

93
0:04:58.38,000 --> 0:05:,000
in terms of its traditional use or function.

94
0:05:01.74,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And mental set is another thing. Right?

95
0:05:03.66,000 --> 0:05:05,000
That's sort of this preconceived framework

96
0:05:05.7,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with which we approach problems.

97
0:05:07.5,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And that actually makes repurposing pretty hard for all of us,

98
0:05:10.78,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which is, I guess, why they gave a TV show to the guy who was,

99
0:05:14.34,000 --> 0:05:15,000
like, really great at repurposing.

100
0:05:16.66,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:19.18,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So the effects in both the case of iproniazid and imipramine,

102
0:05:23.54,000 --> 0:05:24,000
they were so strong --

103
0:05:24.94,000 --> 0:05:26,000
there was mania, or people dancing in the halls.

104
0:05:27.18,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's actually not that surprising they were caught.

105
0:05:30.34,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But it does make you wonder what else we've missed.

106
0:05:35.02,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So iproniazid and imipramine,

107
0:05:37.22,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they're more than just a case study in repurposing.

108
0:05:39.66,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They have two other things in common that are really important.

109
0:05:42.66,000 --> 0:05:44,000
One, they have terrible side effects.

110
0:05:45.18,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That includes liver toxicity,

111
0:05:47.82,000 --> 0:05:49,000
weight gain of over 50 pounds,

112
0:05:50.82,000 --> 0:05:51,000
suicidality.

113
0:05:52.62,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And two, they both increase levels of serotonin,

114
0:05:56.82,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which is a chemical signal in the brain,

115
0:05:59.18,000 --> 0:06:,000
or a neurotransmitter.

116
0:06:01.38,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And those two things together, right, one or the two,

117
0:06:03.9,000 --> 0:06:04,000
may not have been that important,

118
0:06:05.54,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but the two together meant that we had to develop safer drugs,

119
0:06:09.3,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and that serotonin seemed like a pretty good place to start.

120
0:06:13.66,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So we developed drugs to more specifically focus on serotonin,

121
0:06:17.58,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,

122
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the most famous of which is Prozac.

123
0:06:24.02,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And that was 30 years ago,

124
0:06:26.02,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs.

125
0:06:29.74,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And the SSRIs, they are better than the drugs that came before them,

126
0:06:32.98,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but they still have a lot of side effects,

127
0:06:35.1,000 --> 0:06:37,000
including weight gain, insomnia,

128
0:06:38.02,000 --> 0:06:39,000
suicidality --

129
0:06:40.1,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and they take a really long time to work,

130
0:06:42.46,000 --> 0:06:44,000
something like four to six weeks in a lot of patients.

131
0:06:45.02,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And that's in the patients where they do work.

132
0:06:47.22,000 --> 0:06:49,000
There are a lot of patients where these drugs don't work.

133
0:06:50.1,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And that means now, in 2016,

134
0:06:53.5,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we still have no cures for any mood disorders,

135
0:06:57.34,000 --> 0:06:59,000
just drugs that suppress symptoms,

136
0:06:59.42,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which is kind of the difference between taking a painkiller for an infection

137
0:07:03.5,000 --> 0:07:04,000
versus an antibiotic.

138
0:07:04.94,000 --> 0:07:05,000
A painkiller will make you feel better,

139
0:07:06.82,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease.

140
0:07:10.7,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And it was this flexibility in our thinking

141
0:07:13.06,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that let us recognize that iproniazid and imipramine

142
0:07:16.02,000 --> 0:07:18,000
could be repurposed in this way,

143
0:07:18.14,000 --> 0:07:19,000
which led us to the serotonin hypothesis,

144
0:07:20.14,000 --> 0:07:23,000
which we then, ironically, fixated on.

145
0:07:23.98,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This is brain signaling, serotonin,

146
0:07:26.54,000 --> 0:07:27,000
from an SSRI commercial.

147
0:07:27.82,000 --> 0:07:29,000
In case you're not clear, this is a dramatization.

148
0:07:30.66,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And in science, we try and remove our bias, right,

149
0:07:34.74,000 --> 0:07:36,000
by running double-blinded experiments

150
0:07:37.14,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be.

151
0:07:40.86,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But bias creeps in more insidiously in what we choose to study

152
0:07:45.18,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and how we choose to study it.

153
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So we've focused on serotonin now for the past 30 years,

154
0:07:51.86,000 --> 0:07:53,000
often to the exclusion of other things.

155
0:07:54.86,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We still have no cures,

156
0:07:57.18,000 --> 0:08:,000
and what if serotonin isn't all there is to depression?

157
0:08:00.62,000 --> 0:08:02,000
What if it's not even the key part of it?

158
0:08:02.7,000 --> 0:08:04,000
That means no matter how much time

159
0:08:04.9,000 --> 0:08:06,000
or money or effort we put into it,

160
0:08:07.66,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it will never lead to a cure.

161
0:08:10.5,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In the past few years, doctors have discovered

162
0:08:13.1,000 --> 0:08:17,000
probably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the SSRIs,

163
0:08:18.54,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Calypsol,

164
0:08:19.86,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and this drug works very quickly, within a few hours or a day,

165
0:08:23.34,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and it doesn't work on serotonin.

166
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It works on glutamate, which is another neurotransmitter.

167
0:08:28.38,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And it's also repurposed.

168
0:08:29.9,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery.

169
0:08:33.54,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But unlike those other drugs,

170
0:08:35.22,000 --> 0:08:36,000
which were recognized pretty quickly,

171
0:08:37.06,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it took us 20 years

172
0:08:38.78,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to realize that Calypsol was an antidepressant,

173
0:08:41.46,000 --> 0:08:43,000
despite the fact that it's actually a better antidepressant,

174
0:08:44.34,000 --> 0:08:45,000
probably, than those other drugs.

175
0:08:45.98,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It's actually probably because of the fact that it's a better antidepressant

176
0:08:50.1,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that it was harder for us to recognize.

177
0:08:52.019,000 --> 0:08:54,000
There was no mania to signal its effects.

178
0:08:54.58,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So in 2013, up at Columbia University,

179
0:08:57.7,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I was working with my colleague,

180
0:08:59.3,000 --> 0:09:,000
Dr. Christine Ann Denny,

181
0:09:01.3,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and we were studying Calypsol as an antidepressant in mice.

182
0:09:05.66,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And Calypsol has, like, a really short half-life,

183
0:09:08.5,000 --> 0:09:11,000
which means it's out of your body within a few hours.

184
0:09:11.58,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And we were just piloting.

185
0:09:13.02,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So we would give an injection to mice,

186
0:09:15.3,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and then we'd wait a week,

187
0:09:16.62,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and then we'd run another experiment to save money.

188
0:09:20.02,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And one of the experiments I was running,

189
0:09:22.18,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we would stress the mice,

190
0:09:23.86,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and we used that as a model of depression.

191
0:09:26.1,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And at first it kind of just looked like it didn't really work at all.

192
0:09:29.46,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So we could have stopped there.

193
0:09:31.54,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But I have run this model of depression for years,

194
0:09:34.46,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and the data just looked kind of weird.

195
0:09:36.38,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It didn't really look right to me.

196
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So I went back,

197
0:09:39.5,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and we reanalyzed it

198
0:09:41.02,000 --> 0:09:44,000
based on whether or not they had gotten that one injection of Calypsol

199
0:09:44.86,000 --> 0:09:45,000
a week beforehand.

200
0:09:46.94,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And it looked kind of like this.

201
0:09:48.98,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So if you look at the far left,

202
0:09:51.14,000 --> 0:09:53,000
if you put a mouse in a new space,

203
0:09:53.66,000 --> 0:09:55,000
this is the box, it's very exciting,

204
0:09:55.94,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a mouse will walk around and explore,

205
0:09:58.1,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and you can see that pink line is actually the measure of them walking.

206
0:10:02.42,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup

207
0:10:05.62,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that it can decide to interact with.

208
0:10:07.7,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is also a dramatization, in case that's not clear.

209
0:10:10.94,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And a normal mouse will explore.

210
0:10:14.66,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It will be social.

211
0:10:16.62,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Check out what's going on.

212
0:10:18.02,000 --> 0:10:2,000
If you stress a mouse in this depression model,

213
0:10:20.94,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which is the middle box,

214
0:10:23.1,000 --> 0:10:24,000
they aren't social, they don't explore.

215
0:10:25.02,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They mostly just kind of hide in that back corner, behind a cup.

216
0:10:29.02,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Yet the mice that had gotten that one injection of Calypsol,

217
0:10:32.14,000 --> 0:10:33,000
here on your right,

218
0:10:34.06,000 --> 0:10:35,000
they were exploring, they were social.

219
0:10:36.74,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They looked like they had never been stressed at all,

220
0:10:40.02,000 --> 0:10:41,000
which is impossible.

221
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So we could have just stopped there,

222
0:10:44.78,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but Christine had also used Calypsol before as anesthesia,

223
0:10:49.1,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and a few years ago she had seen

224
0:10:50.7,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that it seemed to have some weird effects on cells

225
0:10:53.1,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and some other behavior

226
0:10:54.34,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that also seemed to last long after the drug,

227
0:10:57.38,000 --> 0:10:58,000
maybe a few weeks.

228
0:10:58.66,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So we were like, OK,

229
0:10:59.94,000 --> 0:11:01,000
maybe this is not completely impossible,

230
0:11:02.14,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but we were really skeptical.

231
0:11:03.66,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So we did what you do in science when you're not sure,

232
0:11:06.22,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and we ran it again.

233
0:11:08.46,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And I remember being in the animal room,

234
0:11:11.5,000 --> 0:11:14,000
moving mice from box to box to test them,

235
0:11:15.18,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and Christine was actually sitting on the floor with the computer in her lap

236
0:11:18.82,000 --> 0:11:19,000
so the mice couldn't see her,

237
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and she was analyzing the data in real time.

238
0:11:22.54,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And I remember us yelling,

239
0:11:23.94,000 --> 0:11:26,000
which you're not supposed to do in an animal room where you're testing,

240
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
because it had worked.

241
0:11:28.86,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It seemed like these mice were protected against stress,

242
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
or they were inappropriately happy, however you want to call it.

243
0:11:36.34,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And we were really excited.

244
0:11:39.82,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And then we were really skeptical, because it was too good to be true.

245
0:11:43.86,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So we ran it again.

246
0:11:45.74,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And then we ran it again in a PTSD model,

247
0:11:48.5,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and we ran it again in a physiological model,

248
0:11:50.94,000 --> 0:11:52,000
where all we did was give stress hormones.

249
0:11:53.18,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And we had our undergrads run it.

250
0:11:54.82,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And then we had our collaborators halfway across the world in France run it.

251
0:11:59.78,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And every time someone ran it, they confirmed the same thing.

252
0:12:03.02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It seemed like this one injection of Calypsol

253
0:12:05.86,000 --> 0:12:07,000
was somehow protecting against stress for weeks.

254
0:12:09.18,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And we only published this a year ago,

255
0:12:11.06,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect.

256
0:12:15.94,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So we don't know what causes depression,

257
0:12:18.46,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but we do know that stress is the initial trigger

258
0:12:22.18,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in 80 percent of cases,

259
0:12:24.54,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and depression and PTSD are different diseases,

260
0:12:26.78,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but this is something they share in common.

261
0:12:28.82,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Right? It is traumatic stress

262
0:12:30.66,000 --> 0:12:32,000
like active combat or natural disasters

263
0:12:33.58,000 --> 0:12:35,000
or community violence or sexual assault

264
0:12:36.06,000 --> 0:12:38,000
that causes post-traumatic stress disorder,

265
0:12:38.98,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and not everyone that is exposed to stress develops a mood disorder.

266
0:12:44.62,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And this ability to experience stress and be resilient

267
0:12:47.54,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and bounce back and not develop depression or PTSD

268
0:12:52.5,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is known as stress resilience,

269
0:12:54.78,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and it varies between people.

270
0:12:56.66,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property.

271
0:13:00.02,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's the absence of susceptibility factors

272
0:13:02.58,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and risk factors for these disorders.

273
0:13:05.62,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But what if it were active?

274
0:13:08.42,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Maybe we could enhance it,

275
0:13:09.94,000 --> 0:13:11,000
sort of akin to putting on armor.

276
0:13:13.22,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We had accidentally discovered the first resilience-enhancing drug.

277
0:13:18.74,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And like I said, we only gave a tiny amount of the drug,

278
0:13:21.54,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and it lasted for weeks,

279
0:13:23.14,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and that's not like anything you see with antidepressants.

280
0:13:26.38,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines.

281
0:13:31.18,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So in immune vaccines, you'll get your shots,

282
0:13:34.14,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and then weeks, months, years later,

283
0:13:37.54,000 --> 0:13:39,000
when you're actually exposed to bacteria,

284
0:13:39.9,000 --> 0:13:41,000
it's not the vaccine in your body that protects you.

285
0:13:42.38,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It's your own immune system

286
0:13:43.78,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that's developed resistance and resilience to this bacteria that fights it off,

287
0:13:47.94,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and you actually never get the infection,

288
0:13:50.1,000 --> 0:13:53,000
which is very different from, say, our treatments. Right?

289
0:13:53.18,000 --> 0:13:56,000
In that case, you get the infection, you're exposed to the bacteria,

290
0:13:57.02,000 --> 0:14:,000
you're sick, and then you take, say, an antibiotic which cures it,

291
0:14:00.9,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and those drugs are actually working to kill the bacteria.

292
0:14:04.78,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Or similar to as I said before, with this palliative,

293
0:14:07.3,000 --> 0:14:09,000
you'll take something that will suppress the symptoms,

294
0:14:10.18,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but it won't treat the underlying infection,

295
0:14:12.9,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and you'll only feel better during the time in which you're taking it,

296
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
which is why you have to keep taking it.

297
0:14:18.22,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And in depression and PTSD --

298
0:14:20.94,000 --> 0:14:21,000
here we have your stress exposure --

299
0:14:22.94,000 --> 0:14:24,000
we only have palliative care.

300
0:14:25.58,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Antidepressants only suppress symptoms,

301
0:14:28.1,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and that is why you basically have to keep taking them

302
0:14:30.98,000 --> 0:14:31,000
for the life of the disease,

303
0:14:32.7,000 --> 0:14:34,000
which is often the length of your own life.

304
0:14:35.94,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So we're calling our resilience-enhancing drugs "paravaccines,"

305
0:14:40.18,000 --> 0:14:41,000
which means vaccine-like,

306
0:14:41.74,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because it seems like they might have the potential

307
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
to protect against stress

308
0:14:46.1,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and prevent mice from developing

309
0:14:49.54,000 --> 0:14:51,000
depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

310
0:14:52.78,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Also, not all antidepressants are also paravaccines.

311
0:14:57.3,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We tried Prozac as well,

312
0:14:58.94,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and that had no effect.

313
0:15:01.06,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So if this were to translate into humans,

314
0:15:04.1,000 --> 0:15:06,000
we might be able to protect people

315
0:15:06.7,000 --> 0:15:08,000
who are predictably at risk

316
0:15:08.98,000 --> 0:15:11,000
against stress-induced disorders like depression and PTSD.

317
0:15:12.86,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So that's first responders and firefighters,

318
0:15:16.02,000 --> 0:15:2,000
refugees, prisoners and prison guards,

319
0:15:20.18,000 --> 0:15:22,000
soldiers, you name it.

320
0:15:23.22,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And to give you a sense of the scale of these diseases,

321
0:15:27.62,000 --> 0:15:3,000
in 2010, the global burden of disease

322
0:15:30.7,000 --> 0:15:33,000
was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars,

323
0:15:35.06,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and since they are chronic,

324
0:15:36.62,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that cost is compounding and is therefore expected to rise

325
0:15:39.86,000 --> 0:15:42,000
up to six trillion dollars in just the next 15 years.

326
0:15:44.46,000 --> 0:15:45,000
As I mentioned before,

327
0:15:46.064,000 --> 0:15:5,000
repurposing can be challenging because of our prior biases.

328
0:15:50.86,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Calypsol has another name,

329
0:15:53.1,000 --> 0:15:54,000
ketamine,

330
0:15:55.38,000 --> 0:15:56,000
which also goes by another name,

331
0:15:57.46,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Special K,

332
0:15:58.9,000 --> 0:16:,000
which is a club drug and drug of abuse.

333
0:16:02.54,000 --> 0:16:05,000
It's still used across the world as an anesthetic.

334
0:16:05.66,000 --> 0:16:07,000
It's used in children. We use it on the battlefield.

335
0:16:08.54,000 --> 0:16:1,000
It's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations,

336
0:16:11.54,000 --> 0:16:12,000
because it doesn't affect breathing.

337
0:16:13.42,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It is on the World Health Organization list of most essential medicines.

338
0:16:18.58,000 --> 0:16:21,000
If we had discovered ketamine as a paravaccine first,

339
0:16:22.82,000 --> 0:16:24,000
it'd be pretty easy for us to develop it,

340
0:16:25.7,000 --> 0:16:28,000
but as is, we have to compete with our functional fixedness

341
0:16:29.58,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and mental set that kind of interfere.

342
0:16:33.7,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Fortunately, it's not the only compound we have discovered

343
0:16:37.58,000 --> 0:16:4,000
that has these prophylactic, paravaccine qualities,

344
0:16:41.7,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but all of the other drugs we've discovered,

345
0:16:44.78,000 --> 0:16:46,000
or compounds if you will, they're totally new,

346
0:16:46.98,000 --> 0:16:49,000
they have to go through the entire FDA approval process --

347
0:16:50.62,000 --> 0:16:53,000
if they make it before they can ever be used in humans.

348
0:16:54.22,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And that will be years.

349
0:16:55.9,000 --> 0:16:57,000
So if we wanted something sooner,

350
0:16:58.18,000 --> 0:17:,000
ketamine is already FDA-approved.

351
0:17:00.58,000 --> 0:17:02,000
It's generic, it's available.

352
0:17:03.3,000 --> 0:17:07,000
We could develop it for a fraction of the price and a fraction of the time.

353
0:17:08.38,000 --> 0:17:12,000
But actually, beyond functional fixedness and mental set,

354
0:17:12.78,000 --> 0:17:15,000
there's a real other challenge to repurposing drugs,

355
0:17:16.38,000 --> 0:17:17,000
which is policy.

356
0:17:18.179,000 --> 0:17:2,000
There are no incentives in place

357
0:17:20.419,000 --> 0:17:23,000
once a drug is generic and off patent and no longer exclusive

358
0:17:24.179,000 --> 0:17:26,000
to encourage pharma companies to develop them,

359
0:17:26.54,000 --> 0:17:27,000
because they don't make money.

360
0:17:28.38,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And that's not true for just ketamine. That is true for all drugs.

361
0:17:32.579,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Regardless, the idea itself is completely novel in psychiatry,

362
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
to use drugs to prevent mental illness

363
0:17:42.18,000 --> 0:17:43,000
as opposed to just treat it.

364
0:17:44.74,000 --> 0:17:49,000
It is possible that 20, 50, 100 years from now,

365
0:17:49.82,000 --> 0:17:53,000
we will look back now at depression and PTSD

366
0:17:53.94,000 --> 0:17:56,000
the way we look back at tuberculosis sanitoriums

367
0:17:57.18,000 --> 0:17:58,000
as a thing of the past.

368
0:17:59.18,000 --> 0:18:04,000
This could be the beginning of the end of the mental health epidemic.

369
0:18:05.38,000 --> 0:18:08,000
But as a great scientist once said,

370
0:18:09.9,000 --> 0:18:11,000
"Only a fool is sure of anything.

371
0:18:12.18,000 --> 0:18:14,000
A wise man keeps on guessing."

372
0:18:16.044,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Thank you, guys.

373
0:18:17.78,000 --> 0:18:21,000

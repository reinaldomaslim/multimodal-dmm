0:00:18.437,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Guitar music)

2
0:00:27.126,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was just thinking

3
0:00:32.118,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that I have been missing you way too long

4
0:00:37.526,000 --> 0:00:42,000
There's something inside this weary head

5
0:00:42.718,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that wants us to love just instead

6
0:00:47.768,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But I was just thinking,

7
0:00:52.801,000 --> 0:00:56,000
merely thinking

8
0:01:00.345,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I've got loads of pictures,

9
0:01:05.912,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I've got the one of you in that dancing dress

10
0:01:11.079,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But man I feel silly in that dim light

11
0:01:16.221,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Just after doing you by the sight of my Kodak delights,

12
0:01:21.678,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I am sinking,

13
0:01:26.074,000 --> 0:01:29,000
merely sinking

14
0:01:33.535,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe

15
0:01:39.892,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I'm a singer without a song

16
0:01:44.834,000 --> 0:01:46,000
If I wait for you longer

17
0:01:47.369,000 --> 0:01:5,000
my affection is stronger

18
0:01:50.823,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I ... I was just thinking,

19
0:01:59.28,000 --> 0:02:01,000
merely thinking

20
0:02:04.203,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that this boat is sinking

21
0:02:19.493,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I'm tired of postcards,

22
0:02:25.089,000 --> 0:02:29,000
especially the ones with cute dogs and cupids

23
0:02:30.527,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I'm tired of calling you and missing you

24
0:02:34.934,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and dreaming I slept with you

25
0:02:37.839,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Don't get me wrong I still desperately love you

26
0:02:42.123,000 --> 0:02:45,000
inside this weary head

27
0:02:45.9,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I just want us to love just instead

28
0:02:50.584,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But I was just thinking and thinking,

29
0:02:56.437,000 --> 0:02:59,000
merely thinking

30
0:03:04.079,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe

31
0:03:10.314,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and time is running me still

32
0:03:15.064,000 --> 0:03:17,000
If I wait for you longer

33
0:03:17.668,000 --> 0:03:2,000
my affection is stronger

34
0:03:21.626,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I ... I was just thinking

35
0:03:30.873,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I ... I was just thinking

36
0:03:39.315,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that I'm tired of calling you once a week

37
0:03:43.655,000 --> 0:03:49,000
thinking of long distance rates instead of kissing you

38
0:03:50.005,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So baby I'm sinking,

39
0:03:55.928,000 --> 0:03:57,000
merely sinking

40
0:03:59.788,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Guitar music ends)

41
0:04:02.55,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Applause)

42
0:04:09.865,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Thank you.

43
0:04:12.403,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Singing is sharing.

44
0:04:16.314,000 --> 0:04:2,000
When you sing, you have to know what you're talking about intimately,

45
0:04:20.632,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and you have to be willing to share this insight

46
0:04:23.942,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and give away a piece of yourself.

47
0:04:26.055,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I look for this intention to share in everything,

48
0:04:30.592,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and I ask: what are the intentions behind this architecture or this product

49
0:04:36.223,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or this restaurant or this meal?

50
0:04:38.896,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And if your intentions are to impress people

51
0:04:42.004,000 --> 0:04:44,000
or to get the big applause at the end,

52
0:04:44.634,000 --> 0:04:46,000
then you are taking, not giving.

53
0:04:48.193,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And this is a song that's about --

54
0:04:50.686,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it's the kind of song that everyone has their version of.

55
0:04:53.408,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This song is called "Home,"

56
0:04:55.596,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and it's sort of a "This is where I'm from, nice to meet you all,"

57
0:04:59.366,000 --> 0:05:,000
kind of song.

58
0:05:00.542,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

59
0:05:02.763,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

60
0:05:09.186,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Piano music)

61
0:05:55.179,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Home is the sound of birds early in the morning

62
0:06:01.865,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Home is a song I've always remembered

63
0:06:06.569,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Home is the memory of my first day in school

64
0:06:11.588,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Home is the books that I carry around

65
0:06:16.251,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Home is an alley in a faraway town

66
0:06:20.756,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Home is the places I’ve been and where I’d like to go

67
0:06:30.742,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Home

68
0:06:32.981,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I'm always gonna feel at home

69
0:06:37.275,000 --> 0:06:41,000
No matter where I may roam

70
0:06:41.909,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I'm always gonna find my way back home

71
0:06:46.25,000 --> 0:06:49,000
No matter how far I’m gone

72
0:06:50.075,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I’m always gonna feel this longing

73
0:06:57.027,000 --> 0:07:02,000
No matter where I might stay

74
0:07:07.84,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Home is a feather twirling in the air

75
0:07:12.719,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Home is flowers in a windowsill

76
0:07:17.852,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Home is all the things she said to me

77
0:07:22.751,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Home is a photo I never threw away

78
0:07:27.481,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Home is the smile on my face when I die

79
0:07:32.775,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Home is the taste of an apple pie

80
0:07:44.175,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I met a woman, she always lived in the same place

81
0:07:51.929,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And she said home is where you’re born and raised

82
0:08:00.72,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And I met a man, he sat looking out to the sea

83
0:08:07.716,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And he said home is where you want to be

84
0:08:16.72,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I met a girl in some downtown bar

85
0:08:23.877,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And she said I'll have whatever he's having

86
0:08:32.231,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And I asked her how come we never met before?

87
0:08:38.487,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And she said all my life I’ve been trying

88
0:08:45.37,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to get a place of my own

89
0:08:49.582,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I’m always gonna feel at home

90
0:08:53.85,000 --> 0:08:56,000
No matter where I may roam

91
0:08:58.519,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Always gonna find my way back home

92
0:09:02.801,000 --> 0:09:05,000
No matter how far I’m gone

93
0:09:06.816,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I'm always gonna feel this longing

94
0:09:13.517,000 --> 0:09:18,000
No matter where I might stay

95
0:09:22.033,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Piano music)

96
0:10:28.84,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Piano music ends)

97
0:10:37.2,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Applause)

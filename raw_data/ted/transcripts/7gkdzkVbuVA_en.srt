1
0:00:15.902,000 --> 0:00:18,000
People are living longer and societies are getting grayer.

2
0:00:20.373,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You hear about it all the time.

3
0:00:22.245,000 --> 0:00:23,000
You read about it in your newspapers.

4
0:00:24.048,000 --> 0:00:26,000
You hear about it on your television sets.

5
0:00:26.418,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Sometimes, I'm concerned

6
0:00:27.706,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that we hear about it so much that we've come to accept longer lives

7
0:00:32.338,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with a kind of a complacency, even ease.

8
0:00:37.203,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But make no mistake, longer lives can --

9
0:00:41.509,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and, I believe, will improve quality of life at all ages.

10
0:00:48.956,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now to put this in perspective, let me just zoom out for a minute.

11
0:00:53.084,000 --> 0:00:58,000
More years were added to average life expectancy in the 20th century

12
0:01:00.154,000 --> 0:01:06,000
than all years added across all prior millennia

13
0:01:07.085,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of human evolution combined.

14
0:01:10.535,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In the blink of an eye,

15
0:01:12.087,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we nearly doubled the length of time that we're living.

16
0:01:16.685,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So if you ever feel like you don't have this aging thing quite pegged,

17
0:01:20.012,000 --> 0:01:21,000
don't kick yourself.

18
0:01:21.35,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It's brand new.

19
0:01:23.887,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And because fertility rates fell across that very same period

20
0:01:28.062,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that life expectancy was going up,

21
0:01:31.857,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population,

22
0:01:37.472,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people

23
0:01:42.522,000 --> 0:01:44,000
who make it and survive to old age,

24
0:01:44.783,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is being reshaped into a rectangle.

25
0:01:50.728,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And now, if you're the kind of person

26
0:01:52.56,000 --> 0:01:54,000
who can get chills from population statistics,

27
0:01:54.941,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:55.988,000 --> 0:01:56,000
these are the ones that should do it.

29
0:01:57.806,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Because what that means

30
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is that for the first time in the history of the species,

31
0:02:03.124,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the majority of babies born in the developed world

32
0:02:06.918,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are having the opportunity to grow old.

33
0:02:12.671,000 --> 0:02:13,000
How did this happen?

34
0:02:14.698,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, we're no genetically hardier than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago.

35
0:02:19.238,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture --

36
0:02:24.082,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the crucible that holds science and technology

37
0:02:27.799,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and wide-scale changes in behavior that improve health and well-being.

38
0:02:34.419,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Through cultural changes, our ancestors largely eliminated early death

39
0:02:40.727,000 --> 0:02:42,000
so that people can now live out their full lives.

40
0:02:44.784,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now there are problems associated with aging --

41
0:02:47.753,000 --> 0:02:49,000
diseases, poverty, loss of social status.

42
0:02:50.068,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It's hardly time to rest on our laurels.

43
0:02:53.031,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But the more we learn about aging,

44
0:02:55.131,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course

45
0:02:59.194,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is grossly inaccurate.

46
0:03:02.214,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Aging brings some rather remarkable improvements --

47
0:03:05.506,000 --> 0:03:07,000
increased knowledge, expertise --

48
0:03:09.365,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and emotional aspects of life improve.

49
0:03:15.64,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That's right, older people are happy.

50
0:03:19.788,000 --> 0:03:22,000
They're happier than middle-aged people, and younger people, certainly.

51
0:03:23.41,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

52
0:03:24.616,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Study after study is coming to the same conclusion.

53
0:03:27.754,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The CDC recently conducted a survey

54
0:03:30.61,000 --> 0:03:32,000
where they asked respondents simply to tell them

55
0:03:33.518,000 --> 0:03:36,000
whether they experienced significant psychological distress

56
0:03:36.657,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in the previous week.

57
0:03:37.843,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And fewer older people answered affirmatively to that question

58
0:03:41.501,000 --> 0:03:43,000
than middle-aged people, and younger people as well.

59
0:03:45.126,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And a recent Gallup poll asked participants

60
0:03:48.115,000 --> 0:03:52,000
how much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day.

61
0:03:52.918,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And stress, worry, anger

62
0:03:57.491,000 --> 0:03:58,000
all decrease with age.

63
0:04:00.867,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now social scientists call this the paradox of aging.

64
0:04:03.897,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I mean, after all, aging is not a piece of cake.

65
0:04:07.351,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So we've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding.

66
0:04:12.659,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people

67
0:04:18.601,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are and always have been the greatest generations.

68
0:04:21.869,000 --> 0:04:24,000
That is that younger people today may not typically experience

69
0:04:25.561,000 --> 0:04:27,000
these improvements as they grow older.

70
0:04:28.487,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We've asked,

71
0:04:29.835,000 --> 0:04:32,000
well, maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin

72
0:04:33.802,000 --> 0:04:35,000
on an otherwise depressing existence.

73
0:04:36.239,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:38.01,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But the more we've tried to disavow this finding,

75
0:04:40.887,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the more evidence we find to support it.

76
0:04:44.806,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Years ago, my colleagues and I embarked on a study

77
0:04:47.165,000 --> 0:04:5,000
where we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period.

78
0:04:50.277,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Originally, the sample was aged 18 to 94.

79
0:04:53.754,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed

80
0:04:57.117,000 --> 0:04:58,000
as they grew older.

81
0:04:59.046,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Our participants would carry electronic pagers

82
0:05:02.381,000 --> 0:05:03,000
for a week at a time,

83
0:05:03.906,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times.

84
0:05:07.229,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And every time we paged them,

85
0:05:09.043,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we'd ask them to answer several questions --

86
0:05:11.119,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"On a one to seven scale, how happy are you right now?"

87
0:05:14.208,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"How sad are you right now?"

88
0:05:15.717,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"How frustrated are you right now?" --

89
0:05:17.892,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having

90
0:05:22.15,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in their day-to-day lives.

91
0:05:24.309,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And using this intense study of individuals,

92
0:05:27.627,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we find that it's not one particular generation

93
0:05:31.505,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that's doing better than the others,

94
0:05:33.79,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but the same individuals over time

95
0:05:36.688,000 --> 0:05:4,000
come to report relatively greater positive experience.

96
0:05:41.571,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages.

97
0:05:46.033,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And there is a slight downturn.

98
0:05:47.694,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood.

99
0:05:53.888,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now it's really too simplistic to say that older people are "happy."

100
0:06:01.929,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In our study, they are more positive.

101
0:06:05.088,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But they're also more likely than younger people

102
0:06:07.429,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to experience mixed emotions --

103
0:06:09.626,000 --> 0:06:11,000
sadness at the same time you experience happiness;

104
0:06:12.267,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you know, that tear in the eye when you're smiling at a friend.

105
0:06:16.894,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness

106
0:06:21.561,000 --> 0:06:22,000
more comfortably.

107
0:06:22.991,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They're more accepting of sadness than younger people are.

108
0:06:25.899,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And we suspect that this may help to explain

109
0:06:28.516,000 --> 0:06:3,000
why older people are better than younger people

110
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
at solving hotly charged emotional conflicts and debates.

111
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Older people can view injustice with compassion,

112
0:06:42.22,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but not despair.

113
0:06:44.619,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And all things being equal,

114
0:06:46.38,000 --> 0:06:5,000
older people direct their cognitive resources, like attention and memory,

115
0:06:50.495,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to positive information more than negative.

116
0:06:53.876,000 --> 0:06:56,000
If we show older, middle-aged, younger people images,

117
0:06:57.252,000 --> 0:06:58,000
like the ones you see on the screen,

118
0:06:59.958,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and we later ask them to recall all the images that they can,

119
0:07:05.145,000 --> 0:07:07,000
older people, but not younger people,

120
0:07:07.528,000 --> 0:07:1,000
remember more positive images than negative images.

121
0:07:11.912,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We've asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies,

122
0:07:16.074,000 --> 0:07:17,000
some frowning, some smiling.

123
0:07:17.974,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Older people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning, angry faces.

124
0:07:24.517,000 --> 0:07:29,000
In day-to-day life, this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction.

125
0:07:31.793,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But as social scientists, we continue to ask about possible alternatives.

126
0:07:36.106,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We've said, well, maybe older people report more positive emotions

127
0:07:39.784,000 --> 0:07:41,000
because they're cognitively impaired.

128
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

129
0:07:46.136,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We've said, could it be

130
0:07:47.391,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions,

131
0:07:51.009,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and so you switch to the positive emotions?

132
0:07:54.202,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Maybe our neural centers in our brain

133
0:07:56.361,000 --> 0:08:,000
are degraded such that we're unable to process negative emotions anymore.

134
0:08:00.832,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But that's not the case.

135
0:08:02.874,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The most mentally sharp older adults

136
0:08:06.134,000 --> 0:08:09,000
are the ones who show this positivity effect the most.

137
0:08:10.209,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And under conditions where it really matters,

138
0:08:12.515,000 --> 0:08:14,000
older people do process the negative information

139
0:08:15.067,000 --> 0:08:17,000
just as well as the positive information.

140
0:08:17.618,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So how can this be?

141
0:08:21.136,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Well, in our research,

142
0:08:23.217,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally

143
0:08:27.232,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in the uniquely human ability to monitor time --

144
0:08:30.473,000 --> 0:08:33,000
not just clock time and calendar time, but lifetime.

145
0:08:34.468,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And if there's a paradox of aging,

146
0:08:36.93,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it's that recognizing that we won't live forever

147
0:08:39.956,000 --> 0:08:43,000
changes our perspective on life in positive ways.

148
0:08:45.464,000 --> 0:08:49,000
When time horizons are long and nebulous, as they typically are in youth,

149
0:08:50.294,000 --> 0:08:51,000
people are constantly preparing,

150
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
trying to soak up all the information they possibly can,

151
0:08:56.039,000 --> 0:08:58,000
taking risks, exploring.

152
0:08:58.309,000 --> 0:09:,000
We might spend time with people we don't even like

153
0:09:01.276,000 --> 0:09:03,000
because it's somehow interesting.

154
0:09:03.399,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We might learn something unexpected.

155
0:09:05.619,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

156
0:09:07.703,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We go on blind dates.

157
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

158
0:09:12.537,000 --> 0:09:13,000
You know, after all,

159
0:09:13.731,000 --> 0:09:15,000
if it doesn't work out, there's always tomorrow.

160
0:09:17.381,000 --> 0:09:19,000
People over 50 don't go on blind dates.

161
0:09:19.982,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

162
0:09:27.274,000 --> 0:09:32,000
As we age, our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change.

163
0:09:33.602,000 --> 0:09:35,000
When we recognize that we don't have all the time in the world,

164
0:09:36.618,000 --> 0:09:38,000
we see our priorities most clearly.

165
0:09:39.489,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We take less notice of trivial matters.

166
0:09:42.234,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We savor life.

167
0:09:44.4,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We're more appreciative,

168
0:09:46.042,000 --> 0:09:47,000
more open to reconciliation.

169
0:09:48.721,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We invest in more emotionally important parts of life,

170
0:09:51.575,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and life gets better,

171
0:09:54.684,000 --> 0:09:56,000
so we're happier day-to-day.

172
0:09:57.565,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But that same shift in perspective

173
0:09:59.529,000 --> 0:10:03,000
leads us to have less tolerance than ever for injustice.

174
0:10:05.321,000 --> 0:10:06,000
By 2015,

175
0:10:07.397,000 --> 0:10:09,000
there will be more people in the United States

176
0:10:10.059,000 --> 0:10:13,000
over the age of 60 than under 15.

177
0:10:15.279,000 --> 0:10:19,000
What will happen to societies that are top-heavy with older people?

178
0:10:20.623,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The numbers won't determine the outcome.

179
0:10:24.47,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Culture will.

180
0:10:27.463,000 --> 0:10:3,000
If we invest in science and technology

181
0:10:30.592,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and find solutions for the real problems that older people face

182
0:10:35.444,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and we capitalize on the very real strengths of older people,

183
0:10:42.1,000 --> 0:10:47,000
then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages.

184
0:10:49.157,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Societies with millions of talented, emotionally stable citizens

185
0:10:53.648,000 --> 0:10:57,000
who are healthier and better educated than any generations before them,

186
0:10:58.599,000 --> 0:11:01,000
armed with knowledge about the practical matters of life

187
0:11:02.449,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and motivated to solve the big issues

188
0:11:07.556,000 --> 0:11:11,000
can be better societies than we have ever known.

189
0:11:14.55,000 --> 0:11:17,000
My father, who is 92, likes to say,

190
0:11:19.038,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"Let's stop talking only about how to save the old folks

191
0:11:22.71,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and start talking about how to get them to save us all."

192
0:11:29.097,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Thank you.

193
0:11:30.561,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25.7,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant.

2
0:00:30.7,000 --> 0:00:4,000
After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed,

3
0:00:40.7,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and feel that you are one of the great hopes --

4
0:00:46.7,000 --> 0:00:52,000
not just for American achievement in science and technology,

5
0:00:53.7,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but for the whole world.

6
0:00:55.7,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency,

7
0:01:03.7,000 --> 0:01:12,000
which are the 10-to-the-18th-power -- that's a million trillion --

8
0:01:12.7,000 --> 0:01:26,000
insects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them.

9
0:01:26.7,000 --> 0:01:32,000
If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet --

10
0:01:32.7,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which we are trying hard to do --

11
0:01:36.7,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land.

12
0:01:45.7,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And within a few months.

13
0:01:47.7,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy?

14
0:01:53.7,000 --> 0:01:59,000
As a little boy, and through my teenage years,

15
0:01:59.7,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life.

16
0:02:02.7,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period

17
0:02:14.7,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and finally and definitively, an ant period.

18
0:02:18.7,000 --> 0:02:23,000
By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist,

19
0:02:23.7,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a specialist on the biology of ants,

20
0:02:25.7,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but my attention and research continued to make journeys

21
0:02:30.7,000 --> 0:02:34,000
across the great variety of life on Earth in general --

22
0:02:34.7,000 --> 0:02:42,000
including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it

23
0:02:42.7,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it.

24
0:02:49.7,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition,

25
0:02:54.7,000 --> 0:02:59,000
crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you.

26
0:02:59.7,000 --> 0:03:04,000
My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment

27
0:03:04.7,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula.

28
0:03:11.7,000 --> 0:03:2,000
As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region

29
0:03:20.7,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.

30
0:03:26.7,000 --> 0:03:3,000
One day when I was only seven years old and fishing,

31
0:03:30.7,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast,

32
0:03:38.7,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and I blinded myself in one eye.

33
0:03:40.7,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing,

34
0:03:43.7,000 --> 0:03:46,000
possibly congenitally, in the upper registers.

35
0:03:46.7,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So in planning to be a professional naturalist --

36
0:03:51.7,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I never considered anything else in my entire life --

37
0:03:54.7,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either.

38
0:04:02.7,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So I turned to the teeming small creatures

39
0:04:06.7,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that can be held between the thumb and forefinger:

40
0:04:11.7,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems,

41
0:04:18.7,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the little things, as I like to say, who run the world.

42
0:04:23.7,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich,

43
0:04:31.7,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that it seemed as though it exists on another planet.

44
0:04:37.7,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.

45
0:04:41.7,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.

46
0:04:46.7,000 --> 0:04:52,000
In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world

47
0:04:52.7,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and advances in technology,

48
0:04:54.7,000 --> 0:05:04,000
biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species,

49
0:05:04.7,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to bring the current total to 5,400,

50
0:05:08.7,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and more continue to pour in.

51
0:05:10.7,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes,

52
0:05:16.7,000 --> 0:05:2,000
dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant --

53
0:05:20.7,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and even a distinct kind of gorilla.

54
0:05:23.7,000 --> 0:05:33,000
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria,

55
0:05:33.7,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam --

56
0:05:39.7,000 --> 0:05:48,000
although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth,

57
0:05:48.7,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.

58
0:05:55.7,000 --> 0:05:59,000
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner

59
0:05:59.7,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms --

60
0:06:04.7,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy.

61
0:06:10.7,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.

62
0:06:14.7,000 --> 0:06:19,000
These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet.

63
0:06:19.7,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.

64
0:06:26.7,000 --> 0:06:3,000
60,000 species are known to science,

65
0:06:30.7,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.

66
0:06:34.7,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.

67
0:06:40.7,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms --

68
0:06:48.7,000 --> 0:06:52,000
if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,

69
0:06:52.7,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.

70
0:06:59.7,000 --> 0:07:04,000
About 16,000 species of nematode worms

71
0:07:04.7,000 --> 0:07:07,000
have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists;

72
0:07:07.7,000 --> 0:07:12,000
there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown.

73
0:07:12.7,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further

74
0:07:17.7,000 --> 0:07:23,000
by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria,

75
0:07:23.7,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which within just the last several years

76
0:07:29.7,000 --> 0:07:36,000
still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide.

77
0:07:36.7,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil,

78
0:07:42.7,000 --> 0:07:51,000
just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.

79
0:07:51.7,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil --

80
0:07:56.7,000 --> 0:08:04,000
contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.

81
0:08:04.7,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So the question is: what are they all doing?

82
0:08:12.7,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The fact is, we don't know.

83
0:08:15.7,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment,

84
0:08:24.7,000 --> 0:08:28,000
done by faith and guess alone.

85
0:08:28.7,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Our lives depend upon these creatures.

86
0:08:32.7,000 --> 0:08:4,000
To take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known --

87
0:08:40.7,000 --> 0:08:45,000
friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat

88
0:08:45.7,000 --> 0:08:52,000
probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.

89
0:08:52.7,000 --> 0:08:56,000
At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film

90
0:08:56.7,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that was made especially for this occasion.

91
0:08:58.7,000 --> 0:09:,000
And I'd like to show it.

92
0:09:01.7,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Assisted in this by Billie Holiday.

93
0:09:04.7,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Video)

94
0:11:06.7,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And that may be just the beginning!

95
0:11:09.7,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages,

96
0:11:15.7,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria,

97
0:11:22.7,000 --> 0:11:31,000
are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.

98
0:11:31.7,000 --> 0:11:35,000
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,

99
0:11:35.7,000 --> 0:11:39,000
although they're obviously of enormous importance to us.

100
0:11:39.7,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses

101
0:11:45.7,000 --> 0:11:52,000
exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.

102
0:11:53.7,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,

103
0:11:57.7,000 --> 0:12:03,000
scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.

104
0:12:03.7,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology.

105
0:12:08.7,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.

106
0:12:15.7,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs --

107
0:12:21.7,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface

108
0:12:27.7,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars.

109
0:12:31.7,000 --> 0:12:39,000
What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously?

110
0:12:39.7,000 --> 0:12:44,000
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants

111
0:12:44.7,000 --> 0:12:5,000
to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond

112
0:12:50.7,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world

113
0:12:55.7,000 --> 0:12:59,000
enveloped and living within humanity?

114
0:12:59.7,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations

115
0:13:05.7,000 --> 0:13:11,000
have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms:

116
0:13:11.7,000 --> 0:13:15,000
true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea,

117
0:13:15.7,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.

118
0:13:22.7,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them,

119
0:13:27.7,000 --> 0:13:36,000
have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,

120
0:13:36.7,000 --> 0:13:41,000
one might -- just might -- find aliens among them.

121
0:13:41.7,000 --> 0:13:46,000
True aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.

122
0:13:46.7,000 --> 0:13:48,000
They've had billions of years to do it,

123
0:13:48.7,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.

124
0:13:55.7,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin

125
0:13:59.7,000 --> 0:14:07,000
are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature

126
0:14:07.7,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and other harsh changes in environment,

127
0:14:10.7,000 --> 0:14:18,000
including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels

128
0:14:18.7,000 --> 0:14:21,000
around the growing population of bacteria.

129
0:14:21.7,000 --> 0:14:27,000
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically

130
0:14:27.7,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities

131
0:14:33.7,000 --> 0:14:37,000
hardly worth distinguishing one from the other.

132
0:14:37.7,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,

133
0:14:42.7,000 --> 0:14:44,000
are masterpieces of evolution.

134
0:14:44.7,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years.

135
0:14:50.7,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,

136
0:14:54.7,000 --> 0:15:01,000
interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend

137
0:15:01.7,000 --> 0:15:05,000
in ways we have not begun even to imagine.

138
0:15:05.7,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them

139
0:15:09.7,000 --> 0:15:12,000
at the peril of our own existence --

140
0:15:12.7,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.

141
0:15:21.7,000 --> 0:15:31,000
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,

142
0:15:31.7,000 --> 0:15:34,000
searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba,

143
0:15:35.7,000 --> 0:15:37,000
ants that shine in the sunlight --

144
0:15:37.7,000 --> 0:15:45,000
metallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.

145
0:15:45.7,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains

146
0:15:50.7,000 --> 0:15:54,000
where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on,

147
0:15:54.7,000 --> 0:16:,000
and were then -- and still are -- being cut back.

148
0:16:00.7,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I realized then that these species

149
0:16:03.7,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island --

150
0:16:09.7,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and this is true of practically every part of the world --

151
0:16:14.7,000 --> 0:16:19,000
which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever.

152
0:16:19.7,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And so it is everywhere one looks.

153
0:16:24.7,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces

154
0:16:32.7,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo.

155
0:16:37.7,000 --> 0:16:44,000
H is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases.

156
0:16:44.7,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses

157
0:16:52.7,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate -- that's the I.

158
0:17:03.7,000 --> 0:17:07,000
The P, the first one in "HIPPO," is for pollution.

159
0:17:07.7,000 --> 0:17:13,000
The second is for continued population, human population expansion.

160
0:17:13.7,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And the final letter is O, for over-harvesting --

161
0:17:16.7,000 --> 0:17:2,000
driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.

162
0:17:20.7,000 --> 0:17:26,000
The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined --

163
0:17:26.7,000 --> 0:17:3,000
according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research --

164
0:17:30.7,000 --> 0:17:35,000
to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species

165
0:17:35.7,000 --> 0:17:4,000
to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.

166
0:17:40.7,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Human-forced climate change alone -- again, if unabated --

167
0:17:45.7,000 --> 0:17:51,000
could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades.

168
0:17:51.7,000 --> 0:17:55,000
What will we and all future generations lose

169
0:17:55.7,000 --> 0:17:59,000
if much of the living environment is thus degraded?

170
0:18:01.7,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered,

171
0:18:05.7,000 --> 0:18:09,000
much of our environmental stability

172
0:18:09.7,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value --

173
0:18:16.7,000 --> 0:18:19,000
all thrown away.

174
0:18:19.7,000 --> 0:18:22,000
The loss will inflict a heavy price

175
0:18:22.7,000 --> 0:18:29,000
in wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come,

176
0:18:29.7,000 --> 0:18:31,000
because previous cataclysms of this kind --

177
0:18:31.7,000 --> 0:18:33,000
the last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs --

178
0:18:34.7,000 --> 0:18:4,000
took, normally, five to 10 million years to repair.

179
0:18:40.7,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Sadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete

180
0:18:44.7,000 --> 0:18:49,000
that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered.

181
0:18:49.7,000 --> 0:18:58,000
For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently

182
0:18:58.7,000 --> 0:19:05,000
actually has been found to be only partial in coverage;

183
0:19:05.7,000 --> 0:19:1,000
it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.

184
0:19:10.7,000 --> 0:19:17,000
Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.

185
0:19:17.7,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril,"

186
0:19:23.7,000 --> 0:19:25,000
that is, in danger of extinction.

187
0:19:25.7,000 --> 0:19:27,000
That's in the United States.

188
0:19:27.7,000 --> 0:19:34,000
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.

189
0:19:34.7,000 --> 0:19:36,000
We urgently need to change this.

190
0:19:36.7,000 --> 0:19:4,000
We need to have the biosphere properly explored

191
0:19:40.7,000 --> 0:19:44,000
so that we can understand and competently manage it.

192
0:19:44.7,000 --> 0:19:48,000
We need to settle down before we wreck the planet.

193
0:19:48.7,000 --> 0:19:49,000
And we need that knowledge.

194
0:19:49.7,000 --> 0:19:54,000
This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project.

195
0:19:54.7,000 --> 0:19:59,000
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable.

196
0:19:59.7,000 --> 0:20:03,000
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,

197
0:20:03.7,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.

198
0:20:06.7,000 --> 0:20:12,000
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools

199
0:20:12.7,000 --> 0:20:16,000
that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity.

200
0:20:16.7,000 --> 0:20:2,000
And let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life."

201
0:20:20.7,000 --> 0:20:24,000
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold

202
0:20:24.7,000 --> 0:20:28,000
and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?

203
0:20:28.7,000 --> 0:20:31,000
It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet

204
0:20:31.7,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.

205
0:20:36.7,000 --> 0:20:39,000
Amateurs can do it also.

206
0:20:39.7,000 --> 0:20:44,000
It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species.

207
0:20:44.7,000 --> 0:20:5,000
It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone,

208
0:20:50.7,000 --> 0:20:52,000
on demand, anywhere in the world.

209
0:20:52.7,000 --> 0:20:56,000
I've written about this idea before,

210
0:20:56.7,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.

211
0:21:03.7,000 --> 0:21:11,000
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,

212
0:21:11.7,000 --> 0:21:13,000
science has advanced.

213
0:21:13.7,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Technology has moved forward.

214
0:21:16.7,000 --> 0:21:2,000
Today, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia,

215
0:21:20.7,000 --> 0:21:26,000
regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.

216
0:21:26.7,000 --> 0:21:3,000
Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions

217
0:21:30.7,000 --> 0:21:34,000
have begun mobilizing to realize this dream.

218
0:21:34.7,000 --> 0:21:37,000
I wish you would help them.

219
0:21:37.7,000 --> 0:21:4,000
Working together, we can make this real.

220
0:21:41.7,000 --> 0:21:46,000
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications.

221
0:21:46.7,000 --> 0:21:52,000
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.

222
0:21:52.7,000 --> 0:21:58,000
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.

223
0:21:58.7,000 --> 0:22:03,000
And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists

224
0:22:03.7,000 --> 0:22:08,000
to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago:

225
0:22:08.7,000 --> 0:22:13,000
to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.

226
0:22:13.7,000 --> 0:22:15,000
That is my wish. Thank you.

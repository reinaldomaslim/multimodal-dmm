1
0:00:12.82,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Twenty-eight years ago, I was a broken man.

2
0:00:16.58,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And you probably wouldn't be able to tell that if you met me.

3
0:00:20.06,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I had a good job at a well-respected academic institution.

4
0:00:24.66,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I dressed well, of course.

5
0:00:27.58,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But my insides were rotting away.

6
0:00:30.46,000 --> 0:00:32,000
You see, I grew up in a family riddled with addiction,

7
0:00:34.46,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and as a kid, I also struggled

8
0:00:35.944,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with coming to terms with my own sexuality.

9
0:00:38.74,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And even though I couldn't name it then,

10
0:00:41.1,000 --> 0:00:43,000
growing up as a gay kid

11
0:00:43.14,000 --> 0:00:46,000
just compounded my issues of isolation and insecurities.

12
0:00:48.34,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But drinking took all of that away.

13
0:00:52.66,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Like many, I drank at an early age.

14
0:00:56.66,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I continued to drink my way through college.

15
0:00:59.66,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And when I finally did come out in the early 1980s,

16
0:01:02.5,000 --> 0:01:04,000
about the only places to meet other gay people,

17
0:01:05.34,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to socialize,

18
0:01:07.34,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to be yourself, were gay bars.

19
0:01:10.18,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And what do you do in gay bars?

20
0:01:12.3,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You drink.

21
0:01:13.9,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I did --

22
0:01:15.54,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a lot.

23
0:01:17.58,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My story is not unique.

24
0:01:19.78,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Like millions of Americans, my disease progressed undiagnosed.

25
0:01:24.22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It took me to people and places and things

26
0:01:26.22,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that I never would have chosen.

27
0:01:29.02,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It wasn't until an intersection with the law

28
0:01:31.86,000 --> 0:01:34,000
gave me an "opportunity" to get care,

29
0:01:35.7,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that I began my journey of recovery.

30
0:01:38.82,000 --> 0:01:42,000
My journey of recovery has been filled with love and with joy,

31
0:01:43.78,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but it hasn't been without pain.

32
0:01:45.78,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Like many of you, I've lost too many friends and family to this disease.

33
0:01:49.78,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I've heard too many heartbreaking stories

34
0:01:51.74,000 --> 0:01:53,000
of people who've lost loved ones to addiction.

35
0:01:54.58,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And I've also lost countless friends to HIV and AIDS.

36
0:01:58.98,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Our current opioid epidemic and the AIDS epidemic

37
0:02:02.54,000 --> 0:02:03,000
tragically have much in common.

38
0:02:05.86,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Right now, we are in the midst of one of the greatest health crises of our time.

39
0:02:11.1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
During 2014 alone, 28,000 people

40
0:02:15.46,000 --> 0:02:19,000
died of drug overdoses associated with prescription drugs and heroin.

41
0:02:21.98,000 --> 0:02:25,000
During the 1980s, scores of people were dying from HIV and AIDS.

42
0:02:27.62,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Public officials ignored it.

43
0:02:30.34,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Some wouldn't even utter the words.

44
0:02:33.62,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They didn't want treatment.

45
0:02:36.1,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And tragically, there are many parallels with our current epidemic.

46
0:02:40.54,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Some called it the gay plague.

47
0:02:43.34,000 --> 0:02:44,000
They called for quarantines.

48
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They wanted to separate the innocent victims from the rest of us.

49
0:02:51.94,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I was afraid we were losing this battle

50
0:02:54.3,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because people were blaming us for being sick.

51
0:02:58.62,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Public policy was being held hostage by stigma and fear,

52
0:03:03.7,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and also held hostage

53
0:03:04.98,000 --> 0:03:09,000
were compassion, care, research, recovery and treatment.

54
0:03:11.46,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But we changed all that.

55
0:03:14.3,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Because out of the pain of those deaths,

56
0:03:16.9,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we saw a social and political movement.

57
0:03:20.62,000 --> 0:03:23,000
AIDS galvanized us into action;

58
0:03:24.74,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to stand up, to speak up and to act out.

59
0:03:30.02,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And it also galvanized the LGBT movement.

60
0:03:34.34,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We knew we were in a battle for our lives

61
0:03:36.3,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because silence equaled death,

62
0:03:38.78,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but we changed, and we made things happen.

63
0:03:42.58,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And right now, we have the potential

64
0:03:44.9,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to see the end of HIV/AIDS in our lifetime.

65
0:03:50.3,000 --> 0:03:52,000
These changes came in no small part

66
0:03:53.14,000 --> 0:03:56,000
by the courageous, yet simple decision

67
0:03:56.98,000 --> 0:03:57,000
for people to come out

68
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to their neighbors, to their friends, to their families

69
0:04:05.3,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and to their coworkers.

70
0:04:08.38,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Years ago, I was a volunteer for the Names Project.

71
0:04:12.02,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This was an effort started by Cleve Jones in San Francisco

72
0:04:15.42,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to show that people who died of AIDS

73
0:04:17.42,000 --> 0:04:18,000
had names

74
0:04:19.38,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and faces and families

75
0:04:23.14,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and people who loved them.

76
0:04:26.94,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I still recall unfolding the AIDS memorial quilt

77
0:04:32.74,000 --> 0:04:37,000
on the National Mall on a brilliant day in October, 1988.

78
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So fast forward to 2015.

79
0:04:46.3,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The Supreme Court's decision to strike down the ban on same-sex marriage.

80
0:04:51.58,000 --> 0:04:54,000
My husband, Dave, and I walk over to the steps of the Supreme Court

81
0:04:54.78,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to celebrate that decision with so many other people,

82
0:04:57.74,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I couldn't help but think how far we came around LGBT rights

83
0:05:03.14,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and yet how far we needed to go around issues of addiction.

84
0:05:09.94,000 --> 0:05:1,000
When I was nominated by President Obama

85
0:05:11.82,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to be his Director of Drug Policy,

86
0:05:14.02,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I was very open about my recovery and about the fact that I was a gay man.

87
0:05:18.54,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And at no point during my confirmation process --

88
0:05:20.9,000 --> 0:05:21,000
at least that I know of --

89
0:05:22.46,000 --> 0:05:25,000
did the fact that I was a gay man come to bear on my candidacy

90
0:05:26.46,000 --> 0:05:27,000
or my fitness to do this job.

91
0:05:29.58,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But my addiction did.

92
0:05:32.5,000 --> 0:05:35,000
At one point, a congressional staffer said that there was no way

93
0:05:35.98,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that I was going to be confirmed by the United States Senate

94
0:05:38.86,000 --> 0:05:39,000
because of my past,

95
0:05:40.46,000 --> 0:05:43,000
despite the fact that I had been in recovery for over 20 years,

96
0:05:43.9,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and despite the fact

97
0:05:45.14,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that this job takes a little bit of knowledge around addiction.

98
0:05:48.14,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:51.46,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So, you know, this is the stigma

100
0:05:54.42,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that people with substance use disorders

101
0:05:56.5,000 --> 0:05:57,000
face every single day,

102
0:05:58.7,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and you know, I have to tell you

103
0:06:00.3,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's still why I'm more comfortable coming out as a gay man

104
0:06:03.78,000 --> 0:06:05,000
than I am as a person with a history of addiction.

105
0:06:07.46,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Nearly every family in America is affected by addiction.

106
0:06:11.58,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Yet, unfortunately, too often, it's not talked about openly and honestly.

107
0:06:17.98,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's whispered about.

108
0:06:19.66,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's met with derision and scorn.

109
0:06:23.14,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We hear these stories, time and time again, on TV, online,

110
0:06:28.58,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we hear it from public officials, and we hear it from family and friends.

111
0:06:33.54,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And those of us with an addiction, we hear those voices,

112
0:06:37.38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and somehow we believe that we are less deserving of care and treatment.

113
0:06:42.86,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Today in the United States, only one in nine people

114
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
get care and treatment for their disorder.

115
0:06:48.82,000 --> 0:06:49,000
One in nine.

116
0:06:50.42,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Think about that.

117
0:06:52.42,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Generally, people with other diseases get care and treatment.

118
0:06:55.5,000 --> 0:06:56,000
If you have cancer, you get treatment,

119
0:06:57.5,000 --> 0:06:59,000
if you have diabetes, you get treatment.

120
0:06:59.54,000 --> 0:07:,000
If you have a heart attack,

121
0:07:00.9,000 --> 0:07:02,000
you get emergency services, and you get referred to care.

122
0:07:05.02,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But somehow people with addiction have to wait for treatment

123
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or often can't get when they need it.

124
0:07:11.62,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And left untreated, addiction has significant, dire consequences.

125
0:07:16.18,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And for many people that means death or incarceration.

126
0:07:20.82,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We've been down that road before.

127
0:07:23.22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
For too long our country felt

128
0:07:24.66,000 --> 0:07:26,000
like we could arrest our way out of this problem.

129
0:07:27.7,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But we know that we can't.

130
0:07:30.5,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Decades of scientific research has shown

131
0:07:32.9,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that this is a medical issue --

132
0:07:35.06,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that this is a chronic medical condition

133
0:07:37.66,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that people inherit and that people develop.

134
0:07:41.82,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So the Obama administration has taken a different tack on drug policy.

135
0:07:46.38,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We've developed and implemented a comprehensive plan

136
0:07:49.34,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to expand prevention services, treatment services,

137
0:07:52.74,000 --> 0:07:54,000
early intervention and recovery support.

138
0:07:56.62,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We've pushed criminal justice reform.

139
0:07:59.46,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We've knocked down barriers to give people second chances.

140
0:08:02.7,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We see public health and public safety officials working hand in hand

141
0:08:06.14,000 --> 0:08:07,000
at the community level.

142
0:08:08.3,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We see police chiefs across the country guiding people to treatment

143
0:08:11.5,000 --> 0:08:12,000
instead of jail and incarceration.

144
0:08:14.22,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We see law enforcement and other first responders

145
0:08:17.14,000 --> 0:08:21,000
reversing overdoses with naloxone to give people a second chance for care.

146
0:08:23.46,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The Affordable Care Act is the biggest expansion

147
0:08:26.14,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of substance use disorder treatment in a generation,

148
0:08:29.42,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and it also calls for the integration of treatment services within primary care.

149
0:08:36.1,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But fundamentally, all of this work is not enough.

150
0:08:40.66,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Unless we change the way that we view people with addiction

151
0:08:44.7,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in the United States.

152
0:08:47.22,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Years ago when I finally understood that I had a problem

153
0:08:50.82,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I knew that I needed help,

154
0:08:52.979,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I was too afraid to ask for it.

155
0:08:56.14,000 --> 0:09:,000
I felt that people would think I was stupid, that I was weak-willed,

156
0:09:01.34,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that I was morally flawed.

157
0:09:05.7,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But I talk about my recovery because I want to make change.

158
0:09:10.06,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I want us to see that we need to be open and candid about who we are

159
0:09:16.02,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and what we can do.

160
0:09:18.14,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I am public about my own recovery

161
0:09:20.54,000 --> 0:09:21,000
not to be self-congratulatory.

162
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I am open about my own recovery to change public opinion,

163
0:09:27.14,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to change public policy

164
0:09:29.06,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and to change the course of this epidemic and empower the millions of Americans

165
0:09:32.98,000 --> 0:09:33,000
who struggle with this journey

166
0:09:34.86,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to be open and candid about who they are.

167
0:09:38.46,000 --> 0:09:4,000
People are more than their disease.

168
0:09:41.7,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And all of us have the opportunity to change public opinion

169
0:09:45.02,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and to change public policy.

170
0:09:47.82,000 --> 0:09:49,000
All of us know someone who has an addiction,

171
0:09:51.1,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and all of us can do our part

172
0:09:53.06,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to change how we view people with addiction in the United States.

173
0:09:58.22,000 --> 0:10:,000
So when you see someone with an addiction,

174
0:10:00.66,000 --> 0:10:05,000
don't think of a drunk or a junkie or an addict or an abuser --

175
0:10:07.5,000 --> 0:10:08,000
see a person;

176
0:10:09.86,000 --> 0:10:1,000
offer them help;

177
0:10:11.38,000 --> 0:10:12,000
give them kindness and compassion.

178
0:10:14.18,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And together, we can be part

179
0:10:16.42,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of a growing movement in the United States

180
0:10:18.5,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to change how we view people with addiction.

181
0:10:21.3,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Together we can change public policy.

182
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We can ensure that people get care when they need it,

183
0:10:28.18,000 --> 0:10:29,000
just like any other disease.

184
0:10:30.86,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We can be part of a growing, unstoppable movement

185
0:10:34.58,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to have millions of Americans enter recovery,

186
0:10:37.62,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and put an end to this epidemic.

187
0:10:39.74,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Thank you very much.

188
0:10:40.98,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Applause)

0:00:14.057,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do."

2
0:00:18.51,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I don't have children.

3
0:00:20.51,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I borrow my friends' children, so --

4
0:00:22.844,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:26.082,000 --> 0:00:28,000
take all this advice with a grain of salt.

6
0:00:29.855,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm Gever Tulley.

7
0:00:31.703,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm a contract computer scientist by trade,

8
0:00:36.287,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but I'm the founder of something called the Tinkering School.

9
0:00:40.946,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's a summer program which aims to help kids

10
0:00:43.857,000 --> 0:00:45,000
learn how to build the things that they think of.

11
0:00:46.459,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So we build a lot of things,

12
0:00:48.372,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders.

13
0:00:52.516,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So if you're thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School,

14
0:00:55.594,000 --> 0:00:58,000
they do come back bruised, scraped and bloody.

15
0:00:59.002,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:01.295,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You know, we live in a world

17
0:01:02.891,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations.

18
0:01:06.85,000 --> 0:01:12,000
There doesn't seem to be any limit on how crazy

19
0:01:12.941,000 --> 0:01:13,000
child safety regulations can get.

20
0:01:15.31,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We put suffocation warnings on every piece of plastic film

21
0:01:19.51,000 --> 0:01:2,000
manufactured in the United States,

22
0:01:21.168,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or for sale with an item in the United States.

23
0:01:23.771,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We put warnings on coffee cups

24
0:01:26.502,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to tell us that the contents may be hot.

25
0:01:29.253,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp

26
0:01:36.144,000 --> 0:01:38,000
for children under the age of 10.

27
0:01:38.224,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So where does this trend stop?

28
0:01:41.443,000 --> 0:01:45,000
When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object,

29
0:01:46.261,000 --> 0:01:48,000
every pokey bit in the world,

30
0:01:49.178,000 --> 0:01:54,000
then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp,

31
0:01:54.273,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or not made out of round plastic,

32
0:01:57.586,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they'll hurt themselves with it.

33
0:01:59.51,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So, as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone

34
0:02:05.838,000 --> 0:02:06,000
grow ever smaller,

35
0:02:07.426,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we cut off our children from valuable opportunities

36
0:02:11.395,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to learn how to interact with the world around them.

37
0:02:14.51,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And despite all of our best efforts and intentions,

38
0:02:18.765,000 --> 0:02:19,000
kids are always going to figure out

39
0:02:20.487,000 --> 0:02:22,000
how to do the most dangerous thing they can,

40
0:02:22.566,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in whatever environment they can.

41
0:02:24.534,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:25.95,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So despite the provocative title,

43
0:02:29.322,000 --> 0:02:31,000
this presentation is really about safety,

44
0:02:32.099,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and about some simple things that we can do

45
0:02:36.852,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to raise our kids to be creative,

46
0:02:41.432,000 --> 0:02:44,000
confident and in control of the environment around them.

47
0:02:45.517,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And what I now present to you

48
0:02:47.67,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is an excerpt from a book in progress.

49
0:02:50.94,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The book is called "50 Dangerous Things."

50
0:02:53.267,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This is "Five Dangerous Things."

51
0:02:55.51,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Thing number one: Play with fire.

52
0:02:58.668,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature

53
0:03:03.662,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history.

54
0:03:07.811,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Whether we remember it or not,

55
0:03:09.786,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it's the first time we really get control

56
0:03:13.262,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of one of these mysterious things.

57
0:03:15.93,000 --> 0:03:16,000
These mysteries are only revealed

58
0:03:17.775,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to those who get the opportunity to play with it.

59
0:03:20.18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So, playing with fire.

60
0:03:23.159,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This is like one of the great things we ever discovered, fire.

61
0:03:28.509,000 --> 0:03:31,000
From playing with it, they learn some basic principles about fire,

62
0:03:31.677,000 --> 0:03:34,000
about intake, combustion, exhaust.

63
0:03:35.51,000 --> 0:03:37,000
These are the three working elements of fire

64
0:03:37.63,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that you have to have for a good, controlled fire.

65
0:03:40.827,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory.

66
0:03:45.755,000 --> 0:03:48,000
You don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it.

67
0:03:48.794,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me,

68
0:03:53.241,000 --> 0:03:54,000
they're going to learn things

69
0:03:55.067,000 --> 0:04:,000
that you can't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys.

70
0:04:00.103,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:01.825,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Number two: Own a pocketknife.

72
0:04:04.881,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness,

73
0:04:09.121,000 --> 0:04:11,000
which I think is a terrible thing.

74
0:04:11.908,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:15.395,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool

76
0:04:19.291,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that you're given.

77
0:04:20.51,000 --> 0:04:22,000
You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,

78
0:04:23.51,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.

79
0:04:26.51,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And it's a powerful and empowering tool.

80
0:04:31.122,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And in a lot of cultures they give knives --

81
0:04:33.95,000 --> 0:04:35,000
like, as soon as they're toddlers, they have knives.

82
0:04:36.505,000 --> 0:04:39,000
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber.

83
0:04:40.103,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was 10,

84
0:04:44.095,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and it left a lasting impression,

85
0:04:46.357,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to see babies playing with knives.

86
0:04:48.51,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self

87
0:04:52.51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
through a tool at a very young age.

88
0:04:55.101,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You lay down a couple of very simple rules --

89
0:04:57.51,000 --> 0:05:01,000
always cut away from your body, keep the blade sharp, never force it --

90
0:05:02.096,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and these are things kids can understand and practice with.

91
0:05:05.086,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And yeah, they're going to cut themselves.

92
0:05:07.124,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself.

93
0:05:10.259,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But you know, they're young. They heal fast.

94
0:05:12.747,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:16.08,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Number three: Throw a spear.

96
0:05:18.954,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things,

97
0:05:23.003,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and like muscles, if you don't use parts of your brain,

98
0:05:28.715,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they tend to atrophy over time.

99
0:05:31.105,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But when you exercise them,

100
0:05:34.334,000 --> 0:05:36,000
any given muscle adds strength to the whole system,

101
0:05:36.915,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and that applies to your brain, too.

102
0:05:39.221,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate

103
0:05:44.42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the frontal and parietal lobes,

104
0:05:46.407,000 --> 0:05:51,000
which have to do with visual acuity, 3D understanding,

105
0:05:51.786,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and structural problem solving,

106
0:05:55.357,000 --> 0:06:,000
so it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability.

107
0:06:01.111,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill,

108
0:06:06.51,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so it's very good for that kind of whole-body training.

109
0:06:12.209,000 --> 0:06:18,000
These kinds of target-based practices also help kids develop

110
0:06:18.449,000 --> 0:06:2,000
attention and concentration skills,

111
0:06:21.095,000 --> 0:06:22,000
so those are great.

112
0:06:22.758,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances.

113
0:06:27.574,000 --> 0:06:3,000
There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher.

114
0:06:31.51,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Next time you're about to throw out an appliance,

115
0:06:35.438,000 --> 0:06:36,000
don't throw it out.

116
0:06:36.619,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Take it apart with your kid,

117
0:06:38.057,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or send him to my school, and we'll take it apart with them.

118
0:06:41.442,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Even if you don't know what the parts are,

119
0:06:43.738,000 --> 0:06:45,000
puzzling out what they might be for

120
0:06:46.326,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is a really good practice for the kids

121
0:06:49.8,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart,

122
0:06:55.266,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and no matter how complex they are,

123
0:06:57.479,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they can understand parts of them.

124
0:06:59.623,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And that means that eventually, they can understand all of them.

125
0:07:02.722,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's a sense of knowability, that something is knowable.

126
0:07:06.953,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted

127
0:07:10.709,000 --> 0:07:13,000
are actually complex things made by other people,

128
0:07:14.51,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and you can understand them.

129
0:07:16.647,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Number five: Two-parter.

130
0:07:20.62,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

131
0:07:22.756,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

132
0:07:25.066,000 --> 0:07:28,000
There are laws beyond safety regulations

133
0:07:28.876,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things

134
0:07:31.615,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that we own -- in this case, digital media.

135
0:07:34.51,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's a very simple exercise:

136
0:07:36.669,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD,

137
0:07:41.098,000 --> 0:07:44,000
then rip the CD to an MP3, and play it on your very same computer.

138
0:07:44.971,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You've just broken a law.

139
0:07:46.804,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Technically, the RIAA could come and prosecute you.

140
0:07:50.323,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's an important lesson for kids to understand,

141
0:07:52.915,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that some of these laws get broken by accident,

142
0:07:56.415,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and that laws have to be interpreted.

143
0:07:59.185,000 --> 0:08:01,000
That's something we often talk about with the kids

144
0:08:01.559,000 --> 0:08:05,000
when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open,

145
0:08:05.675,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and taking them apart and using them for other things.

146
0:08:08.415,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And also when we go out and drive a car.

147
0:08:14.265,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Driving a car is a really empowering act for a young child,

148
0:08:18.51,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so this is the alternate --

149
0:08:20.51,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

150
0:08:22.209,000 --> 0:08:25,000
For those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law,

151
0:08:26.174,000 --> 0:08:29,000
you can drive a car with your child.

152
0:08:29.871,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This is a great stage for a kid.

153
0:08:33.601,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This happens about the same time

154
0:08:35.177,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs,

155
0:08:37.53,000 --> 0:08:39,000
these big things in the outside world,

156
0:08:39.655,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that they're trying to get a grip on.

157
0:08:41.655,000 --> 0:08:45,000
A car is a similar object, and they can get in a car and drive it.

158
0:08:46.433,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And that really gives them a handle on a world

159
0:08:50.802,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in a way that they don't often have access to.

160
0:08:55.375,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And it's perfectly legal.

161
0:08:57.029,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Find a big empty lot, make sure there's nothing in it,

162
0:08:59.703,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and that it's on private property, and let them drive your car.

163
0:09:03.51,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's very safe actually.

164
0:09:05.143,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And it's fun for the whole family.

165
0:09:07.136,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

166
0:09:11.494,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Let's see, I think that's it. That's number five and a half. OK.

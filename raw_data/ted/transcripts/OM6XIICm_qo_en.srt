1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Time flies.

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's actually almost 20 years ago

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
when I wanted to reframe the way we use information,

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, 20 years on, at TED,

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I want to ask your help in a new reframing.

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So going back to 1989,

8
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.

9
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.

10
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens --

11
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,

12
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as a sort of a play project,

13
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.

14
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And so he gave me the time to code it up.

15
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:

16
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
hypertext protocol, HTTP;

17
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the idea of URLs, these names for things

18
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
which started with HTTP.

19
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I wrote the code and put it out there.

20
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Why did I do it?

21
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Well, it was basically frustration.

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer

23
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in this huge, very exciting lab,

24
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
lots of people coming from all over the world.

25
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.

26
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They had all sorts of different data formats,

27
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.

28
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So that, in all that diversity,

29
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
if I wanted to figure out how to build something

30
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
out of a bit of this and a bit of this,

31
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,

32
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I had to learn to run some new program,

33
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.

34
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And these were all incompatible.

35
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It was just very frustrating.

36
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The frustration was all this unlocked potential.

37
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In fact, on all these discs there were documents.

38
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So if you just imagined them all

39
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,

40
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
say on the Internet,

41
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
then life would be so much easier.

42
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin

43
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and even if people don't read your memo --

44
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.

45
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.

46
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain

48
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
what the web was like.

49
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.

50
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web

51
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.

52
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I can show somebody a piece of hypertext,

53
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
a page which has got links,

54
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.

55
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Not impressive.

56
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.

57
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
What was difficult was to get them to imagine:

58
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so, imagine that that link could have gone

59
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to virtually any document you could imagine.

60
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.

61
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Well, some people did.

62
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.

63
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And that is what has made it most fun.

64
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That has been the most exciting thing,

65
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
not the technology, not the things people have done with it,

66
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but actually the community, the spirit of all these people

67
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
getting together, sending the emails.

68
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
That's what it was like then.

69
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.

70
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --

71
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"

72
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And you did.

73
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Thanks.

74
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's been a blast, hasn't it?

75
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I mean, it has been quite interesting

76
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because we've found out that the things that happen with the web

77
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
really sort of blow us away.

78
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
They're much more than we'd originally imagined

79
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
when we put together the little, initial website

80
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that we started off with.

81
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now, I want you to put your data on the web.

82
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.

83
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
There is still a huge frustration

84
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.

85
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?

86
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Well, documents you read, OK?

87
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.

88
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.

89
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?

90
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --

91
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
one of the great TED Talks.

92
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Hans put up this presentation

93
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors --

94
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
he showed income levels on one axis

95
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.

96
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation

97
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which just shattered a lot of myths that people had

98
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
about the economics in the developing world.

99
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
He put up a slide a little bit like this.

100
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
It had underground all the data

101
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
OK, data is brown and boxy and boring,

102
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and that's how we think of it, isn't it?

103
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Because data you can't naturally use by itself

104
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives

105
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.

106
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In this case, Hans had put the data together

107
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.

108
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
He had put it together,

109
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces

110
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and then he'd put it into this software,

111
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
which I think his son developed, originally,

112
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and produces this wonderful presentation.

113
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And Hans made a point

114
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."

115
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And I was happy to see that at the party last night

116
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."

117
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So I want us now to think about

118
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,

119
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web

120
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web

121
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and then calling that linked data.

122
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.

123
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:

124
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
first thing is that those HTTP names --

125
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
those things that start with "http:" --

126
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we're using them not just for documents now,

127
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we're using them for things that the documents are about.

128
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We're using them for people, we're using them for places,

129
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.

130
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.

131
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up

132
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data

133
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
using the HTTP protocol from the web,

134
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I will get back some data in a standard format

135
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know

136
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
about that thing, about that event.

137
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,

138
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
where they were born, things like that.

139
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So the second rule is I get important information back.

140
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Third rule is that when I get back that information

141
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,

142
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it's got relationships.

143
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Data is relationships.

144
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Interestingly, data is relationships.

145
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.

146
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship

147
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
then the other thing that it's related to

148
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is given one of those names that starts HTTP.

149
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.

150
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then

151
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,

152
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and the population of it, and so on.

153
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So I can browse this stuff.

154
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So that's it, really.

155
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That is linked data.

156
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago

157
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and soon after that, things started to happen.

158
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots

159
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
of these boxes that Hans had,

160
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.

161
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's not just a whole lot of other plants.

162
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's not just a root supplying a plant,

163
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but for each of those plants, whatever it is --

164
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data --

165
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they get to look at all the data

166
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and they get it connected together,

167
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and the really important thing about data

168
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.

169
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So, linked data.

170
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The meme went out there.

171
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin

172
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
who was one of the first people to put interesting things up,

173
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
he noticed that Wikipedia --

174
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia

175
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.

176
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.

177
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And in most information boxes, there's data.

178
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,

179
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and put it into a blob of linked data

180
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
on the web, which he called dbpedia.

181
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide

182
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and if you actually go and look up Berlin,

183
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
you'll find that there are other blobs of data

184
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.

185
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,

186
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.

187
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.

188
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?

189
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Let's think about data for a bit.

190
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.

191
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing

192
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.

193
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.

194
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,

195
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
there's scientific data, there's personal data,

196
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
there's weather data, there's data about events,

197
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.

198
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I'm just going to mention a few of them

199
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so that you get the idea of the diversity of it,

200
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
so that you also see how much unlocked potential.

201
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Let's start with government data.

202
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Barack Obama said in a speech,

203
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet

204
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in accessible formats.

205
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.

206
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That's important. Why is it important?

207
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,

208
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments

209
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.

210
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It's actual useful. It's got value.

211
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I can use it in my company.

212
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I could use it as a kid to do my homework.

213
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better

214
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
by making this data available.

215
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data

216
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in a government department, often you find that

217
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
these people, they're very tempted to keep it --

218
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Hans calls it database hugging.

219
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go

220
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
until you've made a beautiful website for it.

221
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather --

222
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
yes, make a beautiful website,

223
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?

224
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Make a beautiful website, but first

225
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
give us the unadulterated data,

226
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
we want the data.

227
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We want unadulterated data.

228
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
OK, we have to ask for raw data now.

229
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?

230
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Can you say "raw"?

231
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Audience: Raw.

232
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?

233
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Audience: Data.

234
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
TBL: Can you say "now"?

235
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Audience: Now!

236
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
TBL: Alright, "raw data now"!

237
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Audience: Raw data now!

238
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses

239
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
people come up with to hang onto their data

240
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.

241
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.

242
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.

243
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.

244
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious

245
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
of the huge challenges that human society has right now --

246
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,

247
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,

248
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
understanding how the world works.

249
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists --

250
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
they have half-formed ideas in their head,

251
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
they try to communicate those over the web.

252
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment

253
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
is on databases, often sitting in their computers,

254
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and actually, currently not shared.

255
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In fact, I'll just go into one area --

256
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,

257
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out

258
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
because scientists in that field realize

259
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
this is a great way of getting out of those silos,

260
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because they had their genomics data in one database

261
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in one building, and they had their protein data in another.

262
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data --

263
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,

264
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I wouldn't ask -- they would.

265
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
What proteins are involved in signal transduction

266
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and also related to pyramidal neurons?

267
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.

268
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question

269
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
because nobody has asked that question before.

270
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
You get 223,000 hits --

271
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
no results you can use.

272
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together --

273
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties

274
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and you can look at.

275
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --

276
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
questions which actually bridge across different disciplines --

277
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
is really a complete sea change.

278
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It's very very important.

279
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment --

280
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up

281
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.

282
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions

283
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and has nothing to do with you.

284
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
But, that's not true.

285
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
In fact, data is about our lives.

286
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
You just -- you log on to your social networking site,

287
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."

288
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Bing! Relationship. Data.

289
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. "

290
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.

291
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Every time you do things on the social networking site,

292
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it --

293
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.

294
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
But, when you go to another linked data site --

295
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and let's say this is one about travel,

296
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"

297
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
you can't get over the walls.

298
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --

299
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
tremendous frustration.

300
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability

301
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
between social networking sites.

302
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We need to do that with linked data.

303
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.

304
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap

305
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.

306
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now --

307
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.

308
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,

309
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.

310
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,

311
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.

312
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I did that. Me!

313
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I did that to the map. I just did that!

314
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?

315
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit

316
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and it creates an incredible resource

317
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
because everybody else does theirs.

318
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And that is what linked data is all about.

319
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's about people doing their bit

320
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.

321
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
That's how linked data works.

322
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.

323
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there

324
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
but you know to demand it.

325
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And we've practiced that.

326
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So, linked data -- it's huge.

327
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I've only told you a very small number of things

328
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
There are data in every aspect of our lives,

329
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
every aspect of work and pleasure,

330
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and it's not just about the number of places where data comes,

331
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it's about connecting it together.

332
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And when you connect data together, you get power

333
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.

334
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
You get this really huge power out of it.

335
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So, we're at the stage now

336
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.

337
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because --

338
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
even though there's not an immediate return on the investment

339
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --

340
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things

341
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
which would be good if everybody else did them.

342
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
OK, so it's called linked data.

343
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I want you to make it.

344
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I want you to demand it.

345
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And I think it's an idea worth spreading.

346
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thanks.

347
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000

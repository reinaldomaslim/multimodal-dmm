1
0:00:07.333,000 --> 0:00:08,000
When I was 13,

2
0:00:09.127,000 --> 0:00:11,000
I lost my grandfather to a silent heart attack.

3
0:00:12.877,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What happened to be more shocking was that at 75,

4
0:00:16.89,000 --> 0:00:2,000
grandpa was really normal, healthy and energetic,

5
0:00:21.372,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but he was diabetic.

6
0:00:24.347,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Learning all of this was so painful

7
0:00:26.989,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that I decided to go out on a war against this deadly killer

8
0:00:31.023,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and see what could be done.

9
0:00:33.433,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It was shocking to discover the results of recent studies

10
0:00:36.953,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that have shown an estimate of nearly eight million people

11
0:00:40.749,000 --> 0:00:42,000
who die from heart attacks every year.

12
0:00:44.354,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Heart attacks occur for many reasons,

13
0:00:46.936,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but most often, they occur when arteries get clogged,

14
0:00:51.541,000 --> 0:00:52,000
blood flow is cut off

15
0:00:53.039,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and oxygen-starved cells in the heart muscles start to die.

16
0:00:57.41,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You may know the common symptoms of a heart attack:

17
0:01:00.205,000 --> 0:01:06,000
chest pain, arm pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, et cetera ...

18
0:01:06.364,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but there is a type of heart attack that is quite common,

19
0:01:10.446,000 --> 0:01:11,000
just as deadly,

20
0:01:11.938,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but harder to detect because the symptoms are silent.

21
0:01:16.97,000 --> 0:01:21,000
People having silent heart attacks just don't realize what's happening,

22
0:01:22.578,000 --> 0:01:24,000
so they're not seeking medical attention,

23
0:01:25.497,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which means they're less likely to receive the treatment that they need

24
0:01:30.446,000 --> 0:01:31,000
at the critical moment.

25
0:01:33.091,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And even if they do get to the hospital by chance,

26
0:01:36.321,000 --> 0:01:39,000
either before or after they are struck by a heart attack,

27
0:01:40.081,000 --> 0:01:45,000
they might have to go through one or more of these time-consuming, expensive tests

28
0:01:45.756,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and treatments,

29
0:01:46.931,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which are currently considered the gold standards

30
0:01:49.437,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of heart-attack diagnosis.

31
0:01:51.648,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The greater concern, however,

32
0:01:53.589,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is that these silent heart attacks account for nearly 45 percent

33
0:01:57.753,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of all heart attacks.

34
0:02:00.019,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Patients with diabetes and similar disorders suffer from nerve damage

35
0:02:04.502,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that prevents them from feeling the sort of pain

36
0:02:07.819,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that usually signals to someone

37
0:02:10.318,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that he or she may be having a heart attack.

38
0:02:15.774,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Which means they suffer the damage of a heart attack

39
0:02:18.993,000 --> 0:02:2,000
without even knowing or feeling anything.

40
0:02:23.152,000 --> 0:02:28,000
These already at-risk patients suffer from nerve damage,

41
0:02:28.883,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and they do not get immediate medical care.

42
0:02:33.07,000 --> 0:02:37,000
They do not know anything before an unlikely event is about to occur.

43
0:02:38.83,000 --> 0:02:4,000
My grandfather was an at-risk patient, too.

44
0:02:42.857,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I probed this issue further --

45
0:02:45.365,000 --> 0:02:47,000
read as much as I could to understand the heart,

46
0:02:48.23,000 --> 0:02:51,000
met researchers and worked across labs in India.

47
0:02:52.757,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And finally, after three long years of persistent research,

48
0:02:57.228,000 --> 0:03:,000
what I have to share with the world today is a promising solution.

49
0:03:02.241,000 --> 0:03:05,000
A noninvasive device that is inexpensive,

50
0:03:05.903,000 --> 0:03:1,000
portable, wearable by at-risk patients at all times.

51
0:03:12.101,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It greatly reduces the need for a blood test

52
0:03:15.211,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and works 24/7, collecting and analyzing data at preset intervals.

53
0:03:21.782,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And all this data is collected for a single purpose:

54
0:03:25.576,000 --> 0:03:27,000
detecting heart attacks as they occur.

55
0:03:29.651,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is a very promising solution that might help us in the future.

56
0:03:35.604,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You may not know how intelligent your heart really is.

57
0:03:39.923,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It tries to communicate to your body multiple times before failing,

58
0:03:44.967,000 --> 0:03:46,000
by indicating symptoms like chest pain.

59
0:03:48.335,000 --> 0:03:51,000
These symptoms are triggered when the heart loses out

60
0:03:52.124,000 --> 0:03:54,000
on oxygen-rich blood flow.

61
0:03:55.107,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But remember I told you about the nerve damage.

62
0:03:58.323,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It silences these symptoms before a silent heart attack,

63
0:04:03.565,000 --> 0:04:05,000
which makes it even deadlier.

64
0:04:07.519,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And you may not even know the common symptoms.

65
0:04:12.243,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Meanwhile, the heart also sends out certain biomarkers --

66
0:04:16.64,000 --> 0:04:21,000
cardiac biomarkers or proteins that are SOS messages --

67
0:04:21.837,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in the form of SOS messages --

68
0:04:23.663,000 --> 0:04:24,000
into your bloodstream,

69
0:04:25.266,000 --> 0:04:27,000
indicating that the heart is at risk.

70
0:04:28.361,000 --> 0:04:3,000
As it gets riskier and riskier,

71
0:04:30.608,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the concentrations of these cardiac biomarker proteins

72
0:04:34.212,000 --> 0:04:35,000
keep increasing abysmally.

73
0:04:36.876,000 --> 0:04:38,000
My device solely relies on this data.

74
0:04:40.423,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The key is that these cardiac biomarkers are found

75
0:04:43.83,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in one of the earliest stages of a heart attack,

76
0:04:46.627,000 --> 0:04:49,000
when someone is almost sure to survive

77
0:04:50.162,000 --> 0:04:53,000
if he or she gets prompt care.

78
0:04:54.102,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And my device is solely based on that basis.

79
0:04:59.229,000 --> 0:05:,000
And here's how my device works.

80
0:05:01.52,000 --> 0:05:05,000
A silicon patch is worn around your wrist or placed near your chest.

81
0:05:06.743,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Without having to prick your skin for a biomarker blood test,

82
0:05:11.627,000 --> 0:05:17,000
this patch can spot, isolate and track a heart-attack specific biomarker

83
0:05:18.359,000 --> 0:05:2,000
called H-FABP,

84
0:05:20.464,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and alerts you if and when it reaches a critical level in your bloodstream --

85
0:05:26.15,000 --> 0:05:31,000
a process that's much simpler, easier and cheaper than conventional methods

86
0:05:32.153,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of heart-attack diagnosis.

87
0:05:35.687,000 --> 0:05:38,000
By checking on biomarker concentration data,

88
0:05:40.242,000 --> 0:05:44,000
a system like this, with advanced research in the future,

89
0:05:44.362,000 --> 0:05:48,000
could significantly reduce the need for an at-risk patient to go to a doctor

90
0:05:48.818,000 --> 0:05:49,000
for a biomarker blood test,

91
0:05:50.18,000 --> 0:05:53,000
because the device could be worn at all times,

92
0:05:53.538,000 --> 0:05:56,000
sensing biomarker elevations in real time.

93
0:05:57.813,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Thus, if the device senses the biomarker levels going beyond the critical point,

94
0:06:03.044,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the at-risk patient could be warned of an impending cardiac arrest

95
0:06:07.549,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and that he or she needs immediate medical attention.

96
0:06:11.121,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Although the device may not be able to provide the patient

97
0:06:14.777,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with the complete analysis of the cardiac injury,

98
0:06:17.747,000 --> 0:06:19,000
it might be of immense help

99
0:06:19.865,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in actually indicating that the patient is in danger,

100
0:06:23.771,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so that the patient can be alarmed

101
0:06:25.867,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and know that immediate care is crucial.

102
0:06:29.973,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Every at-risk patient will now receive more time to survive

103
0:06:34.765,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and reach out for medical help.

104
0:06:37.09,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Consequently, they don't have to go

105
0:06:39.648,000 --> 0:06:42,000
for expensive and invasive medical treatments

106
0:06:42.966,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that would otherwise be necessary after a heart attack.

107
0:06:47.278,000 --> 0:06:5,000
When I got my device tested on at-risk patients under observation,

108
0:06:51.135,000 --> 0:06:53,000
results from the clinical validation tests

109
0:06:54.144,000 --> 0:06:58,000
certified close to a 96 percent accuracy and sensitivity.

110
0:06:59.57,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I intend to make my device available to people in two variants:

111
0:07:03.697,000 --> 0:07:07,000
one which gives digital analysis of the biomarker levels

112
0:07:07.745,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and a simpler version for the people in rural areas

113
0:07:10.326,000 --> 0:07:13,000
which simply vibrates when the biomarker levels go beyond the critical point.

114
0:07:15.346,000 --> 0:07:18,000
When we look at our progress in cardiac health care today,

115
0:07:18.747,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it is more of sick care than preventative self-care and technology.

116
0:07:23.724,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We literally wait for the heart attack to occur

117
0:07:26.088,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and put our vast majority of resources into post-care treatment.

118
0:07:30.47,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But by then, irreversible damage will already be done.

119
0:07:35.565,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I firmly believe it's time for us to rethink medicine.

120
0:07:39.385,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We must establish proactive health-care technologies.

121
0:07:42.679,000 --> 0:07:44,000
A change must be brought out not 10 years from now,

122
0:07:45.548,000 --> 0:07:46,000
not five years from now,

123
0:07:46.871,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but today.

124
0:07:48.05,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And so, hopefully, one day,

125
0:07:50.463,000 --> 0:07:51,000
with the help of these devices,

126
0:07:52.253,000 --> 0:07:56,000
someone else won't lose his or her grandfather just like I did.

127
0:07:56.789,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Thank you so much.

128
0:07:58.063,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Applause)

129
0:07:59.548,000 --> 0:08:,000
Thank you.

130
0:08:01.445,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Applause)

131
0:08:03.476,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Thank you.

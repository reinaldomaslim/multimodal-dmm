0:00:12.87,000 --> 0:00:16,000
June 29, 2016.

2
0:00:19.15,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My dear fellow citizen:

3
0:00:22.775,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I write to you today,

4
0:00:26.393,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to you who have lost in this era.

5
0:00:31.708,000 --> 0:00:34,000
At this moment in our common life,

6
0:00:35.95,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when the world is full of breaking

7
0:00:38.425,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and spite

8
0:00:40.239,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and fear,

9
0:00:43.385,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I address this letter

10
0:00:45.863,000 --> 0:00:46,000
simply to you,

11
0:00:48.494,000 --> 0:00:49,000
even though we both know

12
0:00:50.086,000 --> 0:00:54,000
there are many of you behind this "you,"

13
0:00:55.306,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and many of me behind this "I."

14
0:01:02.525,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I write to you because at present,

15
0:01:06.478,000 --> 0:01:1,000
this quaking world we share scares me.

16
0:01:12.819,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I gather it scares you, too.

17
0:01:16.618,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Some of what we fear, I suspect,

18
0:01:19.671,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we fear in common.

19
0:01:22.169,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But much of what we fear seems to be each other.

20
0:01:28.736,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You fear the world I want to live in,

21
0:01:32.529,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I fear your visions in turn.

22
0:01:37.673,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Do you know that feeling you get when you know it's going to storm

23
0:01:42.47,000 --> 0:01:43,000
before it storms?

24
0:01:46.001,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Do you also feel that now,

25
0:01:49.276,000 --> 0:01:5,000
fellow citizen?

26
0:01:52.435,000 --> 0:01:54,000
That malaise and worry

27
0:01:56.181,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that some who know

28
0:01:59.517,000 --> 0:02:01,000
feel reminds them of the 1930s?

29
0:02:03.878,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Perhaps you don't,

30
0:02:06.493,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because our fears of each other

31
0:02:08.424,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are not in sync.

32
0:02:11.325,000 --> 0:02:14,000
In this round, I sense that your fears of me,

33
0:02:15.655,000 --> 0:02:18,000
of the world that I have insisted is right for us both,

34
0:02:20.856,000 --> 0:02:21,000
has gathered over a generation.

35
0:02:24.017,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It took time for your fears to trigger my fears,

36
0:02:28.868,000 --> 0:02:3,000
not least because at first,

37
0:02:31.666,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I never thought I needed to fear you.

38
0:02:36.882,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I heard you

39
0:02:39.737,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but did not listen,

40
0:02:41.731,000 --> 0:02:45,000
all these years when you said that this amazing new world

41
0:02:48.204,000 --> 0:02:49,000
wasn't amazing for you,

42
0:02:50.879,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for many of you,

43
0:02:52.507,000 --> 0:02:54,000
across the industrialized world;

44
0:02:55.918,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that the open, liquid world I relished,

45
0:02:58.763,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of people and goods and technologies flowing freely,

46
0:03:03.09,000 --> 0:03:05,000
going where they pleased, globally,

47
0:03:07.019,000 --> 0:03:11,000
was not, for you, an emancipation.

48
0:03:13.453,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I have walked through your towns

49
0:03:17.442,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and, while looking, failed to see.

50
0:03:22.799,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I did notice in Stephenville, Texas,

51
0:03:27.791,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that the town square was dominated

52
0:03:30.122,000 --> 0:03:33,000
by one lawyer's office after another,

53
0:03:34.394,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because of all the people rotating in and out of the prison.

54
0:03:38.224,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I did notice the barren shops in Wagner, South Dakota,

55
0:03:43.925,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and the VFW gathering hall

56
0:03:48.314,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that stood in mockery

57
0:03:50.934,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of a community's dream to endure.

58
0:03:55.352,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I did notice

59
0:03:57.323,000 --> 0:04:,000
at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart,

60
0:04:01.445,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that far too many people in their 20s and 30s

61
0:04:05.828,000 --> 0:04:07,000
looked a decade or two from death,

62
0:04:09.295,000 --> 0:04:11,000
with patchy, flared-up skin

63
0:04:11.665,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and thinning, stringy hair

64
0:04:14.165,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and browning, ground-down teeth

65
0:04:15.841,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and a lostness in their eyes.

66
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I did notice that the young people I encountered in Paris,

67
0:04:24.794,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in Florence, in Barcelona,

68
0:04:26.769,000 --> 0:04:29,000
had degrees but no place to take them,

69
0:04:31.712,000 --> 0:04:33,000
living on internships well into their 30s,

70
0:04:35.693,000 --> 0:04:37,000
their lives prevented from launching,

71
0:04:39.868,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because of an economy that creates wealth --

72
0:04:43.409,000 --> 0:04:44,000
just not jobs.

73
0:04:45.836,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I did notice the news about those parts of London becoming ghost quarters,

74
0:04:53.025,000 --> 0:04:58,000
where the global super-rich turn fishy money into empty apartments

75
0:04:59.962,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and price lifelong residents of a city, young couples starting out,

76
0:05:04.088,000 --> 0:05:05,000
out of their own home.

77
0:05:08.332,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I heard that the fabric of your life

78
0:05:11.277,000 --> 0:05:12,000
was tearing.

79
0:05:13.574,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You used to be able to count on work,

80
0:05:16.84,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and now you couldn't.

81
0:05:18.977,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You used to be able to nourish your children,

82
0:05:23.079,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and guarantee that they would climb

83
0:05:26.052,000 --> 0:05:29,000
a little bit further in life than you had,

84
0:05:30.002,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and now you couldn't.

85
0:05:32.374,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You used to be made to feel dignity in your work, and now you didn't.

86
0:05:39.795,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It used to be normal for people like you to own a home,

87
0:05:44.47,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and now it wasn't.

88
0:05:47.286,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I cannot say

89
0:05:50.426,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I didn't know these things,

90
0:05:53.701,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but I was distracted

91
0:05:57.569,000 --> 0:06:,000
creating a future in which we could live on Mars,

92
0:06:03.091,000 --> 0:06:06,000
even as you struggled down here on Earth.

93
0:06:08.155,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I was distracted

94
0:06:10.455,000 --> 0:06:11,000
innovating immortality,

95
0:06:14.519,000 --> 0:06:18,000
even as many of you began to live shorter lives than your parents had.

96
0:06:21.301,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I heard all of these things, but I didn't listen.

97
0:06:25.528,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I looked

98
0:06:27.566,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but didn't see.

99
0:06:29.161,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I read, didn't understand.

100
0:06:33.37,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I paid attention

101
0:06:35.389,000 --> 0:06:38,000
only when you began to vote and shout,

102
0:06:40.428,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and when your voting and shouting, when the substance of it,

103
0:06:43.516,000 --> 0:06:45,000
began to threaten me.

104
0:06:48.235,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I listened only when you moved toward shattering continental unions

105
0:06:53.252,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and electing vulgar demagogues.

106
0:06:56.704,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Only then did your pain become of interest

107
0:07:01.343,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to me.

108
0:07:04.317,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I know that feeling hurt

109
0:07:06.295,000 --> 0:07:09,000
is often prologue to dealing hurt.

110
0:07:11.664,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I wonder now

111
0:07:14.408,000 --> 0:07:16,000
if you would be less eager to deal it

112
0:07:17.438,000 --> 0:07:18,000
if I had stood with you

113
0:07:19.402,000 --> 0:07:21,000
when you merely felt it.

114
0:07:23.313,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I ask myself

115
0:07:25.355,000 --> 0:07:27,000
why I didn't stand with you then.

116
0:07:28.874,000 --> 0:07:31,000
One reason is that I became entranced

117
0:07:32.275,000 --> 0:07:34,000
by the gurus of change,

118
0:07:35.187,000 --> 0:07:39,000
became a worshiper of the religion of the new for novelty's sake,

119
0:07:39.546,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and of globalization and open borders

120
0:07:41.723,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and kaleidoscopic diversity.

121
0:07:46.928,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Once change became my totalizing faith,

122
0:07:52.415,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I could be blind.

123
0:07:55.143,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I could fail to see change's consequences.

124
0:07:59.866,000 --> 0:08:,000
I could overlook the importance

125
0:08:01.827,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of roots, traditions, rituals, stability --

126
0:08:04.953,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and belonging.

127
0:08:07.501,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And the more fundamentalist I became

128
0:08:10.84,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in my worship of change and openness,

129
0:08:16.09,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the more I drove you towards the other polarity,

130
0:08:20.074,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to cling,

131
0:08:21.632,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to freeze,

132
0:08:23.277,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to close,

133
0:08:25.1,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to belong.

134
0:08:28.138,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I now see as I didn't before

135
0:08:30.878,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that not having the right skin or right organ

136
0:08:34.843,000 --> 0:08:37,000
is not the only varietal of disadvantage.

137
0:08:39.722,000 --> 0:08:42,000
There is a subtler, quieter disadvantage

138
0:08:43.336,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in having those privileged traits

139
0:08:46.675,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and yet feeling history to be moving away from you;

140
0:08:51.082,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that while the past was hospitable to people like you,

141
0:08:54.499,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the future will be more hospitable

142
0:08:56.921,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to others;

143
0:08:58.338,000 --> 0:09:,000
that the world is growing less familiar,

144
0:09:00.815,000 --> 0:09:02,000
less yours day by day.

145
0:09:05.865,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I will not concede for a moment that old privileges should not dwindle.

146
0:09:12.055,000 --> 0:09:14,000
They cannot dwindle fast enough.

147
0:09:15.785,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It is for you to learn to live in a new century in which

148
0:09:19.31,000 --> 0:09:23,000
there are no bonuses for showing up with the right skin and right organs.

149
0:09:25.277,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If and when your anger turns to hate,

150
0:09:27.729,000 --> 0:09:31,000
please know that there is no space for that in our shared home.

151
0:09:33.642,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But I will admit, fellow citizen,

152
0:09:38.14,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that I have discounted the burden of coping with the loss of status.

153
0:09:44.163,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I have forgotten

154
0:09:45.957,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that what is socially necessary can also be personally gruelling.

155
0:09:52.919,000 --> 0:09:53,000
A similar thing happened

156
0:09:55.217,000 --> 0:09:58,000
with the economy that you and I share.

157
0:10:00.191,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Just as I cannot and don't wish

158
0:10:02.647,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to turn back to the clock on equality and diversity,

159
0:10:06.298,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and yet must understand

160
0:10:08.651,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the sense of loss they can inspire,

161
0:10:13.027,000 --> 0:10:17,000
so, too, I refuse and could not if I wished

162
0:10:17.97,000 --> 0:10:21,000
turn back the clock on an ever more closely knit, interdependent world,

163
0:10:22.135,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and on inventions that won't stop being invented.

164
0:10:26.52,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And yet I must understand your experience of these things.

165
0:10:33.032,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You have for years been telling me that your experience of these things

166
0:10:36.475,000 --> 0:10:39,000
is not as good as my theories forecast.

167
0:10:40.528,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Yet before you could finish a complaining sentence

168
0:10:46.116,000 --> 0:10:51,000
about the difficulty of living with erratic hours, volatile pay,

169
0:10:51.628,000 --> 0:10:52,000
vanishing opportunities,

170
0:10:53.278,000 --> 0:10:57,000
about the pain of dropping your children off at 24-hour day care

171
0:10:57.56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to make your 3am shift,

172
0:11:00.319,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I shot back at you -- before you could finish your sentence --

173
0:11:04.256,000 --> 0:11:05,000
my dogma,

174
0:11:05.622,000 --> 0:11:09,000
about how what you are actually experiencing was flexibility

175
0:11:10.794,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and freedom.

176
0:11:14.591,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Language is one of the only things that we truly share,

177
0:11:20.549,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and I sometimes used this joint inheritance

178
0:11:24.052,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to obfuscate

179
0:11:25.821,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and deflect

180
0:11:27.479,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and justify myself;

181
0:11:29.933,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to re-brand what was good for me

182
0:11:31.837,000 --> 0:11:33,000
as something appearing good for us both,

183
0:11:35.324,000 --> 0:11:38,000
when I threw around terms like "the sharing economy,"

184
0:11:40.135,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and "disruption"

185
0:11:41.845,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and "global resourcing."

186
0:11:45.224,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I see now that what I was really doing,

187
0:11:48.229,000 --> 0:11:49,000
at times,

188
0:11:49.894,000 --> 0:11:52,000
was buying your pain on the cheap,

189
0:11:53.892,000 --> 0:11:54,000
sprucing it up

190
0:11:55.772,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and trying to sell it back to you

191
0:11:58.244,000 --> 0:11:59,000
as freedom.

192
0:12:01.712,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I have wanted to believe and wanted you to believe

193
0:12:07.683,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that the system that has been good to me,

194
0:12:09.816,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that has made my life ever more seamless,

195
0:12:13.229,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is also the best system for you.

196
0:12:17.544,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I have condescended to you

197
0:12:19.829,000 --> 0:12:22,000
with the idea that you are voting against your economic interests --

198
0:12:24.207,000 --> 0:12:25,000
voting against your interests,

199
0:12:27.621,000 --> 0:12:3,000
as if I know your interests.

200
0:12:32.296,000 --> 0:12:36,000
That is just my dogmatic economism talking.

201
0:12:37.723,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I have a weakness

202
0:12:39.524,000 --> 0:12:44,000
for treating people's economic interests as their only interest,

203
0:12:44.933,000 --> 0:12:47,000
ignoring things like belonging and pride

204
0:12:48.481,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and the desire to send a message to those who ignore you.

205
0:12:52.688,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So here we are,

206
0:12:56.243,000 --> 0:13:,000
in a scary but not inexplicable moment

207
0:13:01.507,000 --> 0:13:03,000
of demagoguery, fracture,

208
0:13:04.481,000 --> 0:13:07,000
xenophobia, resentment and fear.

209
0:13:09.628,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And I worry for us both if we continue down this road,

210
0:13:14.358,000 --> 0:13:15,000
me not listening,

211
0:13:16.305,000 --> 0:13:17,000
you feeling unheard,

212
0:13:18.18,000 --> 0:13:2,000
you shouting to get me to listen.

213
0:13:22.779,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I worry when each of us is seduced by visions of the future

214
0:13:26.254,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that have no place for the other.

215
0:13:29.731,000 --> 0:13:31,000
If this goes on,

216
0:13:33.655,000 --> 0:13:34,000
if this goes on,

217
0:13:36.053,000 --> 0:13:37,000
there may be blood.

218
0:13:39.29,000 --> 0:13:41,000
There are already hints of this blood

219
0:13:42.915,000 --> 0:13:43,000
in newspapers every day.

220
0:13:44.967,000 --> 0:13:46,000
There may be roundups, raids,

221
0:13:47.586,000 --> 0:13:5,000
deportations, camps, secessions.

222
0:13:51.494,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And no, I do not think that I exaggerate.

223
0:13:56.236,000 --> 0:13:57,000
There may be even talk of war

224
0:13:58.181,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in places that were certain they were done with it.

225
0:14:03.483,000 --> 0:14:06,000
There is always the hope of redemption.

226
0:14:07.764,000 --> 0:14:1,000
But it will not be a cheap, shallow redemption

227
0:14:11.066,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that comes through blather about us all being in it together.

228
0:14:15.312,000 --> 0:14:16,000
This will take more.

229
0:14:18.396,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It will take accepting that we both made choices to be here.

230
0:14:25.863,000 --> 0:14:28,000
We create our "others."

231
0:14:29.975,000 --> 0:14:32,000
As parents, as neighbors, as citizens,

232
0:14:34.503,000 --> 0:14:38,000
we witness and sometimes ignore each other

233
0:14:38.858,000 --> 0:14:39,000
into being.

234
0:14:41.268,000 --> 0:14:44,000
You were not born vengeful.

235
0:14:45.339,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I have some role

236
0:14:47.37,000 --> 0:14:5,000
in whatever thirst you now feel for revenge,

237
0:14:51.685,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and that thirst now tempts me

238
0:14:53.622,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to plot ever more elaborate escapes

239
0:14:56.164,000 --> 0:14:57,000
from our common life,

240
0:14:58.107,000 --> 0:14:59,000
from the schools and neighborhoods

241
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and airports and amusement parks

242
0:15:01.955,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that we used to share.

243
0:15:05.659,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We face, then,

244
0:15:08.671,000 --> 0:15:11,000
a problem not of these large, impersonal forces.

245
0:15:14.366,000 --> 0:15:18,000
We face a problem of your and my relations.

246
0:15:19.815,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We chose ways of relating to each other

247
0:15:24.345,000 --> 0:15:25,000
that got us here.

248
0:15:25.896,000 --> 0:15:27,000
We can choose ways of relating

249
0:15:28.669,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that get us out.

250
0:15:31.361,000 --> 0:15:34,000
But there are things we might have to let go of,

251
0:15:35.418,000 --> 0:15:36,000
fellow citizen,

252
0:15:37.674,000 --> 0:15:42,000
starting with our own cherished versions of reality.

253
0:15:45.035,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Imagine if you let go of fantasies

254
0:15:48.928,000 --> 0:15:51,000
of a society purged of these or those people.

255
0:15:53.561,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Imagine if I let go of my habit

256
0:15:57.755,000 --> 0:16:,000
of saving the world behind your back,

257
0:16:01.833,000 --> 0:16:02,000
of deliberating on the future

258
0:16:03.254,000 --> 0:16:04,000
of your work,

259
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
your food,

260
0:16:06.53,000 --> 0:16:07,000
your schools,

261
0:16:08.024,000 --> 0:16:11,000
in places where you couldn't get past security.

262
0:16:12.386,000 --> 0:16:16,000
We can do this only if we first accept

263
0:16:17.347,000 --> 0:16:19,000
that we have neglected each other.

264
0:16:21.971,000 --> 0:16:24,000
If there is hope to summon

265
0:16:25.93,000 --> 0:16:26,000
in this ominous hour,

266
0:16:28.202,000 --> 0:16:29,000
it is this.

267
0:16:30.87,000 --> 0:16:31,000
We have, for too long,

268
0:16:33.547,000 --> 0:16:36,000
chased various shimmering dreams

269
0:16:37.818,000 --> 0:16:42,000
at the cost of attention to the foundational dream of each other,

270
0:16:45.101,000 --> 0:16:47,000
the dream of tending to each other,

271
0:16:47.693,000 --> 0:16:49,000
of unleashing each other's wonders,

272
0:16:50.58,000 --> 0:16:52,000
of moving through history together.

273
0:16:54.046,000 --> 0:16:58,000
We could dare to commit to the dream of each other

274
0:16:59.009,000 --> 0:17:03,000
as the thing that matters before every neon thing.

275
0:17:04.476,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Let us dare.

276
0:17:06.467,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Sincerely yours,

277
0:17:08.067,000 --> 0:17:09,000
a fellow citizen.

278
0:17:09.683,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.144,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I've come here today

2
0:00:13.464,000 --> 0:00:15,000
to talk to you about a problem.

3
0:00:16.151,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's a very simple yet devastating problem,

4
0:00:19.678,000 --> 0:00:2,000
one that spans the globe

5
0:00:21.623,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and is affecting all of us.

6
0:00:24.536,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The problem is

7
0:00:26.621,000 --> 0:00:28,000
anonymous companies.

8
0:00:29.346,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It sounds like a really dry and technical thing,

9
0:00:31.436,000 --> 0:00:32,000
doesn't it?

10
0:00:32.492,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But anonymous companies are making it difficult

11
0:00:34.994,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and sometimes impossible

12
0:00:37.546,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to find out

13
0:00:39.395,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the actual human beings responsible

14
0:00:42.394,000 --> 0:00:47,000
sometimes for really terrible crimes.

15
0:00:47.604,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So, why am I here talking to all of you?

16
0:00:52.646,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker

17
0:00:56.176,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and when my parents taught my twin brother and I

18
0:00:59.127,000 --> 0:01:,000
to question authority,

19
0:01:01.033,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I don't think they knew where it might lead.

20
0:01:03.044,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:04.399,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And, they probably really regretted it

22
0:01:06.238,000 --> 0:01:09,000
during my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,

23
0:01:09.376,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I questioned their authority a lot.

24
0:01:11.994,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And a lot of my school teachers

25
0:01:13.589,000 --> 0:01:16,000
didn't appreciate it much either.

26
0:01:16.717,000 --> 0:01:18,000
You see, since the age of about five

27
0:01:18.852,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I've always asked the question, but why?

28
0:01:22.525,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But why does the Earth go around the sun?

29
0:01:25.154,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But why is blood red?

30
0:01:26.991,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But why do I have to go to school?

31
0:01:29.298,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But why do I have to respect the teachers

32
0:01:31.311,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and authority?

33
0:01:33.178,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And little did I realize

34
0:01:34.82,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that this question would become the basis

35
0:01:37.598,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of everything I would do.

36
0:01:40.251,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And so it was

37
0:01:42.006,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in my twenties, a long time ago,

38
0:01:44.49,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London

39
0:01:48.571,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I was sitting with Simon Taylor

40
0:01:50.36,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and Patrick Alley

41
0:01:52.368,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and we were busy stuffing envelopes

42
0:01:54.233,000 --> 0:01:57,000
for a mail out in the office of the campaign group

43
0:01:57.283,000 --> 0:01:59,000
where we worked at the time.

44
0:01:59.538,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And as usual, we were talking about the world's problems.

45
0:02:03.623,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And in particular, we were talking about

46
0:02:05.437,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the civil war in Cambodia.

47
0:02:08.357,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And we had talked about that many, many times before.

48
0:02:12.588,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But then suddenly we stopped

49
0:02:14.875,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and looked at each other

50
0:02:16.419,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and said, but why don't we try and change this?

51
0:02:20.648,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And from that slightly crazy question,

52
0:02:23.251,000 --> 0:02:24,000
over two decades

53
0:02:25.093,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and many campaigns later,

54
0:02:27.359,000 --> 0:02:28,000
including alerting the world

55
0:02:29.15,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to the problem of blood diamonds funding war,

56
0:02:32.366,000 --> 0:02:34,000
from that crazy question,

57
0:02:34.427,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Global Witness is now an 80-strong team

58
0:02:37.288,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of campaigners, investigators, journalists and lawyers.

59
0:02:41.81,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And we're all driven by the same belief,

60
0:02:44.113,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that change really is possible.

61
0:02:48.577,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So, what exactly does Global Witness do?

62
0:02:51.696,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We investigate, we report,

63
0:02:53.93,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to uncover the people really responsible

64
0:02:56.652,000 --> 0:02:57,000
for funding conflict --

65
0:02:58.565,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for stealing millions from citizens around the world,

66
0:03:02.076,000 --> 0:03:03,000
also known as state looting,

67
0:03:03.913,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and for destroying the environment.

68
0:03:06.522,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And then we campaign hard to change the system itself.

69
0:03:11.686,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And we're doing this because so many of the countries

70
0:03:14.447,000 --> 0:03:15,000
rich in natural resources

71
0:03:16.323,000 --> 0:03:18,000
like oil or diamonds or timber

72
0:03:19.035,000 --> 0:03:21,000
are home to some of the poorest

73
0:03:21.539,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and most dispossessed people on the planet.

74
0:03:25.939,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And much of this injustice

75
0:03:27.433,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is made possible

76
0:03:29.087,000 --> 0:03:32,000
by currently accepted business practices.

77
0:03:32.819,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And one of these is anonymous companies.

78
0:03:37.036,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now we've come up against anonymous companies

79
0:03:39.13,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in lots of our investigations,

80
0:03:41.27,000 --> 0:03:43,000
like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

81
0:03:43.952,000 --> 0:03:45,000
where we exposed how secretive deals

82
0:03:46.704,000 --> 0:03:47,000
involving anonymous companies

83
0:03:48.337,000 --> 0:03:5,000
had deprived the citizens

84
0:03:50.522,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of one of the poorest countries on the planet

85
0:03:54.487,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of well over a billion dollars.

86
0:03:56.363,000 --> 0:04:01,000
That's twice the country's health and education budget combined.

87
0:04:01.894,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Or in Liberia,

88
0:04:03.215,000 --> 0:04:05,000
where an international predatory logging company

89
0:04:06.063,000 --> 0:04:08,000
used front companies as it attempted to grab

90
0:04:08.626,000 --> 0:04:12,000
a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.

91
0:04:12.815,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,

92
0:04:15.898,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which has led to the destruction of much of its forests.

93
0:04:19.093,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Well, that uses anonymous companies too.

94
0:04:23.234,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We secretly filmed some of the family

95
0:04:25.523,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of the former chief minister and a lawyer

96
0:04:28.32,000 --> 0:04:3,000
as they told our undercover investigator

97
0:04:30.592,000 --> 0:04:32,000
exactly how these dubious deals are done

98
0:04:33.344,000 --> 0:04:36,000
using such companies.

99
0:04:36.42,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And the awful thing is,

100
0:04:38.193,000 --> 0:04:41,000
there are so many other examples out there

101
0:04:41.499,000 --> 0:04:45,000
from all walks of life.

102
0:04:45.503,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This truly is a scandal of epic proportions

103
0:04:49.721,000 --> 0:04:51,000
hidden in plain sight.

104
0:04:52.486,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,

105
0:04:55.265,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the Zetas,

106
0:04:56.308,000 --> 0:04:58,000
who use anonymous companies to launder profits

107
0:04:58.962,000 --> 0:04:59,000
while their drugs-related violence

108
0:05:00.908,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is tearing communities apart across the Americas.

109
0:05:05.526,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Or the anonymous company,

110
0:05:07.474,000 --> 0:05:09,000
which bought up Americans' tax debts,

111
0:05:09.745,000 --> 0:05:1,000
piled on the legal fees

112
0:05:11.537,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and then gave homeowners a choice:

113
0:05:12.921,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Pay up or lose your home.

114
0:05:15.935,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Imagine being threatened with losing your home

115
0:05:18.613,000 --> 0:05:2,000
sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,

116
0:05:21.327,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and not being able to find out

117
0:05:22.697,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who you were really up against.

118
0:05:26.233,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now anonymous companies

119
0:05:27.672,000 --> 0:05:29,000
are great for sanctions busting too.

120
0:05:30.546,000 --> 0:05:32,000
As the Iranian government found out

121
0:05:33.092,000 --> 0:05:34,000
when, through a series of front companies,

122
0:05:34.927,000 --> 0:05:37,000
it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,

123
0:05:38.02,000 --> 0:05:4,000
on Fifth Avenue,

124
0:05:40.314,000 --> 0:05:42,000
despite American sanctions.

125
0:05:43.209,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,

126
0:05:46.343,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and other companies were the unwitting,

127
0:05:49.072,000 --> 0:05:52,000
unknowing tenants there.

128
0:05:52.179,000 --> 0:05:54,000
There are just so many examples,

129
0:05:54.31,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the horesemeat scandal in Europe,

130
0:05:56.766,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the Italian mafia, they've used these companies

131
0:05:59.263,000 --> 0:06:,000
for decades.

132
0:06:01.052,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The $100 million American Medicare fraud,

133
0:06:06.811,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the supply of weapons to wars around the world

134
0:06:10.583,000 --> 0:06:11,000
including those

135
0:06:11.61,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in Eastern Europe in the early '90s.

136
0:06:14.396,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Anonymous companies

137
0:06:15.674,000 --> 0:06:16,000
have even come to light

138
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in the recent revolution in the Ukraine.

139
0:06:21.696,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But, for every case that we and others expose

140
0:06:26.201,000 --> 0:06:29,000
there are so many more that will remain hidden away

141
0:06:29.418,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because of the current system.

142
0:06:31.815,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And it's just a simple truth

143
0:06:33.774,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that some of the people responsible for outrageous crimes,

144
0:06:38.391,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for stealing from you and me

145
0:06:40.631,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and millions of others,

146
0:06:42.675,000 --> 0:06:43,000
they are remaining faceless

147
0:06:43.858,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and they are escaping accountability

148
0:06:46.343,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and they're doing this with ease,

149
0:06:48.515,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and they're doing it using legal structures.

150
0:06:51.93,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And really, that is unfair.

151
0:06:56.951,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Well, you might well ask,

152
0:06:58.89,000 --> 0:07:,000
what exactly is an anonymous company,

153
0:07:01.784,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and can I really set one up, and use it,

154
0:07:04.192,000 --> 0:07:06,000
without anyone knowing who I am?

155
0:07:06.92,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Well, the answer is, yes you can.

156
0:07:08.651,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But if you're anything like me,

157
0:07:10.366,000 --> 0:07:12,000
you'll want to see some of that for yourself,

158
0:07:12.378,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so let me show you.

159
0:07:14.086,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Well first you need to work out

160
0:07:15.403,000 --> 0:07:17,000
where you want to set it up.

161
0:07:17.441,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Now, at this point you might be imagining

162
0:07:19.418,000 --> 0:07:22,000
one of those lovely tropical island tax havens

163
0:07:22.936,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but here's the thing,

164
0:07:24.941,000 --> 0:07:25,000
shockingly,

165
0:07:26.138,000 --> 0:07:28,000
my own hometown, London,

166
0:07:28.482,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and indeed the U.K.,

167
0:07:29.811,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is one of the best places in the world

168
0:07:32.533,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to set up an anonymous company.

169
0:07:35.437,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And the other, even better,

170
0:07:38.126,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I'm afraid that's America.

171
0:07:42.049,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Do you know, in some states across America

172
0:07:44.505,000 --> 0:07:46,000
you need less identification

173
0:07:46.822,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to open up a company

174
0:07:48.289,000 --> 0:07:51,000
than you do to get a library card,

175
0:07:51.406,000 --> 0:07:52,000
like Delaware,

176
0:07:52.662,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which is one of the easiest places

177
0:07:54.744,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in the world to set up an anonymous company.

178
0:07:58.983,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Okay, so let's say it's America,

179
0:08:00.584,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and let's say it's Delaware,

180
0:08:02.659,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and now you can simply go online

181
0:08:04.522,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and find yourself a company service provider.

182
0:08:07.62,000 --> 0:08:09,000
These are the companies that can set your one up for you,

183
0:08:10.603,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and remember, it's all legal, routine business practice.

184
0:08:14.745,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So, here's one,

185
0:08:16.384,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but there are plenty of others to choose from.

186
0:08:19.311,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And having made your choice,

187
0:08:20.942,000 --> 0:08:22,000
you then pick what type of company you want

188
0:08:23.448,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and then fill in a contact, name and address.

189
0:08:26.564,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But don't worry,

190
0:08:27.748,000 --> 0:08:28,000
it doesn't have to be your name.

191
0:08:29.307,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It can be your lawyer's

192
0:08:30.789,000 --> 0:08:31,000
or your service provider's,

193
0:08:32.688,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and it's not for the public record anyway.

194
0:08:36.523,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And then you add the owner of the company.

195
0:08:39.08,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Now this is the key part,

196
0:08:41.019,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and again it doesn't have to be you,

197
0:08:42.899,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because you can get creative,

198
0:08:45.002,000 --> 0:08:48,000
because there is a whole universe out there of nominees

199
0:08:48.551,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to choose from.

200
0:08:50.398,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And nominees are the people that you

201
0:08:52.734,000 --> 0:08:56,000
can legally pay to be your company's owner.

202
0:08:57.57,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And if you don't want to involve anyone else,

203
0:08:59.412,000 --> 0:09:01,000
it doesn't even have to be an actual human being.

204
0:09:02.275,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It could be another company.

205
0:09:05.363,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And then finally,

206
0:09:06.793,000 --> 0:09:07,000
give your company a name

207
0:09:08.522,000 --> 0:09:1,000
add a few more details and make your payment.

208
0:09:11.253,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And then the service provider

209
0:09:12.673,000 --> 0:09:14,000
will take a few hours or more to process it.

210
0:09:15.456,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But there you are,

211
0:09:16.695,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in 10 minutes of online shopping

212
0:09:19.075,000 --> 0:09:23,000
you can create yourself an anonymous company.

213
0:09:23.289,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And not only is it easy,

214
0:09:24.677,000 --> 0:09:26,000
really, really easy and cheap,

215
0:09:27.284,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it's totally legal too.

216
0:09:29.572,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But the fun doesn't have to end there,

217
0:09:33.296,000 --> 0:09:35,000
maybe you want to be even more anonymous.

218
0:09:36.095,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Well, that's no problem either.

219
0:09:38.198,000 --> 0:09:4,000
You can simply keep adding layers,

220
0:09:40.956,000 --> 0:09:42,000
companies owned by companies.

221
0:09:43.056,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You can have hundreds of layers

222
0:09:44.436,000 --> 0:09:46,000
with hundreds of companies spread across

223
0:09:46.524,000 --> 0:09:48,000
lots of different countries,

224
0:09:49.181,000 --> 0:09:5,000
like a giant web,

225
0:09:50.511,000 --> 0:09:52,000
each layer adds anonymity.

226
0:09:52.7,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Each layer makes it more difficult

227
0:09:54.93,000 --> 0:09:55,000
for law enforcement and others

228
0:09:56.619,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to find out who the real owner is.

229
0:10:00.002,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But whose interests is this all serving?

230
0:10:04.092,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It might be in the interests of the company

231
0:10:06.218,000 --> 0:10:07,000
or a particular individual,

232
0:10:07.984,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but what about all of us, the public?

233
0:10:10.372,000 --> 0:10:12,000
There hasn't even been a global conversation yet

234
0:10:13.141,000 --> 0:10:14,000
about whether it's okay

235
0:10:14.561,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to misuse companies in this way.

236
0:10:17.796,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And what does it all mean for us?

237
0:10:21.674,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Well, an example that really haunts me

238
0:10:24.227,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is one I came across recently.

239
0:10:26.605,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And it's that of a horrific fire

240
0:10:28.554,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in a nightclub in Buenos Aires

241
0:10:30.339,000 --> 0:10:32,000
about a decade ago.

242
0:10:33.29,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It was the night before New Year's Eve.

243
0:10:35.56,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Three thousand very happy revelers,

244
0:10:37.728,000 --> 0:10:38,000
many of them teenagers,

245
0:10:38.765,000 --> 0:10:41,000
were crammed into a space meant for 1,000.

246
0:10:41.96,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And then tragedy struck,

247
0:10:43.133,000 --> 0:10:44,000
a fire broke out

248
0:10:44.736,000 --> 0:10:46,000
plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling

249
0:10:46.82,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and toxic smoke filled the club.

250
0:10:48.796,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So people tried to escape

251
0:10:50.861,000 --> 0:10:52,000
only to find that some of the fire doors

252
0:10:53.494,000 --> 0:10:56,000
had been chained shut.

253
0:10:57.155,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Over 200 people died.

254
0:10:59.588,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Seven hundred were injured trying to get out.

255
0:11:03.347,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And as the victims' families and the city and the country

256
0:11:06.892,000 --> 0:11:07,000
reeled in shock,

257
0:11:08.436,000 --> 0:11:11,000
investigators tried to find out who was responsible.

258
0:11:11.982,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And as they looked for the owners of the club,

259
0:11:14.473,000 --> 0:11:17,000
they found instead anonymous companies,

260
0:11:18.031,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and confusion surrounded the identities of those

261
0:11:20.325,000 --> 0:11:22,000
involved with the companies.

262
0:11:22.832,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Now ultimately, a range of people were charged

263
0:11:25.294,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and some went to jail.

264
0:11:27.321,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But this was an awful tragedy,

265
0:11:29.154,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and it shouldn't have been so difficult

266
0:11:31.137,000 --> 0:11:34,000
just to try and find out who was responsible

267
0:11:35.047,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for those deaths.

268
0:11:38.008,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Because in an age

269
0:11:39.953,000 --> 0:11:41,000
when there is so much information

270
0:11:42.207,000 --> 0:11:43,000
out there in the open,

271
0:11:44.204,000 --> 0:11:45,000
why should this crucial information

272
0:11:45.878,000 --> 0:11:46,000
about company ownership

273
0:11:47.388,000 --> 0:11:48,000
stay hidden away?

274
0:11:49.094,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Why should tax evaders, corrupt government officials,

275
0:11:52.819,000 --> 0:11:54,000
arms traders and more,

276
0:11:55.071,000 --> 0:11:59,000
be able to hide their identities from us, the public?

277
0:11:59.109,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Why should this secrecy be such an accepted business practice?

278
0:12:04.738,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Anonymous companies

279
0:12:06.426,000 --> 0:12:08,000
might be the norm right now

280
0:12:08.635,000 --> 0:12:1,000
but it wasn't always this way.

281
0:12:10.641,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Companies were created

282
0:12:12.438,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to give people a chance to innovate

283
0:12:14.71,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and not have to put everything on the line.

284
0:12:18.373,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Companies were created to limit financial risk,

285
0:12:21.715,000 --> 0:12:25,000
they were never intended to be used as a moral shield.

286
0:12:26.665,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Companies were never intended to be anonymous,

287
0:12:28.939,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and they don't have to be.

288
0:12:31.355,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And so I come to my wish.

289
0:12:34.245,000 --> 0:12:36,000
My wish is for us to know

290
0:12:37.046,000 --> 0:12:39,000
who owns and controls companies

291
0:12:39.772,000 --> 0:12:41,000
so that they can no longer be used anonymously

292
0:12:42.522,000 --> 0:12:44,000
against the public good.

293
0:12:45.152,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Together let's ignite world opinion,

294
0:12:47.818,000 --> 0:12:48,000
change the law,

295
0:12:49.295,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and launch a new era of openness in business.

296
0:12:54.175,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So what might this look like?

297
0:12:55.807,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Well, imagine if you could go online

298
0:12:58.376,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and look up the real owner of a company.

299
0:13:01.493,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Imagine if this data were open and free,

300
0:13:04.265,000 --> 0:13:05,000
accessible across borders

301
0:13:05.976,000 --> 0:13:06,000
for citizens and businesses

302
0:13:07.775,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and law enforcement alike.

303
0:13:09.463,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Imagine what a game changer that would be.

304
0:13:13.931,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So how are we going to do this?

305
0:13:16.434,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Well, there is only one way.

306
0:13:17.88,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Together, we have to change the law globally

307
0:13:21.131,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to create public registries

308
0:13:23.072,000 --> 0:13:25,000
which list the true owners of companies

309
0:13:25.927,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and can be accessed by all

310
0:13:27.963,000 --> 0:13:29,000
with no loopholes.

311
0:13:30.092,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And yes, this is ambitious,

312
0:13:33.824,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but there is momentum on this issue,

313
0:13:36.215,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and over the years I have seen

314
0:13:38.259,000 --> 0:13:4,000
the sheer power of momentum,

315
0:13:40.591,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and it's just starting on this issue.

316
0:13:42.975,000 --> 0:13:45,000
There is such an opportunity right now.

317
0:13:46.253,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And the TED community

318
0:13:48.282,000 --> 0:13:51,000
of creative and innovative thinkers and doers

319
0:13:51.647,000 --> 0:13:52,000
across all of society

320
0:13:53.544,000 --> 0:13:56,000
could make the crucial difference.

321
0:13:56.803,000 --> 0:13:59,000
You really can make this change happen.

322
0:14:00.637,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Now, a simple starting point

323
0:14:02.439,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is the address behind me

324
0:14:03.905,000 --> 0:14:05,000
for a Facebook page that you can join now

325
0:14:06.264,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to support the campaign and spread the word.

326
0:14:09.01,000 --> 0:14:1,000
It's going to be a springboard

327
0:14:10.434,000 --> 0:14:11,000
for our global campaigning.

328
0:14:12.395,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And the techies among you,

329
0:14:13.87,000 --> 0:14:16,000
you could really help us create a prototype

330
0:14:17.243,000 --> 0:14:18,000
public registry

331
0:14:18.963,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.

332
0:14:23.839,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Campaign groups from around the world

333
0:14:26.35,000 --> 0:14:3,000
have come together to work on this issue.

334
0:14:31.21,000 --> 0:14:34,000
The U.K. government is already on board;

335
0:14:34.49,000 --> 0:14:36,000
it supports these public registries.

336
0:14:36.892,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And just last week,

337
0:14:38.79,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the European Parliament came on board

338
0:14:41.498,000 --> 0:14:46,000
with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.

339
0:14:46.564,000 --> 0:14:48,000
That is momentum.

340
0:14:48.989,000 --> 0:14:51,000
(Applause)

341
0:14:53.985,000 --> 0:14:55,000
But it's early days.

342
0:14:56.29,000 --> 0:14:58,000
America still needs to come on board,

343
0:14:58.782,000 --> 0:15:01,000
as do so many other countries.

344
0:15:02.359,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And to succeed we will all together

345
0:15:05.468,000 --> 0:15:07,000
need to help and push our politicians,

346
0:15:07.912,000 --> 0:15:08,000
because without that,

347
0:15:09.499,000 --> 0:15:1,000
real far-reaching, world-shifting change

348
0:15:11.467,000 --> 0:15:13,000
just isn't going to happen.

349
0:15:14.168,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Because this isn't just about changing the law,

350
0:15:16.857,000 --> 0:15:18,000
this is about starting a conversation

351
0:15:18.949,000 --> 0:15:2,000
about what it's okay for companies to do,

352
0:15:21.342,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and in what ways is it acceptable to use company structures.

353
0:15:26.376,000 --> 0:15:28,000
This isn't just a dry policy issue.

354
0:15:29.149,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This is a human issue

355
0:15:30.637,000 --> 0:15:32,000
which affects us all.

356
0:15:33.295,000 --> 0:15:39,000
This is about being on the right side of history.

357
0:15:39.699,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Global citizens, innovators, business leaders, individuals,

358
0:15:45.057,000 --> 0:15:46,000
we need you.

359
0:15:47.044,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Together, let's kickstart this global movement.

360
0:15:50.554,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Let's just do it,

361
0:15:51.899,000 --> 0:15:54,000
let's end anonymous companies.

362
0:15:55.201,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Thank you.

363
0:15:57.305,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.533,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical,

2
0:00:15.089,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I returned to the medical university

3
0:00:17.481,000 --> 0:00:18,000
where I studied.

4
0:00:19.343,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I saw real patients and I wore the white coat

5
0:00:24.098,000 --> 0:00:26,000
for the first time in 17 years,

6
0:00:26.907,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in fact since I became a management consultant.

7
0:00:30.384,000 --> 0:00:31,000
There were two things that surprised me

8
0:00:32.308,000 --> 0:00:34,000
during the month I spent.

9
0:00:34.425,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The first one was that the common theme

10
0:00:36.315,000 --> 0:00:39,000
of the discussions we had were hospital budgets

11
0:00:39.823,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and cost-cutting,

12
0:00:41.746,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and the second thing, which really bothered me,

13
0:00:43.57,000 --> 0:00:45,000
actually, was that several of the colleagues I met,

14
0:00:46.439,000 --> 0:00:48,000
former friends from medical school,

15
0:00:48.5,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who I knew to be some of the smartest,

16
0:00:50.637,000 --> 0:00:52,000
most motivated, engaged and passionate people

17
0:00:53.606,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'd ever met,

18
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
many of them had turned cynical, disengaged,

19
0:00:59.091,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or had distanced themselves from hospital management.

20
0:01:02.598,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So with this focus on cost-cutting,

21
0:01:05.372,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?

22
0:01:09.668,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Many countries that you represent

23
0:01:11.672,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and where I come from

24
0:01:13.269,000 --> 0:01:15,000
struggle with the cost of healthcare.

25
0:01:16.175,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's a big part of the national budgets.

26
0:01:19.143,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth.

27
0:01:22.928,000 --> 0:01:24,000
In some countries, we have long waiting times

28
0:01:24.945,000 --> 0:01:26,000
for patients for surgery.

29
0:01:27.152,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed,

30
0:01:29.67,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and therefore don't reach patients.

31
0:01:32.642,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In several countries, doctors and nurses

32
0:01:34.899,000 --> 0:01:38,000
are the targets, to some extent, for the governments.

33
0:01:38.956,000 --> 0:01:41,000
After all, the costly decisions in health care

34
0:01:42.523,000 --> 0:01:44,000
are taken by doctors and nurses.

35
0:01:44.991,000 --> 0:01:46,000
You choose an expensive lab test,

36
0:01:47.531,000 --> 0:01:5,000
you choose to operate on an old and frail patient.

37
0:01:51.158,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians,

38
0:01:55.632,000 --> 0:01:58,000
this is a way to hold costs down.

39
0:01:58.863,000 --> 0:02:,000
And ultimately, some physicians will say today

40
0:02:01.135,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that they don't have the full liberty

41
0:02:03.802,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to make the choices they think are right for their patients.

42
0:02:07.322,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues

43
0:02:09.692,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are frustrated.

44
0:02:12.058,000 --> 0:02:14,000
At BCG, we looked at this,

45
0:02:14.509,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and we asked ourselves,

46
0:02:16.34,000 --> 0:02:19,000
this can't be the right way of managing healthcare.

47
0:02:19.852,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And so we took a step back and we said,

48
0:02:23.072,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"What is it that we are trying to achieve?"

49
0:02:25.744,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Ultimately, in the healthcare system,

50
0:02:27.975,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we're aiming at improving health for the patients,

51
0:02:31.936,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and we need to do so at a limited,

52
0:02:34.213,000 --> 0:02:35,000
or affordable, cost.

53
0:02:36.07,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We call this value-based healthcare.

54
0:02:38.793,000 --> 0:02:39,000
On the screen behind me, you see what we mean

55
0:02:40.477,000 --> 0:02:41,000
by value:

56
0:02:42.286,000 --> 0:02:44,000
outcomes that matter to patients

57
0:02:44.772,000 --> 0:02:47,000
relative to the money we spend.

58
0:02:47.781,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006

59
0:02:50.526,000 --> 0:02:54,000
by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.

60
0:02:54.531,000 --> 0:02:57,000
On this picture, you have my father-in-law

61
0:02:57.674,000 --> 0:03:,000
surrounded by his three beautiful daughters.

62
0:03:01.06,000 --> 0:03:04,000
When we started doing our research at BCG,

63
0:03:04.096,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we decided not to look so much at the costs,

64
0:03:06.756,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but to look at the quality instead,

65
0:03:09.296,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and in the research, one of the things

66
0:03:11.877,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that fascinated us was the variation we saw.

67
0:03:14.919,000 --> 0:03:16,000
You compare hospitals in a country,

68
0:03:17.292,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you'll find some that are extremely good,

69
0:03:19.508,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse.

70
0:03:22.953,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The differences were dramatic.

71
0:03:25.115,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Erik, my father-in-law,

72
0:03:27.177,000 --> 0:03:29,000
he suffers from prostate cancer,

73
0:03:29.708,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and he probably needs surgery.

74
0:03:32.018,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany

75
0:03:34.725,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that has a well-reputed healthcare system.

76
0:03:38.437,000 --> 0:03:41,000
If he goes there and goes to the average hospital,

77
0:03:42.137,000 --> 0:03:46,000
he will have the risk of becoming incontinent

78
0:03:46.211,000 --> 0:03:47,000
by about 50 percent,

79
0:03:48.185,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so he would have to start wearing diapers again.

80
0:03:51.158,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.

81
0:03:55.095,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If he instead would go to Hamburg,

82
0:03:57.997,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik,

83
0:04:00.508,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the risk would be only one in 20.

84
0:04:03.191,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Either you a flip a coin,

85
0:04:04.776,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or you have a one in 20 risk.

86
0:04:06.809,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference.

87
0:04:10.314,000 --> 0:04:11,000
When we look at many hospitals

88
0:04:12.299,000 --> 0:04:13,000
for many different diseases,

89
0:04:13.973,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we see these huge differences.

90
0:04:16.99,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But you and I don't know. We don't have the data.

91
0:04:19.884,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And often, the data actually doesn't exist.

92
0:04:21.731,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Nobody knows.

93
0:04:23.45,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So going the hospital is a lottery.

94
0:04:27.803,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.

95
0:04:32.083,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In the late '70s, there were a group

96
0:04:34.575,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of Swedish orthopedic surgeons

97
0:04:37.007,000 --> 0:04:38,000
who met at their annual meeting,

98
0:04:38.866,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and they were discussing the different procedures

99
0:04:40.827,000 --> 0:04:43,000
they used to operate hip surgery.

100
0:04:44.131,000 --> 0:04:45,000
To the left of this slide, you see a variety

101
0:04:45.859,000 --> 0:04:48,000
of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use

102
0:04:48.896,000 --> 0:04:5,000
for somebody who needs a new hip.

103
0:04:51.755,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They all realized they had their individual way of operating.

104
0:04:55.004,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They all argued that, "My technique is the best,"

105
0:04:57.401,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but none of them actually knew, and they admitted that.

106
0:05:00.274,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So they said, "We probably need to measure quality

107
0:05:04.223,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so we know and can learn from what's best."

108
0:05:08.392,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So they in fact spent two years debating,

109
0:05:11.591,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"So what is quality in hip surgery?"

110
0:05:13.886,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"Oh, we should measure this." "No, we should measure that."

111
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And they finally agreed.

112
0:05:18.311,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And once they had agreed, they started measuring,

113
0:05:20.962,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and started sharing the data.

114
0:05:23.365,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Very quickly, they found that if you put cement

115
0:05:25.964,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in the bone of the patient

116
0:05:27.47,000 --> 0:05:29,000
before you put the metal shaft in,

117
0:05:29.648,000 --> 0:05:31,000
it actually lasted a lot longer,

118
0:05:31.784,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and most patients would never have to be

119
0:05:33.542,000 --> 0:05:35,000
re-operated on in their lifetime.

120
0:05:35.903,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They published the data,

121
0:05:37.571,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country.

122
0:05:40.694,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense.

123
0:05:43.985,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Since then, they publish every year.

124
0:05:46.022,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Once a year, they publish the league table:

125
0:05:47.97,000 --> 0:05:49,000
who's best, who's at the bottom?

126
0:05:50.457,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And they visit each other to try to learn,

127
0:05:53.137,000 --> 0:05:56,000
so a continuous cycle of improvement.

128
0:05:56.927,000 --> 0:05:58,000
For many years, Swedish hip surgeons

129
0:05:59.734,000 --> 0:06:01,000
had the best results in the world,

130
0:06:02.121,000 --> 0:06:04,000
at least for those who actually were measuring,

131
0:06:04.599,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and many were not.

132
0:06:07.035,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now I found this principle really exciting.

133
0:06:09.917,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So the physicians get together,

134
0:06:11.72,000 --> 0:06:13,000
they agree on what quality is,

135
0:06:13.845,000 --> 0:06:16,000
they start measuring, they share the data,

136
0:06:17.559,000 --> 0:06:2,000
they find who's best, and they learn from it.

137
0:06:21.075,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Continuous improvement.

138
0:06:23.667,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now, that's not the only exciting part.

139
0:06:26.215,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That's exciting in itself.

140
0:06:28.466,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But if you bring back the cost side of the equation,

141
0:06:31.417,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and look at that,

142
0:06:32.877,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it turns out, those who have focused on quality,

143
0:06:35.882,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they actually also have the lowest costs,

144
0:06:37.915,000 --> 0:06:39,000
although that's not been the purpose in the first place.

145
0:06:40.584,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So if you look at the hip surgery story again,

146
0:06:43.614,000 --> 0:06:45,000
there was a study done a couple years ago

147
0:06:45.985,000 --> 0:06:48,000
where they compared the U.S. and Sweden.

148
0:06:49.983,000 --> 0:06:5,000
They looked at how many patients have needed

149
0:06:51.908,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.

150
0:06:55.989,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In the United States, the number was three times

151
0:06:58.876,000 --> 0:07:,000
higher than in Sweden.

152
0:07:01.064,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So many unnecessary surgeries,

153
0:07:04.504,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and so much unnecessary suffering

154
0:07:07.244,000 --> 0:07:08,000
for all the patients who were operated on

155
0:07:08.936,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in that seven year period.

156
0:07:11.403,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now, you can imagine how much savings

157
0:07:12.982,000 --> 0:07:14,000
there would be for society.

158
0:07:15.482,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We did a study where we looked at OECD data.

159
0:07:18.653,000 --> 0:07:2,000
OECD does, every so often,

160
0:07:21.503,000 --> 0:07:23,000
look at quality of care

161
0:07:23.659,000 --> 0:07:27,000
where they can find the data across the member countries.

162
0:07:28.184,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The United States has, for many diseases,

163
0:07:30.786,000 --> 0:07:32,000
actually a quality which is below the average

164
0:07:32.99,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in OECD.

165
0:07:34.408,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Now, if the American healthcare system

166
0:07:36.562,000 --> 0:07:38,000
would focus a lot more on measuring quality,

167
0:07:38.998,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and raise quality just to the level of average OECD,

168
0:07:43.047,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it would save the American people

169
0:07:45.385,000 --> 0:07:49,000
500 billion U.S. dollars a year.

170
0:07:49.511,000 --> 0:07:52,000
That's 20 percent of the budget,

171
0:07:52.738,000 --> 0:07:54,000
of the healthcare budget of the country.

172
0:07:55.451,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now you may say that these numbers

173
0:07:57.558,000 --> 0:07:59,000
are fantastic, and it's all logical,

174
0:08:00.449,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but is it possible?

175
0:08:02.459,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,

176
0:08:05.098,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and I would argue that not only can it be done,

177
0:08:08.678,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but it has to be done.

178
0:08:10.912,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses

179
0:08:14.303,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in the healthcare system.

180
0:08:16.995,000 --> 0:08:18,000
In my practice as a consultant,

181
0:08:19.109,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred

182
0:08:21.376,000 --> 0:08:23,000
doctors and nurses and other hospital

183
0:08:24.253,000 --> 0:08:26,000
or healthcare staff every year.

184
0:08:27.21,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The one thing they have in common is

185
0:08:29.396,000 --> 0:08:31,000
they really care about what they achieve

186
0:08:31.674,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in terms of quality for their patients.

187
0:08:34.908,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Physicians are, like most of you in the audience,

188
0:08:36.991,000 --> 0:08:38,000
very competitive.

189
0:08:39.527,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They were always best in class.

190
0:08:41.277,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We were always best in class.

191
0:08:44.775,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And if somebody can show them that the result

192
0:08:47.389,000 --> 0:08:48,000
they perform for their patients

193
0:08:48.976,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is no better than what others do,

194
0:08:51.83,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they will do whatever it takes to improve.

195
0:08:54.537,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But most of them don't know.

196
0:08:56.87,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But physicians have another characteristic.

197
0:08:59.285,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They actually thrive from peer recognition.

198
0:09:03.127,000 --> 0:09:05,000
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist

199
0:09:05.361,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in a competing hospital

200
0:09:07.209,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and discusses why that other hospital

201
0:09:09.238,000 --> 0:09:11,000
has so much better results, they will share.

202
0:09:12.033,000 --> 0:09:15,000
They will share the information on how to improve.

203
0:09:15.75,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So it is, by measuring and creating transparency,

204
0:09:19.87,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you get a cycle of continuous improvement,

205
0:09:22.78,000 --> 0:09:24,000
which is what this slide shows.

206
0:09:25.654,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now, you may say this is a nice idea,

207
0:09:28.595,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but this isn't only an idea.

208
0:09:30.499,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This is happening in reality.

209
0:09:32.527,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We're creating a global community,

210
0:09:35.681,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and a large global community,

211
0:09:37.544,000 --> 0:09:39,000
where we'll be able to measure and compare

212
0:09:40.091,000 --> 0:09:41,000
what we achieve.

213
0:09:41.805,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Together with two academic institutions,

214
0:09:44.432,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Michael Porter at Harvard Business School,

215
0:09:46.426,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,

216
0:09:48.31,000 --> 0:09:51,000
BCG has formed something we call ICHOM.

217
0:09:52.275,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You may think that's a sneeze,

218
0:09:54.48,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.

219
0:09:57.607,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It stands for the International Consortium

220
0:10:00.183,000 --> 0:10:02,000
for Health Outcome Measurement.

221
0:10:03.143,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We're bringing together leading physicians

222
0:10:05.892,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and patients to discuss, disease by disease,

223
0:10:09.483,000 --> 0:10:11,000
what is really quality,

224
0:10:11.585,000 --> 0:10:12,000
what should we measure,

225
0:10:13.572,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and to make those standards global.

226
0:10:16.06,000 --> 0:10:18,000
They've worked -- four working groups have worked

227
0:10:18.415,000 --> 0:10:19,000
during the past year:

228
0:10:20.383,000 --> 0:10:22,000
cataracts, back pain,

229
0:10:23.227,000 --> 0:10:27,000
coronary artery disease, which is, for instance, heart attack,

230
0:10:27.453,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and prostate cancer.

231
0:10:29.634,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The four groups will publish their data

232
0:10:32.038,000 --> 0:10:33,000
in November of this year.

233
0:10:33.88,000 --> 0:10:35,000
That's the first time we'll be comparing

234
0:10:36.338,000 --> 0:10:38,000
apples to apples, not only within a country,

235
0:10:39.284,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but between countries.

236
0:10:42.465,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases,

237
0:10:46.443,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the year after, 16.

238
0:10:48.997,000 --> 0:10:5,000
In three years' time, we plan to have covered

239
0:10:51.453,000 --> 0:10:54,000
40 percent of the disease burden.

240
0:10:54.566,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Compare apples to apples. Who's better?

241
0:10:57.216,000 --> 0:11:,000
Why is that?

242
0:11:00.267,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Five months ago,

243
0:11:03.132,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I led a workshop at the largest university hospital

244
0:11:06.166,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in Northern Europe.

245
0:11:07.876,000 --> 0:11:1,000
They have a new CEO, and she has a vision:

246
0:11:11.363,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I want to manage my big institution much more

247
0:11:14.969,000 --> 0:11:18,000
on quality, outcomes that matter to patients.

248
0:11:19.074,000 --> 0:11:22,000
This particular day, we sat in a workshop

249
0:11:22.572,000 --> 0:11:24,000
together with physicians, nurses and other staff,

250
0:11:25.382,000 --> 0:11:29,000
discussing leukemia in children.

251
0:11:29.88,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The group discussed,

252
0:11:31.657,000 --> 0:11:33,000
how do we measure quality today?

253
0:11:33.697,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Can we measure it better than we do?

254
0:11:36.262,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We discussed, how do we treat these kids,

255
0:11:38.484,000 --> 0:11:4,000
what are important improvements?

256
0:11:40.535,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And we discussed what are the costs for these patients,

257
0:11:43.316,000 --> 0:11:45,000
can we do treatment more efficiently?

258
0:11:45.664,000 --> 0:11:46,000
There was an enormous energy in the room.

259
0:11:47.608,000 --> 0:11:5,000
There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.

260
0:11:51.097,000 --> 0:11:53,000
At the end of the meeting,

261
0:11:53.391,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the chairman of the department, he stood up.

262
0:11:56.7,000 --> 0:12:,000
He looked over the group and he said --

263
0:12:01.277,000 --> 0:12:02,000
first he raised his hand, I forgot that --

264
0:12:03.062,000 --> 0:12:05,000
he raised his hand, clenched his fist,

265
0:12:05.531,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and then he said to the group, "Thank you.

266
0:12:08.428,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing

267
0:12:11.351,000 --> 0:12:14,000
what this hospital does the right way."

268
0:12:14.925,000 --> 0:12:16,000
By measuring value in healthcare,

269
0:12:17.012,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that is not only costs

270
0:12:19.037,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but outcomes that matter to patients,

271
0:12:21.51,000 --> 0:12:22,000
we will make staff in hospitals

272
0:12:23.308,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and elsewhere in the healthcare system

273
0:12:25.167,000 --> 0:12:29,000
not a problem but an important part of the solution.

274
0:12:29.261,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I believe measuring value in healthcare

275
0:12:31.197,000 --> 0:12:33,000
will bring about a revolution,

276
0:12:33.968,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and I'm convinced that the founder

277
0:12:36.077,000 --> 0:12:39,000
of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,

278
0:12:39.54,000 --> 0:12:41,000
who always put the patient at the center,

279
0:12:42.49,000 --> 0:12:44,000
he would smile in his grave.

280
0:12:44.652,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Thank you.

281
0:12:47.453,000 --> 0:12:5,000
(Applause)

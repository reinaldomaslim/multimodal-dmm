0:00:12.377,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Every year, more than four to five million people die

3
0:00:15.439,000 --> 0:00:18,000
due to exposure to outdoor air pollution

4
0:00:18.74,000 --> 0:00:19,000
around the world.

5
0:00:20.435,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This petri dish that you are looking at

6
0:00:23.302,000 --> 0:00:26,000
contains approximately 20 minutes' worth of pollution

7
0:00:26.927,000 --> 0:00:28,000
captured off a pyrolysis plant.

8
0:00:29.433,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This is PM 2.5.

9
0:00:31.64,000 --> 0:00:33,000
These particles -- you can see it right now,

10
0:00:33.83,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but when they're out there in the air, you won't see them.

11
0:00:36.679,000 --> 0:00:37,000
These are so tiny that our lungs --

12
0:00:38.672,000 --> 0:00:42,000
our bodies cannot filter them, and they end up in our bodies --

13
0:00:43.022,000 --> 0:00:46,000
give us asthma and lung cancer if not treated in the right time.

14
0:00:47.077,000 --> 0:00:5,000
On a trip back to India, when I was a student in 2012,

15
0:00:50.465,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I took this picture.

16
0:00:51.963,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This picture stuck in my head.

17
0:00:53.938,000 --> 0:00:56,000
On one side, you see this exhaust of a diesel generator,

18
0:00:57.724,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the same generator which is a sign of human progress,

19
0:01:00.363,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which is a sign of rapid industrialization

20
0:01:03.255,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and what we have become as a society in the last 100 years,

21
0:01:06.529,000 --> 0:01:07,000
generating energy.

22
0:01:08.01,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But on the other side,

23
0:01:09.256,000 --> 0:01:12,000
you see this very interesting triangular, black-colored swatch,

24
0:01:12.976,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that is produced by the same residual particulate waste

25
0:01:16.194,000 --> 0:01:18,000
created by the emissions of the generator.

26
0:01:20.078,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now, this picture gave me an idea

27
0:01:22.189,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and got me thinking about rethinking both pollution and inks,

28
0:01:27.086,000 --> 0:01:29,000
because it was making that black-colored mark.

29
0:01:29.262,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, the reality is that most of the black ink that we use conventionally

30
0:01:33.11,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is traditionally produced

31
0:01:34.457,000 --> 0:01:37,000
by conventionally burning fossil fuels in factories.

32
0:01:38.37,000 --> 0:01:41,000
There are factories around the world that are burning fossil fuels

33
0:01:41.578,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to produce carbon black,

34
0:01:43.089,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to make black inks that we use on an everyday basis.

35
0:01:46.346,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But given that millions of liters of fossil fuels

36
0:01:49.347,000 --> 0:01:51,000
are already being burned out there

37
0:01:51.378,000 --> 0:01:54,000
by our cars, our engines and our exhaust out there,

38
0:01:54.87,000 --> 0:01:56,000
what if you could capture that pollution

39
0:01:57.353,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and use it to recycle and make those inks?

40
0:02:00.623,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I decided to give this experiment a shot.

41
0:02:03.544,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I went back to my lab back in Boston and conducted a small experiment.

42
0:02:07.544,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In Boston, I couldn't find much pollution to play with,

43
0:02:10.148,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so I resorted to using a candle.

44
0:02:12.782,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This was an experiment.

45
0:02:14.648,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I burnt a candle,

46
0:02:15.982,000 --> 0:02:18,000
built this contraption that would suck in that candle soot,

47
0:02:19.283,000 --> 0:02:21,000
mixed it with some vegetable oil and vodka,

48
0:02:21.474,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because to a DIY hacker, these were really easily available.

49
0:02:25.188,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:26.254,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And after mixing them,

51
0:02:27.562,000 --> 0:02:29,000
you could churn out a very rudimentary form of ink

52
0:02:30.522,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that would go into a cartridge,

53
0:02:32.309,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and now you could print with it.

54
0:02:34.592,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This was my "Hello, World!" of experimenting

55
0:02:37.679,000 --> 0:02:38,000
with printing with pollution.

56
0:02:41.162,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is the same pollution that I showed you in the petri dish,

57
0:02:44.162,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which is the result of any fossil fuel that is being burned out there.

58
0:02:49.005,000 --> 0:02:52,000
In 2015, I decided to take this experimentation forward

59
0:02:52.495,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and set up a lab in India

60
0:02:54.258,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to work on the capture and recycling of air pollution.

61
0:02:57.259,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In the good times, the lab used to look something like this.

62
0:03:00.116,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But experimentations were not always controlled,

63
0:03:02.909,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and disasters happened.

64
0:03:04.219,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And while experimentation would happen,

65
0:03:06.483,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the lab would end up looking something like this.

66
0:03:09.234,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Well, we knew where we wanted to go,

67
0:03:11.902,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but we were not sure how exactly to reach there.

68
0:03:14.568,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The passersby who used to go by that lab through that building

69
0:03:17.608,000 --> 0:03:2,000
used to, at times, think, "These guys are making bombs in there,"

70
0:03:20.78,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because there was too much fire, wires and smoke in the same vicinity.

71
0:03:25.128,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:27.011,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We decided, let's move to a garage and take experiments forward.

73
0:03:30.051,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We took a garage, and during the early stages,

74
0:03:32.305,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we were driving around Bangalore with contraptions like these.

75
0:03:35.708,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is an early-stage prototype.

76
0:03:37.326,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Imagine the looks people gave us,

77
0:03:38.952,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"What are these cars driving around doing?"

78
0:03:41.007,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This is an early-stage prototype of our system that would capture pollution

79
0:03:44.646,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that is being released from a conventional diesel-based car.

80
0:03:48.615,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is an early stage of the technology.

81
0:03:50.648,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We advanced the technology and created this into this version

82
0:03:55.489,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that would capture pollution from static sources of pollution,

83
0:03:58.442,000 --> 0:03:59,000
like a diesel generator.

84
0:03:59.629,000 --> 0:04:03,000
If you see, all the fumes disappear as soon as you turn this machine on.

85
0:04:04.838,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Without affecting the performance of the engine,

86
0:04:08.464,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we are able to capture 95 percent worth of pollution

87
0:04:11.984,000 --> 0:04:12,000
released from the diesel generator.

88
0:04:13.981,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This is the particulate matter that we are talking about that we capture,

89
0:04:17.775,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in this case, within three to four hours of operation of a generator.

90
0:04:22.838,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And while our experiments and our research was advancing,

91
0:04:26.624,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a very big company, a very big brand, approached us and said,

92
0:04:29.917,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"We want to take this idea further with you guys,

93
0:04:32.679,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and take this further in a very big celebrated form."

94
0:04:36.022,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They said, "Let's do a global art campaign

95
0:04:38.371,000 --> 0:04:4,000
with the inks that you are making off this pollution."

96
0:04:41.546,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I'll show you what the ink looks like.

97
0:04:43.864,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So, this pen is made by recycling 40 to 50 minutes of that car pollution

98
0:04:49.814,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that we are talking about,

99
0:04:51.106,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the same pollution that is in the petri dish.

100
0:04:53.227,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And it's a very sharp black that you can write with.

101
0:04:55.711,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So I'm going to write ...

102
0:05:00.822,000 --> 0:05:02,000
PM 2.5, that's incorrect.

103
0:05:03.925,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So this is a very sharp black that is generated by the same pollution.

104
0:05:08.647,000 --> 0:05:1,000
After much work on the lab-level research,

105
0:05:10.735,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we got an offer from a big corporation to do a very big trial of this idea.

106
0:05:14.87,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And it happened to be a brand, and we didn't think twice.

107
0:05:17.696,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We said, "Let's go ahead."

108
0:05:19.442,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Inventing in the lab is one thing

109
0:05:21.846,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and taking ideas and deploying them in the real world is completely another.

110
0:05:26.188,000 --> 0:05:27,000
During early stages,

111
0:05:27.679,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we had to resort to using our own houses and own kitchens

112
0:05:31.682,000 --> 0:05:32,000
as our ink-making factories,

113
0:05:33.6,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and our own bedrooms and living rooms

114
0:05:35.426,000 --> 0:05:37,000
as the first assembly line for making these inks.

115
0:05:38.735,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is my cofounder Nikhil's own bedroom,

116
0:05:41.426,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that is being used to supply inks to artists all around the world,

117
0:05:45.338,000 --> 0:05:46,000
who would paint with AIR-INK.

118
0:05:46.767,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And that's him, delivering AIR-INKs to the ports

119
0:05:49.306,000 --> 0:05:51,000
so that the artists around the world can use it.

120
0:05:52.441,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Soon, we started seeing

121
0:05:53.651,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that thousands of artists around the world started using AIR-INK,

122
0:05:56.823,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and artworks started emerging like this.

123
0:05:59.632,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Soon, thousands of black-and-white, pollution-made artworks

124
0:06:02.466,000 --> 0:06:03,000
started emerging on a global scale.

125
0:06:04.338,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And believe me, for a group of scientists and engineers and inventors,

126
0:06:08.171,000 --> 0:06:11,000
there was nothing more satisfying than that the product of their work

127
0:06:11.451,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is now being used by some of the finest artists around the world.

128
0:06:14.74,000 --> 0:06:16,000
This is the cover of "Contagious" magazine last year,

129
0:06:17.503,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that was done by using the same ink that we made back in our labs.

130
0:06:22.089,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is a famous painting by the British artist, Christian Furr,

131
0:06:25.983,000 --> 0:06:28,000
who painted it for the song "Paint It Black" by The Rolling Stones.

132
0:06:30.394,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now, there's more to this pen and this ink

133
0:06:33.481,000 --> 0:06:36,000
than just the popular and pop-culture artworks.

134
0:06:36.886,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And now our goal is to create a company

135
0:06:38.982,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that can actually make some black money -- I mean, just money --

136
0:06:42.045,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:43.14,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and high-quality printing processes and inks

138
0:06:45.878,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that can replace the conventional black inks

139
0:06:48.762,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that have been produced for the last thousands of years around the world.

140
0:06:52.683,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Soon after our growing popularity and artworks around the world,

141
0:06:56.54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we started facing a very different kind of a problem.

142
0:06:59.294,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We started getting spammed by polluters,

143
0:07:02.017,000 --> 0:07:05,000
who would send us bags full of pollution to our office address,

144
0:07:05.973,000 --> 0:07:07,000
asking us, "What can we do with this pollution?"

145
0:07:08.512,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Our lab back in Bombay right now has pollution samples

146
0:07:11.341,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that have come from London, from India, from China, you name it.

147
0:07:15.641,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And this is just the beginning.

148
0:07:17.896,000 --> 0:07:2,000
This polluter sent us this specific image, asking us

149
0:07:21.745,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that these are all bags filled with PM 2.5,

150
0:07:24.488,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and can we recycle it for him if we paid him some money.

151
0:07:28.378,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Well, what would he have done if we did not take that pollution?

152
0:07:32.005,000 --> 0:07:35,000
He would probably find a nearby river or a landfill and dump it over there.

153
0:07:36.036,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But now, because we had the economics of AIR-INK figured out on the other side,

154
0:07:39.886,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we could incentivize him to give us this pollution and make inks from it,

155
0:07:45.092,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and turn it into even more valuable products.

156
0:07:49.059,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Now, pollution, as we all know, is a global killer.

157
0:07:52.616,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We can't claim that our ink will solve the world's pollution problem.

158
0:07:56.029,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But it does show what can be done

159
0:07:57.759,000 --> 0:07:59,000
if you look at this problem slightly differently.

160
0:08:00.765,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Look at this T-shirt I'm holding right now.

161
0:08:04.052,000 --> 0:08:07,000
This is made from the same AIR-INK I'm talking about.

162
0:08:08.068,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It's made from the same pollution that is inside this petri dish.

163
0:08:11.283,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And the same pollution we are all breathing in when we are walking outdoors.

164
0:08:15.531,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And we are on our way to do better than this.

165
0:08:17.784,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Thank you very much.

166
0:08:19.142,000 --> 0:08:22,000

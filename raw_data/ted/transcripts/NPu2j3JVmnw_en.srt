Roy Gould: Less than a year from now,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy,

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
which marks the 400th anniversary

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research,

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
which I think is going to have as profound an impact

8
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.

9
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's called the WorldWide Telescope,

10
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.

11
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And I want to urge you, when you get a chance,

12
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs.

13
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images

14
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space,

15
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and has woven them seamlessly

16
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to produce a holistic view of the universe.

17
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's going to change the way we do astronomy,

18
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
it's going to change the way we teach astronomy

19
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and I think most importantly

20
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe.

21
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day,

22
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that might not be so big a claim.

23
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink;

24
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote;

25
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night,

26
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
what you saw was thought to be the entire universe.

27
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
In fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then

28
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
gave a great debate in which he argued

29
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.

30
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Harvard was wrong, big time. (Laughter)

31
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Of course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.

32
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe,

33
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
all the way back in time,

34
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.

35
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We can see across the entire spectrum of light,

36
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
revealing worlds that had previously been invisible.

37
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We see these magnificent star nurseries,

38
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers

39
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise.

40
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems --

41
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
300 now, and still counting --

42
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and they're not like us.

43
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy,

44
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe,

45
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
where time itself seems to stand still.

46
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented,

47
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us

48
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
have fallen through the cracks. And that's changing.

49
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I want to just briefly mention three reasons

50
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
why my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education,

51
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope

52
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and why we think it's truly transformative.

53
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
First, it enables you to experience the universe:

54
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the WorldWide Telescope, for me, is a kind of magic carpet

55
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.

56
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Second: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.

57
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing,

58
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe,

59
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
who can share their enthusiasm

60
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and can make the universe a welcoming place.

61
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And third, you can create your own tours --

62
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
you can share them with friends, you can create them with friends --

63
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about

64
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because I think that at heart, we are all storytellers.

65
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And in telling stories,

66
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.

67
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We're going to have a personal universe.

68
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge.

69
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope,

70
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I just want to leave you with this brief thought:

71
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
when I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?"

72
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they often say, "Oh, tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant."

73
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Well, our gaze fills the universe.

74
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope,

75
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.

76
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you

77
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
that we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant.

78
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Thank you.

79
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Applause)

80
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I can't tell you what a privilege it is

81
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause)

82
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Curtis Wong: Thank you, Roy.

83
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So, what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation,

84
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but it's one of the tours.

85
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And actually this tour is one that was created earlier.

86
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And the tours are all totally interactive,

87
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
so that if I were to go somewhere ...

88
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way,

89
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
pull up other information --

90
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there are lots of Web and information sources

91
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
about places you might want to go --

92
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
you can zoom in, you can pull back out.

93
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The whole resources are there available for you.

94
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So, Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray,

95
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did

96
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is really what makes this project possible.

97
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's a labor of love for us and our small team,

98
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.

99
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So basically, kids of all ages, like us.

100
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring.

101
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It'll be a free download -- thank you, Craig Mundie --

102
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org,

103
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which is something new.

104
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And so, what you've seen today

105
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here,

106
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and in the TED Lab, we have a tour

107
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin

108
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that will knock your socks off. (Laughter)

109
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So we'll see you there. Thank you.

110
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Applause)

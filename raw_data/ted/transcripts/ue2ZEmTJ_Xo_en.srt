1
0:00:12.899,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Intelligence -- what is it?

2
0:00:16.566,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If we take a look back at the history

3
0:00:18.857,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of how intelligence has been viewed,

4
0:00:21.481,000 --> 0:00:24,000
one seminal example has been

5
0:00:25.099,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that

6
0:00:28.576,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"the question of whether a machine can think

7
0:00:31.687,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is about as interesting

8
0:00:32.997,000 --> 0:00:34,000
as the question of whether a submarine

9
0:00:35.968,000 --> 0:00:36,000
can swim."

10
0:00:37.758,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,

11
0:00:41.602,000 --> 0:00:43,000
intended it as a criticism

12
0:00:43.656,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of the early pioneers of computer science,

13
0:00:46.656,000 --> 0:00:47,000
like Alan Turing.

14
0:00:48.403,000 --> 0:00:5,000
However, if you take a look back

15
0:00:50.902,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and think about what have been

16
0:00:52.867,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the most empowering innovations

17
0:00:54.863,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that enabled us to build

18
0:00:56.742,000 --> 0:00:58,000
artificial machines that swim

19
0:00:58.976,000 --> 0:01:,000
and artificial machines that [fly],

20
0:01:01.549,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you find that it was only through understanding

21
0:01:05.096,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the underlying physical mechanisms

22
0:01:07.704,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of swimming and flight

23
0:01:10.483,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that we were able to build these machines.

24
0:01:13.655,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And so, several years ago,

25
0:01:15.911,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I undertook a program to try to understand

26
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the fundamental physical mechanisms

27
0:01:21.794,000 --> 0:01:23,000
underlying intelligence.

28
0:01:24.562,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Let's take a step back.

29
0:01:26.422,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.

30
0:01:29.571,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Pretend that you're an alien race

31
0:01:32.425,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that doesn't know anything about Earth biology

32
0:01:35.466,000 --> 0:01:38,000
or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,

33
0:01:38.582,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but you have amazing telescopes

34
0:01:40.774,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and you're able to watch the Earth,

35
0:01:43.136,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and you have amazingly long lives,

36
0:01:45.468,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so you're able to watch the Earth

37
0:01:46.967,000 --> 0:01:49,000
over millions, even billions of years.

38
0:01:50.409,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And you observe a really strange effect.

39
0:01:53.424,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You observe that, over the course of the millennia,

40
0:01:57.736,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids

41
0:02:02.021,000 --> 0:02:04,000
up until a point,

42
0:02:04.108,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and that at some point,

43
0:02:05.639,000 --> 0:02:09,000
corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,

44
0:02:09.831,000 --> 0:02:1,000
asteroids that are on

45
0:02:11.547,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a collision course with the Earth

46
0:02:13.478,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that otherwise would have collided

47
0:02:15.453,000 --> 0:02:17,000
mysteriously get deflected

48
0:02:17.868,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.

49
0:02:20.94,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now of course, as earthlings,

50
0:02:23.023,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we know the reason would be

51
0:02:24.567,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that we're trying to save ourselves.

52
0:02:26.323,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We're trying to prevent an impact.

53
0:02:29.403,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But if you're an alien race

54
0:02:31.114,000 --> 0:02:32,000
who doesn't know any of this,

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,

56
0:02:34.774,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you'd be forced to put together

57
0:02:36.502,000 --> 0:02:38,000
a physical theory that explains how,

58
0:02:39.42,000 --> 0:02:41,000
up until a certain point in time,

59
0:02:41.958,000 --> 0:02:45,000
asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet

60
0:02:46.407,000 --> 0:02:49,000
mysteriously stop doing that.

61
0:02:49.638,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And so I claim that this is the same question

62
0:02:53.842,000 --> 0:02:56,000
as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.

63
0:02:57.84,000 --> 0:03:,000
So in this program that I undertook several years ago,

64
0:03:01.722,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I looked at a variety of different threads

65
0:03:04.487,000 --> 0:03:07,000
across science, across a variety of disciplines,

66
0:03:07.649,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that were pointing, I think,

67
0:03:09.541,000 --> 0:03:11,000
towards a single, underlying mechanism

68
0:03:12.089,000 --> 0:03:13,000
for intelligence.

69
0:03:13.67,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In cosmology, for example,

70
0:03:16.216,000 --> 0:03:18,000
there have been a variety of different threads of evidence

71
0:03:18.963,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that our universe appears to be finely tuned

72
0:03:22.37,000 --> 0:03:24,000
for the development of intelligence,

73
0:03:24.523,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and, in particular, for the development

74
0:03:26.912,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of universal states

75
0:03:28.798,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that maximize the diversity of possible futures.

76
0:03:32.896,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In game play, for example, in Go --

77
0:03:35.24,000 --> 0:03:38,000
everyone remembers in 1997

78
0:03:38.265,000 --> 0:03:41,000
when IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess --

79
0:03:42.216,000 --> 0:03:43,000
fewer people are aware

80
0:03:43.739,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that in the past 10 years or so,

81
0:03:45.757,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the game of Go,

82
0:03:46.955,000 --> 0:03:47,000
arguably a much more challenging game

83
0:03:48.911,000 --> 0:03:5,000
because it has a much higher branching factor,

84
0:03:51.336,000 --> 0:03:52,000
has also started to succumb

85
0:03:53.038,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to computer game players

86
0:03:54.903,000 --> 0:03:55,000
for the same reason:

87
0:03:56.476,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the best techniques right now for computers playing Go

88
0:03:59.276,000 --> 0:04:02,000
are techniques that try to maximize future options

89
0:04:02.972,000 --> 0:04:04,000
during game play.

90
0:04:04.986,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Finally, in robotic motion planning,

91
0:04:08.567,000 --> 0:04:1,000
there have been a variety of recent techniques

92
0:04:10.749,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that have tried to take advantage

93
0:04:12.651,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of abilities of robots to maximize

94
0:04:15.797,000 --> 0:04:16,000
future freedom of action

95
0:04:17.303,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in order to accomplish complex tasks.

96
0:04:20.4,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And so, taking all of these different threads

97
0:04:22.755,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and putting them together,

98
0:04:24.377,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I asked, starting several years ago,

99
0:04:27.017,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence

100
0:04:29.867,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that we can factor out

101
0:04:31.54,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of all of these different threads?

102
0:04:33.314,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Is there a single equation for intelligence?

103
0:04:37.907,000 --> 0:04:4,000

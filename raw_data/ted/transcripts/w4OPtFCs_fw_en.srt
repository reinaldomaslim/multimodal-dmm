0:00:12.731,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Recently, the leadership team of an American supermarket chain

2
0:00:16.361,000 --> 0:00:19,000
decided that their business needed to get a lot more efficient.

3
0:00:19.841,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So they embraced their digital transformation with zeal.

4
0:00:24.174,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Out went the teams supervising meat, veg, bakery,

5
0:00:28.146,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and in came an algorithmic task allocator.

6
0:00:32.914,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, instead of people working together,

7
0:00:35.041,000 --> 0:00:39,000
each employee went, clocked in, got assigned a task, did it,

8
0:00:39.306,000 --> 0:00:4,000
came back for more.

9
0:00:41.429,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This was scientific management on steroids,

10
0:00:45.18,000 --> 0:00:47,000
standardizing and allocating work.

11
0:00:47.58,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It was super efficient.

12
0:00:50.75,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Well, not quite,

13
0:00:53.351,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because the task allocator didn't know

14
0:00:55.701,000 --> 0:00:57,000
when a customer was going to drop a box of eggs,

15
0:00:58.647,000 --> 0:01:01,000
couldn't predict when some crazy kid was going to knock over a display,

16
0:01:02.52,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or when the local high school decided

17
0:01:04.46,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that everybody needed to bring in coconuts the next day.

18
0:01:07.119,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:08.143,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Efficiency works really well

20
0:01:10.304,000 --> 0:01:13,000
when you can predict exactly what you're going to need.

21
0:01:13.815,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But when the anomalous or unexpected comes along --

22
0:01:17.115,000 --> 0:01:19,000
kids, customers, coconuts --

23
0:01:19.471,000 --> 0:01:21,000
well, then efficiency is no longer your friend.

24
0:01:24.074,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This has become a really crucial issue,

25
0:01:26.215,000 --> 0:01:28,000
this ability to deal with the unexpected,

26
0:01:29.771,000 --> 0:01:32,000
because the unexpected is becoming the norm.

27
0:01:33.66,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's why experts and forecasters are reluctant to predict anything

28
0:01:37.761,000 --> 0:01:39,000
more than 400 days out.

29
0:01:41.054,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Why?

30
0:01:42.524,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Because over the last 20 or 30 years,

31
0:01:44.472,000 --> 0:01:47,000
much of the world has gone from being complicated

32
0:01:48.306,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to being complex --

33
0:01:50.431,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which means that yes, there are patterns,

34
0:01:52.738,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but they don't repeat themselves regularly.

35
0:01:55.44,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It means that very small changes can make a disproportionate impact.

36
0:02:00.244,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And it means that expertise won't always suffice,

37
0:02:02.934,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because the system just keeps changing too fast.

38
0:02:08.192,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So what that means

39
0:02:10.848,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is that there's a huge amount in the world

40
0:02:13.759,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that kind of defies forecasting now.

41
0:02:16.773,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's why the Bank of England will say yes, there will be another crash,

42
0:02:20.627,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but we don't know why or when.

43
0:02:23.807,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We know that climate change is real,

44
0:02:26.447,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but we can't predict where forest fires will break out,

45
0:02:29.547,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and we don't know which factories are going to flood.

46
0:02:33.313,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's why companies are blindsided

47
0:02:36.028,000 --> 0:02:4,000
when plastic straws and bags and bottled water

48
0:02:40.921,000 --> 0:02:43,000
go from staples to rejects overnight,

49
0:02:45.488,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and baffled when a change in social mores

50
0:02:49.084,000 --> 0:02:53,000
turns stars into pariahs and colleagues into outcasts:

51
0:02:55.155,000 --> 0:02:58,000
ineradicable uncertainty.

52
0:02:59.319,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In an environment that defies so much forecasting,

53
0:03:03.679,000 --> 0:03:06,000
efficiency won't just not help us,

54
0:03:06.907,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it specifically undermines and erodes our capacity to adapt and respond.

55
0:03:16.055,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So if efficiency is no longer our guiding principle,

56
0:03:19.22,000 --> 0:03:2,000
how should we address the future?

57
0:03:20.992,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What kind of thinking is really going to help us?

58
0:03:23.468,000 --> 0:03:28,000
What sort of talents must we be sure to defend?

59
0:03:29.601,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I think that, where in the past we used to think a lot about just in time management,

60
0:03:34.51,000 --> 0:03:37,000
now we have to start thinking about just in case,

61
0:03:38.418,000 --> 0:03:41,000
preparing for events that are generally certain

62
0:03:41.839,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but specifically remain ambiguous.

63
0:03:45.11,000 --> 0:03:5,000
One example of this is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI.

64
0:03:50.332,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We know there will be more epidemics in future,

65
0:03:54.452,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but we don't know where or when or what.

66
0:03:58.362,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So we can't plan.

67
0:04:00.942,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But we can prepare.

68
0:04:03.257,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So CEPI's developing multiple vaccines for multiple diseases,

69
0:04:09.866,000 --> 0:04:12,000
knowing that they can't predict which vaccines are going to work

70
0:04:13.437,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or which diseases will break out.

71
0:04:15.481,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So some of those vaccines will never be used.

72
0:04:18.478,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That's inefficient.

73
0:04:20.794,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But it's robust,

74
0:04:22.729,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because it provides more options,

75
0:04:24.688,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and it means that we don't depend on a single technological solution.

76
0:04:30.566,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Epidemic responsiveness also depends hugely

77
0:04:33.958,000 --> 0:04:35,000
on people who know and trust each other.

78
0:04:36.899,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But those relationships take time to develop,

79
0:04:39.71,000 --> 0:04:43,000
time that is always in short supply when an epidemic breaks out.

80
0:04:43.959,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So CEPI is developing relationships, friendships, alliances now

81
0:04:50.197,000 --> 0:04:53,000
knowing that some of those may never be used.

82
0:04:53.949,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That's inefficient, a waste of time, perhaps,

83
0:04:57.126,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but it's robust.

84
0:04:59.161,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You can see robust thinking in financial services, too.

85
0:05:02.99,000 --> 0:05:05,000
In the past, banks used to hold much less capital

86
0:05:06.768,000 --> 0:05:08,000
than they're required to today,

87
0:05:09.015,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because holding so little capital, being too efficient with it,

88
0:05:12.78,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is what made the banks so fragile in the first place.

89
0:05:16.581,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, holding more capital looks and is inefficient.

90
0:05:22.094,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But it's robust, because it protects the financial system against surprises.

91
0:05:29.078,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Countries that are really serious about climate change

92
0:05:32.096,000 --> 0:05:35,000
know that they have to adopt multiple solutions,

93
0:05:35.674,000 --> 0:05:38,000
multiple forms of renewable energy,

94
0:05:38.726,000 --> 0:05:39,000
not just one.

95
0:05:40.079,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The countries that are most advanced have been working for years now,

96
0:05:44.963,000 --> 0:05:47,000
changing their water and food supply and healthcare systems,

97
0:05:48.653,000 --> 0:05:52,000
because they recognize that by the time they have certain prediction,

98
0:05:53.289,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that information may very well come too late.

99
0:05:57.458,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You can take the same approach to trade wars, and many countries do.

100
0:06:01.938,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Instead of depending on a single huge trading partner,

101
0:06:05.785,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they try to be everybody's friends,

102
0:06:07.913,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because they know they can't predict

103
0:06:10.275,000 --> 0:06:13,000
which markets might suddenly become unstable.

104
0:06:14.053,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's time-consuming and expensive, negotiating all these deals,

105
0:06:18.314,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but it's robust

106
0:06:19.496,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because it makes their whole economy better defended against shocks.

107
0:06:24.931,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's particularly a strategy adopted by small countries

108
0:06:28.634,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that know they'll never have the market muscle to call the shots,

109
0:06:32.744,000 --> 0:06:35,000
so it's just better to have too many friends.

110
0:06:37.922,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But if you're stuck in one of these organizations

111
0:06:40.353,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that's still kind of captured by the efficiency myth,

112
0:06:45.272,000 --> 0:06:46,000
how do you start to change it?

113
0:06:48.011,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Try some experiments.

114
0:06:50.421,000 --> 0:06:51,000
In the Netherlands,

115
0:06:51.811,000 --> 0:06:55,000
home care nursing used to be run pretty much like the supermarket:

116
0:06:56.549,000 --> 0:06:58,000
standardized and prescribed work

117
0:06:59.351,000 --> 0:07:,000
to the minute:

118
0:07:01.143,000 --> 0:07:04,000
nine minutes on Monday, seven minutes on Wednesday,

119
0:07:04.823,000 --> 0:07:05,000
eight minutes on Friday.

120
0:07:06.561,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The nurses hated it.

121
0:07:08.967,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So one of them, Jos de Blok,

122
0:07:11.363,000 --> 0:07:12,000
proposed an experiment.

123
0:07:13.564,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Since every patient is different,

124
0:07:15.22,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and we don't quite know exactly what they'll need,

125
0:07:17.658,000 --> 0:07:19,000
why don't we just leave it to the nurses to decide?

126
0:07:21.267,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Sound reckless?

127
0:07:22.661,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:24.08,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Applause)

129
0:07:26.224,000 --> 0:07:3,000
In his experiment, Jos found the patients got better

130
0:07:30.382,000 --> 0:07:32,000
in half the time,

131
0:07:32.935,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and costs fell by 30 percent.

132
0:07:37.92,000 --> 0:07:41,000
When I asked Jos what had surprised him about his experiment,

133
0:07:42.156,000 --> 0:07:43,000
he just kind of laughed and he said,

134
0:07:43.973,000 --> 0:07:46,000
"Well, I had no idea it could be so easy

135
0:07:47.189,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to find such a huge improvement,

136
0:07:49.803,000 --> 0:07:52,000
because this isn't the kind of thing you can know or predict

137
0:07:53.45,000 --> 0:07:55,000
sitting at a desk or staring at a computer screen."

138
0:07:56.734,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So now this form of nursing has proliferated across the Netherlands

139
0:08:00.532,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and around the world.

140
0:08:02.29,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But in every new country it still starts with experiments,

141
0:08:05.534,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because each place is slightly and unpredictably different.

142
0:08:11.246,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Of course, not all experiments work.

143
0:08:15.22,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Jos tried a similar approach to the fire service

144
0:08:18.3,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and found it didn't work because the service is just too centralized.

145
0:08:21.861,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Failed experiments look inefficient,

146
0:08:24.448,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but they're often the only way you can figure out

147
0:08:27.655,000 --> 0:08:29,000
how the real world works.

148
0:08:30.28,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So now he's trying teachers.

149
0:08:34.746,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Experiments like that require creativity

150
0:08:38.517,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and not a little bravery.

151
0:08:41.613,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In England --

152
0:08:43.978,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I was about to say in the UK, but in England --

153
0:08:46.907,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:48.673,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:53.363,000 --> 0:08:57,000
In England, the leading rugby team, or one of the leading rugby teams,

156
0:08:57.473,000 --> 0:08:58,000
is Saracens.

157
0:08:59.299,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The manager and the coach there realized that all the physical training they do

158
0:09:04.388,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and the data-driven conditioning that they do

159
0:09:07.126,000 --> 0:09:08,000
has become generic;

160
0:09:08.304,000 --> 0:09:1,000
really, all the teams do exactly the same thing.

161
0:09:11.683,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So they risked an experiment.

162
0:09:14.039,000 --> 0:09:18,000
They took the whole team away, even in match season,

163
0:09:18.308,000 --> 0:09:19,000
on ski trips

164
0:09:19.747,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and to look at social projects in Chicago.

165
0:09:23.065,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This was expensive,

166
0:09:24.615,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it was time-consuming,

167
0:09:26.591,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and it could be a little risky

168
0:09:28.296,000 --> 0:09:31,000
putting a whole bunch of rugby players on a ski slope, right?

169
0:09:32.094,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

170
0:09:33.165,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But what they found was that the players came back

171
0:09:36.533,000 --> 0:09:41,000
with renewed bonds of loyalty and solidarity.

172
0:09:41.823,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And now when they're on the pitch under incredible pressure,

173
0:09:45.256,000 --> 0:09:49,000
they manifest what the manager calls "poise" --

174
0:09:50.515,000 --> 0:09:54,000
an unflinching, unwavering dedication

175
0:09:54.698,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to each other.

176
0:09:56.824,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Their opponents are in awe of this,

177
0:10:00.601,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but still too in thrall to efficiency to try it.

178
0:10:05.783,000 --> 0:10:07,000
At a London tech company, Verve,

179
0:10:07.839,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the CEO measures just about everything that moves,

180
0:10:11.206,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but she couldn't find anything that made any difference

181
0:10:14.254,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to the company's productivity.

182
0:10:16.405,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So she devised an experiment that she calls "Love Week":

183
0:10:20.184,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a whole week where each employee has to look for really clever,

184
0:10:24.745,000 --> 0:10:26,000
helpful, imaginative things

185
0:10:27.048,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that a counterpart does,

186
0:10:28.872,000 --> 0:10:3,000
call it out and celebrate it.

187
0:10:31.36,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It takes a huge amount of time and effort;

188
0:10:33.501,000 --> 0:10:36,000
lots of people would call it distracting.

189
0:10:36.562,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But it really energizes the business

190
0:10:38.818,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and makes the whole company more productive.

191
0:10:44.048,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Preparedness, coalition-building,

192
0:10:47.378,000 --> 0:10:5,000
imagination, experiments,

193
0:10:50.984,000 --> 0:10:51,000
bravery --

194
0:10:53.028,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in an unpredictable age,

195
0:10:54.649,000 --> 0:10:59,000
these are tremendous sources of resilience and strength.

196
0:11:00.673,000 --> 0:11:02,000
They aren't efficient,

197
0:11:04.278,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but they give us limitless capacity

198
0:11:06.971,000 --> 0:11:1,000
for adaptation, variation and invention.

199
0:11:12.284,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And the less we know about the future,

200
0:11:14.73,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the more we're going to need these tremendous sources

201
0:11:20.156,000 --> 0:11:25,000
of human, messy, unpredictable skills.

202
0:11:27.336,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But in our growing dependence on technology,

203
0:11:32.318,000 --> 0:11:35,000
we're asset-stripping those skills.

204
0:11:36.642,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Every time we use technology

205
0:11:40.231,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to nudge us through a decision or a choice

206
0:11:44.447,000 --> 0:11:46,000
or to interpret how somebody's feeling

207
0:11:46.785,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or to guide us through a conversation,

208
0:11:48.986,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we outsource to a machine what we could, can do ourselves,

209
0:11:54.124,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and it's an expensive trade-off.

210
0:11:57.847,000 --> 0:11:59,000
The more we let machines think for us,

211
0:12:01.78,000 --> 0:12:03,000
the less we can think for ourselves.

212
0:12:05.661,000 --> 0:12:06,000
The more --

213
0:12:06.838,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Applause)

214
0:12:11.432,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The more time doctors spend staring at digital medical records,

215
0:12:16.177,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the less time they spend looking at their patients.

216
0:12:20.325,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The more we use parenting apps,

217
0:12:23.137,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the less we know our kids.

218
0:12:26.31,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The more time we spend with people that we're predicted and programmed to like,

219
0:12:31.42,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the less we can connect with people who are different from ourselves.

220
0:12:35.154,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And the less compassion we need, the less compassion we have.

221
0:12:41.825,000 --> 0:12:44,000
What all of these technologies attempt to do

222
0:12:45.383,000 --> 0:12:51,000
is to force-fit a standardized model of a predictable reality

223
0:12:52.204,000 --> 0:12:55,000
onto a world that is infinitely surprising.

224
0:12:56.926,000 --> 0:12:57,000
What gets left out?

225
0:12:58.965,000 --> 0:13:,000
Anything that can't be measured --

226
0:13:02.451,000 --> 0:13:04,000
which is just about everything that counts.

227
0:13:05.81,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Applause)

228
0:13:14.854,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Our growing dependence on technology

229
0:13:18.965,000 --> 0:13:21,000
risks us becoming less skilled,

230
0:13:22.762,000 --> 0:13:23,000
more vulnerable

231
0:13:24.381,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to the deep and growing complexity

232
0:13:27.356,000 --> 0:13:28,000
of the real world.

233
0:13:29.951,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Now, as I was thinking about the extremes of stress and turbulence

234
0:13:35.359,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that we know we will have to confront,

235
0:13:39.412,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I went and I talked to a number of chief executives

236
0:13:42.388,000 --> 0:13:46,000
whose own businesses had gone through existential crises,

237
0:13:46.58,000 --> 0:13:48,000
when they teetered on the brink of collapse.

238
0:13:50.594,000 --> 0:13:54,000
These were frank, gut-wrenching conversations.

239
0:13:56.302,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Many men wept just remembering.

240
0:14:00.214,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So I asked them:

241
0:14:02.603,000 --> 0:14:04,000
"What kept you going through this?"

242
0:14:05.328,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And they all had exactly the same answer.

243
0:14:08.006,000 --> 0:14:11,000
"It wasn't data or technology," they said.

244
0:14:11.926,000 --> 0:14:14,000
"It was my friends and my colleagues

245
0:14:15.335,000 --> 0:14:16,000
who kept me going."

246
0:14:17.173,000 --> 0:14:22,000
One added, "It was pretty much the opposite of the gig economy."

247
0:14:24.056,000 --> 0:14:27,000
But then I went and I talked to a group of young, rising executives,

248
0:14:27.814,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and I asked them,

249
0:14:29.645,000 --> 0:14:3,000
"Who are your friends at work?"

250
0:14:31.211,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And they just looked blank.

251
0:14:33.765,000 --> 0:14:34,000
"There's no time."

252
0:14:35.639,000 --> 0:14:36,000
"They're too busy."

253
0:14:37.472,000 --> 0:14:38,000
"It's not efficient."

254
0:14:39.906,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Who, I wondered, is going to give them

255
0:14:43.502,000 --> 0:14:47,000
imagination and stamina and bravery

256
0:14:48.065,000 --> 0:14:49,000
when the storms come?

257
0:14:51.694,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Anyone who tries to tell you that they know the future

258
0:14:55.361,000 --> 0:14:57,000
is just trying to own it,

259
0:14:57.583,000 --> 0:15:,000
a spurious kind of manifest destiny.

260
0:15:01.794,000 --> 0:15:03,000
The harder, deeper truth is

261
0:15:05.126,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that the future is uncharted,

262
0:15:07.559,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that we can't map it till we get there.

263
0:15:10.734,000 --> 0:15:12,000
But that's OK,

264
0:15:12.821,000 --> 0:15:15,000
because we have so much imagination --

265
0:15:15.862,000 --> 0:15:16,000
if we use it.

266
0:15:17.333,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We have deep talents of inventiveness and exploration --

267
0:15:22.834,000 --> 0:15:23,000
if we apply them.

268
0:15:24.635,000 --> 0:15:29,000
We are brave enough to invent things we've never seen before.

269
0:15:31.175,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Lose those skills,

270
0:15:33.81,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and we are adrift.

271
0:15:36.384,000 --> 0:15:38,000
But hone and develop them,

272
0:15:40.498,000 --> 0:15:42,000
we can make any future we choose.

273
0:15:44.382,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Thank you.

274
0:15:45.58,000 --> 0:15:51,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
"You don't belong here"

2
0:00:14.28,000 --> 0:00:17,000
almost always means, "We can't find a function or a role for you."

3
0:00:18.865,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"You don't belong here" sometimes means, "You're too queer to handle."

4
0:00:24.2,000 --> 0:00:25,000
"You don't belong here"

5
0:00:27.36,000 --> 0:00:28,000
very rarely means,

6
0:00:29.08,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"There's no way for you to exist and be happy here."

7
0:00:33.92,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I went to university in Johannesburg, South Africa,

8
0:00:36.36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I remember the first time a white friend of mine

9
0:00:38.813,000 --> 0:00:41,000
heard me speaking Setswana, the national language of Botswana.

10
0:00:43.24,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was on the phone with my mother

11
0:00:44.92,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and the intrigue which painted itself across her face was absolutely priceless.

12
0:00:50.36,000 --> 0:00:52,000
As soon as I hung up, she comes to me and says,

13
0:00:53.04,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"I didn't know you could do that.

14
0:00:54.68,000 --> 0:00:57,000
After all these years of knowing you, how did I not know you could do that?"

15
0:00:59.28,000 --> 0:01:02,000
What she was referring to was the fact that I could switch off the twang

16
0:01:02.72,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and slip into a native tongue,

17
0:01:04.2,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and so I chose to let her in on a few other things

18
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:08,000
which locate me as a Motswana,

19
0:01:10.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
not just by virtue of the fact that I speak a language

20
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:14,000
or I have family there,

21
0:01:14.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but that a rural child lives within this shiny visage of fabulosity.

22
0:01:19.72,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:22.48,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Applause)

24
0:01:26.52,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I invited the Motswana public into the story, my story,

25
0:01:29.76,000 --> 0:01:32,000
as a transgender person years ago, in English of course,

26
0:01:33.24,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because Setswana is a gender-neutral language

27
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the closest we get is an approximation of "transgender."

28
0:01:39.2,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And an important part of my history got left out of that story,

29
0:01:42.92,000 --> 0:01:45,000
by association rather than out of any act of shame.

30
0:01:47.4,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"Kat" was an international superstar,

31
0:01:50.48,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a fashion and lifestyle writer, a musician, theater producer

32
0:01:53.76,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and performer --

33
0:01:55.04,000 --> 0:01:58,000
all the things that qualify me to be a mainstream, whitewashed,

34
0:01:58.96,000 --> 0:02:,000
new age digestible queer.

35
0:02:01.12,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Kat.

36
0:02:02.92,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Kat had a degree from one of the best universities in Africa,

37
0:02:06.32,000 --> 0:02:07,000
oh no, the world.

38
0:02:08.48,000 --> 0:02:1,000
By association, what Kat wasn't

39
0:02:10.6,000 --> 0:02:12,000
was just like the little brown-skinned children

40
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
frolicking through the streets of some incidental railway settlement

41
0:02:16.28,000 --> 0:02:17,000
like Tati Siding,

42
0:02:17.8,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or an off-the-grid village like Kgagodi,

43
0:02:21.039,000 --> 0:02:24,000
legs clad in dust stockings whose knees had blackened

44
0:02:24.08,000 --> 0:02:27,000
from years of kneeling and wax-polishing floors,

45
0:02:27.36,000 --> 0:02:31,000
whose shins were marked with lessons from climbing trees,

46
0:02:31.52,000 --> 0:02:32,000
who played until dusk,

47
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
went in for supper by a paraffin lamp

48
0:02:35.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and returned to play hide-and-seek amongst centipedes and owls

49
0:02:40.28,000 --> 0:02:43,000
until finally someone's mother would call the whole thing to an end.

50
0:02:44.44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That got lost both in translation and in transition,

51
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and when I realized this,

52
0:02:50.44,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I decided it was time for me to start building bridges between myselves.

53
0:02:55.56,000 --> 0:02:57,000
For me and for others to access me,

54
0:02:58.28,000 --> 0:03:,000
I had to start indigenizing my queerness.

55
0:03:01.96,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What I mean by indigenizing is stripping away the city life film

56
0:03:05.4,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that stops you from seeing the villager within.

57
0:03:08.36,000 --> 0:03:12,000
In a time where being brown, queer, African and seen as worthy of space

58
0:03:12.76,000 --> 0:03:14,000
means being everything but rural,

59
0:03:14.8,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I fear that we're erasing the very struggles

60
0:03:16.92,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that got us to where we are now.

61
0:03:19.64,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The very first time I queered being out in a village,

62
0:03:22.24,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I was in my early 20s, and I wore a kaftan.

63
0:03:25.24,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I was ridiculed by some of my family and by strangers for wearing a dress.

64
0:03:30.2,000 --> 0:03:34,000
My defense against their comments was the default that we who don't belong,

65
0:03:34.68,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the ones who are better than, get taught,

66
0:03:37.64,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we shrug them off and say, "They just don't know enough."

67
0:03:41.24,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And of course I was wrong, because my idea of wealth of knowledge

68
0:03:45.72,000 --> 0:03:51,000
was based in removing yourself from Third World thinking and living.

69
0:03:52.64,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But it took time for me to realize that my acts of pride

70
0:03:55.32,000 --> 0:03:58,000
weren't most alive in the global cities I traipsed through,

71
0:03:58.76,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but in the villages where I speak the languages and play the games

72
0:04:02.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and feel most at home and I can say,

73
0:04:04.76,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"I have seen the world,

74
0:04:06.68,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I know that people like me aren't alone here, we are everywhere."

75
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And so I used these village homes for self-reflection

76
0:04:14.52,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and to give hope to the others who don't belong.

77
0:04:17.96,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Indigenizing my queerness

78
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
means bridging the many exceptional parts of myself.

79
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It means honoring the fact

80
0:04:26.04,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that my tongue can contort itself to speak the romance languages

81
0:04:29.48,000 --> 0:04:35,000
without denying or exoticizing the fact that when I am moved, it can do this:

82
0:04:35.72,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Ululating)

83
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It means --

84
0:04:42.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Cheers)

85
0:04:44.12,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Applause)

86
0:04:48.2,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It means branding cattle with my mother or chopping firewood with my cousins

87
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
doesn't make me any less fabulous or queer,

88
0:04:54.6,000 --> 0:04:58,000
even though I'm now accustomed to rooftop shindigs, wine-paired menus

89
0:04:58.96,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and VIP lounges.

90
0:05:00.6,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:02.48,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It means wearing my pride through my grandmother's tongue,

92
0:05:07.08,000 --> 0:05:09,000
my mother's food, my grandfather's song,

93
0:05:09.92,000 --> 0:05:12,000
my skin etched with stories of falling off donkeys

94
0:05:13.32,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and years and years and years of sleeping under a blanket of stars.

95
0:05:19.24,000 --> 0:05:21,000
If there's any place I don't belong,

96
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it's in a mind where the story of me starts with the branch of me being queer

97
0:05:26.76,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and not with my rural roots.

98
0:05:29.24,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Indigenizing my queerness means understanding

99
0:05:32.72,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that the rural is a part of me, and I am an indelible part of it.

100
0:05:37.36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Thank you.

101
0:05:38.6,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Applause)

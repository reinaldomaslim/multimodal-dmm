1
0:00:12.836,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What was the most difficult job you ever did?

2
0:00:15.882,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Was it working in the sun?

3
0:00:17.564,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Was it working to provide food for a family or a community?

4
0:00:21.134,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property?

5
0:00:25.661,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Was it working alone

6
0:00:26.876,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed,

7
0:00:30.28,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but that might improve human health or save a life?

8
0:00:33.667,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Was it working to build something, create something, make a work of art?

9
0:00:38.991,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Was it work for which you were never sure

10
0:00:41.002,000 --> 0:00:44,000
you were fully understood or appreciated?

11
0:00:45.113,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The people in our communities who do these jobs

12
0:00:47.393,000 --> 0:00:5,000
deserve our attention, our love and our deepest support.

13
0:00:51.417,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But people aren't the only ones in our communities

14
0:00:53.884,000 --> 0:00:54,000
who do these difficult jobs.

15
0:00:56.114,000 --> 0:00:58,000
These jobs are also done by the plants, the animals

16
0:00:58.9,000 --> 0:01:,000
and the ecosystems on our planet,

17
0:01:01.356,000 --> 0:01:04,000
including the ecosystems I study: the tropical coral reefs.

18
0:01:05.64,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Coral reefs are farmers.

19
0:01:07.626,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They provide food, income and food security

20
0:01:10.86,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for hundreds of millions of people around the world.

21
0:01:13.447,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Coral reefs are security guards.

22
0:01:16.181,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The structures that they build protect our shorelines

23
0:01:18.962,000 --> 0:01:19,000
from storm surge and waves,

24
0:01:20.843,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and the biological systems that they house filter the water

25
0:01:24.533,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and make it safer for us to work and play.

26
0:01:27.552,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Coral reefs are chemists.

27
0:01:30.138,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important

28
0:01:33.931,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs.

29
0:01:37.528,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And coral reefs are artists.

30
0:01:39.707,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The structures that they build

31
0:01:41.226,000 --> 0:01:43,000
are some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth.

32
0:01:43.8,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry

33
0:01:46.61,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in many countries with few or little other natural resources.

34
0:01:51.877,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So for all of these reasons, all of these ecosystem services,

35
0:01:55.161,000 --> 0:01:57,000
economists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs

36
0:01:57.87,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year.

37
0:02:01.271,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And yet despite all that hard work being done for us

38
0:02:04.402,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and all that wealth that we gain,

39
0:02:06.622,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that.

40
0:02:11.091,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We have taken the fish out of the oceans

41
0:02:13.068,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and we have added in fertilizer, sewage,

42
0:02:15.69,000 --> 0:02:18,000
diseases, oil, pollution, sediments.

43
0:02:19.613,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We have trampled the reefs physically with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers,

44
0:02:23.51,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea,

45
0:02:26.041,000 --> 0:02:28,000
warmed the waters and made storms worse.

46
0:02:28.693,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And these would all be bad on their own,

47
0:02:30.868,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but these threats magnify each other

48
0:02:32.65,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and compound one another and make each other worse.

49
0:02:35.63,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I'll give you an example.

50
0:02:37.047,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Where I live and work, in Curaçao, a tropical storm went by a few years ago.

51
0:02:41.396,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And on the eastern end of the island,

52
0:02:43.309,000 --> 0:02:44,000
where the reefs are intact and thriving,

53
0:02:45.277,000 --> 0:02:47,000
you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed.

54
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But in town, where corals had died from overfishing, from pollution,

55
0:02:53.609,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the tropical storm picked up the dead corals

56
0:02:55.736,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left.

57
0:02:59.361,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This is a coral that I studied during my PhD --

58
0:03:01.702,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I got to know it quite well.

59
0:03:03.295,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And after this storm took off half of its tissue,

60
0:03:06.398,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it became infested with algae,

61
0:03:08.091,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died.

62
0:03:11.416,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This magnification of threats, this compounding of factors

63
0:03:15.402,000 --> 0:03:19,000
is what Jeremy Jackson describes as the "slippery slope to slime."

64
0:03:20.699,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now

65
0:03:24.276,000 --> 0:03:27,000
are literally bacteria and algae and slime.

66
0:03:28.954,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, this is the part of the talk

67
0:03:30.59,000 --> 0:03:32,000
where you may expect me to launch into my plea

68
0:03:33.503,000 --> 0:03:35,000
for us to all save the coral reefs.

69
0:03:36.835,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But I have a confession to make:

70
0:03:39.744,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that phrase drives me nuts.

71
0:03:42.363,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Whether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline

72
0:03:46.078,000 --> 0:03:49,000
or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure,

73
0:03:49.689,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that phrase bothers me,

74
0:03:51.536,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms

75
0:03:54.488,000 --> 0:03:56,000
about the death of coral reefs for decades.

76
0:03:56.916,000 --> 0:04:,000
And yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated,

77
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is not sure what a coral is or where they come from.

78
0:04:05.489,000 --> 0:04:08,000
How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs

79
0:04:08.838,000 --> 0:04:11,000
when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand?

80
0:04:13.371,000 --> 0:04:16,000
If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from,

81
0:04:16.467,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is,

82
0:04:19.158,000 --> 0:04:21,000
why would we expect them to care about saving them?

83
0:04:22.51,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So let's change that.

84
0:04:23.852,000 --> 0:04:25,000
What is a coral and where does it come from?

85
0:04:27.287,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Corals are born in a number of different ways,

86
0:04:29.479,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species

87
0:04:33.726,000 --> 0:04:34,000
on one night a year,

88
0:04:35.086,000 --> 0:04:37,000
releasing all the eggs they've made that year

89
0:04:37.823,000 --> 0:04:38,000
into the water column,

90
0:04:39.041,000 --> 0:04:41,000
packaged into bundles with sperm cells.

91
0:04:41.509,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart.

92
0:04:45.009,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And hopefully -- hopefully -- at the surface of the ocean,

93
0:04:47.779,000 --> 0:04:49,000
they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals.

94
0:04:50.024,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef --

95
0:04:53.156,000 --> 0:04:56,000
so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface.

96
0:04:57.254,000 --> 0:05:,000
When they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does:

97
0:05:00.386,000 --> 0:05:02,000
divides in half again and again and again.

98
0:05:03.059,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Taking these photos under the microscope every year

99
0:05:05.561,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year.

100
0:05:08.753,000 --> 0:05:11,000
At the end of all this cell division, they turn into a swimming larva --

101
0:05:12.73,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed,

102
0:05:16.488,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but with all of the sensory systems that we have.

103
0:05:19.182,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH.

104
0:05:24.862,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound.

105
0:05:28.253,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And they use those talents

106
0:05:29.571,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach

107
0:05:32.428,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and live the rest of their lives.

108
0:05:34.051,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life

109
0:05:37.451,000 --> 0:05:38,000
when you were just two days old.

110
0:05:39.78,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They attach in the place they find most suitable,

111
0:05:42.571,000 --> 0:05:44,000
they build a skeleton underneath themselves,

112
0:05:44.674,000 --> 0:05:45,000
they build a mouth and tentacles,

113
0:05:46.287,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs.

114
0:05:51.124,000 --> 0:05:54,000
One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again,

115
0:05:54.993,000 --> 0:05:56,000
leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself

116
0:05:57.358,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and growing up toward the sun.

117
0:05:59.906,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Given hundreds of years and many species,

118
0:06:02.652,000 --> 0:06:04,000
what you get is a massive limestone structure

119
0:06:05.014,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that can be seen from space in many cases,

120
0:06:07.55,000 --> 0:06:1,000
covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals.

121
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.

122
0:06:16.435,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But these systems house millions and millions of other species,

123
0:06:21.193,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems,

124
0:06:23.701,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and it's where we're finding our new medicines.

125
0:06:25.939,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's how we find new sources of food.

126
0:06:29.841,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Curaçao,

127
0:06:32.206,000 --> 0:06:34,000
where we still have reefs that look like this.

128
0:06:34.486,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world

129
0:06:38.821,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is much more like this.

130
0:06:40.711,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Scientists have studied in increasing detail

131
0:06:43.758,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the loss of the world's coral reefs,

132
0:06:45.564,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes.

133
0:06:49.149,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward.

134
0:06:52.165,000 --> 0:06:55,000
My colleagues and I in Curaçao are interested in looking forward

135
0:06:55.25,000 --> 0:06:56,000
at what might be.

136
0:06:56.631,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic.

137
0:07:00.824,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Because even in some of these reefs

138
0:07:02.625,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that we probably could have written off long ago,

139
0:07:06.298,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway.

140
0:07:11.193,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability

141
0:07:14.492,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't.

142
0:07:18.119,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They may be able to adjust

143
0:07:20.159,000 --> 0:07:23,000
ever so slightly more readily to this human planet.

144
0:07:24.89,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So in the research I do with my colleagues in Curaçao,

145
0:07:28.957,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we try to figure out what a baby coral needs

146
0:07:31.494,000 --> 0:07:32,000
in that critical early stage,

147
0:07:33.042,000 --> 0:07:34,000
what it's looking for

148
0:07:34.233,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and how we can try to help it through that process.

149
0:07:36.797,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done

150
0:07:39.662,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to try to answer those questions.

151
0:07:42.575,000 --> 0:07:46,000
A few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys --

152
0:07:47.374,000 --> 0:07:48,000
different colors and different textures,

153
0:07:49.334,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle.

154
0:07:52.228,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And we found that corals, even without the biology involved,

155
0:07:55.237,000 --> 0:07:58,000
still prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef.

156
0:07:58.42,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes,

157
0:08:01.579,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where they will be safe from being trampled

158
0:08:03.627,000 --> 0:08:04,000
or eaten by a predator.

159
0:08:05.276,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So we can use this knowledge,

160
0:08:06.756,000 --> 0:08:09,000
we can go back and say we need to restore those factors --

161
0:08:09.799,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces --

162
0:08:13.002,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in our conservation projects.

163
0:08:14.769,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We can also use that knowledge

164
0:08:16.254,000 --> 0:08:19,000
if we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier.

165
0:08:19.817,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures

166
0:08:22.881,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that might bias the system back toward those corals.

167
0:08:27.487,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Now in addition to the surfaces,

168
0:08:29.488,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we also study the chemical and microbial signals

169
0:08:32.009,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that attract corals to reefs.

170
0:08:34.061,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Starting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria

171
0:08:36.985,000 --> 0:08:38,000
from surfaces where corals had settled.

172
0:08:39.101,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And I tried those one by one by one,

173
0:08:41.958,000 --> 0:08:45,000
looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach.

174
0:08:46.748,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer

175
0:08:49.922,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that will reliably cause corals

176
0:08:51.455,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to go through that settlement and attachment process.

177
0:08:54.448,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So as we speak,

178
0:08:55.671,000 --> 0:08:57,000
my colleagues in Curaçao are testing those bacteria

179
0:08:58.115,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab,

180
0:09:01.463,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and to see if those coral settlers will survive better

181
0:09:04.074,000 --> 0:09:05,000
when we put them back underwater.

182
0:09:06.304,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now in addition to these tools, we also try to uncover the mysteries

183
0:09:09.553,000 --> 0:09:11,000
of species that are under-studied.

184
0:09:12.839,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This is one of my favorite corals, and always has been:

185
0:09:16.152,000 --> 0:09:18,000
dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.

186
0:09:19.073,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I love it because it makes this ridiculous shape,

187
0:09:22.004,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy

188
0:09:25.171,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and because it's rare.

189
0:09:26.635,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Finding one of these on a reef is a treat.

190
0:09:29.695,000 --> 0:09:3,000
In fact, it's so rare,

191
0:09:30.871,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that last year it was listed as a threatened species

192
0:09:33.411,000 --> 0:09:34,000
on the endangered species list.

193
0:09:35.29,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And this was in part because in over 30 years of research surveys,

194
0:09:38.621,000 --> 0:09:41,000
scientists had never found a baby pillar coral.

195
0:09:42.803,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We weren't even sure if they could still reproduce,

196
0:09:45.241,000 --> 0:09:46,000
or if they were still reproducing.

197
0:09:47.76,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So four years ago, we started following these at night

198
0:09:50.453,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Curaçao.

199
0:09:55.992,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida,

200
0:09:58.704,000 --> 0:10:02,000
who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,

201
0:10:02.786,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and eventually we figured out when they spawn in Curaçao

202
0:10:05.483,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and we caught it.

203
0:10:06.866,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Here's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue,

204
0:10:09.588,000 --> 0:10:1,000
about to release them into the seawater.

205
0:10:11.532,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And here's a male on the right, releasing sperm.

206
0:10:14.783,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We collected this, we got it back to the lab, we got it to fertilize

207
0:10:18.491,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab.

208
0:10:22.52,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles,

209
0:10:25.084,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and thanks to the 10 years of practice we've had in Curaçao

210
0:10:27.965,000 --> 0:10:29,000
at raising other coral species,

211
0:10:30.182,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process

212
0:10:34.081,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and settle and attach,

213
0:10:35.757,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and turn into metamorphosed corals.

214
0:10:38.492,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw.

215
0:10:43.786,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

216
0:10:49.23,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And I have to say -- if you think baby pandas are cute,

217
0:10:52.428,000 --> 0:10:53,000
this is cuter.

218
0:10:53.69,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:56.236,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process,

220
0:10:59.384,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them.

221
0:11:03.089,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And this is true all around the world;

222
0:11:04.961,000 --> 0:11:06,000
scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos,

223
0:11:07.877,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to get them to settle,

224
0:11:09.059,000 --> 0:11:13,000
maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures,

225
0:11:13.617,000 --> 0:11:16,000
so that we can preserve their genetic diversity

226
0:11:16.757,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and work with them more often.

227
0:11:18.984,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But this is still so low-tech.

228
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We are limited by the space on our bench, the number of hands in the lab

229
0:11:27.299,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour.

230
0:11:32.105,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Now, compare that to our other crises

231
0:11:34.622,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and our other areas of concern as a society.

232
0:11:38.265,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We have advanced medical technology, we have defense technology,

233
0:11:41.941,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we have scientific technology,

234
0:11:43.562,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we even have advanced technology for art.

235
0:11:46.012,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But our technology for conservation is behind.

236
0:11:53.022,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Think back to the most difficult job you ever did.

237
0:11:56.662,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Many of you would say it was being a parent.

238
0:12:00.314,000 --> 0:12:01,000
My mother described being a parent

239
0:12:01.995,000 --> 0:12:05,000
as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult

240
0:12:06.23,000 --> 0:12:08,000
than you could've ever possibly imagined.

241
0:12:08.784,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I've been trying to help corals become parents for over 10 years now.

242
0:12:13.563,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And watching the wonder of life

243
0:12:15.757,000 --> 0:12:19,000
has certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul.

244
0:12:19.808,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents.

245
0:12:24.45,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago,

246
0:12:26.654,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab.

247
0:12:29.567,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And here you see one embryo dividing,

248
0:12:31.649,000 --> 0:12:33,000
alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize

249
0:12:34.547,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and will blow up.

250
0:12:36.532,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They'll be infected with bacteria, they will explode

251
0:12:39.291,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo

252
0:12:43.057,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that has a chance.

253
0:12:45.576,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong

254
0:12:48.563,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and we don't know

255
0:12:50.214,000 --> 0:12:54,000
if it was just this coral on this reef, always suffering from low fertility.

256
0:12:55.582,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Whatever the cause,

257
0:12:56.911,000 --> 0:13:,000
we have much more work to do before we can use baby corals

258
0:13:01.452,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to grow or fix or, yes, maybe save coral reefs.

259
0:13:07.45,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So never mind that they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

260
0:13:10.545,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Coral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi.

261
0:13:15.996,000 --> 0:13:18,000
They're providing us with art and food and medicine.

262
0:13:20.012,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And we almost took out an entire generation of corals.

263
0:13:23.975,000 --> 0:13:27,000
But a few made it anyway, despite our best efforts,

264
0:13:28.04,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and now it's time for us to thank them for the work they did

265
0:13:31.196,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future,

266
0:13:36.045,000 --> 0:13:37,000
their coral babies.

267
0:13:37.557,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Thank you so much.

268
0:13:38.776,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

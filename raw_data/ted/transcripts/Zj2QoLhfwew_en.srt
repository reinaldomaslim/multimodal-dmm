1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect --

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years --

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero],

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.

8
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.

9
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.

10
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it,

11
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world

12
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way,

13
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and that's one of the main parts of my work.

14
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now,

15
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we've been engaged in a field called active music.

16
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
What are all the possible ways that we can think of

17
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience,

18
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
not just listening, but making music?

19
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers --

20
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince,

21
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors

22
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.

23
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling,

24
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra,

25
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
or into something that nobody has ever heard before.

26
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make

27
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
wonderful instruments like that for everybody,

28
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?

29
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So, we've made a whole series of instruments.

30
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.

31
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments,

32
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.

33
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music,

34
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound,

35
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.

36
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in,

37
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to try these instruments and then collaborate with us

38
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.

39
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna,

40
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
where we built a museum around it.

41
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And that led to something which you probably do know.

42
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Guitar Hero came out of our lab,

43
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab

44
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are proof that if you make the right kind of interface,

45
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music,

46
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and playing it over and over and over again.

47
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg,

48
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want

49
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to make music in something like Guitar Hero.

50
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.

51
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's very, very important.

52
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.

53
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It can change the way you communicate with others,

54
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying

55
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.

56
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project

57
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive,

58
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music,

59
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works,

60
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments,

61
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers,

62
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm,

63
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends,

64
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing --

65
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color

66
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it,

67
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button,

68
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.

69
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids

70
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.

71
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities

72
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in a much broader context, for all kinds of people

73
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.

74
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on

75
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.

76
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called

77
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.

78
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself,

79
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and he details his whole career of looking at and observing

80
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.

81
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing

82
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.

83
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones,

84
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror,

85
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music

86
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that

87
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.

88
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes,

89
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
movement to people with Parkinson's disease.

90
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.

91
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles

92
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.

93
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.

94
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.

95
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago

96
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.

97
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital,

98
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.

99
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most

100
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.

101
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.

102
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.

103
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms,

104
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.

105
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it,

106
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to experiment with it, to make their own music.

107
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.

108
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Everybody can experience music in a profound way,

109
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we just have to make different tools.

110
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically,

111
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have

112
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although

113
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.

114
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you,

115
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words,

116
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
more personal things, perhaps deeper things.

117
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples

118
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have,

119
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from ourselves to the outside world.

120
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called

121
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera,

122
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.

123
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.

124
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment,

125
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
actually into a series of books.

126
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.

127
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera

128
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.

129
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others,

130
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to the people we love, and what we can't.

131
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument,

132
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier,

133
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but it's actually a robotic music instrument.

134
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings,

135
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
each string is controlled with a little robotic element --

136
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings,

137
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.

138
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers,

139
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.

140
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now

141
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music.

142
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope,

143
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
not to bump into each other. They go off on their own.

144
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.

145
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.

146
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books.

147
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound,

148
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls,

149
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared,

150
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but the whole physical environment becomes this person.

151
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This is how he's chosen to represent himself.

152
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.

153
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.

154
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This is a sneak preview.

155
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it,

156
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacy

157
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.

158
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces,

159
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives

160
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.

161
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're

162
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
thinking of as personal opera.

163
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?

164
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma

165
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable

166
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.

167
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted

168
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work,

169
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?

170
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.

171
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage,

172
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.

173
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from

174
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan,

175
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today

176
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.

177
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that,

178
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.

179
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?

180
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.

181
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct

182
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
my own music with this new software.

183
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan. (Applause)

184
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago,

185
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic,

186
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out

187
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.

188
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
He's very shy, too.

189
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been

190
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.

191
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area --

192
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.

193
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music

194
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.

195
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan

196
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
be able easily to make his own pieces,

197
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.

198
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?

199
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion

200
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive

201
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face,

202
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform

203
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.

204
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance,

205
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that,

206
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to be able to perform his piece of music.

207
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So, the process and the technology --

208
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know,

209
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.

210
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to

211
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
with his speaking controller.

212
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know,

213
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking;

214
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.

215
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part,

216
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital

217
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?

218
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
What's useful to him as an expressive motion?

219
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
You know, what's his metaphor for performance?

220
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
What types of things does he find

221
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
important to control and convey in a piece of music?

222
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology

223
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
was stretched at that point to fit just Dan.

224
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies --

225
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.

226
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers

227
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?

228
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship

229
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know,

230
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process

231
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.

232
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And so that's what we'll do today.

233
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone

234
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
about what you're going to play now?

235
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
DE: This is "My Eagle Song."

236
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".

237
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece,

238
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.

239
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.

240
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.

241
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Laughter)

242
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
TM: He's really modest, too.

243
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.

244
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
He can place those exactly where he wants.

245
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window,

246
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore,

247
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
you can see it also, you can see where the sections are,

248
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end

249
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
up with a big bang at the end.

250
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says,

251
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.

252
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements,

253
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.

254
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.

255
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.

256
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly

257
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic

258
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.

259
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what

260
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement,

261
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise,

262
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.

263
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is

264
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.

265
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So, are we ready Adam?

266
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
AB: Yeah.

267
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.

268
0:20:01.33,000 --> 0:20:25,000
(Applause)

269
0:20:25.33,000 --> 0:20:27,000
TM: Bravo.

270
0:20:27.33,000 --> 0:20:36,000
(Applause)

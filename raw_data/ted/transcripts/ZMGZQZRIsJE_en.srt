0:02:50.719,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Thank you.

5
0:02:53.834,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Hi, everybody.

6
0:02:56.525,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.

7
0:02:58.644,000 --> 0:03:,000
I'd like to share with you a little bit of me

8
0:03:01.478,000 --> 0:03:03,000
playing my life.

9
0:03:03.59,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I might look successful and happy

10
0:03:06.279,000 --> 0:03:08,000
being in front of you today,

11
0:03:08.377,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but I once suffered from severe depression

12
0:03:11.463,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and was in total despair.

13
0:03:13.828,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The violin, which meant everything to me,

14
0:03:16.933,000 --> 0:03:18,000
became a grave burden on me.

15
0:03:19.51,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me,

16
0:03:23.236,000 --> 0:03:26,000
their words sounded like meaningless noise.

17
0:03:27.161,000 --> 0:03:3,000
When I was just about to give everything up

18
0:03:30.523,000 --> 0:03:32,000
after years of suffering,

19
0:03:32.886,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I started to rediscover the true power of music.

20
0:03:38.427,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Music)

21
0:04:59.924,000 --> 0:05:01,000
In the midst of hardship,

22
0:05:02.776,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.

23
0:05:08.266,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The comfort the music gave me

24
0:05:10.035,000 --> 0:05:11,000
was just indescribable,

25
0:05:11.745,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too,

26
0:05:15.909,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and it totally changed my perspective on life

27
0:05:19.213,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and set me free from the pressure

28
0:05:21.869,000 --> 0:05:25,000
of becoming a successful violinist.

29
0:05:26.807,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Do you feel like you are all alone?

30
0:05:29.946,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart,

31
0:05:33.505,000 --> 0:05:35,000
as it did for me.

32
0:05:36.016,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Music)

33
0:06:52.051,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Applause)

34
0:07:00.758,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Thank you.

35
0:07:02.503,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts

36
0:07:06.44,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and have found there are no boundaries.

37
0:07:09.119,000 --> 0:07:12,000
My audience is anyone who is here to listen,

38
0:07:12.678,000 --> 0:07:16,000
even those who are not familiar with classical music.

39
0:07:16.926,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls

40
0:07:21.775,000 --> 0:07:22,000
like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center,

41
0:07:23.71,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but also hospitals, churches, prisons,

42
0:07:27.501,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and restricted facilities for leprosy patients,

43
0:07:31.721,000 --> 0:07:32,000
just to mention a few.

44
0:07:33.687,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you

45
0:07:38.297,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that classical music can be so much fun, exciting,

46
0:07:41.978,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and that it can rock you.

47
0:07:44.782,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Let me introduce you to my brand new project,

48
0:07:48.21,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"Baroque in Rock,"

49
0:07:49.715,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which became a golden disc most recently.

50
0:07:53.407,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's such an honor for me.

51
0:07:55.904,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician,

52
0:08:00.145,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.

53
0:08:04.778,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But it's now your turn.

54
0:08:08.345,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Changing your perspectives

55
0:08:09.816,000 --> 0:08:12,000
will not only transform you but also the whole world.

56
0:08:13.764,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Just play your life with all you have,

57
0:08:16.247,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and share it with the world.

58
0:08:18.581,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I really look forward to witnessing

59
0:08:20.406,000 --> 0:08:23,000
a transforming world by you, TEDsters.

60
0:08:24.351,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Play your life, and stay tuned.

61
0:08:29.41,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Music)

62
0:12:19.179,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.56,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Today, there are 1.8 billion young people

2
0:00:18.28,000 --> 0:00:21,000
between the ages of 10 and 24 in the world.

3
0:00:22.92,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It is the largest cohort in human history.

4
0:00:26.68,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Meeting their needs will be a big challenge.

5
0:00:29.64,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But it's also a big opportunity.

6
0:00:32.8,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They hold our shared future in their hands.

7
0:00:37.36,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Every day, we read about young people lending their ideas and passions

8
0:00:43.2,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to fighting for change,

9
0:00:45.24,000 --> 0:00:5,000
social change, political change, change in their communities.

10
0:00:50.52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Imagine what they'll create: breakthroughs, inventions.

11
0:00:55.48,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Maybe new medicines, new modes of transportation,

12
0:00:59.72,000 --> 0:01:01,000
new ways to communicate,

13
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:06,000
sustainable economies and maybe even a world at peace.

14
0:01:07.32,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But this opportunity, this youth dividend,

15
0:01:10.24,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is not a given.

16
0:01:13.2,000 --> 0:01:16,000
One point eight billion young women and young men

17
0:01:17.12,000 --> 0:01:19,000
are standing at the door of adulthood.

18
0:01:20.52,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Are they ready?

19
0:01:22.28,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Right now, too few of them are.

20
0:01:25.52,000 --> 0:01:27,000
My favorite part of my job at UNICEF

21
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is a chance to talk to, meet with and hear from young people

22
0:01:32.72,000 --> 0:01:33,000
all around the world.

23
0:01:34.68,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And they tell me about their hopes and dreams.

24
0:01:37.6,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And they have amazing hopes and dreams

25
0:01:40.68,000 --> 0:01:42,000
for what they'll accomplish in their lives.

26
0:01:43.96,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But what they're also telling me is that they have fears.

27
0:01:48.4,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They feel that they're facing a series of urgent crises.

28
0:01:53.36,000 --> 0:01:55,000
A crisis of demographics,

29
0:01:55.96,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a crisis of education,

30
0:01:58.36,000 --> 0:02:,000
a crisis of employment,

31
0:02:00.64,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a crisis of violence

32
0:02:02.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and a crisis for girls.

33
0:02:07.24,000 --> 0:02:11,000
If you look at these crises, you realize that they're urgent

34
0:02:11.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and they need to be addressed now.

35
0:02:14.08,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Because they tell us that they're worried.

36
0:02:17.56,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They're worried that they might not get the education that they need.

37
0:02:22.28,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And you know what?

38
0:02:23.52,000 --> 0:02:24,000
They're right.

39
0:02:25.12,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Two hundred million adolescents are out of school worldwide,

40
0:02:28.96,000 --> 0:02:3,000
about the population of Brazil.

41
0:02:31.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And those that are in school

42
0:02:33.64,000 --> 0:02:36,000
feel that they may not be getting the right skills.

43
0:02:37.08,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Globally, six in 10 children and young people

44
0:02:41.4,000 --> 0:02:46,000
do not meet the minimum proficiency level for reading and mathematics.

45
0:02:47.36,000 --> 0:02:49,000
No country can be successful

46
0:02:49.88,000 --> 0:02:52,000
if nearly half of its population of young people

47
0:02:53.32,000 --> 0:02:55,000
are unable to read or write.

48
0:02:56.68,000 --> 0:03:,000
And what about the lucky few who are in secondary school?

49
0:03:00.88,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Many of them are dropping out because they're worried

50
0:03:04.08,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that they're not getting skills that they can use to make a livelihood.

51
0:03:08.28,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And sometimes, their parents can no longer afford the fees.

52
0:03:12.24,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It's a tragedy.

53
0:03:14.48,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And young people are also telling me that they're worried about employment,

54
0:03:19.36,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that they won't be able to find a job.

55
0:03:22.12,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And again, they're right.

56
0:03:24.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Every month, 10 million young people reach working age.

57
0:03:29.76,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's a staggering number.

58
0:03:31.92,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Some will go on for further education, but many will enter the workforce.

59
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And our world is not creating 10 million new jobs each month.

60
0:03:42.4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The competition is fierce for the jobs that are available.

61
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, imagine being a young person today,

62
0:03:49.92,000 --> 0:03:52,000
needing a job, seeking a livelihood,

63
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
ready to build a future,

64
0:03:55.24,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and opportunities are hard to find.

65
0:04:00.12,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Young people are also telling me

66
0:04:02.12,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that they're worried that they're not getting the skills that they need.

67
0:04:05.88,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And again, they're right.

68
0:04:09.84,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We are finding ourselves at a time in the world

69
0:04:14.24,000 --> 0:04:16,000
when the world is changing so fast for work.

70
0:04:17.24,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We're in the fourth industrial revolution.

71
0:04:20.64,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Young people do not want to be on the farms and in rural communities.

72
0:04:24.84,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They want to go to the cities.

73
0:04:26.88,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They want to learn future skills for future work.

74
0:04:30.88,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They want to learn digital technology and green technologies.

75
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They want to have a chance to learn modern agriculture.

76
0:04:38.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They want to learn business and entrepreneurship,

77
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:44,000
so that they can create a business of their own.

78
0:04:44.64,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They want to be nurses and radiologists and pharmacists and doctors.

79
0:04:50.2,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And they want to have all of the skills that they'll need for the future.

80
0:04:54.96,000 --> 0:04:59,000
They also want to learn the trades, like construction and electricians.

81
0:05:00.48,000 --> 0:05:02,000
These are all the professions that a country needs,

82
0:05:03.48,000 --> 0:05:06,000
as well as the professions that have not been invented yet.

83
0:05:08.08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And young people are also telling me that they're worried about violence.

84
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:17,000
At home, online, in school, in their communities.

85
0:05:18.68,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And again, they're right.

86
0:05:21.56,000 --> 0:05:25,000
A young person can have hundreds of friends on social media,

87
0:05:25.88,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but when they need to find a friendly face,

88
0:05:28.88,000 --> 0:05:31,000
someone who can be there as their friend, to talk to,

89
0:05:31.96,000 --> 0:05:33,000
they do not find one.

90
0:05:34.2,000 --> 0:05:38,000
They face bullying, harassment and more.

91
0:05:38.24,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And hundreds of millions are facing exploitation

92
0:05:42.28,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and abuse, and violence.

93
0:05:45.36,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Every seven minutes, an adolescent boy or girl

94
0:05:49.4,000 --> 0:05:52,000
somewhere in the world is killed by an act of violence.

95
0:05:55.4,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And girls are telling me

96
0:05:56.8,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that they're especially worried about their futures.

97
0:06:00.12,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And sadly, they're right, too.

98
0:06:02.8,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Girls face prejudice and discrimination.

99
0:06:05.88,000 --> 0:06:07,000
They face early childhood marriage

100
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and they face life-threatening early pregnancy.

101
0:06:12.76,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Imagine a population of the United States.

102
0:06:15.6,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now double it.

103
0:06:17.08,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That's the number of women who were married before their 18th birthday.

104
0:06:21.88,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Six hundred and fifty million.

105
0:06:24.64,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And many were mothers while they were still children themselves.

106
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:34,000
One out of every three women will face physical abuse

107
0:06:34.56,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or sexual abuse in her lifetime.

108
0:06:37.92,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So, no wonder girls are worried about their futures.

109
0:06:42.4,000 --> 0:06:47,000
These urgent crises may not be a reality in your life or in your neighborhood.

110
0:06:47.96,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And perhaps you've had opportunities for a good education

111
0:06:50.92,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and for marketable skills, and for getting a job.

112
0:06:54.56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And maybe you've never faced violence, or prejudice, or discrimination.

113
0:06:59.68,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But there are tens of millions of young people who are not so lucky.

114
0:07:04.04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And they are sounding the alarm for their futures.

115
0:07:08.52,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And that is why UNICEF and our many public and private partners

116
0:07:12.6,000 --> 0:07:14,000
are launching a new global initiative.

117
0:07:15.6,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Young people themselves have named it.

118
0:07:18.64,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And it's called Generation Unlimited

119
0:07:21.6,000 --> 0:07:24,000
or Gen-U or Gen you.

120
0:07:26.72,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So, what they're saying is, it's our time, it's our turn,

121
0:07:31.48,000 --> 0:07:32,000
it's our future.

122
0:07:33.76,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Our goal is very straightforward.

123
0:07:36.72,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We want every young person in school, learning, training,

124
0:07:41.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
or age-appropriate employment by the year 2030.

125
0:07:46.88,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This goal is urgent, it's necessary, it's ambitious.

126
0:07:51.28,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But we think it's also achievable.

127
0:07:54.48,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So we're calling out for cutting-edge solutions

128
0:07:57.24,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and new ideas.

129
0:07:59.12,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Ideas that will give young people a fighting chance for their futures.

130
0:08:04.08,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We don't know all the answers,

131
0:08:05.84,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so we're reaching out to businesses and governments, and nonprofits,

132
0:08:10.24,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and academia, and communities, and innovators for help.

133
0:08:14.88,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Gen-U is to be an open platform,

134
0:08:17.72,000 --> 0:08:22,000
where people can come and share their ideas and solutions

135
0:08:22.8,000 --> 0:08:25,000
about what works, what does not work,

136
0:08:25.96,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and importantly, what might work.

137
0:08:30.04,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So if we can take these ideas and add a little bit of seed money,

138
0:08:35.08,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and add some good partners,

139
0:08:37.08,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and add good political will,

140
0:08:39.36,000 --> 0:08:43,000
we think they can scale up to reach thousands and millions of people

141
0:08:43.6,000 --> 0:08:44,000
around the world.

142
0:08:45.72,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And with this project, we're also going to do something new.

143
0:08:49.24,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We're going to co-design and co-create with young people.

144
0:08:52.88,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So with Gen-U, they're going to be in the driver's seat,

145
0:08:55.799,000 --> 0:08:57,000
steering us all along the way.

146
0:08:59.28,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In Argentina, there's a program where we connect students

147
0:09:03.44,000 --> 0:09:08,000
who are in rural, remote, hard to reach mountainous communities,

148
0:09:08.52,000 --> 0:09:1,000
with something they've seldom seen:

149
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
a secondary school teacher.

150
0:09:13.68,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So these students come to a classroom, they're joined by a community teacher

151
0:09:19.32,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and they're connected to urban schools online.

152
0:09:23.56,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And there is the secondary school teacher,

153
0:09:26.4,000 --> 0:09:29,000
who is teaching them about digital technology

154
0:09:29.8,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and a good secondary school education,

155
0:09:32.68,000 --> 0:09:35,000
without them ever having to leave their own communities.

156
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And in South Africa, there's a program called Techno Girls.

157
0:09:41.2,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And these are girls from disadvantaged neighborhoods

158
0:09:43.92,000 --> 0:09:46,000
who are studying the STEM program area:

159
0:09:47.24,000 --> 0:09:5,000
science, technology, engineering and math.

160
0:09:50.4,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And they have a chance to job shadow.

161
0:09:53.4,000 --> 0:09:55,000
This is the way that they then can see themselves

162
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in jobs that are in engineering,

163
0:09:58.04,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in science, and maybe in the space program.

164
0:10:02.32,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In Bangladesh,

165
0:10:03.68,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we have partners who are training tens of thousands of young people

166
0:10:07.72,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in the trades,

167
0:10:09.04,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so that they can become motorcycle repair people,

168
0:10:12.28,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or mobile phone service people.

169
0:10:14.76,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But these are a chance to see their own livelihoods.

170
0:10:18.12,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And maybe even to have a business of their own.

171
0:10:22.4,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And in Vietnam,

172
0:10:24.04,000 --> 0:10:27,000
there's a program where we are pairing young entrepreneurs

173
0:10:27.88,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with the needs in their own local communities.

174
0:10:30.92,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So with this program, a group gathered

175
0:10:33.88,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and they decided that they would solve the problem of transportation

176
0:10:37.8,000 --> 0:10:4,000
for people with disabilities in their communities.

177
0:10:41.12,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So with a mentor and a bit of seed funding,

178
0:10:43.44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
they've now developed a new app to help the whole community.

179
0:10:48.28,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And I've seen how these programs can make a difference.

180
0:10:52.44,000 --> 0:10:56,000
When I was in Lebanon, I visited a program called Girls Got IT,

181
0:10:56.96,000 --> 0:10:57,000
or Girls Got It.

182
0:10:59.52,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And in this program, girls who have been studying

183
0:11:02.6,000 --> 0:11:04,000
computer skills and the STEM program

184
0:11:05.44,000 --> 0:11:09,000
have a chance to work side by side with young professionals,

185
0:11:09.72,000 --> 0:11:11,000
so that they can learn firsthand

186
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:16,000
what it's like to be an architect, a designer or a scientist.

187
0:11:17.28,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And when you see these girls, smiles on their faces,

188
0:11:20.52,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the hot lights in their eyes,

189
0:11:23.24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
they are so excited, they have hope for the future.

190
0:11:26.84,000 --> 0:11:28,000
They want to change the world.

191
0:11:29.08,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And now, with this program and these mentors,

192
0:11:32.4,000 --> 0:11:33,000
they'll be able to do it.

193
0:11:35.4,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But these ideas and programs are just a start.

194
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
They'll only reach a fraction of the young people that we need to reach.

195
0:11:43.64,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We want to take these ideas and find ways to scale them up.

196
0:11:47.8,000 --> 0:11:49,000
To reach more young people in more communities,

197
0:11:50.28,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in more places around the world.

198
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And we want to dream big.

199
0:11:56.08,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Could every school, everywhere in the world,

200
0:11:59.8,000 --> 0:12:01,000
no matter how remote or mountainous,

201
0:12:02.64,000 --> 0:12:03,000
or even if it's in a refugee camp,

202
0:12:04.64,000 --> 0:12:07,000
could they be connected to the internet?

203
0:12:08.12,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Could we have instant translation for young people,

204
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
so that you could get a good education

205
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in your own language, anywhere in the world?

206
0:12:17.64,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And would it be possible

207
0:12:19.12,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that we could connect the education in your school

208
0:12:23.04,000 --> 0:12:27,000
with skills that you're going to need to get a job in your own community?

209
0:12:27.52,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So that you actually can move from school to work.

210
0:12:32.36,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And more.

211
0:12:33.64,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Can each one of us help?

212
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
In our everyday lives and in our workplaces,

213
0:12:39.36,000 --> 0:12:41,000
are there ways that we could support young people?

214
0:12:42.56,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Young people are asking us for apprenticeships,

215
0:12:45.64,000 --> 0:12:48,000
for job shadowing, for internships.

216
0:12:48.72,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Could we do this?

217
0:12:50.84,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Young people are also asking us for work-study programs,

218
0:12:54.84,000 --> 0:12:56,000
places where they can learn and earn.

219
0:12:57.84,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Could we do this and could we reach out to a community that's nearby,

220
0:13:02.48,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that's less advantaged, and help them?

221
0:13:06.44,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Young people are also saying that they want to help other young people.

222
0:13:09.88,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They want more space and more voice,

223
0:13:12.88,000 --> 0:13:15,000
so that they can gather to help each other.

224
0:13:15.92,000 --> 0:13:19,000
In HIV centers, in refugee camps,

225
0:13:20.04,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but also to stop online bullying and early child marriage.

226
0:13:25.32,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We need ideas, we need ideas that are big and small,

227
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
ideas that are local and global.

228
0:13:33.24,000 --> 0:13:36,000
This, in the end, is our responsibility.

229
0:13:36.84,000 --> 0:13:41,000
A massive generation of young people are about to inherit our world.

230
0:13:42.76,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It is our duty to leave a legacy of hope and opportunity

231
0:13:47.88,000 --> 0:13:5,000
for them but also with them.

232
0:13:51.32,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Young people are 25 percent of our population.

233
0:13:54.72,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But they are 100 percent of our future.

234
0:13:58.68,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And they're calling out for a fighting chance

235
0:14:01.8,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to build a better world.

236
0:14:04.4,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So their call should be our calling.

237
0:14:07.64,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The calling of our time.

238
0:14:10.52,000 --> 0:14:13,000
The time is now, the need is urgent.

239
0:14:13.88,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And 1.8 billion young people are waiting.

240
0:14:19.44,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Thank you.

241
0:14:20.68,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

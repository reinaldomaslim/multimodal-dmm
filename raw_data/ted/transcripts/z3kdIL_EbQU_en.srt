1
0:00:13.504,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When you walk around the place where you live,

2
0:00:15.921,000 --> 0:00:16,000
most of the times,

3
0:00:17.374,000 --> 0:00:19,000
you feel pretty safe and comfortable, right?

4
0:00:20.839,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now imagine if there were land mines

5
0:00:23.936,000 --> 0:00:25,000
buried right here,

6
0:00:26.133,000 --> 0:00:27,000
scattered around,

7
0:00:27.785,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and you'd never know when you might step on one.

8
0:00:32.1,000 --> 0:00:34,000
That's how it is for many in my home country, Colombia.

9
0:00:35.393,000 --> 0:00:38,000
As a result of a 50-year internal armed conflict,

10
0:00:39.147,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we have an undetermined number of land mines

11
0:00:41.608,000 --> 0:00:42,000
buried throughout the countryside,

12
0:00:43.529,000 --> 0:00:46,000
affecting more than one third of the Colombian population.

13
0:00:48.186,000 --> 0:00:51,000
These anti-personnel mines

14
0:00:51.454,000 --> 0:00:54,000
are designed to maim, not to kill their targets.

15
0:00:55.769,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The logic behind this, which is awful,

16
0:00:59.194,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is that more resources are taken up caring for an injured soldier

17
0:01:03.794,000 --> 0:01:05,000
than dealing with a person who has been killed.

18
0:01:07.348,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I met Adriana Rodriguez about five years ago

19
0:01:11.815,000 --> 0:01:13,000
while I was working for the Colombian government

20
0:01:14.106,000 --> 0:01:15,000
as a documentary filmmaker.

21
0:01:16.374,000 --> 0:01:17,000
During the conflict,

22
0:01:18.054,000 --> 0:01:19,000
she was forced to leave her house ...

23
0:01:21.268,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with her kids in her arms.

24
0:01:24.118,000 --> 0:01:27,000
One day, one of her neighbors was killed

25
0:01:27.484,000 --> 0:01:29,000
while he stepped on a land mine.

26
0:01:32.406,000 --> 0:01:36,000
He was actually inside an abandoned house, not outside,

27
0:01:36.582,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a house exactly like the one Adriana was forced to leave.

28
0:01:40.442,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Ever since, she has been living with the fear that she, or her children,

29
0:01:44.885,000 --> 0:01:45,000
might step on a land mine.

30
0:01:47.855,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You know, the Colombian conflict has been running for so long

31
0:01:51.092,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that neither me nor my mom have seen our country in peace,

32
0:01:56.481,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and for someone like me,

33
0:01:57.973,000 --> 0:02:,000
who has been living detached from all this suffering,

34
0:02:01.458,000 --> 0:02:02,000
there was only two options:

35
0:02:04.778,000 --> 0:02:06,000
either I get used to it,

36
0:02:06.835,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or I can try to change it with all my heart.

37
0:02:11.989,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I have to admit that for almost 30 years,

38
0:02:14.672,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I was getting used to it, you know?

39
0:02:18.694,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But something changed for me when I met my wife.

40
0:02:22.614,000 --> 0:02:23,000
She is a political scientist

41
0:02:24.473,000 --> 0:02:27,000
completely passionate about the Colombian armed conflict.

42
0:02:28.083,000 --> 0:02:29,000
She helped me to understand

43
0:02:30.068,000 --> 0:02:34,000
how deeply our country has been affected by land mines and by war.

44
0:02:35.166,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We decided to come here to the United States

45
0:02:37.783,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in search of new skills

46
0:02:39.855,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that would enable us to contribute in a fair way to our society,

47
0:02:44.109,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and maybe even help heal it.

48
0:02:47.364,000 --> 0:02:48,000
While in grad school,

49
0:02:48.559,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I started developing

50
0:02:49.793,000 --> 0:02:52,000
an augmented reality, really broad application

51
0:02:52.857,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to help military personnel to deactivate land mines more safely.

52
0:02:57.583,000 --> 0:02:59,000
During that time, I also realized

53
0:03:00.235,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that Colombia is not the only country in the world

54
0:03:02.886,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that has to worry about land mines.

55
0:03:06.724,000 --> 0:03:08,000
In fact, more than 58 countries

56
0:03:09.593,000 --> 0:03:12,000
are still contaminated with any sort of explosive device.

57
0:03:14.101,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Only in 2015, due to an escalation of war

58
0:03:17.697,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in countries like Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen,

59
0:03:21.752,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the number of [land mine casualties] almost doubled,

60
0:03:24.372,000 --> 0:03:29,000
from 3,695 to 6,461 people.

61
0:03:31.051,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Imagine that.

62
0:03:32.259,000 --> 0:03:34,000
While some countries are trying to get rid of land mines,

63
0:03:35.219,000 --> 0:03:37,000
some others are increasing their use.

64
0:03:38.648,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But what happens when a conflict that involved land mines

65
0:03:42.768,000 --> 0:03:43,000
comes to an end?

66
0:03:44.782,000 --> 0:03:46,000
There are two consequences.

67
0:03:46.989,000 --> 0:03:47,000
On the one hand,

68
0:03:48.672,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the internally displaced population will start returning to their lands,

69
0:03:53.384,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and on the other hand,

70
0:03:55.256,000 --> 0:03:58,000
hidden land mines are going to start exploding more often

71
0:03:58.915,000 --> 0:03:59,000
on the civilian side.

72
0:04:01.033,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That's the reason why I decided to join

73
0:04:03.827,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the Computer Science Department at NYU,

74
0:04:06.438,000 --> 0:04:08,000
along with Professor Claudio Silva

75
0:04:09.151,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to start to develop an app called MineSafe.

76
0:04:12.831,000 --> 0:04:16,000
MineSafe uses information from the community

77
0:04:18.38,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to suggest paths that have been declared as the most transited

78
0:04:22.895,000 --> 0:04:25,000
without accident or incident caused by a land mine.

79
0:04:27.035,000 --> 0:04:3,000
These traffic patterns can also be used to determine

80
0:04:30.686,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the top priority zones to be de-mined.

81
0:04:35.666,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Almost 15 million people are living now in the countryside of Colombia.

82
0:04:41.085,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Imagine, for a moment, if we can crowdsource information from all of them

83
0:04:45.611,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to help people like Adriana and her children

84
0:04:48.705,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to find safe and reliable paths.

85
0:04:51.222,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This information can not only be used for that.

86
0:04:54.032,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This information can also help them to become more productive.

87
0:04:58.379,000 --> 0:05:,000
Farmers will be able to find

88
0:05:00.533,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which lands have been cleared from explosive devices,

89
0:05:04.57,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and in that way, they will be able to find new, fertile grounds

90
0:05:09.857,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to start growing food again.

91
0:05:13.212,000 --> 0:05:16,000
MineSafe has now a partnership with the Colombian government

92
0:05:16.579,000 --> 0:05:17,000
for the initial pilot,

93
0:05:18.396,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and we have now some connections with Cambodia and Somalia as well.

94
0:05:23.485,000 --> 0:05:25,000
This project is being funded by private money

95
0:05:25.913,000 --> 0:05:26,000
here in the United States,

96
0:05:27.859,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but we don't want to stop here.

97
0:05:29.708,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We want to go big,

98
0:05:31.256,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and we want to scale the project to every single place

99
0:05:34.603,000 --> 0:05:35,000
where land mines are still a threat.

100
0:05:38.709,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The Colombian armed conflict is finally coming to an end,

101
0:05:43.255,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but the consequences of years of war are still buried under our feet.

102
0:05:48.887,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We at MineSafe are working to help both people and land

103
0:05:54.191,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to find peace.

104
0:05:55.848,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Thank you.

105
0:05:57.023,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Applause)

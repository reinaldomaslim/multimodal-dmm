1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In 1987, Tina Lord found herself in quite the pickle.

2
0:00:16.56,000 --> 0:00:19,000
See, this gold digger made sure she married sweet Cord Roberts

3
0:00:19.88,000 --> 0:00:21,000
just before he inherited millions.

4
0:00:22.56,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But when Cord found out Tina loved his money

5
0:00:24.8,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as much as she loved him,

6
0:00:26.44,000 --> 0:00:27,000
he dumped her.

7
0:00:27.72,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Cord's mother Maria was thrilled

8
0:00:29.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
until they hooked up again.

9
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina

10
0:00:33.84,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and then made sure Cord didn't find out Tina was pregnant with his baby.

11
0:00:37.6,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So Tina, still married but thinking Cord didn't love her

12
0:00:40.52,000 --> 0:00:42,000
flew to Argentina with Max.

13
0:00:42.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Cord finally figured out what was going on

14
0:00:44.84,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and rushed after them, but he was too late.

15
0:00:47.84,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Tina had already been kidnapped,

16
0:00:49.44,000 --> 0:00:51,000
strapped to a raft and sent over a waterfall.

17
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:54,000
She and her baby were presumed dead.

18
0:00:55.32,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Cord was sad for a bit,

19
0:00:58.36,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but then he bounced right back

20
0:00:59.84,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with a supersmart archaeologist named Kate,

21
0:01:03.24,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and they had a gorgeous wedding

22
0:01:04.76,000 --> 0:01:08,000
until Tina, seemingly back from the dead, ran into the church holding a baby.

23
0:01:09.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"Stop!" she screamed.

24
0:01:11.2,000 --> 0:01:12,000
"Am I too late?

25
0:01:12.72,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Cord, I've come so far.

26
0:01:15.6,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This is your son."

27
0:01:19.4,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

28
0:01:20.92,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is how the soap opera "One Life to Live" introduced a love story

29
0:01:24.12,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that lasted 25 years.

30
0:01:26.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:27.56,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, if you've ever seen a soap opera,

32
0:01:29.68,000 --> 0:01:33,000
you know the stories and the characters can be exaggerated, larger than life,

33
0:01:34.6,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and if you're a fan, you find that exaggeration fun,

34
0:01:37.88,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and if you're not,

35
0:01:39.6,000 --> 0:01:41,000
maybe you find them melodramatic or unsophisticated.

36
0:01:42.32,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Maybe you think watching soap operas

37
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is a waste of time,

38
0:01:45.84,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that their bigness means their lessons are small or nonexistent.

39
0:01:50.56,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But I believe the opposite to be true.

40
0:01:53.44,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Soap operas reflect life, just bigger.

41
0:01:57.92,000 --> 0:02:,000
So there are real life lessons we can learn from soap operas,

42
0:02:01.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and those lessons are as big and adventurous

43
0:02:04.2,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as any soap opera storyline.

44
0:02:07.32,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, I've been a fan since I ran home from the bus stop in second grade

45
0:02:10.92,000 --> 0:02:12,000
desperate to catch the end of Luke and Laura's wedding,

46
0:02:13.64,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the biggest moment in "General Hospital" history.

47
0:02:17.04,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:18.32,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So you can imagine how much I loved my eight years

49
0:02:21.68,000 --> 0:02:23,000
as the assistant casting director on "As the World Turns."

50
0:02:24.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
My job was watching soap operas,

51
0:02:26.72,000 --> 0:02:27,000
reading soap opera scripts

52
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and auditioning actors to be on soap operas.

53
0:02:30.96,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So I know my stuff.

54
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:34.56,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And yes, soap operas

56
0:02:36.88,000 --> 0:02:38,000
are larger than life,

57
0:02:39.2,000 --> 0:02:4,000
drama on a grand scale,

58
0:02:40.92,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but our lives can be filled with as much intensity,

59
0:02:44.68,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and the stakes can feel just as dramatic.

60
0:02:47.84,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We cycle through tragedy and joy

61
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
just like these characters.

62
0:02:52.12,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We cross thresholds, fight demons and find salvation unexpectedly,

63
0:02:56.6,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and we do it again and again and again,

64
0:02:59.6,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but just like soaps, we can flip the script,

65
0:03:02.36,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which means we can learn from these characters

66
0:03:04.64,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that move like bumblebees,

67
0:03:06.48,000 --> 0:03:08,000
looping and swerving through life.

68
0:03:09.08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And we can use those lessons

69
0:03:11.36,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to craft our own life stories.

70
0:03:13.88,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Soap operas teach us to push away doubt

71
0:03:17.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and believe in our capacity

72
0:03:19.8,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for bravery, vulnerability,

73
0:03:22.44,000 --> 0:03:24,000
adaptability and resilience.

74
0:03:25.28,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And most importantly, they show us

75
0:03:27.6,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it's never too late to change your story.

76
0:03:31.12,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So with that, let's start with soap opera lesson one:

77
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:35,000
surrender is not an option.

78
0:03:36.12,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:38.12,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"All My Children"'s Erica Kane was daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara,

80
0:03:42.72,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a hyperbolically self-important princess

81
0:03:45.2,000 --> 0:03:48,000
who deep down was scrappy and daring.

82
0:03:48.8,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now, in her 41 years on TV, perhaps Erica's most famous scene

83
0:03:52.44,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is her alone in the woods

84
0:03:54.44,000 --> 0:03:56,000
suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.

85
0:03:57.2,000 --> 0:03:59,000
She screamed at the bear,

86
0:03:59.48,000 --> 0:04:,000
"You may not do this!

87
0:04:00.92,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Do you understand me?

88
0:04:02.6,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You may not come near me!

89
0:04:04.52,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I am Erica Kane

90
0:04:06.44,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and you are a filthy beast!"

91
0:04:09.08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:10.92,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And of course the bear left,

93
0:04:12.6,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so what that teaches us

94
0:04:14.44,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is obstacles are to be expected

95
0:04:16.52,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and we can choose to surrender or we can stand and fight.

96
0:04:21.24,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Pandora's Tim Westergren knows this better than most.

97
0:04:24.08,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You might even call him the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.

98
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Tim and his cofounders launched the company

99
0:04:30.079,000 --> 0:04:31,000
with two million dollars in funding.

100
0:04:31.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They were out of cash the next year.

101
0:04:34.84,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, lots of companies fold at that point, but Tim chose to fight.

102
0:04:38.6,000 --> 0:04:42,000
He maxed out 11 credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt

103
0:04:42.8,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and it still wasn't enough.

104
0:04:44.68,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So every two weeks for two years on payday he stood in front of his employees

105
0:04:49.56,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and he asked them to sacrifice their salaries,

106
0:04:53.12,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and it worked.

107
0:04:54.52,000 --> 0:04:56,000
More than 50 people deferred two million dollars,

108
0:04:57.36,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and now, more than a decade later,

109
0:04:59.24,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Pandora is worth billions.

110
0:05:02.36,000 --> 0:05:04,000
When you believe that there is a way

111
0:05:04.84,000 --> 0:05:06,000
around or through whatever is in front of you,

112
0:05:07.24,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that surrender is not an option,

113
0:05:09.8,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you can overcome enormous obstacles.

114
0:05:13.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Which brings us to soap opera lesson two:

115
0:05:15.96,000 --> 0:05:19,000
sacrifice your ego and drop the superiority complex.

116
0:05:20.72,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, this is scary.

117
0:05:22.32,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's an acknowledgment of need or fallibility.

118
0:05:25.52,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Maybe it's even an admission

119
0:05:26.92,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that we're not as special as we might like to think.

120
0:05:31.12,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Stephanie Forrester of "The Bold and the Beautiful"

121
0:05:33.56,000 --> 0:05:34,000
thought she was pretty darn special.

122
0:05:35.32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
She thought she was so special,

123
0:05:36.84,000 --> 0:05:38,000
she didn't need to mix with the riffraff from the valley,

124
0:05:39.56,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and she made sure valley girl Brooke knew it.

125
0:05:42.44,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But after nearly 25 years of epic fighting,

126
0:05:45.88,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Stephanie got sick and let Brooke in.

127
0:05:49.48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They made amends,

128
0:05:50.72,000 --> 0:05:52,000
archenemies became soul mates

129
0:05:52.76,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and Stephanie died in Brooke's arms,

130
0:05:55.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and here's our takeaway.

131
0:05:57.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Drop your ego.

132
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:,000
Life is not about you.

133
0:06:00.92,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's about us,

134
0:06:02.56,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and our ability to experience joy

135
0:06:05.4,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and love and to improve our reality

136
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:1,000
comes only when we make ourselves vulnerable

137
0:06:10.96,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and we accept responsibility for our actions

138
0:06:14.12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and our inactions,

139
0:06:15.52,000 --> 0:06:17,000
kind of like Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks.

140
0:06:18.92,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, after a great run as CEO,

141
0:06:20.96,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Howard stepped down in 2000,

142
0:06:23.28,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and Starbucks quickly overextended itself

143
0:06:25.52,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and stock prices fell.

144
0:06:27.52,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Howard rejoined the team in 2008,

145
0:06:29.48,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and one of the first things he did

146
0:06:31.52,000 --> 0:06:35,000
was apologize to all 180,000 employees.

147
0:06:36.92,000 --> 0:06:37,000
He apologized.

148
0:06:38.8,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And then he asked for help, honesty, and ideas in return.

149
0:06:42.8,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And now, Starbucks has more than doubled

150
0:06:45.4,000 --> 0:06:47,000
its net revenue since Howard came back.

151
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time.

152
0:06:52.12,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's not helping anyone, least of all you.

153
0:06:55.24,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Sacrifice your ego.

154
0:06:59.24,000 --> 0:07:,000
Soap opera lesson three:

155
0:07:00.72,000 --> 0:07:02,000
evolution is real.

156
0:07:04.24,000 --> 0:07:06,000
You're not meant to be static characters.

157
0:07:06.96,000 --> 0:07:09,000
On television, static equals boring and boring equals fired.

158
0:07:10.92,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Characters are supposed to grow and change.

159
0:07:14.56,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, on TV, those dynamic changes

160
0:07:17.04,000 --> 0:07:19,000
can make for some rough transitions,

161
0:07:19.32,000 --> 0:07:22,000
particularly when a character is played by one person yesterday

162
0:07:22.72,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and played by someone new today.

163
0:07:25.84,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Recasting happens all the time on soaps.

164
0:07:29.56,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Over the last 20 years,

165
0:07:31.4,000 --> 0:07:33,000
four different actors have played the same key role

166
0:07:34.28,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of Carly Benson on "General Hospital."

167
0:07:37.72,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Each new face triggered a change in the character's life and personality.

168
0:07:42.88,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now, there was always an essential nugget of Carly in there,

169
0:07:46.96,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but the character and the story adapted to whomever was playing her.

170
0:07:51.64,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And here's what that means for us.

171
0:07:54.4,000 --> 0:07:56,000
While we may not swap faces in our own lives,

172
0:07:57.04,000 --> 0:07:58,000
we can evolve too.

173
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We can choose to draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot,

174
0:08:04.32,000 --> 0:08:06,000
or we can open ourselves to opportunities

175
0:08:06.88,000 --> 0:08:09,000
like Carly, who went from nursing student to hotel owner,

176
0:08:11.52,000 --> 0:08:12,000
or like Julia Child.

177
0:08:13.72,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Julia was a World War II spy,

178
0:08:16.4,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and when the war ended, she got married, moved to France,

179
0:08:19.76,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and decided to give culinary school a shot.

180
0:08:23.08,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Julia, her books and her TV shows revolutionized the way America cooks.

181
0:08:29.64,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We all have the power to initiate change in our lives,

182
0:08:32.96,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to evolve and adapt.

183
0:08:35.56,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We make the choice,

184
0:08:37.4,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but sometimes life chooses for us, and we don't get a heads up.

185
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Surprise slams us in the face.

186
0:08:43.2,000 --> 0:08:45,000
You're flat on the ground, the air is gone,

187
0:08:45.36,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and you need resuscitation.

188
0:08:47.96,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So thank goodness for soap opera lesson four:

189
0:08:51.159,000 --> 0:08:53,000
resurrection is possible.

190
0:08:53.44,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:54.88,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Applause)

192
0:08:58.96,000 --> 0:09:02,000
In 1983, "Days of Our Lives"' Stefano DiMera died of a stroke,

193
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but not really, because in 1984

194
0:09:05.72,000 --> 0:09:07,000
he died when his car plunged into the harbor,

195
0:09:08.48,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and yet he was back in 1985 with a brain tumor.

196
0:09:12.04,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

197
0:09:13.08,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But before the tumor could kill him,

198
0:09:15.72,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Marlena shot him, and he tumbled off a catwalk to his death.

199
0:09:20.44,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And so it went for 30 years.

200
0:09:22.76,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

201
0:09:25.28,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Even when we saw the body,

202
0:09:27.44,000 --> 0:09:28,000
we knew better.

203
0:09:28.68,000 --> 0:09:3,000
He's called the Phoenix for a reason.

204
0:09:32.72,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And here's what that means for us.

205
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
As long as the show is still on the air,

206
0:09:37.48,000 --> 0:09:39,000
or you're still breathing,

207
0:09:39.6,000 --> 0:09:4,000
nothing is permanent.

208
0:09:41.28,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Resurrection is possible.

209
0:09:45.56,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Now, of course, just like life,

210
0:09:48.28,000 --> 0:09:51,000
soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale.

211
0:09:52.32,000 --> 0:09:56,000
CBS canceled my show, "As The World Turns," in December 2009,

212
0:09:57.28,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and we shot our final episode

213
0:09:58.88,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in June 2010.

214
0:10:00.64,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It was six months of dying

215
0:10:02.36,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and I rode that train right into the mountain.

216
0:10:06.24,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And even though we were in the middle of a huge recession

217
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and millions of people were struggling to find work,

218
0:10:12.84,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I somehow thought everything would be OK.

219
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So I packed up the kids and the Brooklyn apartment,

220
0:10:17.88,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and we moved in with my in-laws

221
0:10:20.24,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in Alabama.

222
0:10:21.48,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:24.92,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Three months later, nothing was OK.

224
0:10:27.68,000 --> 0:10:32,000
That was when I watched the final episode air,

225
0:10:32.92,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and I realized the show was not the only fatality.

226
0:10:37.04,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I was one too.

227
0:10:39.12,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I was unemployed and living on the second floor

228
0:10:41.72,000 --> 0:10:42,000
of my in-laws' home,

229
0:10:43.32,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and that's enough to make anyone feel dead inside.

230
0:10:46.12,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

231
0:10:48.04,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But I knew my story wasn't over,

232
0:10:50.2,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that it couldn't be over.

233
0:10:52.44,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I just had to tap into everything I had ever learned about soap operas.

234
0:10:58.36,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I had to be brave like Erica and refuse to surrender,

235
0:11:01.92,000 --> 0:11:04,000
so every day, I made a decision to fight.

236
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie

237
0:11:08.6,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and sacrifice my ego.

238
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I had to ask for help a lot of times across many states.

239
0:11:14.76,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I had to be adaptable like Carly

240
0:11:18.24,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and evolve my skills, my mindset, and my circumstances,

241
0:11:21.8,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and then I had to be resilient, like Stefano,

242
0:11:24.8,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and resurrect myself and my career

243
0:11:27.48,000 --> 0:11:29,000
like a phoenix from the ashes.

244
0:11:30.76,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Eventually I got an interview.

245
0:11:33.64,000 --> 0:11:35,000
After 15 years in news and entertainment,

246
0:11:36.6,000 --> 0:11:37,000
nine months of unemployment

247
0:11:38.56,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and this one interview,

248
0:11:41.84,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I had an offer for an entry level job.

249
0:11:45.04,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I was 37 years old

250
0:11:46.92,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and I was back from the dead.

251
0:11:50.24,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We will all experience what looks like an ending,

252
0:11:53.36,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and we can choose to make it a beginning.

253
0:11:56.12,000 --> 0:12:,000
Kind of like Tina, who miraculously survived that waterfall,

254
0:12:00.24,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and because I hate to leave a cliffhanger hanging,

255
0:12:02.96,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Tina and Cord did get divorced,

256
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but they got remarried three times before the show went off the air in 2012.

257
0:12:11.08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So remember,

258
0:12:12.84,000 --> 0:12:14,000
as long as there is breath in your body,

259
0:12:16.32,000 --> 0:12:18,000
it's never too late to change your story.

260
0:12:19.48,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you.

261
0:12:20.72,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Applause)

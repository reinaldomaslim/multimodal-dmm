friends who are inside the homes instead

7

name that could be used for both men and

23
0:01:35.289,000 --> 0:01:42,000
women so he saw a chance to change her

24

it is impossible she gets very upset but

48
0:03:18.55,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a miracle happened a long distant

49
0:03:22.2,000 --> 0:03:29,000
relative offers to teach her ninth and

50
0:03:25.57,000 --> 0:03:32,000
tenth curricula during summer vacations

51
0:03:29.22,000 --> 0:03:36,000
this is how she completed her

52
0:03:32.74,000 --> 0:03:4,000
matriculation the girl whom I am talking

53
0:03:36.94,000 --> 0:03:43,000
about to you is me Shamim who is talking

54
0:03:41.38,000 --> 0:03:43,000
before you now

55
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Jurong centuries people have been

56
0:03:51.24,000 --> 0:03:55,000
fighting for their identity

57
0:03:53.4,000 --> 0:03:58,000
people have been loved privileged

58
0:03:56.07,000 --> 0:04:01,000
because of their identity their

59
0:03:58.44,000 --> 0:04:05,000
rationality their ethnicity again people

60
0:04:01.8,000 --> 0:04:07,000
have been hated denied because of their

61
0:04:05.55,000 --> 0:04:12,000
nationality their identity their race

62
0:04:08.7,000 --> 0:04:15,000
their gender their religion identity

63
0:04:12.96,000 --> 0:04:18,000
determines your position in the society

64
0:04:15.81,000 --> 0:04:2,000
wherever you live so if you ask me I

65
0:04:19.41,000 --> 0:04:25,000
would say I had this question of

66
0:04:21.75,000 --> 0:04:27,000
identity millions of girls in this third

67
0:04:25.62,000 --> 0:04:31,000
are being denied their basic rights

68
0:04:28.65,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because of being female I would have

69
0:04:32.61,000 --> 0:04:4,000
faced same if I hadn't been raised as a

70
0:04:36.42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
boy I am determined to continue my study

71
0:04:41.25,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to learn to be free after the schooling

72
0:04:45.84,000 --> 0:04:52,000
even enrolling in college was not easy

73
0:04:48.96,000 --> 0:04:58,000
for me I went on three-day hunger strike

74
0:04:53.66,000 --> 0:04:58,000
then I got the permission for college

75
0:05:00.75,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in that way

76
0:05:02.59,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I completed my college two years later

77
0:05:06.73,000 --> 0:05:13,000
when time comes for me to go University

78
0:05:10.72,000 --> 0:05:16,000
my father turned his eyes his attention

79
0:05:14.65,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to my younger brothers they need to be

80
0:05:17.68,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in school

81
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:25,000
get secured the jobs and support the

82
0:05:22.09,000 --> 0:05:29,000
family and as a women my place first had

83
0:05:25.24,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to be home but I don't give up I sign up

84
0:05:30.07,000 --> 0:05:36,000

85

hours to interview for a position it is

90
0:05:51.55,000 --> 0:05:56,000

91
0:05:54.61,000 --> 0:06:,000
have ever been I am processed to my

92

0:06:15.85,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of teasing him with talk of a daughter

97
0:06:18.55,000 --> 0:06:24,000
crossing the border when i returned to

98
0:06:22.45,000 --> 0:06:3,000
home i want nothing to more than just

99
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
accept the position in her deep so that

100
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:37,000
night I picked my all things in a bag

101
0:06:34.24,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and I walked into my father's room I'd

102
0:06:37.72,000 --> 0:06:44,000
said him tomorrow morning bus is going

103
0:06:41.95,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to come in if you believe in me if you

104
0:06:44.95,000 --> 0:06:5,000
believe in me you would take me you

105
0:06:48.7,000 --> 0:06:51,000
would wake me up and take me off at the

106
0:06:51.4,000 --> 0:06:55,000
bus station

107
0:06:52.18,000 --> 0:06:59,000
if you don't I'll understand then I go

108
0:06:55.81,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to sleep next morning my father was

109
0:06:59.86,000 --> 0:07:05,000
standing beside me to take me off at the

110
0:07:03.58,000 --> 0:07:05,000
bus stop

111
0:07:08.139,000 --> 0:07:14,000
very they they I understand the

112
0:07:11.689,000 --> 0:07:18,000
importance of words I understand how

113
0:07:14.659,000 --> 0:07:21,000
words affect our hurts how worse play an

114
0:07:19.55,000 --> 0:07:24,000
important role in our lives

115
0:07:22.069,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I understand words are more powerful

116
0:07:24.77,000 --> 0:07:33,000
than fighting a TI DP I saw there was a

117
0:07:30.939,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Pakistan which I didn't know a country

118
0:07:34.189,000 --> 0:07:4,000
much more complex that I had realized

119
0:07:37.55,000 --> 0:07:44,000
till yet I thought I had a difficult

120
0:07:40.789,000 --> 0:07:48,000
life but here I saw what women in other

121
0:07:44.709,000 --> 0:07:5,000
parts of Pakistan were experiencing it

122
0:07:49.49,000 --> 0:07:54,000
really opened my eyes

123
0:07:51.43,000 --> 0:07:58,000
supermen had eleven children but nothing

124
0:07:55.219,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to feed them forgetting water they would

125
0:07:58.909,000 --> 0:08:05,000
walk three hours every day to wells

126
0:08:03.159,000 --> 0:08:09,000
nearest hospital was at least 32

127
0:08:06.649,000 --> 0:08:12,000
kilometres away so if a woman is a

128
0:08:09.619,000 --> 0:08:17,000
laborer she travels by camel to get

129
0:08:13.039,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Hospital distances great she may die on

130
0:08:18.08,000 --> 0:08:27,000
her way so now this became more than

131
0:08:22.699,000 --> 0:08:3,000
just a job for me I discovered my pavo

132
0:08:27.309,000 --> 0:08:33,000
now as I was getting salary soil I

133
0:08:30.769,000 --> 0:08:35,000
started sending back money to my home

134
0:08:33.43,000 --> 0:08:39,000
relatives and neighbors were noticing

135
0:08:36.11,000 --> 0:08:44,000
this now they started to understand the

136
0:08:39.589,000 --> 0:08:46,000
importance of education by the time some

137
0:08:44.149,000 --> 0:08:51,000
other parents itzá started sending that

138
0:08:47.089,000 --> 0:08:55,000
doctors preschool slowly it became

139
0:08:51.319,000 --> 0:08:59,000
easier as an acceptable for young women

140
0:08:55.519,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to be in college today there isn't a

141
0:08:59.42,000 --> 0:09:04,000
single girl out of car school in my

142
0:09:03.05,000 --> 0:09:05,000
village

143
0:09:07.68,000 --> 0:09:15,000
girls are doing jobs inhale site even in

144
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
police life was good but somewhere in my

145
0:09:16.569,000 --> 0:09:24,000
heart I realized that in my region

146
0:09:21.509,000 --> 0:09:28,000
beyond my village needs further chains

147
0:09:25.48,000 --> 0:09:31,000
this is also time when I joined at

148
0:09:28.899,000 --> 0:09:34,000
UMaine fellowship here I meet leaders

149
0:09:32.199,000 --> 0:09:4,000
like me across the country and I saw

150
0:09:35.889,000 --> 0:09:44,000
they had taken risks in their lives I

151
0:09:40.439,000 --> 0:09:47,000
started to understand thee that lead

152
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
what leadership really means so I

153
0:09:47.98,000 --> 0:09:54,000
decided to go back my region and take a

154
0:09:51.85,000 --> 0:09:59,000
position as a teacher in a remote school

155
0:09:55.029,000 --> 0:10:04,000
a school where I have to reach by bus to

156
0:10:00.67,000 --> 0:10:07,000
us traveling in every morning and

157
0:10:04.269,000 --> 0:10:12,000
evening though it was hard but on my

158
0:10:07.959,000 --> 0:10:15,000
first day I do I took right decision

159
0:10:12.67,000 --> 0:10:18,000
when first day I walked into school I

160
0:10:16.269,000 --> 0:10:23,000
saw all these little sham imps is

161
0:10:19.089,000 --> 0:10:26,000
staring back at me with with dreams in

162
0:10:23.98,000 --> 0:10:3,000
their eyes same dream of freedom which I

163
0:10:26.92,000 --> 0:10:33,000
had in my childhood so girls are eager

164
0:10:31.509,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to learn but school is understaffed

165
0:10:34.079,000 --> 0:10:4,000
girls sit hopeful learn nothing and they

166
0:10:39.819,000 --> 0:10:42,000
leave

167
0:10:40.36,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I can't we had to see this happening

168
0:10:43.24,000 --> 0:10:51,000
there was no turning back I found my

169
0:10:48.009,000 --> 0:10:55,000
purpose I understood few of my friends

170
0:10:51.37,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to help me to teach I am introducing my

171
0:10:55.899,000 --> 0:11:01,000
girls with outside the word by extra

172
0:10:59.5,000 --> 0:11:04,000
curriculum activities and books I share

173
0:11:02.62,000 --> 0:11:07,000
with them the profiles of world's best

174
0:11:05.41,000 --> 0:11:11,000
leaders like Martin Luther King and

175
0:11:08.559,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Nelson Mandela last year few of our

176
0:11:12.189,000 --> 0:11:19,000
restaurants went to college for me I

177
0:11:16.449,000 --> 0:11:22,000
never stopped studying

178
0:11:19.4,000 --> 0:11:3,000
are you working to complete my PhD in

179
0:11:22.85,000 --> 0:11:32,000
education which will allow me to gain a

180
0:11:31.37,000 --> 0:11:37,000
management position in a school system

181
0:11:33.71,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and I will be able to take more decision

182
0:11:37.43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and play an pivotal role in this system

183
0:11:41.45,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I believe without educating the girls we

184
0:11:46.279,000 --> 0:11:53,000
may not make this word peace we may not

185
0:11:49.91,000 --> 0:11:56,000
reduce child marriage we may not reduce

186
0:11:53.68,000 --> 0:12:,000
infant mortality rate we may not reduce

187
0:11:57.14,000 --> 0:12:03,000
maternal mortality rate for this we have

188
0:12:01.58,000 --> 0:12:07,000
a to continuously

189
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and were collectively work together at

190
0:12:08.39,000 --> 0:12:15,000
least I am playing my role though

191
0:12:11.92,000 --> 0:12:18,000
destination is not close road is not

192
0:12:15.71,000 --> 0:12:23,000
easy but I have a dreams in my eyes and

193
0:12:19.31,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I am NOT going to look back now thank

194
0:12:24.29,000 --> 0:12:34,000

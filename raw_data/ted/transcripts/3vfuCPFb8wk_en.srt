1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was walking in the market one day with my wife,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and somebody stuck a cage in my face.

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And in between those slits

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
were the saddest eyes I've ever seen.

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That evening I came back to the market in the dark

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I heard "uhh, uhh,"

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Of course, the cage was salvaged.

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I took up the little baby,

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
massaged her, forced her to drink

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
until she finally started breathing normally.

13
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is Uce.

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain,

15
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and this is Matahari, her second son,

16
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy.

17
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
That changed my life quite dramatically,

18
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers.

19
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
No. No. No. Wrong.

21
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild.

22
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's not good.

23
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing.

24
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together,

25
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
just now like victims for every baby,

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
six have disappeared from the forest.

27
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The deforestation, especially for oil palm,

28
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to provide biofuel for Western countries

29
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is what's causing these problems.

30
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat,

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the largest accumulation of organic material in the world.

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
When you open this for growing oil palms

33
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
you're creating CO2 volcanoes

34
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that are emitting so much CO2

35
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world,

36
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
after China and the United States.

37
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And we don't have any industry at all --

38
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it's only because of this deforestation.

39
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And these are horrible images.

40
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I'm not going to talk too long about it,

41
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but there are so many of the family of Uce,

42
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest,

43
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that still have to go through that process.

44
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I don't know anymore where to put them.

45
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her

46
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but also a solution

47
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests,

48
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to get their hands on the last timber

49
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and that are causing, in that way,

50
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the loss of habitat and all those victims.

51
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So I created the place Samboja Lestari,

52
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and the idea was,

53
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of

54
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
where there is really nothing left,

55
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
no one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ..."

56
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
No. Everyone should be able to follow this.

57
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started.

58
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
As you can see there's only yellow terrain.

59
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there.

60
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there.

61
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There was a huge amount of crime.

62
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water.

63
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
There was no agricultural productivity left.

64
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This was the poorest district in the whole province

65
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and it was a total extinction of wildlife.

66
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This was like a biological desert.

67
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
When I stood there in the grass, it's hot -- not even the sound of insects --

68
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
just this waving grass.

69
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Still, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people.

70
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The climate has changed. I will show you:

71
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
no more flooding, no more fires.

72
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's no longer the poorest district,

73
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and there is a huge development of biodiversity.

74
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We've got over 1,000 species. We have 137 bird species as of today.

75
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We have 30 species of reptiles.

76
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So what happened here? We created a huge economic failure in this forest.

77
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So basically the whole process of destruction

78
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm.

79
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But we saw the same thing.

80
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We had slash and burn agriculture;

81
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
people cannot afford the fertilizer,

82
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there;

83
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the fires become more frequent,

84
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and after a while you're stuck with an area of land

85
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
where there is no fertility left.

86
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
There are no trees left.

87
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Still, in this place, in this grassland

88
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
where you can see our very first office there on that hill,

89
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
four years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ...

90
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Applause)

91
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And there are all these animals, and all these people happy,

92
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and there's this economic value.

93
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So how's this possible?

94
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps:

95
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we bought the land, we dealt with the fire,

96
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and then only, we started doing the reforestation

97
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
by combining agriculture with forestry.

98
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary.

99
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But we made sure that in every step of the way

100
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the local people were going to be fully involved

101
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.

102
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The people would become the defenders of that forest.

103
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So we do the "people, profit, planet" principles,

104
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but we do it in addition

105
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to a sure legal status --

106
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because if the forest belongs to the state,

107
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
people say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone."

108
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And then we apply all these other principles

109
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
like transparency, professional management, measurable results,

110
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
scalability, [unclear], etc.

111
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
What we did was we formulated recipes --

112
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing

113
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to a target situation.

114
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control,

115
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.

116
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.

117
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now in this recipe you also have the cost.

118
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You also know how much labor is needed.

119
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
If you can drop this recipe on the map

120
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
on a sandy soil, on a clay soil,

121
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
on a steep slope, on flat soil,

122
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you put those different recipes; if you combine them,

123
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
out of that comes a business plan,

124
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
comes a work plan, and you can optimize it

125
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have,

126
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and you can do it.

127
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.

128
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.

129
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The acacia trees are of a very low value

130
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil

131
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and to shake out the grasses.

132
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber --

133
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that is, if you can preserve it in the right way,

134
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which we can do with bamboo peels.

135
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's an old temple-building technique from Japan

136
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but bamboo is very fire-susceptible.

137
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So if we would plant that in the beginning

138
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.

139
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So we plant it later, along the waterways

140
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to filter the water, provide the raw products

141
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
just in time for when the timber becomes available.

142
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So the idea is: how to integrate these flows

143
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in space, over time and with the limited means you have.

144
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples

145
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees,

146
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops,

147
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
for the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land,

148
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food

149
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration

150
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
while even saving some money.

151
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So beautiful. What a theory.

152
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But is it really that easy?

153
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Not really, because if you looked at what happened in 1998,

154
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the fire started.

155
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This is an area of about 50 million hectares.

156
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
January.

157
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
February.

158
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
March.

159
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
April.

160
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
May.

161
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months.

162
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires

163
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States.

164
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season -- you get cracks,

165
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
oxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again.

166
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So how to break that cycle?

167
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Fire is the biggest problem.

168
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is what it looked like for three months.

169
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
For three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off

170
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because it was that dark.

171
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year;

172
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
they lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster

173
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
for orangutans and people.

174
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So these fires are really the first things to work on.

175
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That was why I put it as a single point up there.

176
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands,

177
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm

178
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients

179
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to the first rainfall -- going to the sea

180
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
killing off the coral reefs there.

181
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So you have to do it with the local people.

182
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution.

183
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So what we did is, we created

184
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
a ring of sugar palms around the area.

185
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant --

186
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
also flood-resistant, by the way --

187
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and they provide a lot of income for local people.

188
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is what it looks like:

189
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice --

190
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and the only thing you harvest is sugar water,

191
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine.

192
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
In principle, you make those trees into

193
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
biological photovoltaic cells.

194
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And you can create so much energy from this --

195
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
they produce three times more energy per hectare per year,

196
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because you can tap them on a daily basis.

197
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
You don't need to harvest [unclear]

198
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or any other of the crops.

199
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics,

200
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which is still unexploited, and doing it in combination with technology.

201
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order.

202
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So we bought that land,

203
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and here is where we started our project --

204
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in the middle of nowhere.

205
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area

206
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is divided into strips that go over different types of soil,

207
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and we were actually monitoring,

208
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres.

209
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And this forest is quite different.

210
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
What I really did was I just followed nature,

211
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and nature doesn't know monocultures,

212
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but a natural forest is multilayered.

213
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
That means that both in the ground and above the ground

214
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
it can make better use of the available light,

215
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.

216
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people.

217
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So, just like nature,

218
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that,

219
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity

220
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that can optimally use that light. Then,

221
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
what is just as important: get the right fungi in there

222
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients

223
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.

224
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And they become like nutrient pumps.

225
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen,

226
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all.

227
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day.

228
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to

229
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.

230
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We didn't want to lose the people

231
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that are going to work in that plantation.

232
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And we do a lot of work here.

233
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types,

234
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here.

235
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.

236
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This is what it looks like in reality;

237
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
you have this irregular ring around it,

238
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
with strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms

239
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that can provide income for 648 families.

240
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's only a small part of the area.

241
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The nursery, in here, is quite different.

242
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance,

243
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
from the Urals up to England, you know how many?

244
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
165.

245
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
In this nursery, we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species.

246
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Can you imagine?

247
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
You do need to know what you are working with,

248
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but it's that diversity which makes it work.

249
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
That you can go from this zero situation,

250
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees

251
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
in the lines in that grass there,

252
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost,

253
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest

254
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
there are crops that can be used.

255
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
In the beginning, maybe pineapples and beans and corn;

256
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in the second phase, there will be bananas and papayas;

257
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
later on, there will be chocolate and chilies.

258
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And then slowly, the trees start taking over,

259
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
bringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood.

260
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And finally, the sugar palm forest takes over

261
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and provides the people with permanent income.

262
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
On the top left, underneath those green stripes,

263
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants

264
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that you can see from space.

265
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And in that area we started growing some acacia trees

266
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that you just saw before.

267
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So this is after one year.

268
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And this is after two years.

269
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And that's green. If you look from the tower --

270
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
this is when we start attacking the grass.

271
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We plant in the seedlings

272
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people,

273
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but the trees are growing up fast in between as well.

274
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And three years later, 137 species of birds are living here.

275
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Applause)

276
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius.

277
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Air humidity is up 10 percent.

278
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Cloud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up.

279
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Rainfall is up.

280
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And all these species and income.

281
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This ecolodge that I built here,

282
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
three years before, was an empty, yellow field.

283
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency --

284
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself

285
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
is taking a picture.

286
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon, how the forest is developing,

287
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.

288
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We can use these data now

289
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology.

290
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We actually have it already with Google Earth.

291
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks,

292
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and use Google Earth in combination with that,

293
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced,

294
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
which company is stealing the timber,

295
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and you could save so much more carbon

296
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
than with any measure of saving energy here.

297
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So this is the Samboja Lestari area.

298
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
You measure how the trees grow back,

299
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.

300
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced,

301
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
how many medicines can be kept here.

302
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And finally I made it into the rain machine

303
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
because this forest is now creating its own rain.

304
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water;

305
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
it's 80 percent surrounded by seawater,

306
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and we have now a lot of intrusion there.

307
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Now we looked at the clouds above this forest;

308
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
we looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area.

309
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And look at these images.

310
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I'll just run them very quickly through.

311
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
In the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals,

312
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
which is the case in the temperate zones,

313
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
you need the trees with [unclear], chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees

314
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that initiate the raindrops.

315
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate,

316
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and you have the trees to initiate the rain.

317
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
And look, there's now 11.2 percent more clouds --

318
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
already, after three years.

319
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time.

320
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Let's look at the next year,

321
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and you can see that that trend is continuing.

322
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall,

323
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that cap is now widening and getting higher.

324
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And if we look at the rainfall pattern

325
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
above Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place,

326
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there.

327
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So you can actually change the climate.

328
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears,

329
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
but afterwards, as soon as the wind stabilizes,

330
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area.

331
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do,

332
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
because we actually can make that difference

333
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
if you integrate the various technologies.

334
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And it's nice to have the science, but it still depends mostly upon the people,

335
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
on your education.

336
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
We have our farmer schools.

337
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
But the real success of course, is our band --

338
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
because if a baby is born, we will play, so everyone's our family

339
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and you don't make trouble with your family.

340
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
This is how it looks.

341
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
We have this road going around the area,

342
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
which brings the people electricity and water from our own area.

343
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
We have the zone with the sugar palms,

344
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and then we have this fence with very thorny palms

345
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle --

346
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and the people apart.

347
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And inside, we have this area for reforestation

348
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
as a gene bank to keep all that material alive,

349
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
because for the last 12 years

350
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up

351
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
because the climatic triggers have disappeared.

352
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
All the seeds get eaten.

353
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
So now we do the monitoring on the inside --

354
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
from towers, satellites, ultralights.

355
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.

356
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees --

357
0:17:58.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
you have the shade trees planted in year one,

358
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
then you underplanted with the sugar palms,

359
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and you plant this thorny fence.

360
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And after a few years, you can remove some of those shade trees.

361
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel,

362
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with.

363
0:18:16.33,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.

364
0:18:20.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
They have enough income for three families.

365
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
But whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people,

366
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.

367
0:18:32.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
There is no simple one recipe for one place.

368
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt --

369
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:42,000
that it's transparent.

370
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Like here, in Samboja Lestari,

371
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
we divide that ring in groups of 20 families.

372
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
If one member trespasses the agreement,

373
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and does cut down trees,

374
0:18:51.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him.

375
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:56,000
If the group doesn't take action,

376
0:18:56.33,000 --> 0:19:,000
the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group

377
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:04,000
that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them.

378
0:19:04.33,000 --> 0:19:07,000
In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative --

379
0:19:07.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
they have a democratic culture there,

380
0:19:09.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system.

381
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:17,000
In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land

382
0:19:17.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation,

383
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:26,000
the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.

384
0:19:26.33,000 --> 0:19:29,000
They also get free land in between the trees,

385
0:19:29.33,000 --> 0:19:31,000
where they can grow their crops.

386
0:19:31.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project.

387
0:19:35.33,000 --> 0:19:37,000
They get building material for houses,

388
0:19:37.33,000 --> 0:19:39,000
a contract for selling the sugar,

389
0:19:39.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally.

390
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:46,000
They get all these other benefits: environmentally, money,

391
0:19:46.33,000 --> 0:19:48,000
they get education -- it's a great deal.

392
0:19:48.33,000 --> 0:19:51,000
And everything is based upon that one thing --

393
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:54,000
make sure that forest remains there.

394
0:19:54.33,000 --> 0:19:57,000
So if we want to help the orangutans --

395
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:20:,000
what I actually set out to do --

396
0:20:00.33,000 --> 0:20:04,000
we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit.

397
0:20:04.33,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Now I think the real key to doing it, to give a simple answer,

398
0:20:08.33,000 --> 0:20:1,000
is integration.

399
0:20:10.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
I hope -- if you want to know more, you can read more.

400
0:20:14.33,000 --> 0:20:35,000

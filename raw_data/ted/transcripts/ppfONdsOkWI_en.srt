1
0:00:13.026,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I was a child,

2
0:00:14.547,000 --> 0:00:15,000
every other Friday,

3
0:00:15.73,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I would leave my mother and stepfather's home --

4
0:00:18.696,000 --> 0:00:22,000
an Indian and British, atheist, Buddhist,

5
0:00:23.369,000 --> 0:00:28,000
agnostic, vegetarian, new age-y sometimes,

6
0:00:29.047,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Democratic household.

7
0:00:31.339,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I would go 1.4 miles to my father and stepmother's home

8
0:00:35.836,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and enter a white, Evangelical Christian,

9
0:00:39.444,000 --> 0:00:41,000
conservative, Republican,

10
0:00:42.321,000 --> 0:00:44,000
twice-a-week-churchgoing,

11
0:00:44.86,000 --> 0:00:46,000
meat-eating family.

12
0:00:47.996,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It doesn't take a shrink to explain how I ended up

13
0:00:50.47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in the field of conflict resolution.

14
0:00:52.21,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:54.164,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Whether I was facilitating dialogues in Charlottesville or Istanbul

16
0:00:57.935,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or Ahmedabad,

17
0:00:59.182,000 --> 0:01:,000
the challenge was always the same:

18
0:01:02.088,000 --> 0:01:03,000
despite all odds,

19
0:01:03.811,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and with integrity,

20
0:01:05.377,000 --> 0:01:07,000
how do you get people to connect meaningfully,

21
0:01:08.302,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to take risks,

22
0:01:09.944,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to be changed by their experience?

23
0:01:13.626,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I would witness extraordinarily beautiful electricity in those rooms.

24
0:01:19.93,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And then I would leave those rooms

25
0:01:21.636,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and attend my everyday gatherings like all of you --

26
0:01:24.428,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a wedding or a conference or a back-to-school picnic --

27
0:01:27.669,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and many would fall flat.

28
0:01:30.155,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There was a meaning gap

29
0:01:32.011,000 --> 0:01:34,000
between these high-intensity conflict groups

30
0:01:34.655,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and my everyday gatherings.

31
0:01:37.412,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now, you could say, sure, somebody's birthday party

32
0:01:39.88,000 --> 0:01:41,000
isn't going to live up to a race dialogue,

33
0:01:42.239,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but that's not what I was responding to.

34
0:01:45.688,000 --> 0:01:46,000
As a facilitator,

35
0:01:47.107,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you're taught to strip everything away

36
0:01:49.204,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and focus on the interaction between people,

37
0:01:52.217,000 --> 0:01:56,000
whereas everyday hosts focus on getting the things right --

38
0:01:56.34,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the food, the flowers, the fish knives --

39
0:01:59.397,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and leave the interaction between people largely to chance.

40
0:02:03.599,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So I began to wonder how we might change our everyday gatherings

41
0:02:07.902,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to focus on making meaning by human connection,

42
0:02:12.12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
not obsessing with the canapés.

43
0:02:15.777,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And I set out and interviewed dozens of brave and unusual hosts --

44
0:02:19.678,000 --> 0:02:22,000
an Olympic hockey coach, a Cirque du Soleil choreographer,

45
0:02:22.886,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a rabbi, a camp counselor--

46
0:02:24.993,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to better understand what creates meaningful

47
0:02:27.357,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and even transformative gatherings.

48
0:02:29.513,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And I want to share with you some of what I learned today

49
0:02:32.205,000 --> 0:02:34,000
about the new rules of gathering.

50
0:02:35.812,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So when most people plan a gathering,

51
0:02:37.61,000 --> 0:02:39,000
they start with an off-the-rack format.

52
0:02:39.923,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Birthday party? Cake and candles.

53
0:02:43.112,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Board meeting?

54
0:02:44.373,000 --> 0:02:46,000
One brown table, 12 white men.

55
0:02:46.999,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:51.405,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Assuming the purpose is obvious, we skip too quickly to form.

57
0:02:55.715,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This not only leads to dull and repetitive gatherings,

58
0:02:58.395,000 --> 0:03:,000
it misses a deeper opportunity

59
0:03:00.644,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to actually address our needs.

60
0:03:03.904,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The first step of creating more meaningful everyday gatherings

61
0:03:08.405,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is to embrace a specific disputable purpose.

62
0:03:13.381,000 --> 0:03:16,000
An expectant mother I know was dreading her baby shower.

63
0:03:17.542,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The idea of "pin the diaper on the baby" games

64
0:03:20.473,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and opening gifts felt odd and irrelevant.

65
0:03:23.787,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So she paused to ask:

66
0:03:25.154,000 --> 0:03:27,000
What is the purpose of a baby shower?

67
0:03:27.819,000 --> 0:03:29,000
What is my need at this moment?

68
0:03:31.268,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And she realized it was to address her fears

69
0:03:33.628,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of her and her husband's -- remember that guy? --

70
0:03:36.812,000 --> 0:03:37,000
transition to parenthood.

71
0:03:38.817,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so she asked two friends to invent a gathering based on that.

72
0:03:42.978,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And so on a sunny afternoon, six women gathered.

73
0:03:46.062,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And first, to address her fear of labor -- she was terrified --

74
0:03:50.768,000 --> 0:03:52,000
they told her stories from her life

75
0:03:53.1,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to remind her of the characteristics she already carries --

76
0:03:56.947,000 --> 0:03:59,000
bravery, wonder, faith, surrender --

77
0:04:01.513,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that they believed would carry her and help her in labor as well.

78
0:04:04.844,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And as they spoke, they tied a bead for each quality into a necklace

79
0:04:09.528,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that she could wear around her neck in the delivery room.

80
0:04:13.216,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Next, her husband came in,

81
0:04:15.262,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and they wrote new vows, family vows, and spoke them aloud,

82
0:04:19.213,000 --> 0:04:21,000
first committing to keep their marriage central

83
0:04:21.542,000 --> 0:04:22,000
as they transitioned to parenthood,

84
0:04:23.247,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but also future vows to their future son

85
0:04:26.078,000 --> 0:04:29,000
of what they wanted to carry with them from each of their family lines

86
0:04:29.404,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and what would stop with this generation.

87
0:04:32.392,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Then more friends came along, including men, for a dinner party.

88
0:04:36.18,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And in lieu of gifts, they each brought a favorite memory from their childhood

89
0:04:40.12,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to share with the table.

90
0:04:41.798,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now, you might be thinking this is a lot for a baby shower,

91
0:04:45.613,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or it's a little weird or it's a little intimate.

92
0:04:48.325,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Good.

93
0:04:49.523,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It's specific.

94
0:04:50.787,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's disputable.

95
0:04:52.417,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's specific to them,

96
0:04:54.03,000 --> 0:04:56,000
just as your gathering should be specific to you.

97
0:04:58.353,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The next step of creating more meaningful everyday gatherings

98
0:05:02.071,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is to cause good controversy.

99
0:05:05.908,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You may have learned, as I did,

100
0:05:07.567,000 --> 0:05:1,000
never to talk about sex, politics or religion at the dinner table.

101
0:05:11.295,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's a good rule in that it preserves harmony,

102
0:05:14.226,000 --> 0:05:15,000
or that's its intention.

103
0:05:15.857,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But it strips away a core ingredient of meaning, which is heat,

104
0:05:20.353,000 --> 0:05:21,000
burning relevance.

105
0:05:22.736,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The best gatherings learn to cultivate good controversy

106
0:05:26.907,000 --> 0:05:28,000
by creating the conditions for it,

107
0:05:29.297,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because human connection is as threatened by unhealthy peace

108
0:05:33.779,000 --> 0:05:34,000
as by unhealthy conflict.

109
0:05:37.218,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I was once working with an architecture firm,

110
0:05:39.953,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and they were at a crossroads.

111
0:05:41.456,000 --> 0:05:44,000
They had to figure out whether they wanted to continue to be an architecture firm

112
0:05:45.342,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and focus on the construction of buildings

113
0:05:47.377,000 --> 0:05:49,000
or pivot and become the hot new thing, a design firm,

114
0:05:49.887,000 --> 0:05:51,000
focusing on beyond the construction of spaces.

115
0:05:52.724,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And there was real disagreement in the room,

116
0:05:54.825,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but you wouldn't know, because no one was actually speaking up publicly.

117
0:05:58.265,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And so we hosted good controversy.

118
0:06:00.134,000 --> 0:06:03,000
After a lunch break, all the architects came back,

119
0:06:03.351,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and we hosted a cage match.

120
0:06:07.479,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They walked in,

121
0:06:08.69,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we took one architect, put him in one corner to represent architecture,

122
0:06:12.119,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the other one to represent design.

123
0:06:14.008,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We threw white towels around their necks,

124
0:06:16.01,000 --> 0:06:18,000
stolen from the bathroom -- sorry --

125
0:06:18.232,000 --> 0:06:2,000
played Rocky music on an iPad,

126
0:06:20.683,000 --> 0:06:22,000
got each a Don King-like manager

127
0:06:22.876,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to rev them up and prepare them with counterarguments,

128
0:06:25.501,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and then basically made them each argue the best possible argument

129
0:06:29.036,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of each future vision.

130
0:06:31.344,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The norm of politeness was blocking their progress.

131
0:06:34.662,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And we then had everybody else physically choose a side

132
0:06:38.692,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in front of their colleagues.

133
0:06:40.356,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And because they were able to actually show where they stood,

134
0:06:43.347,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they broke an impasse.

135
0:06:45.24,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Architecture won.

136
0:06:47.479,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So that's work.

137
0:06:48.946,000 --> 0:06:53,000
What about a hypothetical tense Thanksgiving dinner?

138
0:06:54.151,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Anyone?

139
0:06:55.408,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:58.041,000 --> 0:07:,000
So first, ask the purpose.

141
0:07:00.597,000 --> 0:07:03,000
What does this family need this year?

142
0:07:04.594,000 --> 0:07:07,000
If cultivating good heat is part of it,

143
0:07:07.634,000 --> 0:07:11,000
then try for a night banning opinions and asking for stories instead.

144
0:07:13.387,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Choose a theme related to the underlying conflict.

145
0:07:16.995,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But instead of opinions,

146
0:07:18.17,000 --> 0:07:21,000
ask everybody to share a story from their life and experience

147
0:07:21.25,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that nobody around the table has ever heard,

148
0:07:23.786,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to difference or to belonging

149
0:07:26.375,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or to a time I changed my mind,

150
0:07:29.542,000 --> 0:07:31,000
giving people a way in to each other

151
0:07:31.79,000 --> 0:07:32,000
without burning the house down.

152
0:07:35.559,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And finally, to create more meaningful everyday gatherings,

153
0:07:39.948,000 --> 0:07:41,000
create a temporary alternative world

154
0:07:42.751,000 --> 0:07:44,000
through the use of pop-up rules.

155
0:07:47.021,000 --> 0:07:5,000
A few years ago, I started noticing invitations coming with a set of rules.

156
0:07:51.58,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Kind of boring or controlling, right?

157
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Wrong.

158
0:07:56.257,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In this multicultural, intersectional society,

159
0:07:59.037,000 --> 0:08:01,000
where more of us are gathered and raised

160
0:08:01.138,000 --> 0:08:03,000
by people and with etiquette unlike our own,

161
0:08:03.929,000 --> 0:08:05,000
where we don't share the etiquette,

162
0:08:06.222,000 --> 0:08:07,000
unspoken norms are trouble,

163
0:08:09.141,000 --> 0:08:12,000
whereas pop-up rules allow us to connect meaningfully.

164
0:08:12.719,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They're one-time-only constitutions for a specific purpose.

165
0:08:16.912,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So a team dinner,

166
0:08:19.457,000 --> 0:08:21,000
where different generations are gathering

167
0:08:21.706,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and don't share the same assumptions of phone etiquette:

168
0:08:25.991,000 --> 0:08:26,000
whoever looks at their phone first

169
0:08:27.985,000 --> 0:08:28,000
foots the bill.

170
0:08:29.264,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:30.7,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Try it.

172
0:08:31.93,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Applause)

173
0:08:33.422,000 --> 0:08:35,000
For an entrepreneurial advice circle of just strangers,

174
0:08:36.331,000 --> 0:08:38,000
where the hosts don't want everybody to just listen

175
0:08:38.788,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to the one venture capitalist in the room --

176
0:08:40.868,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:41.908,000 --> 0:08:42,000
knowing laugh --

178
0:08:43.375,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:44.433,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you can't reveal what you do for a living.

180
0:08:48.437,000 --> 0:08:49,000
For a mom's dinner,

181
0:08:50.208,000 --> 0:08:51,000
where you want to upend the norms

182
0:08:51.901,000 --> 0:08:55,000
of what women who also happen to be mothers talk about when they gather,

183
0:08:56.44,000 --> 0:08:59,000
if you talk about your kids, you have to take a shot.

184
0:08:59.521,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:02.624,000 --> 0:09:03,000
That's a real dinner.

186
0:09:05.258,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Rules are powerful,

187
0:09:07.327,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because they allow us to temporarily change and harmonize our behavior.

188
0:09:12.22,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And in diverse societies,

189
0:09:14.234,000 --> 0:09:16,000
pop-up rules carry special force.

190
0:09:17.028,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They allow us to gather across difference,

191
0:09:19.293,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to connect,

192
0:09:20.801,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to make meaning together

193
0:09:22.184,000 --> 0:09:23,000
without having to be the same.

194
0:09:25.104,000 --> 0:09:26,000
When I was a child,

195
0:09:27.564,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I navigated my two worlds by becoming a chameleon.

196
0:09:31.266,000 --> 0:09:33,000
If somebody sneezed in my mother's home,

197
0:09:33.501,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I would say, "Bless you,"

198
0:09:35.155,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in my father's, "God bless you."

199
0:09:38.848,000 --> 0:09:4,000
To protect myself, I hid,

200
0:09:41.24,000 --> 0:09:42,000
as so many of us do.

201
0:09:43.42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And it wasn't until I grew up and through conflict work

202
0:09:46.203,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that I began to stop hiding.

203
0:09:49.73,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I realized that gatherings for me,

204
0:09:52.598,000 --> 0:09:53,000
at their best,

205
0:09:54.209,000 --> 0:09:56,000
allow us to be among others,

206
0:09:57.41,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to be seen for who we are,

207
0:09:59.946,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and to see.

208
0:10:03.51,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The way we gather matters

209
0:10:07.21,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because how we gather

210
0:10:09.586,000 --> 0:10:1,000
is how we live.

211
0:10:11.627,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Thank you.

212
0:10:12.808,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

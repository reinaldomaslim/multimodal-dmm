1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You all know this story.

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In the summer of 1950,

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and atomic-pile builder,

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory

6
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:

7
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"Where is everybody?"

8
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
This confused his colleagues, obviously,

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because they were sitting right there with him.

10
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.

11
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
He was talking about the space aliens.

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You see, this was only a few years after

13
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the supposed flying saucer crash

14
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
at Roswell, New Mexico.

15
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And even though that turned out to be nothing,

16
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
nothing at all --

17
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter) --

18
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
merely a downed weather balloon

19
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
piloted by small hairless men

20
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
with slits for mouths ...

21
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Still, America had gone saucer-mad,

22
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
even famous scientists

23
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who were eating lunch.

24
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,

25
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is that the universe is so vast

26
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that it stands to reason,

27
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
there should be other intelligent life out there.

28
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And the universe is so old

29
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,

30
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we should have some evidence of their existence by now.

31
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.

32
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"Where is everybody?" asked Fermi,

33
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and his colleagues had no answer.

34
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic

35
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to disprove fairies,

36
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Sasquatch, God,

37
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the possibility of love --

38
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and thereafter, as you know,

39
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Enrico Fermi ate alone.

40
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now,

42
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I am not a scientist.

43
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I have never built an atomic pile.

44
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Although, I might argue that, technically,

45
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
every pile is atomic.

46
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
However, with respect, I might point out two possibilities

48
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.

49
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
One is that the aliens might be

50
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
very far away.

51
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Perhaps, I dare say,

52
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
even on other planets.

53
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The other possibility --

54
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter) --

55
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself

56
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
was an alien.

57
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Think about it.

59
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Isn't it a little convenient

60
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,

61
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
suddenly an Italian scientist showed up

62
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
with an amazing new technology

63
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that would transform everything in the world

64
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and darken the history of the human species forever after?

65
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And isn't it a little strange

66
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that he required no payment for this?

67
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
That he asked for only one thing --

68
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
a gift of two healthy sperm whales?

69
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
That's -- that's not true.

70
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But it is strange.

71
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,

73
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince

74
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
his fellow scientists

75
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that the space aliens are not already here?

76
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
For it is given in certain UFO-ology

77
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or UFOlogy circles,

78
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;

79
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that they have walked among us in disguise,

80
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
observing us, guiding our evolution

81
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
from ape to man --

82
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
if you believe in that sort of thing --

83
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers

84
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.

85
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's a difficult theory to discount,

87
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I think you'll agree.

88
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

89
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
For even in my own life,

90
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
there are memories I have

91
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that are difficult to explain --

92
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,

93
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that it is difficult to imagine

94
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
they were not the result

95
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.

96
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
For how else will you explain

97
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the amazing and absolutely true

98
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
close encounters that I had

99
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and will describe to you now?

100
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.

101
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
This was the summer when the special edition of

102
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.

103
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.

104
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,

105
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.

106
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

107
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And so I spent the rest of the vacation

108
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
largely sitting outside our little rental house at night,

109
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the sidewalk still warm from the sun,

110
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
watching the skies for UFOs.

111
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
What did I see? Stars, satellites,

112
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk.

113
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Occasionally, kids would come and

114
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
join me and watch,

115
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk

116
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to play video games and mingle with humans.

117
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,

118
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
so I stayed alone with the cosmos.

119
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And that's when it happened.

120
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
An elderly couple came walking down the street.

121
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I would say they were in their late seventies,

122
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I would say that they were on a date,

123
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because he was wearing a very neat little suit

124
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
with a yellow tie -- a brown suit.

125
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night

126
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and a chill was coming in off the ocean.

127
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I remember, for some reason,

128
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that they were exactly the same height.

129
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And then they stopped, and the man turned to me

130
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and said,

131
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"What are you looking for,

132
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
flying saucers?"

133
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

134
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective work

135
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for an old man on a date.

136
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But what was stranger still --

137
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and even I realized it at the time,

138
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
as a nine-year-old child --

139
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
was that they stopped at all.

140
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll

141
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with his sweetheart with the precise reason

142
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
of making fun of a child.

143
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"Oh," he said,

144
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"little green men."

145
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And then his girlfriend joined in, too.

146
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"There's no such thing as space men," she said.

147
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"There's no such thing."

148
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha."

149
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I looked around.

150
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The street was entirely empty.

151
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.

152
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It was as though time had stopped.

153
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I did not know why they were teasing me.

154
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I looked into their strangely angry faces,

155
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and I remember wondering,

156
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
are they wearing rubber masks?

157
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

158
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?

159
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?

160
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Slits for mouths?

161
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,

162
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and then he made laser sounds.

163
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"Kew, kew, kew --

164
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
watch out."

165
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And they turned at once and walked away.

166
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The old man reached out

167
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
his knobbly claw

168
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
for the woman's hand,

169
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and found it, and left me alone.

170
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding --

171
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
a strange encounter among humans.

172
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Maybe it was swamp gas, but --

173
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter) --

174
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I know what I saw.

175
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.

176
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I went to see the movie "Dune,"

177
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face --

178
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter) --

179
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
this is impossible on its face, I realize --

180
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but it is absolutely true.

181
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It was opening night, naturally.

182
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.

183
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
On my right was the girl in question.

184
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.

185
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,

186
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.

187
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
She was very tall, I would say.

188
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,

189
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.

190
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I didn't know her name, and I never will.

191
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,

192
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and they were talking about the novel, "Dune."

193
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They were both big fans, mother and daughter --

194
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
very unusual.

195
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They were talking about how their favorite characters

196
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
were the giant sandworms.

197
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And then it got stranger.

198
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
That's when she turned to me and said,

199
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"

200
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

201
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
First of all, I was embarrassed

202
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.

203
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I was merely a connoisseur of movies

204
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
featuring desert planets, as I still am.

205
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

206
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question:

207
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,

208
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
as though she just wanted to talk to me.

209
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I did not know what to say. I said, "Yes."

210
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I did not even turn my head.

211
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The movie began.

212
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,"

213
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in which all of the characters

214
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
were sexy and deformed at the same time.

215
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

216
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator,

217
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature

218
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist

219
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
of psychedelic spice

220
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
swirling around him,

221
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
allowing him to bend space and time.

222
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
He could never leave the tank

223
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or interact with the outside world.

224
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
He had become, in his isolation,

225
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
so deformed and so sexy,

226
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio

227
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to the outside world, and could never touch them.

228
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.

229
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?

230
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Please.

231
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
When the movie ended,

232
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
everyone seemed very happy

233
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.

234
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Except for the girl.

235
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
As I walked out, her pace slowed.

236
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Perhaps it was the crutches,

237
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but it seemed --

238
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter) --

239
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.

240
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,

241
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but I can only come to the conclusion

242
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that it was what, in the alien abductee community,

243
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
they call a "screen memory":

244
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain

245
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to cover up some trauma -- say, of being kidnapped

246
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and flown off to a sex pyramid.

247
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

248
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And so I sure am glad

249
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I did not slow down to talk to her.

250
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I sure am glad I never saw her again.

251
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Close encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

252
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
1989.

253
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
In the mid-to-late '80s,

254
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,"

255
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in which he described his own lifelong experiences

256
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
being abducted by aliens.

257
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community

258
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
as "lost time,"

259
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware

260
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that he could not remember the previous ten minutes,

261
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.

262
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens

263
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
were taking him and giving him rectal probes.

264
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

265
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.

266
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book,

267
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
and was his, sort of, police sketch

268
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of what the creatures looked like

269
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that Whitley Strieber had described to him.

270
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.

271
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And in 1989, the way I remember it,

272
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I was in Philadelphia

273
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
visiting my girlfriend, and we decided,

274
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
apropos of nothing, to go see this movie.

275
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.

276
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
One: Whitley Strieber

277
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
was played by Christopher Walken.

278
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.

279
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

280
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Three: there was a surprisingly long

281
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet

282
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.

283
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Four: this was being shown

284
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.

285
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Five: all of which is to say,

286
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
they made a movie out of the book, "Communion,"

287
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and it starred Christopher Walken.

288
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Does something seem strange about this to you?

289
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?

290
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Think about it. Yes. The answer is:

291
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
I had a girlfriend. What?

292
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

293
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
How did this happen? When did this happen?

294
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I remember walking out of the theater

295
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and becoming suddenly aware of this fact,

296
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
as we walked hand in hand,

297
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and pondering these very same questions.

298
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And to this day, I have no answer for you.

299
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Close encounter four: the Algarve,

300
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Portugal, 1991.

301
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Some years later, I and this woman --

302
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
we'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" --

303
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter) --

304
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
went traveling through the south of Portugal together.

305
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,

306
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
in tiny little hotels,

307
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde

308
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and watch the sun set and play checkers.

309
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?

310
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
We went to some topless beaches.

311
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Excuse me? No, not in my life.

312
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
For what it's worth, we went to Sagres,

313
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.

314
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,

315
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and the lead dog bit me on the ass,

316
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic

317
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and receive an ass shot.

318
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Make of that what you will.

319
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Laughter)

320
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Our last day in Portugal,

321
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
we were in the district capital of Faro,

322
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach

323
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
one last time.

324
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Now, Faro is a bustling little city,

325
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take

326
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
a bus and then a boat.

327
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And did I want to come with?

328
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No."

329
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I remember what she looked like before she left.

330
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The freckles had grown

331
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and multiplied on her face and shoulders,

332
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
clustering into a kind of a tan.

333
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
A tan, we were both tan --

334
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is this true?

335
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.

336
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
She was smiling.

337
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country,

338
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
not even speaking the language,

339
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
to travel alone by bus and boat

340
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
to go to a beach she did not know

341
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
or had never seen.

342
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I loved her, and then she went out

343
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
into that strange, alien land.

344
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It took me some time to come to my senses.

345
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I had my own "lost time" moment,

346
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
where I woke up and suddenly realized

347
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
it was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,

348
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and she had not come back.

349
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.

350
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Now, I did not speak Portuguese.

351
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I did not know where the beach was.

352
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,

353
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.

354
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Laughter)

355
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I realized that the day would only have

356
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
two possible outcomes:

357
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
either Catherine would come back to the hotel,

358
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
or she would never come back to the hotel.

359
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And so I sat down to wait.

360
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street

361
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
where the buses and cars and pedestrians

362
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and little scooters were moving along.

363
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And I watched those constellations shift,

364
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
hoping that they would part and I would see her face.

365
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It was at that moment,

366
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
in that very small town of 30,000 or so,

367
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe

368
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and the searching we might do in it.

369
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And that's when the Liberians came along.

370
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Five young men -- all laughing, happy, traveling together,

371
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
coming back to this hotel where they were staying.

372
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me

373
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
what was I doing, and I explained.

374
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.

375
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But he did not seem so very sure,

376
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
for he sat down to wait with me.

377
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:

378
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,

379
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
telling me jokes, distracting me.

380
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Two hours, they gave me a message.

381
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We are not alone.

382
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,

383
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I turned and looked down the street.

384
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The stars aligned, and she came back.

385
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.

386
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Neither did the Liberians,

387
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter

388
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room

389
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and left us alone in the street, holding hands.

390
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,

391
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
much like a piece of alien technology

392
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
that has been inserted into your buttocks

393
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
by a "Portuguese doctor."

394
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
(Laughter)

395
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And even now, a decade and a half later,

396
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
even now that we are married,

397
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.

398
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable

399
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that during the time she was away,

400
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,

401
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I love her and wait for her still.

402
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Thank you for your kind attention.

403
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Applause)

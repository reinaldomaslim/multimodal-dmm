1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
You know, culture was born of the imagination,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it --

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
came into being when our species descended

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
from our progenitor, Homo erectus,

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to every corner of the habitable world.

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
For a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal,

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who clearly had some spark of awareness,

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but -- whether it was the increase in the size of the brain,

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or the development of language,

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or some other evolutionary catalyst --

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe,

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
27,000 years ago,

15
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
our direct ancestors had already,

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and for 5,000 years,

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
been crawling into the belly of the earth,

18
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles,

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
they had brought into being

20
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the great art of the Upper Paleolithic.

21
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France

22
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called "Juniper Fuse."

23
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And you could look at this art and you could, of course,

24
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
see the complex social organization

25
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of the people who brought it into being.

26
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning,

27
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
something far more sophisticated than hunting magic.

28
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the way Clayton put it was this way.

29
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He said, "You know, clearly at some point,

30
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't."

31
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt,

32
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
through ritual, to rekindle a connection

33
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that had been irrevocably lost.

34
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So, he saw this art not as

35
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
hunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.

36
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And viewed in that light,

37
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it takes on a whole other resonance.

38
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art

39
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is that as an aesthetic expression,

40
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
it lasted for almost 20,000 years.

41
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
If these were postcards of nostalgia,

42
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
ours was a very long farewell indeed.

43
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And it was also the beginning of our discontent,

44
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because if you wanted to distill all of our experience

45
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
since the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words:

46
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
how and why.

47
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged.

48
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, all people share the same

49
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
raw, adaptive imperatives.

50
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We all have children.

51
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We all have to deal with the mystery of death,

52
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the world that waits beyond death,

53
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the elders who fall away into their elderly years.

54
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
All of this is part of our common experience,

55
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all,

56
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
biologists have finally proven it to be true,

57
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.

58
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.

59
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We are all cut from the same genetic cloth.

60
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
All of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people

61
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago.

62
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But the corollary of that is that,

63
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
if we all are brothers and sisters

64
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and share the same genetic material,

65
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
all human populations share the same raw human genius,

66
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the same intellectual acuity.

67
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
And so whether that genius is placed

68
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
into -- technological wizardry

69
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
has been the great achievement of the West --

70
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads

71
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of memory inherent in a myth,

72
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.

73
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There is no progression of affairs

74
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in human experience.

75
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid

76
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex

77
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and descends down the flanks

78
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to the so-called primitives of the world.

79
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
All peoples are simply cultural options,

80
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
different visions of life itself.

81
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But what do I mean by different visions of life

82
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
making for completely different

83
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
possibilities for existence?

84
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Well, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere

85
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
ever brought into being by the imagination,

86
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that of Polynesia.

87
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
10,000 square kilometers,

88
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea.

89
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I recently sailed on the Hokulea,

90
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
named after the sacred star of Hawaii,

91
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
throughout the South Pacific to make a film

92
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
about the navigators.

93
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
These are men and women who, even today, can name

94
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
250 stars in the night sky.

95
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls

96
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
of islands beyond the visible horizon,

97
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
simply by watching the reverberation of waves

98
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
across the hull of their vessel, knowing full well

99
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that every island group in the Pacific

100
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
has its unique refractive pattern

101
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that can be read with the same perspicacity

102
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint.

103
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
These are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel,

104
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells

105
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
moving through the canoe at any one point in time,

106
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
distinguishing local wave disturbances

107
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean,

108
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that can be followed with the same ease

109
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea.

110
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Indeed, if you took all of the genius

111
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that allowed us to put a man on the moon

112
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and applied it to an understanding of the ocean,

113
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
what you would get is Polynesia.

114
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And if we slip from the realm of the sea

115
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
into the realm of the spirit of the imagination,

116
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.

117
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I recently made a film called "The Buddhist Science of the Mind."

118
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
Why did we use that word, science?

119
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?

120
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
What is Buddhism but 2,500 years

121
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of empirical observation

122
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
as to the nature of mind?

123
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard,

124
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us

125
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
here once at TED,

126
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"Western science is a major response to minor needs."

127
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100

128
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
without losing our teeth.

129
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence.

130
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear.

131
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Their billboards are manuals,

132
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.

133
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage

134
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to a curious destination,

135
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
accompanied by a great doctor.

136
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And the destination was a single room in a nunnery,

137
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat

138
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
55 years before.

139
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche,

140
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths,

141
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the essence of the Buddhist path.

142
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.

143
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It means things happen.

144
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The cause of suffering is ignorance.

145
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
By that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity;

146
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
he meant clinging to the illusion

147
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that life is static and predictable.

148
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome.

149
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And the fourth and most important, of course,

150
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
was the delineation of a contemplative practice

151
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that not only had the possibility

152
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of a transformation of the human heart,

153
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence

154
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that such a transformation was a certainty.

155
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And so, when this door opened onto the face of a woman

156
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
who had not been out of that room in 55 years,

157
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
you did not see a mad woman.

158
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You saw a woman who was more clear

159
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
than a pool of water in a mountain stream.

160
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us.

161
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe

162
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
you went to the moon, but you did.

163
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment

164
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in one lifetime, but we do.

165
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And if we move from the realm of the spirit

166
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to the realm of the physical,

167
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to the sacred geography of Peru --

168
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people

169
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
that literally believe that the Earth is alive,

170
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
responsive to all of their aspirations,

171
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
all of their needs.

172
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And, of course, the human population

173
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
has its own reciprocal obligations.

174
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I spent 30 years living amongst

175
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the people of Chinchero

176
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in.

177
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Once each year, the fastest young boy

178
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.

179
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister

180
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and he becomes a transvestite,

181
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
a waylaka. And for that day,

182
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
he leads all able-bodied men on a run,

183
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but it's not your ordinary run.

184
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You start off at 11,500 feet.

185
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa.

186
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
You run up to 15,000 feet,

187
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
descend 3,000 feet.

188
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Climb again over the course of 24 hours.

189
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And of course, the waylakama spin,

190
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the trajectory of the route,

191
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is marked by holy mounds of Earth,

192
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
where coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind,

193
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.

194
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual,

195
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but through exhaustion, through sacrifice,

196
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
you emerge as a community that has once again

197
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet.

198
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this,

199
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
only one to finish it.

200
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day

201
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.

202
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But these localized rituals become pan-Andean,

203
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and these fantastic festivals,

204
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs

205
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky.

206
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock:

207
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
60,000 Indians on pilgrimage

208
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to the end of a dirt road

209
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara,

210
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
which is dominated by three tongues

211
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of the great glacier.

212
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community,

213
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in this wonderful fusion of Christian

214
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and pre-Columbian ideas.

215
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
You place the cross into the ice,

216
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus,

217
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
or sacred mountains of the Inca.

218
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses.

219
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now, these ideas and these events

220
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
allow us even to deconstruct iconic places

221
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu.

222
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Machu Picchu was never a lost city.

223
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
On the contrary, it was completely linked in

224
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads

225
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the Inca made in less than a century.

226
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But more importantly, it was linked in

227
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to the Andean notions of sacred geography.

228
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun,

229
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light

230
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu,

231
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
which is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu.

232
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
If you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar.

233
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.

234
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Take a direct north-south bearing,

235
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
you find to your astonishment

236
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that it bisects the intiwatana stone,

237
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
goes to the skyline,

238
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
hits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains

239
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
of the Incan empire.

240
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And then beyond Salcantay, of course,

241
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky,

242
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
directly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead.

243
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?

244
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota,

245
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way,

246
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked

247
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.

248
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And where does the river rise?

249
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Right on the slopes of the Koariti.

250
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So, 500 years after Columbus,

251
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
these ancient rhythms of landscape

252
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
are played out in ritual.

253
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Now, when I was here at the first TED,

254
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers,

255
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the descendants, survivors of El Dorado.

256
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
These, of course, are the descendants

257
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
of the ancient Tairona civilization.

258
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned

259
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,

260
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary.

261
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness

262
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
for 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen

263
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.

264
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction,

265
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
as they are taught the values of their society.

266
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers,

267
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.

268
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Now, the measure of a society is not only what it does,

269
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but the quality of its aspirations.

270
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And I always wanted to go back into these mountains,

271
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to see if this could possibly be true,

272
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist,

273
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Reichel-Dolmatoff.

274
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So, literally two weeks ago,

275
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers

276
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
on what was clearly the most

277
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
extraordinary trip of my life.

278
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
These really are a people who live and breathe

279
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the realm of the sacred,

280
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome.

281
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
They consume more coca leaves than any human population,

282
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
half a pound per man, per day.

283
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The gourd you see here is --

284
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
everything in their lives is symbolic.

285
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Their central metaphor is a loom.

286
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
They say, "Upon this loom, I weave my life."

287
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient

288
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
as "threads."

289
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
When they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands,

290
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
spinning their thoughts into the heavens.

291
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.

292
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.

293
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
You put the stick in the powder

294
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes,

295
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
they're burnt limestone --

296
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to empower the coca leaf, to change

297
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption

298
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of cocaine hydrochloride.

299
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away,

300
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
because every stroke of that stick

301
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that has built up that calcium,

302
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the measure of a man's life,

303
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
has a thought behind it.

304
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way,

305
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that the one side of the field

306
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is planted like that by the women.

307
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically,

308
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
you turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth.

309
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,

310
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the greatest goldsmiths of South America,

311
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
who in the wake of the conquest,

312
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
retreated into this isolated volcanic massif

313
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that soars to 20,000 feet

314
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
above the Caribbean coastal plain.

315
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
There are four societies:

316
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
the Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos.

317
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I traveled with the Arhuacos,

318
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and the wonderful thing about this story

319
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
was that this man, Danilo Villafane --

320
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
if we just jump back here for a second.

321
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington,

322
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I couldn't help but say, "You know,

323
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
you look a lot like an old friend of mine."

324
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Well, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto,

325
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
from 1974, who had been killed by the FARC.

326
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And I said, "Danilo, you won't remember this,

327
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but when you were an infant, I carried you on my back,

328
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
up and down the mountains."

329
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And because of that, Danilo invited us

330
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to go to the very heart of the world,

331
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
a place where no journalist had ever been permitted.

332
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Not simply to the flanks of the mountains,

333
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims.

334
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And this man sitting cross-legged

335
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
is now a grown-up Eugenio,

336
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
a man who I've known since 1974.

337
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And this is one of those initiates.

338
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
No, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years,

339
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but they are kept within the confines

340
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
of the ceremonial men's circle

341
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
for 18 years.

342
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
This little boy will never step outside

343
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
of the sacred fields

344
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that surround the men's hut for all that time,

345
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
until he begins his journey of initiation.

346
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
For that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction,

347
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
as he is taught the values of society,

348
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
including this notion that their prayers alone

349
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
maintain the cosmic balance.

350
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Before we could begin our journey,

351
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth.

352
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.

353
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet --

354
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
there must be nothing between the feet

355
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and the Earth for a mamo.

356
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And this is actually the place where the Great Mother

357
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
sent the spindle into the world

358
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that elevated the mountains and created the homeland

359
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that they call the heart of the world.

360
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We traveled high into the paramo,

361
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and as we crested the hills,

362
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
we realized that the men were interpreting

363
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
every single bump on the landscape

364
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
in terms of their own intense religiosity.

365
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And then of course, as we reached our final destination,

366
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
a place called Mamancana,

367
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
we were in for a surprise,

368
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.

369
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts,

370
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
hidden away until the darkness.

371
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And then, abandoning all our gear,

372
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night,

373
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in a quite dramatic scene.

374
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It's going to look like a John Ford Western.

375
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing.

376
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating

377
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
is that the minute there was a sense of dangers,

378
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
the mamos went into a circle of divination.

379
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And of course, this is a photograph

380
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
literally taken the night we were in hiding,

381
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
as they divine their route

382
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to take us out of the mountains.

383
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
We were able to, because we had trained

384
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
people in filmmaking,

385
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
continue with our work,

386
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers

387
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to the final sacred lakes

388
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to get the last shots for the film,

389
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea,

390
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
taking the elements from the highlands to the sea.

391
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And here you see how their sacred landscape

392
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos,

393
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and yet, still they pray.

394
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And it's an amazing thing to think

395
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
that this close to Miami,

396
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
two hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people

397
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
praying every day for your well-being.

398
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
They call themselves the Elder Brothers.

399
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world

400
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand

401
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
why it is that we do what we do to the Earth.

402
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Now, if we slip to another end of the world,

403
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I was up in the high Arctic

404
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
to tell a story about global warming,

405
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
inspired in part by

406
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
the former Vice President's wonderful book.

407
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And what struck me so extraordinary

408
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
was to be again with the Inuit --

409
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
a people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.

410
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
A people who

411
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
find a way, with their imagination,

412
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
to carve life out of that very frozen.

413
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
A people for whom blood on ice

414
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
is not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.

415
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities,

416
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
you find to your astonishment

417
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September

418
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and stay till July,

419
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland,

420
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
it literally comes in now in November

421
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and stays until March.

422
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
So, their entire year has been cut in half.

423
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Now, I want to stress that none of these peoples

424
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
that I've been quickly talking about here

425
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
are disappearing worlds.

426
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
These are not dying peoples.

427
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
On the contrary, you know,

428
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see,

429
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
you discover that the world is not flat.

430
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
The world remains a rich tapestry.

431
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It remains a rich topography of the spirit.

432
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
These myriad voices of humanity

433
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
are not failed attempts at being new,

434
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
failed attempts at being modern.

435
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
They're unique facets of the human imagination.

436
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
They're unique answers to a fundamental question:

437
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
what does it mean to be human and alive?

438
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And when asked that question, they respond

439
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
with 6,000 different voices.

440
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And collectively, those voices become our human repertoire

441
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
for dealing with the challenges that will confront us

442
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
in the ensuing millennia.

443
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Our industrial society is scarcely

444
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
300 years old.

445
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone

446
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
that we have all of the answers

447
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
for all of the questions that will confront us

448
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
in the ensuing millennia.

449
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.

450
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
They are unique answers to that fundamental question:

451
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
what does it mean to be human and alive?

452
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth,

453
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
taking with it not only plants and animals,

454
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
but the legacy of humanity's brilliance.

455
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Right now, as we sit here in this room,

456
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born,

457
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
fully half aren't being taught to children.

458
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
So, you're living through a time

459
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
when virtually half of humanity's intellectual,

460
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
social and spiritual legacy

461
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
is being allowed to slip away.

462
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
This does not have to happen.

463
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern --

464
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
quaint and colorful and destined to fade away

465
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
as if by natural law.

466
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
In every case, these are dynamic, living peoples

467
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
being driven out of existence by identifiable forces.

468
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
That's actually an optimistic observation,

469
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
because it suggests that if human beings

470
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
are the agents of cultural destruction,

471
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
we can also be, and must be,

472
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
the facilitators of cultural survival.

473
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Thank you very much.

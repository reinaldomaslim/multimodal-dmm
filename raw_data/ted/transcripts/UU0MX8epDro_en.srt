1
0:00:27.357,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Music)

2
0:04:37.922,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Music ends)

3
0:04:41.174,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Applause)

4
0:04:59.23,000 --> 0:05:,000
Thank you!

5
0:05:00.476,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Applause continues)

6
0:05:05.203,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Thank you very much.

7
0:05:07.616,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Like the speaker before me -- I am a TED virgin, I guess.

8
0:05:12.322,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'm also the first time here, and ...

9
0:05:15.278,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

10
0:05:16.423,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I don't know what to say!

11
0:05:17.708,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Applause)

12
0:05:21.165,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me.

13
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.

14
0:05:27.523,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann.

15
0:05:30.818,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It's called "Kaleidoscope."

16
0:05:32.691,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century,

17
0:05:39.378,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.

18
0:05:43.173,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.

19
0:05:45.729,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann,

20
0:05:49.796,000 --> 0:05:51,000
a German 19th-century composer.

21
0:05:53.994,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G,

22
0:05:58.169,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and that's the main theme in the melody.

23
0:06:00.136,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G)

24
0:06:04.007,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.

25
0:06:08.673,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

26
0:06:10.47,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But he wrote that for his wife.

27
0:06:12.597,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

28
0:06:16.715,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So actually, if you listen carefully,

29
0:06:18.565,000 --> 0:06:2,000
there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.

30
0:06:21.986,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's written around 1834,

31
0:06:24.614,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.

32
0:06:30.583,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Music)

33
0:13:19.987,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Music ends)

34
0:13:23.312,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Applause)

35
0:13:30.748,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Now comes the part that I hate.

36
0:13:35.591,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Well, because Mr. Anderson told me

37
0:13:38.071,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that this session is called "Sync and Flow,"

38
0:13:40.972,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?"

39
0:13:43.993,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Laughter)

40
0:13:45.184,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So, I'll talk about musical composition,

41
0:13:47.333,000 --> 0:13:48,000
even though I don't know where to start.

42
0:13:50.679,000 --> 0:13:51,000
How do I compose?

43
0:13:52.544,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.

44
0:13:56.452,000 --> 0:13:59,000
What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas

45
0:14:00.163,000 --> 0:14:02,000
you can just improvise here at the piano --

46
0:14:02.378,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody,

47
0:14:06.119,000 --> 0:14:07,000
like the Abegg that you just heard.

48
0:14:08.3,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide:

49
0:14:11.826,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want?

50
0:14:15.628,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And this year, I composed a Romantic style.

51
0:14:18.568,000 --> 0:14:21,000
So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky

52
0:14:22.469,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and all the great Romantic composers.

53
0:14:24.96,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.

54
0:14:30.443,000 --> 0:14:31,000
They help me plan out the whole piece.

55
0:14:32.412,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas,

56
0:14:36.138,000 --> 0:14:37,000
because then you have to think.

57
0:14:38.136,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Laughter)

58
0:14:39.933,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form --

59
0:14:43.436,000 --> 0:14:45,000
solidified, excuse me -- solidified form,

60
0:14:45.682,000 --> 0:14:5,000
you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details,

61
0:14:50.732,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and then polish the overall performance of the composition.

62
0:14:54.843,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing.

63
0:14:57.912,000 --> 0:15:,000
Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.

64
0:15:01.42,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I think that's a craze among teens right now.

65
0:15:04.385,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And once I realized it,

66
0:15:06.061,000 --> 0:15:09,000
there's a parallel between creating music and creating art,

67
0:15:10.081,000 --> 0:15:15,000
because for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing,

68
0:15:15.215,000 --> 0:15:17,000
it's your character -- you want to decide who you want to draw,

69
0:15:18.207,000 --> 0:15:2,000
or if you want to draw an original character.

70
0:15:20.387,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character?

71
0:15:23.908,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Like, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer?

72
0:15:27.344,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book?

73
0:15:30.544,000 --> 0:15:32,000
For a more grandiose effect, I guess.

74
0:15:33.131,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character,

75
0:15:36.302,000 --> 0:15:38,000
which is like your structure of a piece,

76
0:15:38.364,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need --

77
0:15:42.148,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that's polishing the drawing.

78
0:15:44.025,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind,

79
0:15:47.771,000 --> 0:15:51,000
because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted.

80
0:15:52.781,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it,

81
0:15:57.82,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.

82
0:16:00.999,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw

83
0:16:03.801,000 --> 0:16:04,000
or I can't compose at all,

84
0:16:05.786,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and then it's like there's too much on your mind.

85
0:16:08.116,000 --> 0:16:1,000
You can't focus on what you're supposed to do.

86
0:16:10.517,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it,

87
0:16:15.842,000 --> 0:16:18,000
you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.

88
0:16:19.486,000 --> 0:16:21,000
What happens is, if something magical happens,

89
0:16:21.994,000 --> 0:16:23,000
if something natural happens to you,

90
0:16:24.622,000 --> 0:16:27,000
you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly,

91
0:16:28.265,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and then that's what I consider "flow,"

92
0:16:30.417,000 --> 0:16:33,000
because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything.

93
0:16:34.409,000 --> 0:16:37,000
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.

94
0:16:38.194,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I'm not going to play my own composition today because,

95
0:16:41.439,000 --> 0:16:43,000
although I did finish it, it's way too long.

96
0:16:45.05,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Instead, I'd like to try something called "improvisation."

97
0:16:48.262,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I have here seven note cards,

98
0:16:50.507,000 --> 0:16:53,000
one with each note of the musical alphabet.

99
0:16:53.714,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five --

100
0:16:57.621,000 --> 0:16:58,000
anyone to come up here and choose five --

101
0:16:59.633,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and then I can make it into some sort of melody,

102
0:17:02.369,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and I'll improvise it.

103
0:17:04.711,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Wow. A volunteer, yay!

104
0:17:07.866,000 --> 0:17:08,000
(Laughter)

105
0:17:09.364,000 --> 0:17:12,000
(Applause)

106
0:17:12.514,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.

107
0:17:14.633,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?

108
0:17:17.644,000 --> 0:17:19,000
JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.

109
0:17:19.73,000 --> 0:17:2,000
GH: OK, one. JL: OK.

110
0:17:22.185,000 --> 0:17:23,000
GH: Two. JL: Yes.

111
0:17:25.025,000 --> 0:17:26,000
GH: Three.

112
0:17:28.009,000 --> 0:17:3,000
GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar.

113
0:17:30.532,000 --> 0:17:34,000
(Laughter)

114
0:17:35.165,000 --> 0:17:38,000
JL: One more. GH: OK. "E" for "effort."

115
0:17:38.525,000 --> 0:17:41,000
JL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?

116
0:17:41.82,000 --> 0:17:47,000
GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E.

117
0:17:48.135,000 --> 0:17:49,000
JL: Thank you very much!

118
0:17:49.313,000 --> 0:17:5,000
GH: You're welcome. And what about these?

119
0:17:51.313,000 --> 0:17:53,000
JL: I won't use them. Thank you!

120
0:17:55.204,000 --> 0:18:01,000
(Applause)

121
0:18:02.152,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.

122
0:18:05.554,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.

123
0:18:07.998,000 --> 0:18:1,000
(Plays notes)

124
0:18:13.606,000 --> 0:18:14,000
OK, that's nice.

125
0:18:16.036,000 --> 0:18:17,000
So, I'm going to have a moment to think,

126
0:18:17.997,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and I'll try to make something out of it.

127
0:18:25.134,000 --> 0:18:28,000
(Plays the five notes)

128
0:18:36.044,000 --> 0:18:42,000
(Music)

129
0:21:52.201,000 --> 0:21:54,000
(Music ends)

130
0:21:54.226,000 --> 0:22:,000
(Applause)

131
0:22:01.028,000 --> 0:22:03,000
The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play

132
0:22:03.616,000 --> 0:22:06,000
is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina.

133
0:22:07.979,000 --> 0:22:08,000
(Applause)

134
0:22:12.689,000 --> 0:22:17,000
(Music)

135
0:24:04.521,000 --> 0:24:06,000
(Music ends)

136
0:24:06.546,000 --> 0:24:12,000
(Applause)

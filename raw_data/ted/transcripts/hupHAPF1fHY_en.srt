1
0:00:16.028,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Think about your day for a second.

2
0:00:17.681,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door,

3
0:00:20.952,000 --> 0:00:22,000
encountered new colleagues and had great discussions

4
0:00:23.427,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and felt in awe when you found something new.

5
0:00:25.553,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But I bet there's something you didn't think about today,

6
0:00:28.255,000 --> 0:00:29,000
something so close to home,

7
0:00:29.575,000 --> 0:00:31,000
you probably don't think about it very often at all.

8
0:00:32.038,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And that's that all those sensations, feelings, decisions and actions

9
0:00:35.325,000 --> 0:00:36,000
are mediated by the computer in your head

10
0:00:37.307,000 --> 0:00:38,000
called your brain.

11
0:00:38.521,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now, the brain may not look like much from the outside --

12
0:00:41.23,000 --> 0:00:43,000
a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,

13
0:00:43.621,000 --> 0:00:44,000
amorphous.

14
0:00:44.859,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But the last 100 years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain

15
0:00:48.578,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and to see the intricacy of what lies within.

16
0:00:50.714,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit

17
0:00:54.502,000 --> 0:00:57,000
made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.

18
0:00:58.161,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now, unlike a human-designed computer,

19
0:01:01.441,000 --> 0:01:03,000
where there's a fairly small number of different parts,

20
0:01:04.102,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and we know how they work because we humans designed them,

21
0:01:06.979,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells,

22
0:01:10.074,000 --> 0:01:11,000
maybe tens of thousands.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules;

24
0:01:14.629,000 --> 0:01:16,000
they project and connect to different brain regions.

25
0:01:17.115,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They also change in different ways in different disease states.

26
0:01:20.137,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Let's make it concrete.

27
0:01:21.537,000 --> 0:01:22,000
There's a class of cells,

28
0:01:23.046,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.

29
0:01:27.126,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied

30
0:01:29.41,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in disorders like schizophrenia.

31
0:01:30.969,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's called the basket cell.

32
0:01:32.694,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell

33
0:01:35.252,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that we're learning about.

34
0:01:36.555,000 --> 0:01:37,000
New ones are being discovered every day.

35
0:01:39.482,000 --> 0:01:4,000
As just a second example:

36
0:01:40.9,000 --> 0:01:43,000
these pyramidal cells, large cells, can span a significant fraction

37
0:01:44.906,000 --> 0:01:45,000
of the brain.

38
0:01:46.081,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They're excitatory.

39
0:01:47.287,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And these are some of the cells that might be overactive

40
0:01:50.024,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in disorders such as epilepsy.

41
0:01:52.315,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device.

42
0:01:56.73,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They receive inputs from thousands of upstream partners

43
0:01:59.421,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and compute their own electrical outputs,

44
0:02:01.797,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which then, if they pass a certain threshold,

45
0:02:04.032,000 --> 0:02:06,000
will go to thousands of downstream partners.

46
0:02:06.141,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so,

47
0:02:08.905,000 --> 0:02:11,000
happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells,

48
0:02:12.922,000 --> 0:02:14,000
as long as you live and think and feel.

49
0:02:17.1,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?

50
0:02:21.102,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Ideally, we could go through this circuit

51
0:02:23.117,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and turn these different kinds of cell on and off

52
0:02:25.683,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and see whether we could figure out

53
0:02:27.401,000 --> 0:02:29,000
which ones contribute to certain functions

54
0:02:29.678,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.

55
0:02:32.207,000 --> 0:02:35,000
If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash,

56
0:02:35.539,000 --> 0:02:36,000
what they can initiate and sustain.

57
0:02:37.253,000 --> 0:02:38,000
If we could turn them off,

58
0:02:38.53,000 --> 0:02:4,000
then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for.

59
0:02:41.396,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And that's the story I'm going to tell you about today.

60
0:02:44.409,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years,

61
0:02:47.342,000 --> 0:02:48,000
through an attempt to find ways

62
0:02:48.852,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain

63
0:02:51.938,000 --> 0:02:52,000
on and off,

64
0:02:53.113,000 --> 0:02:54,000
both to understand the science

65
0:02:54.72,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans.

66
0:03:00.675,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, before I tell you about the technology,

67
0:03:03.083,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room,

68
0:03:07.232,000 --> 0:03:08,000
if we live long enough,

69
0:03:08.412,000 --> 0:03:1,000
will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.

70
0:03:11.158,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder

71
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that incapacitates them.

72
0:03:16.446,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The numbers don't do it justice, though.

73
0:03:18.865,000 --> 0:03:2,000
These disorders -- schizophrenia, Alzheimer's,

74
0:03:21.213,000 --> 0:03:22,000
depression, addiction --

75
0:03:22.388,000 --> 0:03:24,000
they not only steal away our time to live,

76
0:03:24.583,000 --> 0:03:25,000
they change who we are.

77
0:03:25.758,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They take our identity and change our emotions

78
0:03:27.928,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and change who we are as people.

79
0:03:30.714,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now, in the 20th century,

80
0:03:34.376,000 --> 0:03:36,000
there was some hope that was generated

81
0:03:36.658,000 --> 0:03:39,000
through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders.

82
0:03:40.295,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And while many drugs have been developed

83
0:03:42.556,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders,

84
0:03:45.169,000 --> 0:03:47,000
practically none of them can be considered to be cured.

85
0:03:47.783,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In part, that's because, if you think about it,

86
0:03:49.999,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we're bathing the brain in a chemical --

87
0:03:51.946,000 --> 0:03:54,000
this elaborate circuit, made of thousands of different kinds of cell --

88
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is being bathed in a substance.

89
0:03:56.845,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That's also why most of the drugs, not all, on the market

90
0:03:59.583,000 --> 0:04:01,000
can present some kind of serious side effect too.

91
0:04:02.091,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators

92
0:04:05.947,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that are implanted in the brain,

93
0:04:07.508,000 --> 0:04:1,000
for Parkinson's disease or cochlear implants.

94
0:04:11.035,000 --> 0:04:14,000
These have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy

95
0:04:14.829,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to people with certain kinds of disorders.

96
0:04:16.915,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But electricity also will go in all directions --

97
0:04:19.966,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the path of least resistance --

98
0:04:21.474,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which is where that phrase, in part, comes from,

99
0:04:23.746,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and will also affect normal circuits,

100
0:04:25.535,000 --> 0:04:27,000
as well as the abnormal ones you want to fix.

101
0:04:27.687,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So again, we're sent back to the idea of ultraprecise control:

102
0:04:30.674,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go?

103
0:04:35.329,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So, when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago --

104
0:04:38.454,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist --

105
0:04:41.714,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the first thing I thought about was,

106
0:04:43.468,000 --> 0:04:45,000
if these neurons are electrical devices,

107
0:04:45.581,000 --> 0:04:48,000
all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes

108
0:04:49.404,000 --> 0:04:5,000
at a distance.

109
0:04:50.588,000 --> 0:04:53,000
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors,

110
0:04:53.927,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that'd give us the tool to activate and shut down these different cells

111
0:04:57.297,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to figure out what they do

112
0:04:58.562,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded.

113
0:05:01.688,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It would also allow us to have the ultraprecise control we need

114
0:05:04.677,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry.

115
0:05:07.837,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, how are we going to do that?

116
0:05:09.482,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Well, there are many molecules that exist in nature

117
0:05:12.066,000 --> 0:05:15,000
which are able to convert light into electricity.

118
0:05:15.283,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells.

119
0:05:18.518,000 --> 0:05:2,000
If we install these molecules in neurons somehow,

120
0:05:21.339,000 --> 0:05:24,000
then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light,

121
0:05:24.699,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and their neighbors, which don't have this molecule, would not.

122
0:05:27.871,000 --> 0:05:29,000
There's one other magic trick you need to make this happen:

123
0:05:30.665,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the ability to get light into the brain.

124
0:05:32.597,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The brain doesn't feel pain.

125
0:05:35.121,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Taking advantage of all the effort

126
0:05:36.78,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that's gone into the internet, telecommunications, etc.,

127
0:05:39.501,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you can put optical fibers connected to lasers

128
0:05:41.684,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to activate -- in animal models, for example, in preclinical studies --

129
0:05:45.729,000 --> 0:05:46,000
these neurons and see what they do.

130
0:05:48.135,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So how do we do this?

131
0:05:49.968,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Around 2004, in collaboration with Georg Nagel and Karl Deisseroth,

132
0:05:53.626,000 --> 0:05:54,000
this vision came to fruition.

133
0:05:55.943,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild,

134
0:05:58.997,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally.

135
0:06:02.893,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And it senses light with a little eyespot,

136
0:06:04.969,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which works not unlike how our eye works.

137
0:06:07.681,000 --> 0:06:09,000
In its membrane, or its boundary,

138
0:06:09.992,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it contains little proteins

139
0:06:13.194,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that indeed can convert light into electricity.

140
0:06:16.118,000 --> 0:06:18,000
These molecules are called channelrhodopsins.

141
0:06:18.692,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell

142
0:06:21.494,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that I told you about.

143
0:06:22.683,000 --> 0:06:23,000
When blue light hits it,

144
0:06:23.858,000 --> 0:06:26,000
it opens a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eyespot;

145
0:06:27.332,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that allows this eyespot to have an electrical signal,

146
0:06:29.897,000 --> 0:06:31,000
just like a solar cell charging a battery.

147
0:06:31.927,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So what we need to do is take these molecules

148
0:06:34.082,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and somehow install them in neurons.

149
0:06:35.833,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And because it's a protein,

150
0:06:37.201,000 --> 0:06:4,000
it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.

151
0:06:40.277,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So all we've got to do is take that DNA,

152
0:06:42.446,000 --> 0:06:44,000
put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus,

153
0:06:45.344,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and put it into neurons.

154
0:06:48.276,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And this was a very productive time in gene therapy,

155
0:06:51.975,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and lots of viruses were coming along,

156
0:06:53.991,000 --> 0:06:54,000
so this turned out to be fairly simple.

157
0:06:55.898,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004,

158
0:06:58.381,000 --> 0:07:,000
we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.

159
0:07:01.057,000 --> 0:07:03,000
You take this DNA and put it into the neuron.

160
0:07:03.205,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery

161
0:07:06.614,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins

162
0:07:09.094,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and install them all over the cell, like putting solar panels on a roof.

163
0:07:12.867,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And the next thing you know,

164
0:07:14.236,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you have a neuron which can be activated with light.

165
0:07:17.303,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So this is very powerful.

166
0:07:18.765,000 --> 0:07:21,000
One of the tricks you have to do is figure out how to deliver these genes

167
0:07:22.5,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to the cells you want and not all the other neighbors.

168
0:07:25.055,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And you can do that;

169
0:07:26.23,000 --> 0:07:29,000
you can tweak the viruses so they hit some cells and not others.

170
0:07:29.258,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And there's other genetic tricks you can play

171
0:07:31.412,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in order to get light-activated cells.

172
0:07:34.206,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This field has now come to be known as "optogenetics."

173
0:07:37.21,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do,

174
0:07:40.135,000 --> 0:07:41,000
you can take a complex network,

175
0:07:41.932,000 --> 0:07:43,000
use one of these viruses to deliver the gene

176
0:07:44.025,000 --> 0:07:46,000
just to one kind of cell in this dense network.

177
0:07:46.291,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And then when you shine light on the entire network,

178
0:07:48.863,000 --> 0:07:49,000
just that cell type will be activated.

179
0:07:50.727,000 --> 0:07:53,000
For example, let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier,

180
0:07:54.058,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia

181
0:07:56.057,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and the one that is inhibitory.

182
0:07:58.291,000 --> 0:08:,000
If we can deliver that gene to these cells --

183
0:08:00.423,000 --> 0:08:03,000
they won't be altered by the expression of the gene, of course --

184
0:08:03.505,000 --> 0:08:05,000
then flash blue light over the entire brain network,

185
0:08:05.972,000 --> 0:08:07,000
just these cells are going to be driven.

186
0:08:08.135,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal;

187
0:08:10.992,000 --> 0:08:11,000
there don't seem to be adverse events.

188
0:08:12.842,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Not only can you study what these cells do,

189
0:08:14.872,000 --> 0:08:16,000
what their power is in computing in the brain,

190
0:08:17.043,000 --> 0:08:19,000
you can also use this to try to figure out

191
0:08:19.128,000 --> 0:08:21,000
if we could jazz up the activity of these cells

192
0:08:21.362,000 --> 0:08:22,000
if indeed, they're atrophied.

193
0:08:22.839,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I want to tell you some short stories about how we're using this

194
0:08:25.931,000 --> 0:08:28,000
both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels.

195
0:08:29.341,000 --> 0:08:31,000
One of the questions that we've confronted is:

196
0:08:31.795,000 --> 0:08:33,000
What signals in the brain mediate the sensation of reward?

197
0:08:34.561,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Because if you could find those,

198
0:08:36.121,000 --> 0:08:38,000
those would be some of the signals that could drive learning;

199
0:08:39.031,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the brain will do more of what got that reward.

200
0:08:41.251,000 --> 0:08:44,000
These are also signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.

201
0:08:44.426,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So if we could figure out what cells they are, we could maybe find new targets

202
0:08:48.136,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for which drugs can be designed or screened against

203
0:08:50.65,000 --> 0:08:52,000
or maybe places where electrodes could be put in

204
0:08:52.925,000 --> 0:08:53,000
for people who have severe disability.

205
0:08:54.774,000 --> 0:08:56,000
To do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm

206
0:08:57.186,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in collaboration with the Fiorillo group,

207
0:08:59.171,000 --> 0:09:01,000
where, if the animal goes to one side of this little box,

208
0:09:01.884,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it gets a pulse of light.

209
0:09:03.104,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And we'll make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.

210
0:09:06.108,000 --> 0:09:09,000
If these cells can mediate reward, the animal should go there more and more.

211
0:09:09.719,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And that's what happens.

212
0:09:10.908,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The animal goes to the right-hand side and pokes his nose there

213
0:09:13.89,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and gets a flash of blue light every time he does it.

214
0:09:16.403,000 --> 0:09:17,000
He'll do that hundreds of times.

215
0:09:17.96,000 --> 0:09:18,000
These are the dopamine neurons,

216
0:09:19.461,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.

217
0:09:21.586,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We've shown that a brief activation of these is enough to drive learning.

218
0:09:25.403,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now we can generalize the idea.

219
0:09:27.472,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Instead of one point in the brain, we can devise devices that span the brain,

220
0:09:31.129,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns --

221
0:09:33.829,000 --> 0:09:34,000
arrays of optical fibers,

222
0:09:35.046,000 --> 0:09:37,000
each coupled to its own independent miniature light source.

223
0:09:37.845,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Then we can try to do things in vivo

224
0:09:39.586,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that have only been done to date in a dish,

225
0:09:41.624,000 --> 0:09:43,000
like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain

226
0:09:44.38,000 --> 0:09:46,000
for the signals that can cause certain things to happen

227
0:09:47.025,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders.

228
0:09:50.27,000 --> 0:09:51,000
One story I want to tell you about is:

229
0:09:52.115,000 --> 0:09:55,000
How can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder,

230
0:09:55.353,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear?

231
0:09:58.044,000 --> 0:10:02,000
One of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear.

232
0:10:02.96,000 --> 0:10:04,000
This goes back to the Pavlovian days.

233
0:10:05.961,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning, where a tone ends with a brief shock.

234
0:10:09.663,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.

235
0:10:12.131,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And over time -- in this case, a mouse,

236
0:10:14.033,000 --> 0:10:17,000
which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments --

237
0:10:17.167,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the animal learns to fear the tone.

238
0:10:18.871,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It will react by freezing, sort of like a deer in the headlights.

239
0:10:21.962,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now the question is: What targets in the brain can we find

240
0:10:24.716,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that allow us to overcome this fear?

241
0:10:27.366,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So we play that tone again, after it's been associated with fear.

242
0:10:31.135,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But we activate different targets in the brain,

243
0:10:33.355,000 --> 0:10:35,000
using that optical fiber array I showed on the previous slide,

244
0:10:36.361,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in order to try and figure out

245
0:10:37.818,000 --> 0:10:4,000
which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.

246
0:10:41.112,000 --> 0:10:43,000
This brief video shows you one of these targets

247
0:10:43.426,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that we're working on now.

248
0:10:44.704,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex, a region where we can use cognition

249
0:10:48.365,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to try to overcome aversive emotional states.

250
0:10:50.493,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The animal hears a tone. A flash of light occurs.

251
0:10:52.81,000 --> 0:10:54,000
There's no audio, but you see that the animal freezes --

252
0:10:55.462,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the tone used to mean bad news.

253
0:10:56.965,000 --> 0:10:58,000
There's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner.

254
0:10:59.472,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You can see the animal is about two minutes into this.

255
0:11:02.026,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This next clip is just eight minutes later.

256
0:11:04.264,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.

257
0:11:08.294,000 --> 0:11:11,000
OK, there it goes. Right ... now.

258
0:11:11.494,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment,

259
0:11:14.208,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that we've equipped the brain, by photoactivating this area,

260
0:11:17.052,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to overcome the expression of this fear memory.

261
0:11:21.262,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Over the last couple years, we've gone back to the tree of life,

262
0:11:24.314,000 --> 0:11:27,000
because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.

263
0:11:27.435,000 --> 0:11:29,000
If we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.

264
0:11:29.999,000 --> 0:11:31,000
If you can delete cells for a few milliseconds or seconds,

265
0:11:32.748,000 --> 0:11:35,000
you can figure out what role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded.

266
0:11:36.582,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life --

267
0:11:39.182,000 --> 0:11:41,000
every kingdom of life but animals; we see slightly differently.

268
0:11:42.167,000 --> 0:11:44,000
We found molecules called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins,

269
0:11:45.06,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that respond to green and yellow light.

270
0:11:46.95,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And they do the opposite of the molecule I told you about before,

271
0:11:50.077,000 --> 0:11:52,000
with the blue light activator, channelrhodopsin.

272
0:11:52.586,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go.

273
0:11:55.437,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Consider, for example, a condition like epilepsy,

274
0:11:58.259,000 --> 0:12:,000
where the brain is overactive.

275
0:12:00.373,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now, if drugs fail in epileptic treatment,

276
0:12:02.512,000 --> 0:12:04,000
one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain,

277
0:12:05.021,000 --> 0:12:07,000
but that's irreversible, and there could be side effects.

278
0:12:07.728,000 --> 0:12:1,000
What if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time

279
0:12:11.038,000 --> 0:12:12,000
until the seizure dies away,

280
0:12:12.442,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state,

281
0:12:15.88,000 --> 0:12:18,000
like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state?

282
0:12:19.21,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This animation tries to explain this concept

283
0:12:21.296,000 --> 0:12:24,000
where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light,

284
0:12:24.507,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and we beam light in,

285
0:12:25.683,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure,

286
0:12:28.235,000 --> 0:12:29,000
we're hoping to be able to turn it off.

287
0:12:30.13,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We don't have data to show you on this front,

288
0:12:32.266,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but we're very excited about this.

289
0:12:33.926,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I want to close on one story, which we think is another possibility,

290
0:12:37.372,000 --> 0:12:4,000
which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultraprecise control,

291
0:12:40.789,000 --> 0:12:43,000
can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic,

292
0:12:43.866,000 --> 0:12:44,000
an optical prosthetic.

293
0:12:45.042,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.

294
0:12:48.195,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Seventy-five thousand people

295
0:12:49.563,000 --> 0:12:51,000
have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted,

296
0:12:51.935,000 --> 0:12:54,000
maybe 100,000 people have cochlear implants, which allow them to hear.

297
0:12:55.552,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Another thing -- you've got to get these genes into cells.

298
0:12:58.36,000 --> 0:13:,000
A new hope in gene therapy has been developed,

299
0:13:00.628,000 --> 0:13:02,000
because viruses like the adeno-associated virus --

300
0:13:03.261,000 --> 0:13:05,000
which probably most of us around this room have;

301
0:13:05.532,000 --> 0:13:06,000
it doesn't have any symptoms --

302
0:13:07.048,000 --> 0:13:08,000
have been used in hundreds of patients

303
0:13:08.886,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to deliver genes into the brain or the body.

304
0:13:10.969,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And so far, there have not been serious adverse events

305
0:13:13.526,000 --> 0:13:14,000
associated with the virus.

306
0:13:14.793,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There's one last elephant in the room: the proteins themselves,

307
0:13:17.789,000 --> 0:13:19,000
which come from algae, bacteria and funguses

308
0:13:19.916,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and all over the tree of life.

309
0:13:21.616,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brains,

310
0:13:24.172,000 --> 0:13:26,000
so what will our brain do if we put that in?

311
0:13:26.249,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Will the cells tolerate it? Will the immune system react?

312
0:13:28.943,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It's early -- these haven't been done in humans yet --

313
0:13:31.492,000 --> 0:13:33,000
but we're working on a variety of studies to examine this.

314
0:13:34.246,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So far, we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity

315
0:13:37.118,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to these molecules

316
0:13:38.412,000 --> 0:13:41,000
or to the illumination of the brain with light.

317
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it.

318
0:13:45.135,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I wanted to close with one story,

319
0:13:46.776,000 --> 0:13:49,000
which we think could potentially be a clinical application.

320
0:13:50.913,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Now, there are many forms of blindness

321
0:13:53.412,000 --> 0:13:56,000
where the photoreceptors -- light sensors in the back of our eye --

322
0:13:56.672,000 --> 0:13:57,000
are gone.

323
0:13:57.855,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And the retina is a complex structure.

324
0:13:59.721,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Let's zoom in on it so we can see it in more detail.

325
0:14:02.407,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top.

326
0:14:04.829,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed

327
0:14:08.015,000 --> 0:14:09,000
via various computations

328
0:14:09.194,000 --> 0:14:12,000
until finally, the layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells,

329
0:14:12.462,000 --> 0:14:13,000
relay the information to the brain,

330
0:14:14.175,000 --> 0:14:15,000
where we see that as perception.

331
0:14:16.318,000 --> 0:14:18,000
In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa

332
0:14:18.829,000 --> 0:14:19,000
or macular degeneration,

333
0:14:20.559,000 --> 0:14:22,000
the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.

334
0:14:23.904,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Now, how could you repair this?

335
0:14:25.787,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored,

336
0:14:28.825,000 --> 0:14:3,000
since there's nothing for the drug to bind to.

337
0:14:30.994,000 --> 0:14:32,000
On the other hand, light can still get into the eye.

338
0:14:33.452,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in.

339
0:14:36.015,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So what if we could take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules

340
0:14:39.233,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and install them on some of these other spared cells

341
0:14:41.69,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and convert them into little cameras?

342
0:14:43.485,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And because there are so many of these cells in the eye,

343
0:14:46.183,000 --> 0:14:48,000
potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras.

344
0:14:48.843,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This is some work that we're doing,

345
0:14:50.541,000 --> 0:14:53,000
led by one of our collaborators, Alan Horsager at USC,

346
0:14:53.579,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company, Eos Neuroscience,

347
0:14:57.278,000 --> 0:14:58,000
which is funded by the NIH.

348
0:14:58.594,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What you see here is a mouse trying to solve a six-arm maze.

349
0:15:01.662,000 --> 0:15:04,000
There's a bit of water to motivate the mouse to move or he'll just sit there.

350
0:15:05.322,000 --> 0:15:07,000
The goal of this maze is to get out of the water

351
0:15:07.605,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port.

352
0:15:11.338,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Mice are smart, so this one solves the maze eventually,

353
0:15:13.938,000 --> 0:15:14,000
but he does a brute-force search.

354
0:15:15.538,000 --> 0:15:18,000
He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.

355
0:15:18.86,000 --> 0:15:2,000
He's not using vision to do it.

356
0:15:20.968,000 --> 0:15:22,000
These different mice are different mutations

357
0:15:23.051,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.

358
0:15:26.178,000 --> 0:15:29,000
So we're being careful in trying to look at these different models

359
0:15:29.309,000 --> 0:15:31,000
so we come up with a generalized approach.

360
0:15:31.85,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So how can we solve this?

361
0:15:33.135,000 --> 0:15:35,000
We'll do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.

362
0:15:35.788,000 --> 0:15:36,000
We'll take these blue light photo sensors

363
0:15:37.772,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and install them onto a layer of cells

364
0:15:39.614,000 --> 0:15:41,000
in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye

365
0:15:41.981,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and convert them into a camera --

366
0:15:43.629,000 --> 0:15:45,000
just like installing solar cells all over those neurons

367
0:15:46.239,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to make them light-sensitive.

368
0:15:47.659,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Light is converted to electricity on them.

369
0:15:49.977,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment

370
0:15:52.895,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule on a virus.

371
0:15:56.127,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls

372
0:15:58.693,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and go to this little platform

373
0:16:00.158,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and make cognitive use of its eyes again.

374
0:16:03.379,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And to point out the power of this:

375
0:16:05.136,000 --> 0:16:06,000
these animals can get to that platform

376
0:16:06.984,000 --> 0:16:08,000
just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.

377
0:16:09.733,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So this preclinical study, I think, bodes hope

378
0:16:11.907,000 --> 0:16:13,000
for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future.

379
0:16:15.555,000 --> 0:16:19,000
We're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology.

380
0:16:20.072,000 --> 0:16:22,000
We're developing tools and sharing them freely

381
0:16:22.247,000 --> 0:16:24,000
with hundreds of groups all over the world

382
0:16:24.324,000 --> 0:16:26,000
for them to study and try to treat different disorders.

383
0:16:26.928,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits

384
0:16:29.205,000 --> 0:16:32,000
at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them,

385
0:16:32.476,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we can take some of these intractable disorders I mentioned earlier,

386
0:16:35.697,000 --> 0:16:36,000
practically none of which are cured,

387
0:16:37.44,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and in the 21st century, make them history.

388
0:16:39.486,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Thank you.

389
0:16:40.671,000 --> 0:16:46,000
(Applause)

390
0:16:53.967,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Juan Enriquez: So some of this stuff is a little dense.

391
0:16:56.651,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Laughter)

392
0:16:59.083,000 --> 0:17:03,000
But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy

393
0:17:03.715,000 --> 0:17:04,000
with light instead of drugs

394
0:17:05.716,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and being able to target those specifically

395
0:17:08.394,000 --> 0:17:09,000
is a first step.

396
0:17:10.642,000 --> 0:17:12,000
The second thing that I think I heard you say

397
0:17:12.81,000 --> 0:17:16,000
is you can now control the brain in two colors,

398
0:17:17.662,000 --> 0:17:18,000
like an on-off switch.

399
0:17:18.947,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Ed Boyden: That's right.

400
0:17:20.135,000 --> 0:17:23,000
JE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code.

401
0:17:23.372,000 --> 0:17:24,000
EB: Right.

402
0:17:24.547,000 --> 0:17:27,000
With blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.

403
0:17:28.023,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.

404
0:17:30.491,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain

405
0:17:34.064,000 --> 0:17:36,000
so we can augment functions in people with disabilities.

406
0:17:36.734,000 --> 0:17:41,000
JE: And in theory, that means that, as a mouse feels, smells, hears, touches,

407
0:17:42.313,000 --> 0:17:45,000
you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros.

408
0:17:45.658,000 --> 0:17:47,000
EB: Yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing

409
0:17:48.222,000 --> 0:17:5,000
what neural codes can drive certain behaviors

410
0:17:50.368,000 --> 0:17:51,000
and certain thoughts and certain feelings

411
0:17:52.375,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and use that to understand more about the brain.

412
0:17:54.913,000 --> 0:17:56,000
JE: Does that mean that someday you could download memories

413
0:17:57.769,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and maybe upload them?

414
0:17:59.448,000 --> 0:18:01,000
EB: That's something we're starting to work on very hard.

415
0:18:02.155,000 --> 0:18:05,000
We're now working on trying to tile the brain with recording elements, too,

416
0:18:05.733,000 --> 0:18:08,000
so we can record information and then drive information back in --

417
0:18:08.863,000 --> 0:18:09,000
sort of computing what the brain needs

418
0:18:10.7,000 --> 0:18:12,000
in order to augment its information processing.

419
0:18:12.93,000 --> 0:18:14,000
JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you.

420
0:18:15.531,000 --> 0:18:16,000
EB: Thank you.

421
0:18:16.706,000 --> 0:18:18,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There's a question I've been puzzling over and writing about

2
0:00:16.24,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for pretty much all of my adult life.

3
0:00:20.2,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Why do some large-scale crises

4
0:00:23.44,000 --> 0:00:27,000
jolt us awake and inspire us to change and evolve

5
0:00:28.2,000 --> 0:00:3,000
while others might jolt us a bit,

6
0:00:31.12,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but then it's back to sleep?

7
0:00:33.6,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now, the kind of shocks I'm talking about are big --

8
0:00:37.04,000 --> 0:00:41,000
a cataclysmic market crash, rising fascism,

9
0:00:41.64,000 --> 0:00:45,000
an industrial accident that poisons on a massive scale.

10
0:00:46.88,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, events like this can act like a collective alarm bell.

11
0:00:52.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Suddenly, we see a threat, we get organized.

12
0:00:55.8,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We discover strength and resolve that was previously unimaginable.

13
0:01:01.24,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's as if we're no longer walking, but leaping.

14
0:01:06.24,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Except, our collective alarm seems to be busted.

15
0:01:11.32,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Faced with a crisis, we often fall apart, regress

16
0:01:15.48,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and that becomes a window for antidemocratic forces

17
0:01:19.48,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to push societies backwards, to become more unequal and more unstable.

18
0:01:26.24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Ten years ago, I wrote about this backwards process

19
0:01:30.08,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and I called it the "Shock Doctrine."

20
0:01:32.68,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So what determines which road we navigate through crisis?

21
0:01:38.28,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Whether we grow up fast and find those strengths

22
0:01:41.68,000 --> 0:01:42,000
or whether we get knocked back.

23
0:01:44.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I'd say this is a pressing question these days.

24
0:01:48.24,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Because things are pretty shocking out there.

25
0:01:51.2,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Record-breaking storms, drowning cities,

26
0:01:54.64,000 --> 0:01:57,000
record-breaking fires threatening to devour them,

27
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:02,000
thousands of migrants disappearing beneath the waves.

28
0:02:03.32,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And openly supremacist movements rising,

29
0:02:06.56,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in many of our countries there are torches in the streets.

30
0:02:11.44,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And now there's no shortage of people who are sounding the alarm.

31
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But as a society, I don't think we can honestly say

32
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that we're responding with anything like the urgency

33
0:02:25.08,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that these overlapping crises demand from us.

34
0:02:29.56,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And yet, we know from history

35
0:02:31.48,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that it is possible for crisis to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap.

36
0:02:38.28,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And one of the most striking examples of this progressive power of crisis

37
0:02:44.48,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is the Great Crash of 1929.

38
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
There was the shock of the sudden market collapse

39
0:02:50.32,000 --> 0:02:52,000
followed by all of the aftershocks,

40
0:02:52.44,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the millions who lost everything thrown onto breadlines.

41
0:02:56.56,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And this was taken by many as a message that the system itself was broken.

42
0:03:02.32,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And many people listened and they leapt into action.

43
0:03:06.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In the United States and elsewhere, governments began to weave a safety net

44
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
so that the next time there was a crash

45
0:03:14.28,000 --> 0:03:17,000
there would be programs like social security to catch people.

46
0:03:18.24,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There were huge job-creating public investments

47
0:03:21.72,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in housing, electrification and transit.

48
0:03:25.8,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And there was a wave of aggressive regulation

49
0:03:29.32,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to reign in the banks.

50
0:03:30.64,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now, these reforms were far from perfect.

51
0:03:33.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In the US, African American workers, immigrants and women

52
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
were largely excluded.

53
0:03:39.88,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But the Depression period,

54
0:03:41.36,000 --> 0:03:45,000
along with the transformation of allied nations and economies

55
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
during the World War II effort,

56
0:03:47.6,000 --> 0:03:51,000
show us that it is possible for complex societies

57
0:03:51.88,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to rapidly transform themselves in the face of a collective threat.

58
0:03:57.24,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now, when we tell this story of the 1929 Crash,

59
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that's usually the formula that it follows --

60
0:04:04.44,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that there was a shock and it induced a wake-up call

61
0:04:09.56,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and that produced a leap to a safer place.

62
0:04:13.04,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now, if that's really what it took,

63
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
then why isn't it working anymore?

64
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Why do today's non-stop shocks --

65
0:04:21.48,000 --> 0:04:23,000
why don't they spur us into action?

66
0:04:24.48,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Why don't they produce leaps?

67
0:04:26.2,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Especially when it comes to climate change.

68
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So I want to talk to you today

69
0:04:31.519,000 --> 0:04:35,000
about what I think is a much more complete recipe for deep transformation

70
0:04:36.32,000 --> 0:04:38,000
catalyzed by shocking events.

71
0:04:38.48,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And I'm going to focus on two key ingredients

72
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that usually get left out of the history books.

73
0:04:45.68,000 --> 0:04:5,000
One has to do with imagination, the other with organization.

74
0:04:51.12,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Because it's in the interplay between the two

75
0:04:54.12,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where revolutionary power lies.

76
0:04:56.92,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So let's start with imagination.

77
0:04:59.36,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The victories of the New Deal didn't happen just because suddenly

78
0:05:03.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
everybody understood the brutalities of laissez-faire.

79
0:05:07.72,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This was a time, let's remember, of tremendous ideological ferment,

80
0:05:13.08,000 --> 0:05:16,000
when many different ideas about how to organize societies

81
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
did battle with one another in the public square.

82
0:05:19.48,000 --> 0:05:21,000
A time when humanity dared to dream big

83
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:24,000
about different kinds of futures,

84
0:05:24.64,000 --> 0:05:28,000
many of them organized along radically egalitarian lines.

85
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Now, not all of these ideas were good

86
0:05:31.92,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but this was an era of explosive imagining.

87
0:05:36.48,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This meant that the movements demanding change

88
0:05:39.32,000 --> 0:05:42,000
knew what they were against -- crushing poverty, widening inequality --

89
0:05:43.32,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but just as important, they knew what they were for.

90
0:05:46.76,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They had their "no" and they had their "yes," too.

91
0:05:51.6,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They also had very different models of political organization

92
0:05:55.08,000 --> 0:05:56,000
than we do today.

93
0:05:56.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
For decades, social and labor movements

94
0:05:59.12,000 --> 0:06:01,000
had been building up their membership bases,

95
0:06:01.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
linking their causes together and increasing their strength.

96
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Which meant that by the time the Crash happened,

97
0:06:08.76,000 --> 0:06:11,000
there was already a movement that was large and broad enough

98
0:06:12.52,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to, for instance, stage strikes that didn't just shut down factories,

99
0:06:17.36,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but shut down entire cities.

100
0:06:20.12,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The big policy wins of the New Deal were actually offered as compromises.

101
0:06:25.72,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Because the alternative seemed to be revolution.

102
0:06:30.08,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So, let's adjust that equation from earlier.

103
0:06:34.48,000 --> 0:06:37,000
A shocking event plus utopian imagination

104
0:06:38.24,000 --> 0:06:39,000
plus movement muscle,

105
0:06:39.88,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that's how we get a real leap.

106
0:06:43.12,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So how does our present moment measure up?

107
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We are living, once again, at a time of extraordinary political engagements.

108
0:06:50.72,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Politics is a mass obsession.

109
0:06:53.56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage.

110
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And yet, we know from history that "no" is not enough.

111
0:07:03.64,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, there are some "yeses" out there that are emerging.

112
0:07:06.92,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And they're actually getting a lot bolder quickly.

113
0:07:10.32,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Where climate activists used to talk about changing light bulbs,

114
0:07:14.12,000 --> 0:07:16,000
now we're pushing for 100 percent of our energy

115
0:07:16.84,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to come from the sun, wind and waves,

116
0:07:20.04,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and to do it fast.

117
0:07:22.44,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Movements catalyzed by police violence against black bodies

118
0:07:26.2,000 --> 0:07:3,000
are calling for an end to militarized police, mass incarceration

119
0:07:31.04,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and even for reparations for slavery.

120
0:07:34.36,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Students are not just opposing tuition increases,

121
0:07:37.84,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but from Chile to Canada to the UK,

122
0:07:41.08,000 --> 0:07:44,000
they are calling for free tuition and debt cancellation.

123
0:07:46.04,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And yet, this still doesn't add up

124
0:07:48.08,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to the kind of holistic and universalist vision

125
0:07:52.2,000 --> 0:07:55,000
of a different world than our predecessors had.

126
0:07:55.6,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So why is that?

127
0:07:57.88,000 --> 0:08:,000
Well, very often we think about political change

128
0:08:00.92,000 --> 0:08:02,000
in defined compartments these days.

129
0:08:03.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Environment in one box, inequality in another,

130
0:08:07.4,000 --> 0:08:11,000
racial and gender justice in a couple of other boxes,

131
0:08:11.52,000 --> 0:08:14,000
education over here, health over there.

132
0:08:15.32,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And within each compartment,

133
0:08:16.88,000 --> 0:08:2,000
there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGOs,

134
0:08:21.48,000 --> 0:08:24,000
each competing with one another for credit, name recognition

135
0:08:25.48,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and of course, resources.

136
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
In other words, we act a lot like corporate brands.

137
0:08:32.56,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now, this is often referred to as the problem of silos.

138
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Now, silos are understandable.

139
0:08:38.2,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They carve up our complex world into manageable chunks.

140
0:08:42.28,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They help us feel less overwhelmed.

141
0:08:45.159,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But in the process, they also train our brains to tune out

142
0:08:49.679,000 --> 0:08:52,000
when somebody else's issue comes up

143
0:08:52.76,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and when somebody else's issue needs our help and support.

144
0:08:57.08,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And they also keep us from seeing glaring connections between our issues.

145
0:09:03.08,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So for instance, the people fighting poverty and inequality

146
0:09:06.4,000 --> 0:09:07,000
rarely talk about climate change.

147
0:09:08.32,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Even though we see time and again

148
0:09:10.72,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that it's the poorest of people

149
0:09:12.24,000 --> 0:09:15,000
who are the most vulnerable to extreme weather.

150
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The climate change people rarely talk about war and occupation.

151
0:09:20.04,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Even though we know that the thirst for fossil fuels

152
0:09:22.8,000 --> 0:09:24,000
has been a major driver of conflict.

153
0:09:26.4,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The environmental movement has gotten better at pointing out

154
0:09:29.6,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that the nations that are getting hit hardest by climate change

155
0:09:33.08,000 --> 0:09:36,000
are populated overwhelmingly by black and brown people.

156
0:09:37.32,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But when black lives are treated as disposable

157
0:09:40.04,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in prisons, in schools and on the streets,

158
0:09:44.04,000 --> 0:09:46,000
these connections are too rarely made.

159
0:09:47.28,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The walls between our silos

160
0:09:49.52,000 --> 0:09:52,000
also means that our solutions, when they emerge,

161
0:09:53.4,000 --> 0:09:55,000
are also disconnected from each other.

162
0:09:55.72,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So progressives now have this long list of demands that I was mentioning earlier,

163
0:10:00.72,000 --> 0:10:01,000
those "yeses."

164
0:10:02.36,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But what we're still missing

165
0:10:03.76,000 --> 0:10:06,000
is that coherent picture of the world we're fighting for.

166
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
What it looks like, what it feels like, and most of all, what its core values are.

167
0:10:12.72,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And that really matters.

168
0:10:14.48,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Because when large-scale crises hit us

169
0:10:17.32,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and we are confronted with the need to leap somewhere safer,

170
0:10:21.76,000 --> 0:10:24,000
there isn't any agreement on what that place is.

171
0:10:25.76,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And leaping without a destination

172
0:10:28.52,000 --> 0:10:3,000
looks a lot like jumping up and down.

173
0:10:31.2,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

174
0:10:32.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Fortunately, there are all kinds of conversations and experiments going on

175
0:10:36.04,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to try to overcome these divisions that are holding us back.

176
0:10:39.32,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And I want to finish by talking about one of them.

177
0:10:42.96,000 --> 0:10:44,000
A couple of years ago, a group of us in Canada

178
0:10:45.2,000 --> 0:10:47,000
decided that we were hitting the limits

179
0:10:47.44,000 --> 0:10:5,000
of what we could accomplish in our various silos.

180
0:10:50.92,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So we locked ourselves in a room for two days,

181
0:10:53.68,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and we tried to figure out what bound us together.

182
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
In that room were people who rarely get face to face.

183
0:11:01.04,000 --> 0:11:05,000
There were indigenous elders with hipsters working on transit.

184
0:11:05.64,000 --> 0:11:06,000
There was the head of Greenpeace

185
0:11:07.48,000 --> 0:11:11,000
with a union leader representing oil workers and loggers.

186
0:11:11.56,000 --> 0:11:14,000
There were faith leaders and feminist icons and many more.

187
0:11:15.48,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And we gave ourselves a pretty ambitious assignment:

188
0:11:18.92,000 --> 0:11:23,000
agreeing on a short statement describing the world after we win.

189
0:11:24.92,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The world after we've already made the transition to a clean economy

190
0:11:29.52,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and a much fairer society.

191
0:11:31.8,000 --> 0:11:32,000
In other words,

192
0:11:33.04,000 --> 0:11:37,000
instead of trying to scare people about what will happen if we don't act,

193
0:11:37.76,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we decided to try to inspire them with what could happen if we did act.

194
0:11:43.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Sensible people are always telling us

195
0:11:46.2,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that change needs to come in small increments.

196
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
That politics is the art of the possible

197
0:11:52.52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and that we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

198
0:11:56.4,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Well, we rejected all of that.

199
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We wrote a manifesto, and we called it "The Leap."

200
0:12:02.88,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I have to tell you that agreeing on our common "yes"

201
0:12:06.32,000 --> 0:12:08,000
across such diversity of experiences

202
0:12:08.72,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and against a backdrop of a lot of painful history

203
0:12:12.84,000 --> 0:12:13,000
was not easy work.

204
0:12:14.44,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But it was also pretty thrilling.

205
0:12:16.32,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Because as soon as we gave ourselves permission to dream,

206
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:24,000
those threads connecting much of our work became self-evident.

207
0:12:24.36,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We realized, for instance,

208
0:12:25.8,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that the bottomless quest for profits

209
0:12:28.4,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that is forcing so many people to work more than 50 hours a week,

210
0:12:32.68,000 --> 0:12:33,000
without security,

211
0:12:34.2,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and that is fueling this epidemic of despair

212
0:12:37.8,000 --> 0:12:41,000
is the same quest for bottomless profits and endless growth

213
0:12:42.48,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that is at the heart of our ecological crisis

214
0:12:45.84,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and is destabilizing our planet.

215
0:12:48.44,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It also became clear what we need to do.

216
0:12:51.68,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We need to create a culture of care-taking.

217
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
In which no one and nowhere is thrown away.

218
0:12:59.48,000 --> 0:13:04,000
In which the inherent value of all people and every ecosystem is foundational.

219
0:13:06.12,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So we came up with this people's platform,

220
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and don't worry, I'm not going to read the whole thing to you out loud --

221
0:13:11.64,000 --> 0:13:14,000
if you're interested, you can read it at theleap.org.

222
0:13:14.68,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But I will give you a taste of what we came up with.

223
0:13:18.08,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So we call for that 100 percent renewable economy in a hurry,

224
0:13:23.72,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but we went further.

225
0:13:25.4,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Calls for new kinds of trade deals,

226
0:13:27.72,000 --> 0:13:3,000
a robust debate on a guaranteed annual income,

227
0:13:30.8,000 --> 0:13:32,000
full rights for immigrant workers,

228
0:13:32.84,000 --> 0:13:34,000
getting corporate money out of politics,

229
0:13:35.12,000 --> 0:13:38,000
free universal day care, electoral reform and more.

230
0:13:39.76,000 --> 0:13:42,000
What we discovered is that a great many of us

231
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:49,000
are looking for permission to act less like brands and more like movements.

232
0:13:49.04,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Because movements don't care about credit.

233
0:13:51.44,000 --> 0:13:54,000
They want good ideas to spread far and wide.

234
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
What I love about The Leap

235
0:13:56.72,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is that it rejects the idea that there is this hierarchy of crisis,

236
0:14:00.52,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and it doesn't ask anyone to prioritize one struggle over another

237
0:14:04.96,000 --> 0:14:05,000
or wait their turn.

238
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And though it was birthed in Canada,

239
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
we've discovered that it travels well.

240
0:14:11.68,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Since we launched, The Leap has been picked up around the world

241
0:14:14.8,000 --> 0:14:15,000
with similar platforms,

242
0:14:16.48,000 --> 0:14:19,000
being written from Nunavut to Australia,

243
0:14:19.64,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to Norway to the UK and the US,

244
0:14:22.84,000 --> 0:14:25,000
where it's gaining a lot of traction in cities like Los Angeles,

245
0:14:25.88,000 --> 0:14:27,000
where it's being localized.

246
0:14:27.92,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And also in rural communities that are traditionally very conservative,

247
0:14:31.36,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but where politics is failing the vast majority of people.

248
0:14:37.24,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Here's what I've learned from studying shocks and disasters for two decades.

249
0:14:44.64,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Crises test us.

250
0:14:47.08,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We either fall apart or we grow up fast.

251
0:14:51.4,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Finding new reserves of strength and capacity that we never knew we had.

252
0:14:57.12,000 --> 0:14:59,000
The shocking events that fill us with dread today

253
0:15:00.12,000 --> 0:15:05,000
can transform us, and they can transform the world for the better.

254
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
But first we need to picture the world that we're fighting for.

255
0:15:10.12,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And we have to dream it up together.

256
0:15:13.8,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Right now, every alarm in our house is going off simultaneously.

257
0:15:19.36,000 --> 0:15:2,000
It's time to listen.

258
0:15:21.24,000 --> 0:15:22,000
It's time to leap.

259
0:15:23.04,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Thank you.

260
0:15:24.28,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Applause)

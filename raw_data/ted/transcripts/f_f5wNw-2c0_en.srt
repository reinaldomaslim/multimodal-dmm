Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:15.854,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think

3
0:00:19.079,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that two and a half billion of us around the world

4
0:00:21.677,000 --> 0:00:23,000
are connected to each other through the Internet

5
0:00:24.093,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that at any point in time

6
0:00:26.218,000 --> 0:00:28,000
more than 30 percent of the world's population

7
0:00:28.968,000 --> 0:00:33,000
can go online to learn, to create and to share.

8
0:00:34.083,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this

9
0:00:37.646,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is also continuing to go grow.

10
0:00:39.427,000 --> 0:00:4,000
A recent study showed

11
0:00:40.885,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that the young generation alone

12
0:00:42.385,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is spending over eight hours a day online.

13
0:00:45.656,000 --> 0:00:47,000
As the parent of a nine-year-old girl,

14
0:00:47.822,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that number seems awfully low.

15
0:00:50.035,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:51.385,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us,

17
0:00:55.458,000 --> 0:00:58,000
it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world.

18
0:00:59.133,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay

19
0:01:01.989,000 --> 0:01:02,000
for all of this connectedness

20
0:01:03.24,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is our privacy.

21
0:01:05.254,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Today, what many of us would love to believe

22
0:01:09.25,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is that the Internet is a private place; it's not.

23
0:01:12.255,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen,

24
0:01:15.34,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we are like Hansel and Gretel

25
0:01:17.69,000 --> 0:01:19,000
leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
everywhere we travel through the digital woods.

27
0:01:22.702,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence,

28
0:01:27.552,000 --> 0:01:29,000
our interests and preferences,

29
0:01:29.914,000 --> 0:01:31,000
our relationships,

30
0:01:32.003,000 --> 0:01:35,000
our financial histories, and on and on it goes.

31
0:01:35.764,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now don't get me wrong,

32
0:01:37.76,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.

33
0:01:41.247,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In fact, when I know the data that's being shared

34
0:01:43.625,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I'm asked explicitly for my consent,

35
0:01:46.385,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I want some sites to understand my habits.

36
0:01:48.802,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It helps them suggest books for me to read

37
0:01:51.2,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or movies for my family to watch

38
0:01:53.535,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or friends for us to connect with.

39
0:01:55.991,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked,

40
0:01:59.072,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that's when the problem arises.

41
0:02:01.668,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It's a phenomenon on the Internet today

42
0:02:03.385,000 --> 0:02:04,000
called behavioral tracking,

43
0:02:05.135,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and it is very big business.

44
0:02:06.802,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In fact, there's an entire industry formed

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
around following us through the digital woods

46
0:02:11.597,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and compiling a profile on each of us.

47
0:02:13.941,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And when all of that data is held,

48
0:02:15.856,000 --> 0:02:18,000
they can do almost whatever they want with it.

49
0:02:19.308,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is an area today that has very few regulations

50
0:02:22.677,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and even fewer rules.

51
0:02:24.427,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe,

52
0:02:28.01,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked.

53
0:02:32.135,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.

54
0:02:35.539,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion

55
0:02:39.245,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and it's an experimental browser add-on

56
0:02:42.718,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that you can install in your Firefox browser

57
0:02:44.885,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.

58
0:02:49.581,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The red dots you see up there

59
0:02:52.177,000 --> 0:02:53,000
are sites that are behavioral tracking

60
0:02:54.093,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that I have not navigated to, but are following me.

61
0:02:57.302,000 --> 0:03:,000
The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.

62
0:03:00.45,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me,

63
0:03:03.816,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but I have no idea who they are.

64
0:03:05.916,000 --> 0:03:07,000
All of them are connected, as you can see,

65
0:03:08.01,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to form a picture of me on the Web.

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And this is my profile.

67
0:03:11.802,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal.

68
0:03:15.212,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago

69
0:03:18.635,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day.

70
0:03:21.645,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now like most of you,

71
0:03:23.943,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I actually start my day going online and checking email.

72
0:03:27.564,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I then go to a news site, look for some headlines.

73
0:03:30.403,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And in this particular case I happened to like one of them

74
0:03:33.927,000 --> 0:03:36,000
on the merits of music literacy in schools

75
0:03:37.343,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I shared it over a social network.

76
0:03:39.593,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table,

77
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I asked her, "Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?"

78
0:03:46.51,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old,

79
0:03:48.51,000 --> 0:03:5,000
looked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?"

80
0:03:50.629,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So I sent her online, of course, to look it up.

81
0:03:54.385,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now let me stop here.

82
0:03:56.51,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We are not even two bites into breakfast

83
0:03:59.29,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me.

84
0:04:03.606,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I have navigated to a total of four.

85
0:04:06.864,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.

86
0:04:10.17,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I go to work, I check email,

87
0:04:12.451,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I log onto a few more social sites, I blog,

88
0:04:15.141,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I check more news reports, I share some of those news reports,

89
0:04:18.635,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I go look at some videos,

90
0:04:20.697,000 --> 0:04:24,000
pretty typical day -- in this case, actually fairly pedantic --

91
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and at the end of the day, as my day winds down,

92
0:04:28.302,000 --> 0:04:31,000
look at my profile.

93
0:04:31.343,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The red dots have exploded.

94
0:04:33.433,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The gray dots have grown exponentially.

95
0:04:36.039,000 --> 0:04:38,000
All in all, there's over 150 sites

96
0:04:38.579,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that are now tracking my personal information,

97
0:04:41.51,000 --> 0:04:43,000
most all of them without my consent.

98
0:04:44.352,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I look at this picture and it freaks me out.

99
0:04:47.599,000 --> 0:04:51,000
This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web.

100
0:04:52.081,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And why is this happening?

101
0:04:54.398,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Pretty simple -- it's huge business.

102
0:04:56.768,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space

103
0:04:59.343,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is over 39 billion dollars today.

104
0:05:01.718,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And as adults, we're certainly not alone.

105
0:05:04.641,000 --> 0:05:06,000
At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile,

106
0:05:07.635,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I installed one for my daughter.

107
0:05:10.968,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And on one single Saturday morning, over two hours on the Internet,

108
0:05:14.343,000 --> 0:05:17,000
here's her Collusion profile.

109
0:05:17.485,000 --> 0:05:19,000
This is a nine-year-old girl

110
0:05:20.38,000 --> 0:05:23,000
navigating to principally children's sites.

111
0:05:24.205,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I move from this, from freaked out to enraged.

112
0:05:27.677,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate;

113
0:05:32.387,000 --> 0:05:33,000
this is me being a parent.

114
0:05:33.987,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Imagine in the physical world

115
0:05:35.552,000 --> 0:05:38,000
if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook

116
0:05:38.839,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and recorded their every movement.

117
0:05:40.865,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I can tell you, there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by.

118
0:05:44.385,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.

119
0:05:47.81,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:49.156,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We can't sit idly by here either.

121
0:05:51.221,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is happening today.

122
0:05:53.279,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Privacy is not an option,

123
0:05:55.481,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and it shouldn't be the price we accept

124
0:05:57.322,000 --> 0:05:58,000
for just getting on the Internet.

125
0:05:59.028,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Our voices matter and our actions matter even more.

126
0:06:02.645,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Today we've launched Collusion.

127
0:06:05.718,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You can download it, install it in Firefox,

128
0:06:07.885,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to see who is tracking you across the Web

129
0:06:10.427,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and following you through the digital woods.

130
0:06:12.808,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard.

131
0:06:15.87,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Because what we don't know can actually hurt us.

132
0:06:19.01,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Because the memory of the Internet is forever.

133
0:06:21.635,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We are being watched.

134
0:06:23.314,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's now time for us to watch the watchers.

135
0:06:26.029,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Thank you.

136
0:06:27.126,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Applause)

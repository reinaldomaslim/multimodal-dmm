1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My name is Joshua Walters.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm a performer.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Beatboxing)

4
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Applause)

6
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But as far as being a performer,

7
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I'm also diagnosed

8
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
bipolar.

9
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I reframe that as a positive

10
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because the crazier I get onstage,

11
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the more entertaining I become.

12
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
When I was 16 in San Francisco,

13
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I had my breakthrough manic episode

14
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.

15
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Maybe you thought that was scary,

16
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take

17
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that can get you as high

18
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
as if you think you're Jesus Christ.

19
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I was sent to a place,

21
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a psych ward,

22
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and in the psych ward,

23
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
everyone is doing their own one-man show.

24
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
There's no audience like this

26
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to justify their rehearsal time.

27
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They're just practicing.

28
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
One day they'll get here.

29
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Now when I got out,

30
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I was diagnosed

31
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and I was given medications

32
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
by a psychiatrist.

33
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some --

34
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
why don't we give you some Zyprexa.

35
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Okay? Mmhmm?

36
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
At least that's what it says on my pen."

37
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Some of you are in the field, I can see.

39
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I can feel your noise.

40
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The first half of high school

41
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
was the struggle of the manic episode,

42
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the second half

43
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
was the overmedications of these drugs,

44
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
where I was sleeping through high school.

45
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.

46
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
When I got out

47
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I had a choice.

48
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I could either deny

49
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
my mental illness

50
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or embrace

51
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
my mental skillness.

52
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Bugle sound)

53
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There's a movement going on right now

54
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to reframe mental illness as a positive --

55
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
at least the hypomanic edge part of it.

56
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now if you don't know what hypomania is,

57
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it's like an engine that's out of control,

58
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.

59
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,

60
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
have that creative edge,

61
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
if you know what I'm talking about.

62
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You're driven to do something

63
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that everyone has told you is impossible.

64
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And there's a book -- John Gartner.

65
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge"

66
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs

67
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and all these business minds

68
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
have this edge to compete.

69
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
A different book was written not too long ago

70
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in the mid-90s

71
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
called "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamison

72
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in which it was looked at in a creative sense

73
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh

74
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
all have this manic depression that they were suffering with.

75
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Some of them committed suicide.

76
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So it wasn't all

77
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the good side of the illness.

78
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now recently,

79
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
there's been development in this field.

80
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And there was an article written in the New York Times,

81
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
September 2010,

82
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that stated:

83
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
"Just Manic Enough."

84
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Just be manic enough

85
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs

86
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that have this kind of spectrum --

87
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you know what I'm talking about --

88
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
not maybe full bipolar,

89
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but they're in the bipolar spectrum --

90
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
where on one side,

91
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
maybe you think you're Jesus,

92
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and on the other side

93
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
maybe they just make you a lot of money.

94
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Your call. Your call.

96
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And everyone's somewhere in the middle.

97
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Everyone's somewhere in the middle.

98
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So maybe, you know,

99
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
there's no such thing

100
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
as crazy,

101
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and being diagnosed with a mental illness

102
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
doesn't mean you're crazy.

103
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But maybe it just means

104
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you're more sensitive

105
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to what most people can't see

106
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
or feel.

107
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Maybe no one's really crazy.

108
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Everyone is just a little bit mad.

109
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
How much

110
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
depends on where you fall in the spectrum.

111
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
How much

112
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
depends on how lucky you are.

113
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Thank you.

114
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.695,000 --> 0:00:16,000
All right. So, like all good stories,

3
0:00:17.678,000 --> 0:00:18,000
this starts a long, long time ago

4
0:00:19.612,000 --> 0:00:21,000
when there was basically nothing.

5
0:00:21.761,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So here is a complete picture of the universe

6
0:00:24.161,000 --> 0:00:27,000
about 14-odd billion years ago.

7
0:00:27.613,000 --> 0:00:3,000
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.

8
0:00:30.697,000 --> 0:00:31,000
For some reason it explodes,

9
0:00:32.281,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and you begin to get these things.

10
0:00:34.397,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So you're now about 14 billion years into this.

11
0:00:37.263,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And these things expand and expand and expand

12
0:00:39.159,000 --> 0:00:4,000
into these giant galaxies,

13
0:00:40.858,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and you get trillions of them.

14
0:00:42.177,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And within these galaxies

15
0:00:44.325,000 --> 0:00:46,000
you get these enormous dust clouds.

16
0:00:46.444,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I want you to pay particular attention

17
0:00:48.209,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to the three little prongs

18
0:00:49.659,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in the center of this picture.

19
0:00:51.56,000 --> 0:00:52,000
If you take a close-up of those,

20
0:00:52.975,000 --> 0:00:53,000
they look like this.

21
0:00:54.628,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And what you're looking at is columns of dust

22
0:00:57.478,000 --> 0:00:59,000
where there's so much dust --

23
0:00:59.525,000 --> 0:01:03,000
by the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles --

24
0:01:03.858,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and what's happening is there's so much dust,

25
0:01:06.776,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it comes together and it fuses

26
0:01:08.71,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and ignites a thermonuclear reaction.

27
0:01:12.169,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And so what you're watching

28
0:01:13.011,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is the birth of stars.

29
0:01:14.996,000 --> 0:01:15,000
These are stars being born out of here.

30
0:01:16.653,000 --> 0:01:18,000
When enough stars come out,

31
0:01:19.121,000 --> 0:01:2,000
they create a galaxy.

32
0:01:20.919,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy,

33
0:01:24.353,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because you are here.

34
0:01:26.569,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:27.736,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And as you take a close-up of this galaxy,

36
0:01:29.387,000 --> 0:01:31,000
you find a relatively normal,

37
0:01:31.452,000 --> 0:01:33,000
not particularly interesting star.

38
0:01:33.82,000 --> 0:01:37,000
By the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story.

39
0:01:37.835,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So this star doesn't even appear

40
0:01:40.017,000 --> 0:01:42,000
until about two-thirds of the way into this story.

41
0:01:42.968,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And then what happens

42
0:01:44.046,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is there's enough dust left over

43
0:01:45.452,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that it doesn't ignite into a star,

44
0:01:47.418,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it becomes a planet.

45
0:01:49.418,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And this is about a little over four billion years ago.

46
0:01:54.243,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And soon thereafter

47
0:01:55.676,000 --> 0:01:56,000
there's enough material left over

48
0:01:57.593,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that you get a primordial soup,

49
0:02:02.156,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and that creates life.

50
0:02:03.92,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And life starts to expand and expand and expand,

51
0:02:07.801,000 --> 0:02:08,000
until it goes kaput.

52
0:02:09.552,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:13.04,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now the really strange thing

54
0:02:14.47,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is life goes kaput, not once, not twice,

55
0:02:17.376,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but five times.

56
0:02:19.592,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So almost all life on Earth

57
0:02:21.694,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is wiped out about five times.

58
0:02:24.158,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And as you're thinking about that,

59
0:02:25.71,000 --> 0:02:27,000
what happens is you get more and more complexity,

60
0:02:28.142,000 --> 0:02:29,000
more and more stuff

61
0:02:29.376,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to build new things with.

62
0:02:33.494,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And we don't appear

63
0:02:34.764,000 --> 0:02:39,000
until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story,

64
0:02:40.412,000 --> 0:02:43,000
just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective.

65
0:02:44.342,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So within that context, there's two theories of the case

66
0:02:47.801,000 --> 0:02:48,000
as to why we're all here.

67
0:02:49.49,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The first theory of the case

68
0:02:51.079,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is that's all she wrote.

69
0:02:54.488,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Under that theory,

70
0:02:55.847,000 --> 0:02:56,000
we are the be-all and end-all

71
0:02:57.683,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of all creation.

72
0:02:59.416,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the reason for trillions of galaxies,

73
0:03:02.3,000 --> 0:03:04,000
sextillions of planets,

74
0:03:04.313,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is to create something that looks like that

75
0:03:09.023,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and something that looks like that.

76
0:03:12.656,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And that's the purpose of the universe;

77
0:03:14.197,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and then it flat-lines,

78
0:03:15.481,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it doesn't get any better.

79
0:03:16.792,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:21.272,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The only question you might want to ask yourself is,

81
0:03:24.091,000 --> 0:03:29,000
could that be just mildly arrogant?

82
0:03:29.326,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And if it is --

83
0:03:31.067,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction.

84
0:03:36.449,000 --> 0:03:39,000
There were only about 2,000 of our species left.

85
0:03:39.816,000 --> 0:03:41,000
A few more weeks without rain,

86
0:03:41.899,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we would have never seen any of these.

87
0:03:44.983,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:51.682,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

89
0:03:56.316,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So maybe you have to think about a second theory

90
0:03:59.282,000 --> 0:04:01,000
if the first one isn't good enough.

91
0:04:02.199,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Second theory is: Could we upgrade?

92
0:04:03.983,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:06.882,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Well, why would one ask a question like that?

94
0:04:10.116,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Because there have been at least 29 upgrades so far

95
0:04:12.581,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of humanoids.

96
0:04:14.617,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So it turns out that we have upgraded.

97
0:04:17.467,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We've upgraded time and again and again.

98
0:04:19.382,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades.

99
0:04:22.298,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We found this one last year.

100
0:04:24.482,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We found another one last month.

101
0:04:27.099,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And as you're thinking about this,

102
0:04:29.298,000 --> 0:04:31,000
you might also ask the question:

103
0:04:31.401,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So why a single human species?

104
0:04:34.498,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Wouldn't it be really odd

105
0:04:36.332,000 --> 0:04:39,000
if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica

106
0:04:40.116,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and found exactly the same bird --

107
0:04:42.735,000 --> 0:04:45,000
particularly given that we co-existed at the same time

108
0:04:46.527,000 --> 0:04:48,000
with at least eight other versions of humanoid

109
0:04:49.313,000 --> 0:04:51,000
at the same time on this planet?

110
0:04:51.781,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So the normal state of affairs

111
0:04:53.66,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is not to have just a Homo sapiens;

112
0:04:56.17,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the normal state of affairs

113
0:04:57.191,000 --> 0:05:,000
is to have various versions of humans walking around.

114
0:05:01.02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And if that is the normal state of affairs,

115
0:05:03.837,000 --> 0:05:05,000
then you might ask yourself,

116
0:05:06.205,000 --> 0:05:08,000
all right, so if we want to create something else,

117
0:05:08.27,000 --> 0:05:1,000
how big does a mutation have to be?

118
0:05:11.138,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Well Svante Paabo has the answer.

119
0:05:13.77,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The difference between humans and Neanderthal

120
0:05:16.57,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is 0.004 percent of gene code.

121
0:05:19.869,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's how big the difference is

122
0:05:21.569,000 --> 0:05:23,000
one species to another.

123
0:05:23.786,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This explains most contemporary political debates.

124
0:05:28.186,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:30.121,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But as you're thinking about this,

126
0:05:33.332,000 --> 0:05:34,000
one of the interesting things

127
0:05:34.69,000 --> 0:05:37,000
is how small these mutations are and where they take place.

128
0:05:38.087,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Difference human/Neanderthal

129
0:05:39.42,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is sperm and testis,

130
0:05:41.153,000 --> 0:05:42,000
smell and skin.

131
0:05:42.521,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And those are the specific genes

132
0:05:44.007,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that differ from one to the other.

133
0:05:46.687,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So very small changes can have a big impact.

134
0:05:49.788,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And as you're thinking about this,

135
0:05:51.42,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we're continuing to mutate.

136
0:05:53.936,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea,

137
0:05:56.837,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we had one mutation in one gene

138
0:05:58.897,000 --> 0:06:,000
which led to blue eyes.

139
0:06:01.453,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And this is continuing and continuing and continuing.

140
0:06:05.337,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And as it continues,

141
0:06:06.771,000 --> 0:06:07,000
one of the things that's going to happen this year

142
0:06:08.536,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,

143
0:06:11.869,000 --> 0:06:14,000
because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing.

144
0:06:15.138,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And when we find these,

145
0:06:16.726,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we may find differences.

146
0:06:19.22,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for,

147
0:06:22.296,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because we have really misused the science in this.

148
0:06:25.672,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people.

149
0:06:29.355,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That was partly based on Francis Galton's work.

150
0:06:33.153,000 --> 0:06:35,000
He was Darwin's cousin.

151
0:06:35.289,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,

152
0:06:37.604,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Stanford, American Neurological Association

153
0:06:40.186,000 --> 0:06:41,000
took this really far.

154
0:06:42.054,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That got exported and was really misused.

155
0:06:45.653,000 --> 0:06:47,000
In fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous

156
0:06:48.338,000 --> 0:06:5,000
treatment of human beings.

157
0:06:50.351,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So since the 1940s, we've been saying there are no differences,

158
0:06:52.945,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we're all identical.

159
0:06:54.265,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We're going to know at year end if that is true.

160
0:06:57.542,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And as we think about that,

161
0:06:59.274,000 --> 0:07:,000
we're actually beginning to find things

162
0:07:00.792,000 --> 0:07:03,000
like, do you have an ACE gene?

163
0:07:04.258,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Why would that matter?

164
0:07:06.236,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Because nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen

165
0:07:10.274,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that doesn't have an ACE gene.

166
0:07:13.024,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And if you want to get more specific,

167
0:07:14.893,000 --> 0:07:17,000
how about a 577R genotype?

168
0:07:17.908,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested

169
0:07:22.608,000 --> 0:07:25,000
carries at least one of these variants.

170
0:07:25.858,000 --> 0:07:26,000
If that is true,

171
0:07:27.512,000 --> 0:07:29,000
it leads to some very complicated questions

172
0:07:29.67,000 --> 0:07:3,000
for the London Olympics.

173
0:07:31.471,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Three options:

174
0:07:32.99,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase

175
0:07:35.822,000 --> 0:07:37,000
for really hardworking mutants?

176
0:07:38.522,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:40.255,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Option number two:

178
0:07:42.99,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Why don't we play it like golf or sailing?

179
0:07:46.388,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Because you have one and you don't have one,

180
0:07:48.862,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I'll give you a tenth of a second head start.

181
0:07:52.857,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Version number three:

182
0:07:53.928,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Because this is a naturally occurring gene

183
0:07:55.997,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents,

184
0:07:58.779,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you get the right to upgrade.

185
0:08:02.728,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Three different options.

186
0:08:04.479,000 --> 0:08:05,000
If these differences are the difference

187
0:08:06.101,000 --> 0:08:09,000
between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal.

188
0:08:09.479,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And it turns out that as we discover these things,

189
0:08:12.313,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we human beings really like to change

190
0:08:15.648,000 --> 0:08:16,000
how we look, how we act,

191
0:08:17.342,000 --> 0:08:18,000
what our bodies do.

192
0:08:18.936,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,

193
0:08:23.31,000 --> 0:08:26,000
except that with the technologies that are coming online today,

194
0:08:26.627,000 --> 0:08:28,000
today's corrections, deletions,

195
0:08:29.328,000 --> 0:08:3,000
augmentations and enhancements

196
0:08:31.247,000 --> 0:08:33,000
are going to seem like child's play.

197
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,

198
0:08:37.861,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but this ability to start filling

199
0:08:41.428,000 --> 0:08:43,000
things like inkjet cartridges with cells

200
0:08:44.361,000 --> 0:08:48,000
are allowing us to print skin, organs

201
0:08:49.035,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and a whole series of other body parts.

202
0:08:51.785,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And as these technologies go forward,

203
0:08:53.669,000 --> 0:08:56,000
you keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things --

204
0:08:57.453,000 --> 0:08:59,000
2000, human genome sequence --

205
0:09:00.227,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and it seems like nothing's happening,

206
0:09:04.009,000 --> 0:09:07,000
until it does.

207
0:09:07.121,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And we may just be in some of these weeks.

208
0:09:10.645,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And as you're thinking about

209
0:09:12.244,000 --> 0:09:15,000
these two guys sequencing a human genome in 2000

210
0:09:15.695,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in 2000,

211
0:09:19.248,000 --> 0:09:22,000
then you don't hear a lot,

212
0:09:22.412,000 --> 0:09:25,000
until you hear about an experiment last year in China,

213
0:09:26.396,000 --> 0:09:3,000
where they take skin cells from this mouse,

214
0:09:30.413,000 --> 0:09:31,000
put four chemicals on it,

215
0:09:32.146,000 --> 0:09:35,000
turn those skin cells into stem cells,

216
0:09:35.712,000 --> 0:09:36,000
let the stem cells grow

217
0:09:37.177,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and create a full copy of that mouse.

218
0:09:40.264,000 --> 0:09:43,000
That's a big deal.

219
0:09:43.511,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Because in essence

220
0:09:44.527,000 --> 0:09:46,000
what it means is you can take a cell,

221
0:09:46.675,000 --> 0:09:48,000
which is a pluripotent stem cell,

222
0:09:48.961,000 --> 0:09:5,000
which is like a skier at the top of a mountain,

223
0:09:51.645,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,

224
0:09:55.462,000 --> 0:09:56,000
four, eight, 16,

225
0:09:57.244,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and then it gets so crowded

226
0:09:58.912,000 --> 0:09:59,000
after 16 divisions

227
0:10:00.712,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that those cells have to differentiate.

228
0:10:03.214,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So they go down one side of the mountain,

229
0:10:04.647,000 --> 0:10:05,000
they go down another.

230
0:10:05.88,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And as they pick that,

231
0:10:07.414,000 --> 0:10:09,000
these become bone,

232
0:10:09.664,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and then they pick another road and these become platelets,

233
0:10:12.596,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and these become macrophages,

234
0:10:14.713,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and these become T cells.

235
0:10:15.98,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But it's really hard, once you ski down,

236
0:10:17.932,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to get back up.

237
0:10:19.455,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.

238
0:10:24.867,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And what those four chemicals do

239
0:10:27.316,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is they take any cell

240
0:10:29.385,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and take it way back up the mountain

241
0:10:31.317,000 --> 0:10:33,000
so it can become any body part.

242
0:10:33.35,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And as you think of that,

243
0:10:35.078,000 --> 0:10:36,000
what it means is potentially

244
0:10:37.058,000 --> 0:10:39,000
you can rebuild a full copy

245
0:10:39.233,000 --> 0:10:4,000
of any organism

246
0:10:41.1,000 --> 0:10:43,000
out of any one of its cells.

247
0:10:43.686,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That turns out to be a big deal

248
0:10:46.217,000 --> 0:10:48,000
because now you can take, not just mouse cells,

249
0:10:48.783,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but you can human skin cells

250
0:10:51.101,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and turn them into human stem cells.

251
0:10:54.751,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And then what they did in October

252
0:10:57.949,000 --> 0:11:,000
is they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells

253
0:11:01.349,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and began to turn them into liver cells.

254
0:11:05.022,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So in theory,

255
0:11:06.066,000 --> 0:11:11,000
you could grow any organ from any one of your cells.

256
0:11:11.25,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Here's a second experiment:

257
0:11:12.968,000 --> 0:11:15,000
If you could photocopy your body,

258
0:11:16.101,000 --> 0:11:19,000
maybe you also want to take your mind.

259
0:11:19.153,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And one of the things you saw at TED

260
0:11:20.718,000 --> 0:11:21,000
about a year and a half ago

261
0:11:21.968,000 --> 0:11:22,000
was this guy.

262
0:11:23.403,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And he gave a wonderful technical talk.

263
0:11:26.003,000 --> 0:11:27,000
He's a professor at MIT.

264
0:11:27.602,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But in essence what he said

265
0:11:29.518,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is you can take retroviruses,

266
0:11:31.218,000 --> 0:11:33,000
which get inside brain cells of mice.

267
0:11:34.018,000 --> 0:11:36,000
You can tag them with proteins

268
0:11:36.458,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that light up when you light them.

269
0:11:38.552,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And you can map the exact pathways

270
0:11:42.268,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when a mouse sees, feels, touches,

271
0:11:45.751,000 --> 0:11:47,000
remembers, loves.

272
0:11:47.934,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And then you can take a fiber optic cable

273
0:11:50.307,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and light up some of the same things.

274
0:11:54.126,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And by the way, as you do this,

275
0:11:55.958,000 --> 0:11:57,000
you can image it in two colors,

276
0:11:57.975,000 --> 0:11:59,000
which means you can download this information

277
0:12:00.374,000 --> 0:12:04,000
as binary code directly into a computer.

278
0:12:05.114,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So what's the bottom line on that?

279
0:12:07.587,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Well it's not completely inconceivable

280
0:12:09.787,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that someday you'll be able to download your own memories,

281
0:12:14.282,000 --> 0:12:16,000
maybe into a new body.

282
0:12:16.669,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well.

283
0:12:21.754,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And this might have just one or two

284
0:12:24.268,000 --> 0:12:27,000
small ethical, political, moral implications.

285
0:12:27.788,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

286
0:12:29.319,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Just a thought.

287
0:12:32.31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Here's the kind of questions

288
0:12:33.838,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that are becoming interesting questions

289
0:12:35.818,000 --> 0:12:37,000
for philosophers, for governing people,

290
0:12:38.302,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for economists, for scientists.

291
0:12:41.668,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Because these technologies are moving really quickly.

292
0:12:44.952,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And as you think about it,

293
0:12:46.452,000 --> 0:12:49,000
let me close with an example of the brain.

294
0:12:49.534,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The first place where you would expect

295
0:12:51.217,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to see enormous evolutionary pressure today,

296
0:12:54.268,000 --> 0:12:56,000
both because of the inputs,

297
0:12:56.533,000 --> 0:12:57,000
which are becoming massive,

298
0:12:58.085,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and because of the plasticity of the organ,

299
0:12:59.867,000 --> 0:13:01,000
is the brain.

300
0:13:02.401,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Do we have any evidence that that is happening?

301
0:13:05.719,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand.

302
0:13:10.45,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Here's what it looks like in 2000.

303
0:13:12.952,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Here's what it looks like in 2002,

304
0:13:15.034,000 --> 0:13:19,000
2006, 2008.

305
0:13:19.652,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Here's the increase in less than a decade.

306
0:13:23.734,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And we still don't know why this is happening.

307
0:13:28.151,000 --> 0:13:3,000
What we do know is, potentially,

308
0:13:30.636,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the brain is reacting in

309
0:13:32.668,000 --> 0:13:34,000
a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,

310
0:13:34.802,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and creating individuals that are like this.

311
0:13:37.752,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And this is only one of the conditions that's out there.

312
0:13:40.509,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,

313
0:13:44.049,000 --> 0:13:46,000
people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives,

314
0:13:46.446,000 --> 0:13:47,000
people who've got synesthesia,

315
0:13:47.831,000 --> 0:13:48,000
people who've got schizophrenia.

316
0:13:49.162,000 --> 0:13:51,000
You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there,

317
0:13:51.696,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and we still don't understand

318
0:13:52.914,000 --> 0:13:54,000
how and why this is happening.

319
0:13:55.147,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But one question you might want to ask is,

320
0:13:57.829,000 --> 0:13:59,000
are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain

321
0:14:00.457,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and of how we process data?

322
0:14:02.282,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains,

323
0:14:05.345,000 --> 0:14:08,000
we're trying to take in as much data in a day

324
0:14:08.829,000 --> 0:14:1,000
as people used to take in in a lifetime.

325
0:14:11.38,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And as you're thinking about this,

326
0:14:14.012,000 --> 0:14:16,000
there's four theories as to why this might be going on,

327
0:14:16.354,000 --> 0:14:17,000
plus a whole series of others.

328
0:14:17.681,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I don't have a good answer.

329
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
There really needs to be more research on this.

330
0:14:22.946,000 --> 0:14:24,000
One option is the fast food fetish.

331
0:14:25.181,000 --> 0:14:27,000
There's beginning to be some evidence

332
0:14:27.63,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that obesity and diet

333
0:14:29.881,000 --> 0:14:3,000
have something to do

334
0:14:31.512,000 --> 0:14:32,000
with gene modifications,

335
0:14:33.28,000 --> 0:14:35,000
which may or may not have an impact

336
0:14:35.63,000 --> 0:14:38,000
on how the brain of an infant works.

337
0:14:39.147,000 --> 0:14:42,000
A second option is the sexy geek option.

338
0:14:43.102,000 --> 0:14:47,000
These conditions are highly rare.

339
0:14:47.345,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Laughter)

340
0:14:50.383,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Applause)

341
0:14:55.683,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But what's beginning to happen

342
0:14:57.316,000 --> 0:14:59,000
is because these geeks are all getting together,

343
0:14:59.85,000 --> 0:15:01,000
because they are highly qualified for computer programming

344
0:15:02.747,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and it is highly remunerated,

345
0:15:05.065,000 --> 0:15:08,000
as well as other very detail-oriented tasks,

346
0:15:08.215,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that they are concentrating geographically

347
0:15:10.664,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and finding like-minded mates.

348
0:15:13.631,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So this is the assortative mating hypothesis

349
0:15:17.199,000 --> 0:15:19,000
of these genes reinforcing one another

350
0:15:19.899,000 --> 0:15:21,000
in these structures.

351
0:15:22.016,000 --> 0:15:24,000
The third, is this too much information?

352
0:15:24.966,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We're trying to process so much stuff

353
0:15:26.463,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that some people get synesthetic

354
0:15:28.815,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and just have huge pipes that remember everything.

355
0:15:31.415,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Other people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information.

356
0:15:34.084,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Other people react with various psychological conditions

357
0:15:38.066,000 --> 0:15:39,000
or reactions to this information.

358
0:15:39.698,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Or maybe it's chemicals.

359
0:15:42.4,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But when you see an increase

360
0:15:44.165,000 --> 0:15:46,000
of that order of magnitude in a condition,

361
0:15:46.516,000 --> 0:15:47,000
either you're not measuring it right

362
0:15:48.081,000 --> 0:15:5,000
or there's something going on very quickly,

363
0:15:50.599,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and it may be evolution in real time.

364
0:15:54.631,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Here's the bottom line.

365
0:15:57.134,000 --> 0:15:59,000
What I think we are doing

366
0:15:59.315,000 --> 0:16:,000
is we're transitioning as a species.

367
0:16:01.031,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together.

368
0:16:06.515,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis

369
0:16:08.966,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that, for better or worse,

370
0:16:10.365,000 --> 0:16:14,000
is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment,

371
0:16:14.547,000 --> 0:16:17,000
it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately

372
0:16:17.766,000 --> 0:16:2,000
control the evolution of its own species,

373
0:16:20.964,000 --> 0:16:23,000
of bacteria, of plants, of animals.

374
0:16:24.798,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And I think that's such an order of magnitude change

375
0:16:27.633,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that your grandkids or your great-grandkids

376
0:16:30.736,000 --> 0:16:33,000
may be a species very different from you.

377
0:16:33.781,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Thank you very much.

378
0:16:35.367,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Applause)

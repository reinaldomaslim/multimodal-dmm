1
0:00:13.952,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello, friends.

2
0:00:15.667,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm happy to see all of you here today.

3
0:00:18.746,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is actually exactly what I say to the people who visit us

4
0:00:21.913,000 --> 0:00:22,000
at the La Crosse Public Library.

5
0:00:23.795,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I say it because I mean it.

6
0:00:26.668,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The children who come into our library are my friends

7
0:00:29.635,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in that I care about their needs and their futures.

8
0:00:32.779,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I want them to be happy and successful.

9
0:00:35.509,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I hope that they'll find great books or a movie that delights them.

10
0:00:39.699,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Or the solution to a tricky problem.

11
0:00:43.39,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Libraries in general have this wonderful reputation

12
0:00:46.186,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of really caring about our communities.

13
0:00:48.696,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We put out mission statements and statements of purpose

14
0:00:51.66,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that say that we connect our community to the broader world.

15
0:00:55.71,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We engage minds,

16
0:00:58.075,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we create lifelong learners.

17
0:01:01.488,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And these ideals are really important to us as libraries,

18
0:01:04.249,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because we know the power they have to create a better world.

19
0:01:08.434,000 --> 0:01:12,000
A more connected world, a more engaged and empathetic world.

20
0:01:14.224,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Books have power, information has power.

21
0:01:16.922,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And for the powerless in our communities,

22
0:01:19.176,000 --> 0:01:22,000
being able to connect to that is even more important.

23
0:01:23.069,000 --> 0:01:25,000
In 1995, Betty Hart and Todd Risley

24
0:01:26.069,000 --> 0:01:28,000
published a study that found that working class families

25
0:01:28.736,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and those being served by welfare

26
0:01:30.724,000 --> 0:01:34,000
experience what we now refer to as the "30 million word gap."

27
0:01:35.947,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Essentially, what they learned is that children in these families

28
0:01:39.581,000 --> 0:01:41,000
are hearing so many fewer words each day

29
0:01:42.59,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that by the time they are three years old,

30
0:01:44.8,000 --> 0:01:47,000
there's this enormous disparity in their learned language.

31
0:01:48.569,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And that gap in words follows them as they enter school,

32
0:01:51.289,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and it results in later reading, poorer reading skills,

33
0:01:55.284,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a lack of success overall.

34
0:01:58.625,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Children need to hear words every day

35
0:02:00.569,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and they need to hear not just our day-to-day conversation,

36
0:02:03.363,000 --> 0:02:04,000
they have to hear rare words:

37
0:02:05.125,000 --> 0:02:08,000
those outside the common lexicon we share, of around 10,000.

38
0:02:09.887,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I'm going to read you a short snippet from a children's book

39
0:02:13.379,000 --> 0:02:16,000
by one of our favorite authors in the children's room, Eric Carle.

40
0:02:16.527,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Some of you might know his work "The Very Hungry Caterpillar."

41
0:02:19.568,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But this is from "'Slowly, Slowly, Slowly,' said the Sloth."

42
0:02:25.288,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"Finally, the sloth replied,

43
0:02:27.439,000 --> 0:02:3,000
'It is true that I am slow, quiet and boring.

44
0:02:31.177,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I am lackadaisical,

45
0:02:32.733,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I dawdle and I dillydally.

46
0:02:35.21,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I am also unflappable, languid, stoic,

47
0:02:38.48,000 --> 0:02:41,000
impassive, sluggish, lethargic,

48
0:02:41.528,000 --> 0:02:44,000
placid, calm, mellow,

49
0:02:44.665,000 --> 0:02:46,000
laid-back and, well, slothful!

50
0:02:47.823,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I am relaxed and tranquil, and I like to live in peace.

51
0:02:52.03,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But I am not lazy.'

52
0:02:54.282,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Then the sloth yawned and said,

53
0:02:56.672,000 --> 0:02:57,000
'That's just how I am.

54
0:02:58.472,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I like to do things slowly, slowly, slowly.'"

55
0:03:04.085,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So you can see from this very brief example from one book in our library

56
0:03:09.117,000 --> 0:03:13,000
how Eric Carle used 20 different words to get the same idea across to children.

57
0:03:15.474,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now we know that a lot of the families visiting us at the library,

58
0:03:19.109,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a lot of our friends, are struggling financially.

59
0:03:23.124,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We know that some of them are living in poverty,

60
0:03:25.847,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and don't have enough to eat or anywhere safe to live.

61
0:03:29.022,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We know that our friend James, who comes in after school

62
0:03:31.697,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and is staying at a local shelter,

63
0:03:33.411,000 --> 0:03:34,000
isn't reading at grade level

64
0:03:34.784,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and has probably never read at grade level.

65
0:03:37.419,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We know we have that 30 million word gap

66
0:03:39.712,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and a corresponding achievement gap by the time kids enter the third grade,

67
0:03:43.809,000 --> 0:03:46,000
both of which directly correlate to income level.

68
0:03:47.737,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So what's the responsibility of libraries in addressing these gaps?

69
0:03:51.57,000 --> 0:03:54,000
How can we help our friends be more successful, more educated

70
0:03:55.56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and some day, better global citizens?

71
0:03:58.813,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It starts with ensuring free and equitable access

72
0:04:02.052,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to everything libraries offer them.

73
0:04:04.894,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Books level the playing field

74
0:04:06.662,000 --> 0:04:09,000
by exposing children of every socioeconomic background to words.

75
0:04:11.482,000 --> 0:04:12,000
At the library, we provide programs

76
0:04:13.24,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that are based on the five tenants of early literacy:

77
0:04:15.746,000 --> 0:04:17,000
playing, singing, talking, reading and writing.

78
0:04:18.936,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We offer programs for adults

79
0:04:20.611,000 --> 0:04:22,000
on computer classes and job-skills training.

80
0:04:24.603,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Business start-ups.

81
0:04:26.703,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We do all of this great work for our community members

82
0:04:29.998,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and at the same time, we counteract it by charging fines and fees of our patrons.

83
0:04:35.895,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Today in La Crosse,

84
0:04:37.784,000 --> 0:04:4,000
10,000 of our users are unable to check out library materials

85
0:04:41.016,000 --> 0:04:42,000
because of fines and fees.

86
0:04:43.911,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If we narrow in on our neighborhoods experiencing the most poverty,

87
0:04:47.991,000 --> 0:04:51,000
those where 82 percent of the student body is considered economically disadvantaged,

88
0:04:52.411,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the number rises to 23 percent of the neighborhood.

89
0:04:56.046,000 --> 0:05:,000
And these are local numbers, it's true, but they hold true nationwide.

90
0:05:00.882,000 --> 0:05:02,000
In libraries across the country that charge fines,

91
0:05:03.558,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the poorest neighborhoods have the most number of people blocked from use.

92
0:05:09.439,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In fact, the Colorado State Library was so worried about this,

93
0:05:12.375,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they published a white paper

94
0:05:14.217,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and they stated unequivocally

95
0:05:15.749,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that it's the fear of fines that keeps poor families out of libraries.

96
0:05:21.079,000 --> 0:05:24,000
A colleague of mine took a ride in a Lyft in Atlanta last year,

97
0:05:24.809,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and he started chatting with his driver about libraries, as we do.

98
0:05:28.976,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And she told him she grew up visiting her local library, she loved it.

99
0:05:33.578,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But now that she's a parent with three children of her own,

100
0:05:36.483,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there's no way she would allow them to get a library card,

101
0:05:39.322,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because of the strict deadlines libraries impose.

102
0:05:42.331,000 --> 0:05:45,000
She said, "It would be like another credit card that I can't pay."

103
0:05:46.585,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Meanwhile, when other libraries have experimented with eliminating fines,

104
0:05:50.957,000 --> 0:05:54,000
like one in San Rafael that took away children's fines,

105
0:05:55.147,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they had a 126-percent increase in child card applications

106
0:05:59.361,000 --> 0:06:,000
within the first few months.

107
0:06:01.601,000 --> 0:06:03,000
When people aren't afraid of the fines they might accrue,

108
0:06:04.585,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they line up to access what we have to offer.

109
0:06:08.823,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So what are we telling people, then?

110
0:06:10.975,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We have these two disparate ideas.

111
0:06:13.332,000 --> 0:06:16,000
On the one hand, we're champions of democracy

112
0:06:16.658,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and we claim that we're there so that every citizen can educate themselves.

113
0:06:22.532,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We're advocates for the power early literacy has

114
0:06:24.838,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to reduce that achievement gap and eliminate the word gap.

115
0:06:29.215,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We tell people, "We're here to help you."

116
0:06:32.553,000 --> 0:06:33,000
On the other hand,

117
0:06:33.974,000 --> 0:06:35,000
if you're struggling financially, and you make a mistake,

118
0:06:36.887,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the kind of mistake that anyone in this room could make --

119
0:06:39.807,000 --> 0:06:42,000
your tote bag that belongs to the library sits by your back door

120
0:06:43.736,000 --> 0:06:45,000
for a couple of weeks longer than it should,

121
0:06:46.752,000 --> 0:06:48,000
you lose a CD,

122
0:06:48.784,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you spill your coffee on a book,

123
0:06:51.284,000 --> 0:06:53,000
suddenly, we're not here for you so much anymore,

124
0:06:53.686,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because if that happens, we're going to make you pay for it.

125
0:06:57.407,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And if you can't pay for it, you're out of luck.

126
0:07:01.137,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I have been a librarian for a lot of years.

127
0:07:03.708,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And in the past few years,

128
0:07:06.101,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I myself have paid over 500 dollars in late fines.

129
0:07:11.403,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now, you might wonder why,

130
0:07:12.719,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I mean, I'm there every day, and I certainly know how the system works.

131
0:07:16.757,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But like all of our friends at the library,

132
0:07:20.376,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I am busy, I lose track of things,

133
0:07:23.527,000 --> 0:07:25,000
my house is sometimes messy,

134
0:07:25.958,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and I have lost a DVD or two under the sofa.

135
0:07:31.236,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And I have been fortunate enough to be able to pay

136
0:07:35.3,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that 500 dollars over the last several years.

137
0:07:38.085,000 --> 0:07:41,000
If not happily, I at least had the means to do it.

138
0:07:42.069,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So is that fair and equitable service

139
0:07:44.522,000 --> 0:07:49,000
if some of us can pay our fines and continue to operate as we always have,

140
0:07:50.402,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and others of us make one mistake and no longer are welcome back?

141
0:07:56.244,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's simply not.

142
0:08:00.141,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now, why would we continue to operate under a model that hurts

143
0:08:04.935,000 --> 0:08:06,000
our most vulnerable patrons the most?

144
0:08:07.594,000 --> 0:08:08,000
There are reasons.

145
0:08:09.276,000 --> 0:08:11,000
There are reasons like responsibility.

146
0:08:11.387,000 --> 0:08:12,000
There are some libraries that really feel

147
0:08:13.377,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that it's our job to teach people responsibility.

148
0:08:16.243,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And they haven't figured out that there might be ways to do that

149
0:08:19.284,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that don't equate to dollars.

150
0:08:21.664,000 --> 0:08:24,000
There's also this idea that we share the resources collectively in a community,

151
0:08:25.458,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and so we have to take turns.

152
0:08:27.417,000 --> 0:08:3,000
If I keep my "My Little Pony" movie for too long,

153
0:08:30.855,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and somebody else wants to watch it, it's not fair.

154
0:08:34.395,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And then, there's the money.

155
0:08:36.18,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Community members often love their libraries,

156
0:08:38.694,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and they don't want us to not be able to sustain the services we offer.

157
0:08:44.773,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Luckily, we can address all of these things in a variety of ways

158
0:08:48.212,000 --> 0:08:51,000
without scaring away our most vulnerable populations.

159
0:08:52.244,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Some libraries have gone to a Netflix model.

160
0:08:55.727,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You might be familiar with this:

161
0:08:57.308,000 --> 0:08:58,000
you check things out,

162
0:08:58.728,000 --> 0:09:,000
when you're done with them, you return them.

163
0:09:01.704,000 --> 0:09:04,000
If you don't return them, you can't check more things out,

164
0:09:04.851,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but once you do, it's all forgiven, it's fine.

165
0:09:08.954,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You can check out again.

166
0:09:10.819,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Others continue to charge fines,

167
0:09:12.699,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but they want to offer alternatives to their library patrons,

168
0:09:15.601,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and so they do things like food for fines, where you bring in canned goods,

169
0:09:19.305,000 --> 0:09:22,000
or read away your fines, where you can read off your fines.

170
0:09:22.419,000 --> 0:09:23,000
There's even another library in Wisconsin

171
0:09:24.411,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that offers scratch-off tickets at their counter,

172
0:09:26.758,000 --> 0:09:3,000
so you can scratch off and get 10 or 20 percent off your fines that day.

173
0:09:30.959,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And there are amnesty days.

174
0:09:32.893,000 --> 0:09:34,000
One day a year, you bring back your late materials

175
0:09:35.768,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and all is forgiven.

176
0:09:38.664,000 --> 0:09:41,000
There was a library in San Francisco that did an amnesty day last year,

177
0:09:42.315,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and they welcomed back 5,000 users who had been blocked.

178
0:09:46.585,000 --> 0:09:5,000
That same day, they received more than 700,000 items that were overdue.

179
0:09:52.392,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Among them was one book that was 100 years overdue.

180
0:09:56.377,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So I know that sounds ridiculous, but I know from experience

181
0:09:59.988,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that people will stay away from the library

182
0:10:02.324,000 --> 0:10:04,000
rather than face the authority of the librarian

183
0:10:04.585,000 --> 0:10:05,000
when they have late items.

184
0:10:06.521,000 --> 0:10:09,000
As Michael might have mentioned, I've been a librarian for 15 years

185
0:10:09.903,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and my mom hasn't been in a library in decades,

186
0:10:12.601,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because when she was young, she lost a book.

187
0:10:18.006,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So, these are great baby steps.

188
0:10:20.879,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But they don't go far enough,

189
0:10:23.276,000 --> 0:10:27,000
because they make people jump through hoops.

190
0:10:28.134,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They have to come on the right days, at the right times.

191
0:10:30.791,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They might have to have extra food to share.

192
0:10:33.856,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They want to read away their fines, they need to be literate.

193
0:10:37.847,000 --> 0:10:39,000
If we want people to use the library again,

194
0:10:41.879,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we should just get rid of fines altogether.

195
0:10:46.236,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Now, you might think I've forgotten a money piece,

196
0:10:48.615,000 --> 0:10:5,000
where we need to finance libraries, right?

197
0:10:51.752,000 --> 0:10:53,000
But there's a couple of things to consider

198
0:10:53.791,000 --> 0:10:57,000
when we think about how fines function in library budgets.

199
0:10:59.379,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The first is that fines have never been a stable source of revenue.

200
0:11:04.396,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They've always fluctuated,

201
0:11:06.157,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and in fact, they've continued to go down over the last few decades.

202
0:11:11.661,000 --> 0:11:14,000
When the recession hit, especially, people's ability to pay was hit, as well.

203
0:11:15.844,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So for a lot of those 10,000 friends that we've got at the library

204
0:11:19.161,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that aren't able to use it,

205
0:11:20.844,000 --> 0:11:21,000
they might never be able to pay us.

206
0:11:22.831,000 --> 0:11:24,000
When we talk about eliminating their fines,

207
0:11:24.864,000 --> 0:11:26,000
we're not losing money so much as the idea of money.

208
0:11:29.831,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And thirdly, you might be surprised to know

209
0:11:33.632,000 --> 0:11:36,000
fines on average, nationally, are about one and a half percent

210
0:11:37.149,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of a library's operating budget.

211
0:11:39.505,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Now that can still be a lot of money.

212
0:11:41.339,000 --> 0:11:43,000
If you're looking at a large library or a large library system,

213
0:11:44.329,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the dollar amount can be high.

214
0:11:45.974,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But it's an achievable cut for most libraries to absorb.

215
0:11:50.768,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And finally, and maybe most importantly, fines cost us money to collect.

216
0:11:56.395,000 --> 0:11:59,000
When you start to factor in all of the ways that we collect fines,

217
0:11:59.971,000 --> 0:12:03,000
supplies like mailers that we send out to remind people of their fines,

218
0:12:05.129,000 --> 0:12:09,000
services, like collections management services,

219
0:12:09.284,000 --> 0:12:12,000
even telephone and email notifications can cost libraries money.

220
0:12:13.264,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And staff time is a huge cost for libraries.

221
0:12:17.804,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So that our frontline staff is standing there,

222
0:12:20.105,000 --> 0:12:23,000
talking to people about their fines, sometimes arguing with people about fines.

223
0:12:25.077,000 --> 0:12:27,000
When we eliminate all of those pieces,

224
0:12:27.894,000 --> 0:12:3,000
if we got rid of fines, we might actually save money in our libraries.

225
0:12:31.513,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Or at the very least,

226
0:12:33.046,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we would be able to reallocate our staff time

227
0:12:35.292,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to pursuits that better fit those missions we talked about.

228
0:12:40.363,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The other thing I want everybody to come away understanding

229
0:12:43.174,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is that fines don't actually work to do what we think they do.

230
0:12:46.371,000 --> 0:12:47,000
The debate about fines --

231
0:12:47.637,000 --> 0:12:5,000
whether we should fine, how much we should fine, it isn't new.

232
0:12:50.95,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We've been talking about it for almost 100 years.

233
0:12:54.307,000 --> 0:12:55,000
As long as that book was overdue.

234
0:12:58.22,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Study after study has shown that the reason libraries fine

235
0:13:02.085,000 --> 0:13:04,000
is because of strongly held beliefs

236
0:13:04.45,000 --> 0:13:07,000
about the effectiveness of getting materials back on time

237
0:13:07.752,000 --> 0:13:08,000
backed by no evidence.

238
0:13:10.474,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Basically, we fine because we've always fined.

239
0:13:14.871,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So, the best option for your libraries is to put their mission first.

240
0:13:20.776,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And they will do that if their community members ask it of them.

241
0:13:24.918,000 --> 0:13:26,000
When you leave here, I hope you'll visit your public library

242
0:13:27.784,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and talk to your librarians,

243
0:13:29.18,000 --> 0:13:31,000
talk to your neighbors and community members

244
0:13:31.268,000 --> 0:13:32,000
who serve on library boards.

245
0:13:32.72,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Tell them that you know how important literacy is

246
0:13:36.673,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to everyone in your community.

247
0:13:39.206,000 --> 0:13:42,000
That if our libraries are truly for everyone,

248
0:13:43.047,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that they have to get rid of fines and embrace their entire community.

249
0:13:47.245,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Thank you.

250
0:13:48.988,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Applause)

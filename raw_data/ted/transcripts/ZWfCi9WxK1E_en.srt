1
0:00:12.814,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was 10 years old when I learned what the word "genocide" meant.

2
0:00:18.575,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It was 2003,

3
0:00:20.303,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and my people were being brutally attacked because of their race --

4
0:00:24.429,000 --> 0:00:25,000
hundreds of thousands murdered,

5
0:00:26.257,000 --> 0:00:27,000
millions displaced,

6
0:00:28.229,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a nation torn apart at the hands of its own government.

7
0:00:32.019,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My mother and father immediately began speaking out against the crisis.

8
0:00:36.233,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I didn't really understand it,

9
0:00:37.743,000 --> 0:00:39,000
except for the fact that it was destroying my parents.

10
0:00:41.211,000 --> 0:00:44,000
One day, I walked in on my mother crying,

11
0:00:44.948,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I asked her why we are burying so many people.

12
0:00:50.22,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I don't remember the words that she chose

13
0:00:52.947,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to describe genocide to her 10-year-old daughter,

14
0:00:57.208,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but I remember the feeling.

15
0:00:59.561,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We felt completely alone,

16
0:01:02.64,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as if no one could hear us,

17
0:01:04.582,000 --> 0:01:06,000
as if we were essentially invisible.

18
0:01:08.179,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is when I wrote my first poem about Darfur.

19
0:01:12.964,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I wrote poetry to convince people to hear and see us,

20
0:01:17.976,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and that's how I learned the thing that changed me.

21
0:01:21.111,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It's easy to be seen.

22
0:01:22.931,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I mean, look at me -- I'm a young African woman with a scarf around my head,

23
0:01:28.065,000 --> 0:01:3,000
an American accent on my tongue

24
0:01:30.252,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and a story that makes even the most brutal of Monday mornings seem inviting.

25
0:01:35.851,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But it's hard to convince people that they deserve to be seen.

26
0:01:40.561,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I learned this in my high school classroom one day,

27
0:01:42.996,000 --> 0:01:44,000
when my teacher asked me to give a presentation about Darfur.

28
0:01:45.895,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I was setting up the projector when a classmate of mine said,

29
0:01:49.814,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"Why do you have to talk about this?

30
0:01:51.933,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Can't you think about us and how it will make us feel?"

31
0:01:55.007,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:57.171,000 --> 0:02:01,000
My 14-year-old self didn't know what to say to her,

33
0:02:01.259,000 --> 0:02:04,000
or how to explain the pain that I felt in that moment,

34
0:02:05.145,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and in every moment that we were forced not to talk about "this."

35
0:02:09.24,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Her words took me back to the days and nights on the ground in Darfur,

36
0:02:14.108,000 --> 0:02:16,000
where we were forced to remain silent;

37
0:02:16.586,000 --> 0:02:18,000
where we didn't speak over morning tea

38
0:02:18.801,000 --> 0:02:22,000
because the warplanes overhead would swallow any and all noise;

39
0:02:23.278,000 --> 0:02:25,000
back to the days when we were told

40
0:02:25.425,000 --> 0:02:27,000
not only that we don't deserve to be heard

41
0:02:28.238,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but that we do not have a right to exist.

42
0:02:31.783,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And this is where the magic happened,

43
0:02:34.286,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in that classroom when all the students started taking their seats

44
0:02:37.533,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and I began to speak,

45
0:02:38.826,000 --> 0:02:41,000
despite this renewed feeling that I didn't deserve to be there,

46
0:02:42.589,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that I didn't belong there

47
0:02:44.053,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or have a right to break the silence.

48
0:02:46.93,000 --> 0:02:47,000
As I talked,

49
0:02:48.638,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and my classmates listened,

50
0:02:51.305,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the fear ebbed away.

51
0:02:53.842,000 --> 0:02:54,000
My mind became calm,

52
0:02:55.443,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and I felt safe.

53
0:02:58.616,000 --> 0:03:,000
It was the sound of our grieving,

54
0:03:01.537,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the feel of their arms around me,

55
0:03:04.284,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the steady walls that held us together.

56
0:03:07.746,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It felt nothing like a vacuum.

57
0:03:10.621,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I choose poetry because it's so visceral.

58
0:03:14.641,000 --> 0:03:17,000
When someone is standing in front of you, mind, body and soul,

59
0:03:17.975,000 --> 0:03:18,000
saying "Witness me,"

60
0:03:19.2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it's impossible not to become keenly aware of your own humanity.

61
0:03:23.413,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This changed everything for me.

62
0:03:25.237,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It gave me courage.

63
0:03:27.703,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Every day I experience the power of witness,

64
0:03:30.318,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and because of that, I am whole.

65
0:03:32.443,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And so now I ask:

66
0:03:33.949,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Will you witness me?

67
0:03:37.221,000 --> 0:03:39,000
They hand me the microphone

68
0:03:39.279,000 --> 0:03:42,000
as my shoulders sink under the weight of this stress.

69
0:03:44.163,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The woman says,

70
0:03:46.145,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"The one millionth refugee just left South Sudan.

71
0:03:48.61,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Can you comment?"

72
0:03:50.091,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I feel my feet rock back and forth on the heels my mother bought,

73
0:03:54.135,000 --> 0:03:55,000
begging the question:

74
0:03:55.337,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Do we stay, or is it safer to choose flight?

75
0:03:58.646,000 --> 0:04:,000
My mind echoes the numbers:

76
0:04:01.561,000 --> 0:04:02,000
one million gone,

77
0:04:03.248,000 --> 0:04:04,000
two million displaced,

78
0:04:04.894,000 --> 0:04:06,000
400,000 dead in Darfur.

79
0:04:07.638,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And this lump takes over my throat,

80
0:04:09.368,000 --> 0:04:11,000
as if each of those bodies just found a grave

81
0:04:12.014,000 --> 0:04:13,000
right here in my esophagus.

82
0:04:14.413,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Our once country,

83
0:04:15.588,000 --> 0:04:17,000
all north and south and east and west,

84
0:04:17.842,000 --> 0:04:19,000
so restless the Nile couldn't hold us together,

85
0:04:20.784,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and you ask me to summarize.

86
0:04:23.174,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They talk about the numbers as if this isn't still happening,

87
0:04:26.233,000 --> 0:04:29,000
as if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria,

88
0:04:29.474,000 --> 0:04:31,000
as if 3,000 aren't still making their final stand

89
0:04:32.392,000 --> 0:04:35,000
at the bottom of the Mediterranean,

90
0:04:35.58,000 --> 0:04:39,000
as if there aren't entire volumes full of fact sheets about our genocides,

91
0:04:40.343,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and now they want me to write one.

92
0:04:43.074,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Fact:

93
0:04:45.703,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we never talked over breakfast,

94
0:04:47.989,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because the warplanes would swallow our voices.

95
0:04:50.728,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Fact:

96
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
my grandfather didn't want to leave home,

97
0:04:54.818,000 --> 0:04:56,000
so he died in a war zone.

98
0:04:57.467,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Fact:

99
0:04:58.831,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a burning bush without God is just a fire.

100
0:05:02.472,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I measure the distance between what I know

101
0:05:04.682,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and what is safe to say on a microphone.

102
0:05:06.956,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Do I talk about sorrow? Displacement?

103
0:05:09.874,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Do I mention the violence,

104
0:05:11.291,000 --> 0:05:13,000
how it's never as simple as what you see on TV,

105
0:05:13.995,000 --> 0:05:16,000
how there are weeks' worth of fear before the camera is on?

106
0:05:19.474,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Do I tell her about our bodies,

107
0:05:22.118,000 --> 0:05:23,000
how they are 60 percent water,

108
0:05:23.593,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but we still burn like driftwood,

109
0:05:25.534,000 --> 0:05:26,000
making fuel of our sacrifice?

110
0:05:27.44,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Do I tell her the men died first, mothers forced to watch the slaughter?

111
0:05:31.572,000 --> 0:05:32,000
That they came for our children,

112
0:05:33.198,000 --> 0:05:36,000
scattering them across the continent until our homes sank?

113
0:05:36.376,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That even castles sink at the bite of the bomb?

114
0:05:41.593,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Do I talk about the elderly,

115
0:05:43.484,000 --> 0:05:44,000
our heroes,

116
0:05:45.143,000 --> 0:05:47,000
too weak to run, too expensive to shoot,

117
0:05:47.778,000 --> 0:05:48,000
how they would march them,

118
0:05:49.185,000 --> 0:05:51,000
hands raised, rifles at their backs,

119
0:05:51.456,000 --> 0:05:52,000
into the fire?

120
0:05:52.636,000 --> 0:05:54,000
How their walking sticks kept the flames alive?

121
0:05:54.93,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It feels too harsh for a bundle of wires and an audience to swallow.

122
0:06:00.138,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Too relentless,

123
0:06:01.598,000 --> 0:06:04,000
like the valley that filled with the putrid smoke of our deaths.

124
0:06:05.481,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Is it better in verse?

125
0:06:07.934,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Can a stanza become a burial shroud?

126
0:06:10.659,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Will it sting less if I say it softly?

127
0:06:12.514,000 --> 0:06:14,000
If you don't see me cry, will you listen better?

128
0:06:14.841,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Will the pain leave when the microphone does?

129
0:06:16.981,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Why does every word feel as if I'm saying my last?

130
0:06:22.076,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Thirty seconds for the sound bite,

131
0:06:24.267,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and now three minutes for the poem.

132
0:06:27.14,000 --> 0:06:31,000
My tongue goes dry the same way we died,

133
0:06:31.228,000 --> 0:06:34,000
becoming ash, having never been coal.

134
0:06:36.131,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I feel my left leg go numb,

135
0:06:38.441,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and I realize that I locked my knees,

136
0:06:41.322,000 --> 0:06:42,000
bracing for impact.

137
0:06:43.557,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I never wear shoes I can't run in.

138
0:06:48.15,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Thank you.

139
0:06:49.808,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

140
0:06:56.667,000 --> 0:07:,000
So, I wanted to leave on a positive note,

141
0:07:00.928,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because that's the paradox that this life has been:

142
0:07:04.428,000 --> 0:07:07,000
in the places where I learned to cry the most,

143
0:07:07.452,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I also learned how to smile after.

144
0:07:11.435,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So, here goes.

145
0:07:16.657,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"You Have a Big Imagination

146
0:07:20.145,000 --> 0:07:21,000
or

147
0:07:21.446,000 --> 0:07:24,000
400,000 Ways to Cry."

148
0:07:26.254,000 --> 0:07:27,000
For Zeinab.

149
0:07:28.604,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I am a sad girl,

150
0:07:31.145,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but my face makes other plans,

151
0:07:33.854,000 --> 0:07:37,000
focusing energy on this smile, so as not to waste it on pain.

152
0:07:38.7,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The first thing they took was my sleep,

153
0:07:41.247,000 --> 0:07:43,000
eyes heavy but wide open,

154
0:07:43.589,000 --> 0:07:45,000
thinking maybe I missed something,

155
0:07:45.637,000 --> 0:07:47,000
maybe the cavalry is still coming.

156
0:07:47.835,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They didn't come,

157
0:07:49.104,000 --> 0:07:5,000
so I bought bigger pillows.

158
0:07:50.94,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:53.328,000 --> 0:07:56,000
My grandmother could cure anything

160
0:07:57.056,000 --> 0:07:59,000
by talking the life out of it.

161
0:07:59.667,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And she said that I could make a thief in a silo laugh

162
0:08:02.956,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in the middle of our raging war.

163
0:08:05.06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
War makes a broken marriage bed out of sorrow.

164
0:08:10.018,000 --> 0:08:12,000
You want nothing more than to disappear,

165
0:08:12.223,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but your heart can't salvage enough remnants to leave.

166
0:08:16.668,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But joy --

167
0:08:18.036,000 --> 0:08:22,000
joy is the armor we carried across the borders of our broken homeland.

168
0:08:24.507,000 --> 0:08:27,000
A hasty mix of stories and faces

169
0:08:28.083,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that lasts long after the flavor is gone.

170
0:08:31.838,000 --> 0:08:34,000
A muscle memory that overcomes even the most bitter of times,

171
0:08:35.772,000 --> 0:08:39,000
my memory is spotted with days of laughing until I cried,

172
0:08:40.345,000 --> 0:08:41,000
or crying until I laughed.

173
0:08:42.004,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Laughter and tears are both involuntary human reactions,

174
0:08:45.997,000 --> 0:08:48,000
testaments to our capacity for expression.

175
0:08:49.194,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So allow me to express

176
0:08:51.051,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that if I make you laugh,

177
0:08:52.765,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it's usually on purpose.

178
0:08:54.868,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And if I make you cry,

179
0:08:56.619,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I'll still think you are beautiful.

180
0:08:59.087,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This is for my cousin Zeinab,

181
0:09:02.516,000 --> 0:09:05,000
bedridden on a random afternoon.

182
0:09:05.951,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I hadn't seen her since the last time we were in Sudan together,

183
0:09:10.001,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and there I was at her hospital bedside

184
0:09:13.979,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in a 400-year-old building in France.

185
0:09:18.867,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Zeinab wanted to hear poems.

186
0:09:21.999,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Suddenly, English, Arabic and French were not enough.

187
0:09:26.073,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Every word I knew became empty noise,

188
0:09:29.484,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and Zeinab said, "Well, get on with it."

189
0:09:31.782,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:32.883,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And I read her everything that I could,

191
0:09:36.069,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and we laughed,

192
0:09:37.429,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and we loved it,

193
0:09:38.609,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and it was the most important stage that I've ever stood on,

194
0:09:42.608,000 --> 0:09:43,000
surrounded by family,

195
0:09:44.443,000 --> 0:09:48,000
by remnants of a people who were given as a dowry to a relentless war

196
0:09:49.243,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but still managed to make pearls of this life;

197
0:09:52.723,000 --> 0:09:55,000
by the ones who taught me to not only laugh,

198
0:09:56.463,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but to live in the face of death;

199
0:09:59.357,000 --> 0:10:01,000
who placed their hands across the sky,

200
0:10:01.787,000 --> 0:10:04,000
measuring the distance to the sun and saying, "Smile;

201
0:10:05.178,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I'm gonna meet you there."

202
0:10:07.618,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And for Zeinab --

203
0:10:09.942,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Zeinab, who taught me love in a place like France,

204
0:10:14.244,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Zeinab, who wanted to he.ar poems on her deathbed --

205
0:10:20.291,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Dilated fibromyalgia.

206
0:10:23.603,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Her heart muscles expanded

207
0:10:26.758,000 --> 0:10:27,000
until they couldn't function.

208
0:10:29.01,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And she held me, and she made me feel like gold.

209
0:10:32.907,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And I said, "Zeinab,

210
0:10:35.301,000 --> 0:10:38,000
isn't it strange that your only problem

211
0:10:38.845,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is that your heart was too big?"

212
0:10:44.24,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Thank you.

213
0:10:45.463,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Applause)

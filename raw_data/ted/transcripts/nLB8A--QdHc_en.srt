1
0:00:13.573,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In March 2017,

2
0:00:15.977,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the mayor of Cape Town officially declared Cape Town a local disaster,

3
0:00:20.435,000 --> 0:00:22,000
as it had less than four months left of usable water.

4
0:00:24.02,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Residents were restricted to 100 liters of water per person, per day.

5
0:00:29.324,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But what does that really mean?

6
0:00:31.721,000 --> 0:00:32,000
With 100 liters of water per day,

7
0:00:33.637,000 --> 0:00:34,000
you can take a five-minute shower,

8
0:00:36.066,000 --> 0:00:37,000
wash your face twice

9
0:00:38.17,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and probably flush the toilet about five times.

10
0:00:41.902,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You still didn't brush your teeth,

11
0:00:44.835,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you didn't do laundry,

12
0:00:46.734,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and you definitely didn't water your plants.

13
0:00:50.412,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You, unfortunately, didn't wash your hands after those five toilet flushes.

14
0:00:55.91,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And you didn't even take a sip of water.

15
0:01:00.511,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The mayor described this as that it means

16
0:01:03.623,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a new relationship with water.

17
0:01:07.442,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Today, seven months later,

18
0:01:08.988,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I can share two things about my second home with you.

19
0:01:11.825,000 --> 0:01:14,000
First: Cape Town hasn't run out of water just yet.

20
0:01:15.378,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But as of September 3rd,

21
0:01:17.175,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the hundred-liter limit dropped to 87 liters.

22
0:01:21.003,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The mayor defined the city's new normal as one of permanent drought.

23
0:01:26.869,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Second:

24
0:01:28.348,000 --> 0:01:31,000
what's happening in Cape Town is pretty much coming to many other cities

25
0:01:31.882,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and countries in the world.

26
0:01:33.935,000 --> 0:01:36,000
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,

27
0:01:37.561,000 --> 0:01:39,000
excluding countries that we don't have data for,

28
0:01:40.525,000 --> 0:01:43,000
less than five percent of the world's population

29
0:01:43.712,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is living in a country that has more water today than it did 20 years ago.

30
0:01:49.309,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Everyone else is living in a country that has less water today.

31
0:01:53.842,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And nearly one out of three are living in a country

32
0:01:56.579,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that is facing a water crisis.

33
0:01:59.519,000 --> 0:02:,000
I grew up in Jordan,

34
0:02:02.138,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a water-poor country that has experienced absolute water scarcity since 1973.

35
0:02:08.496,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And still, in 2017,

36
0:02:10.387,000 --> 0:02:13,000
only 10 countries in the world have less water than Jordan.

37
0:02:14.923,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So dealing with a lack of water is quite ingrained in my soul.

38
0:02:18.864,000 --> 0:02:21,000
As soon as I was old enough to learn how to write my name,

39
0:02:22.252,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I also learned that I need to conserve water.

40
0:02:25.649,000 --> 0:02:29,000
My parents would constantly remind my siblings and I to close the tap

41
0:02:29.683,000 --> 0:02:3,000
when we brushed our teeth.

42
0:02:31.761,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We used to fill balloons with flour instead of water when we played.

43
0:02:36.329,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's just as much fun, though.

44
0:02:37.858,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:38.965,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And a few years ago,

46
0:02:40.156,000 --> 0:02:43,000
when my friends and I were dared to do the Ice Bucket Challenge,

47
0:02:44.197,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we did that with sand.

48
0:02:45.792,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:47.721,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And you might think that, you know, that's easy,

50
0:02:50.005,000 --> 0:02:51,000
sand is not ice cold.

51
0:02:51.697,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I promise you, sand goes everywhere,

52
0:02:54.339,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and it took ages to get rid of it.

53
0:02:57.97,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But what perhaps I didn't realize

54
0:02:59.755,000 --> 0:03:01,000
as I played with flour balloons as a child,

55
0:03:02.332,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and as I poured sand on my head as an adult,

56
0:03:05.864,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is that some of the techniques that seem second nature to me

57
0:03:09.188,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and to others who live in dry countries

58
0:03:11.782,000 --> 0:03:15,000
might help us all address what is fast becoming a global crisis.

59
0:03:18.272,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I wish to share three lessons today,

60
0:03:22.297,000 --> 0:03:24,000
three lessons from water-poor countries

61
0:03:24.465,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and how they survived and even thrived despite their water crisis.

62
0:03:30.231,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Lesson one:

63
0:03:31.865,000 --> 0:03:33,000
tell people how much water they really have.

64
0:03:35.185,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In order to solve a problem,

65
0:03:36.644,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we need to acknowledge that we have one.

66
0:03:39.169,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And when it comes to water,

67
0:03:40.523,000 --> 0:03:42,000
people can easily turn a blind eye,

68
0:03:43.033,000 --> 0:03:45,000
pretending that since water is coming out of the tap now,

69
0:03:45.897,000 --> 0:03:46,000
everything will be fine forever.

70
0:03:48.703,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But some smart, drought-affected countries

71
0:03:51.795,000 --> 0:03:53,000
have adopted simple, innovative measures

72
0:03:54.204,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to make sure their citizens, their communities and their companies

73
0:03:58.085,000 --> 0:03:59,000
know just how dry their countries are.

74
0:04:02.159,000 --> 0:04:04,000
When I was in Cape Town earlier this year,

75
0:04:04.6,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I saw this electronic billboard on the freeway,

76
0:04:07.524,000 --> 0:04:09,000
indicating how much water the city had left.

77
0:04:11.004,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This is an idea they may well have borrowed from Australia

78
0:04:13.996,000 --> 0:04:16,000
when it faced one of the worst droughts of the country's history

79
0:04:17.667,000 --> 0:04:19,000
from 1997 to 2009.

80
0:04:21.273,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Water levels in Melbourne dropped to a very low capacity

81
0:04:24.807,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of almost 26 percent.

82
0:04:27.917,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But the city didn't yell at people.

83
0:04:30.515,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It didn't plead with them not to use water.

84
0:04:33.427,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They used electronic billboards to flash available levels of water

85
0:04:37.845,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to all citizens across the city.

86
0:04:40.429,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They were honestly telling people how much water they really have,

87
0:04:43.85,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and letting them take responsibility for themselves.

88
0:04:47.083,000 --> 0:04:51,000
By the end of the drought, this created such a sense of urgency

89
0:04:51.114,000 --> 0:04:52,000
as well as a sense of community.

90
0:04:53.281,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Nearly one out of three citizens in Melbourne had invested

91
0:04:57.038,000 --> 0:05:,000
in installing rainwater holding tanks for their own households.

92
0:05:01.799,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Actions that citizens took didn't stop at installing those tanks.

93
0:05:06.461,000 --> 0:05:07,000
With help from the city,

94
0:05:07.813,000 --> 0:05:09,000
they were able to do something even more impactful.

95
0:05:11.509,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Taking me to lesson two:

96
0:05:14.285,000 --> 0:05:16,000
empower people to save water.

97
0:05:18.658,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Melbourne wanted people to spend less water in their homes.

98
0:05:22.636,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And one way to do that is to spend less time in the shower.

99
0:05:26.644,000 --> 0:05:29,000
However, interviews revealed that some people, women in particular,

100
0:05:30.603,000 --> 0:05:32,000
weren't keen on saving water that way.

101
0:05:33.554,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Some of them honestly said,

102
0:05:35.274,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"The shower is not just to clean up.

103
0:05:37.141,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's my sanctuary.

104
0:05:39.218,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's a space I go to relax, not just clean up."

105
0:05:43.083,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So the city started offering water-efficient showerheads for free.

106
0:05:47.638,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And then, now some people complained that the showerheads looked ugly

107
0:05:51.138,000 --> 0:05:53,000
or didn't suit their bathrooms.

108
0:05:53.34,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So what I like to call "The Showerhead Team"

109
0:05:56.423,000 --> 0:05:58,000
developed a small water-flow regulator

110
0:05:58.894,000 --> 0:06:,000
that can be fitted into existing showerheads.

111
0:06:03.103,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And although showerhead beauty doesn't matter much to me,

112
0:06:06.47,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I loved how the team didn't give up

113
0:06:08.528,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and instead came up with a simple, unique solution

114
0:06:11.3,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to empower people to save water.

115
0:06:14.858,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Within a span of four years,

116
0:06:16.965,000 --> 0:06:19,000
more than 460,000 showerheads were replaced.

117
0:06:21.889,000 --> 0:06:23,000
When the small regulator was introduced,

118
0:06:24.086,000 --> 0:06:26,000
more than 100,000 orders of that were done.

119
0:06:28.261,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Melbourne succeeded in reducing the water demands per capita

120
0:06:31.481,000 --> 0:06:32,000
by 50 percent.

121
0:06:33.648,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In the United Arab Emirates,

122
0:06:35.45,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the second-most water-scarce country in the world,

123
0:06:39.009,000 --> 0:06:44,000
officials designed what they called the "Business Heroes Toolkit" in 2010.

124
0:06:45.026,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The aim was to motivate and empower businesses

125
0:06:47.607,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to reduce water and energy consumption.

126
0:06:51.066,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The toolkit practically taught companies

127
0:06:53.059,000 --> 0:06:55,000
how to measure their existing water-consumption levels

128
0:06:56.323,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and consisted of tips to help them reduce those levels.

129
0:07:00.517,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And it worked.

130
0:07:01.844,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Hundreds of organizations downloaded the toolkit.

131
0:07:05.187,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And several of them joined

132
0:07:06.849,000 --> 0:07:08,000
what they called the "Corporate Heroes Network,"

133
0:07:10.435,000 --> 0:07:12,000
where companies can voluntarily take on a challenge

134
0:07:13.376,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to reduce their water-consumption levels to preset targets

135
0:07:16.962,000 --> 0:07:17,000
within a period of one year.

136
0:07:19.716,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Companies which completed the challenge saved on average 35 percent of water.

137
0:07:25.409,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And one company, for example,

138
0:07:27.247,000 --> 0:07:31,000
implemented as many water-saving tips as they could in their office space.

139
0:07:32.178,000 --> 0:07:36,000
They replaced their toilet-flushing techniques, taps, showerheads --

140
0:07:37.029,000 --> 0:07:38,000
you name it.

141
0:07:38.242,000 --> 0:07:4,000
If it saved water, they replaced it,

142
0:07:40.733,000 --> 0:07:43,000
eventually reducing their employees' water consumption by half.

143
0:07:45.335,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Empowering individuals and companies to save water is so critical,

144
0:07:50.99,000 --> 0:07:51,000
yet not sufficient.

145
0:07:53.24,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Countries need to look beyond the status quo

146
0:07:56.264,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and implement country-level actions

147
0:07:59.133,000 --> 0:08:,000
to save water.

148
0:08:01.957,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Taking me to lesson three:

149
0:08:03.917,000 --> 0:08:04,000
look below the surface.

150
0:08:06.268,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Water savings can come from unexpected places.

151
0:08:10.555,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Singapore is the eighth most water-scarce country in the world.

152
0:08:14.374,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It depends on imported water for almost 60 percent of its water needs.

153
0:08:20.423,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's also a very small island.

154
0:08:22.933,000 --> 0:08:25,000
As such, it needs to make use of as much space as possible

155
0:08:26.633,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to catch rainfall.

156
0:08:29.153,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So in 2008,

157
0:08:30.744,000 --> 0:08:31,000
they built the Marina Barrage.

158
0:08:32.801,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's the first-ever urban water reservoir built in the middle of the city-state.

159
0:08:38.593,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's the largest water catchment in the country,

160
0:08:41.909,000 --> 0:08:43,000
almost one-sixth the size of Singapore.

161
0:08:44.716,000 --> 0:08:46,000
What's so amazing about the Marina Barrage

162
0:08:46.851,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is that it has been built to make the maximum use of its large size

163
0:08:51.79,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and its unexpected yet important location.

164
0:08:55.09,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It brings three valuable benefits to the country:

165
0:08:58.506,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it has boosted Singapore's water supply by 10 percent;

166
0:09:03.654,000 --> 0:09:05,000
it protects low areas around it from floods

167
0:09:06.267,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because of its connection to the sea;

168
0:09:09.01,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and, as you can see,

169
0:09:10.297,000 --> 0:09:12,000
it acts as a beautiful lifestyle attraction,

170
0:09:12.911,000 --> 0:09:13,000
hosting several events,

171
0:09:14.783,000 --> 0:09:16,000
from art exhibitions to music festivals,

172
0:09:17.619,000 --> 0:09:21,000
attracting joggers, bikers, tourists all around that area.

173
0:09:23.521,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now, not all initiatives need to be stunning

174
0:09:25.872,000 --> 0:09:26,000
or even visible.

175
0:09:27.923,000 --> 0:09:3,000
My first home, Jordan, realized that agriculture is consuming

176
0:09:31.84,000 --> 0:09:33,000
the majority of its fresh water.

177
0:09:35.396,000 --> 0:09:37,000
They really wanted to encourage farmers

178
0:09:37.66,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to focus on growing low water-intensive crops.

179
0:09:42.136,000 --> 0:09:43,000
To achieve that,

180
0:09:43.359,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the local agriculture is increasing its focus on date palms and grapevines.

181
0:09:49.077,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Those two are much more tolerant to drought conditions

182
0:09:52.601,000 --> 0:09:53,000
than many other fruits and vegetables,

183
0:09:54.941,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and at the same time,

184
0:09:56.552,000 --> 0:10:01,000
they are considered high-value crops, both locally and internationally.

185
0:10:02.711,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Locals in Namibia,

186
0:10:05.073,000 --> 0:10:08,000
one of the most arid countries in Southern Africa,

187
0:10:08.585,000 --> 0:10:12,000
have been drinking recycled water since 1968.

188
0:10:13.334,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now, you may tell me many countries recycle water.

189
0:10:16.767,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I would say yes.

190
0:10:18.569,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But very few use it for drinking purposes,

191
0:10:21.738,000 --> 0:10:23,000
mostly because people don't like the thought

192
0:10:24.213,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of water that was in their toilets going to their taps.

193
0:10:28.295,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But Namibia could not afford to think that way.

194
0:10:31.528,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They looked below the surface to save water.

195
0:10:35.428,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They are now a great example

196
0:10:37.214,000 --> 0:10:41,000
of how, when countries purify waste water to drinking standards,

197
0:10:41.893,000 --> 0:10:43,000
they can ease their water shortages,

198
0:10:44.672,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and in Namibia's case,

199
0:10:46.209,000 --> 0:10:51,000
provide drinking water for more than 300,000 citizens in its capital city.

200
0:10:52.714,000 --> 0:10:56,000
As more countries which used to be more water rich

201
0:10:56.874,000 --> 0:10:57,000
are becoming water scarce,

202
0:10:59.703,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I say we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

203
0:11:03.586,000 --> 0:11:06,000
If we just look at what water-poor countries have done,

204
0:11:07.561,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the solutions are out there.

205
0:11:10.3,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Now it's really just up to all of us

206
0:11:13.285,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to take action.

207
0:11:15.495,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Thank you.

208
0:11:16.701,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

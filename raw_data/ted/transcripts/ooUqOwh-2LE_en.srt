1
0:00:16.02,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago

2
0:00:18.22,000 --> 0:00:21,000
when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.

3
0:00:21.74,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage,

4
0:00:24.74,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so I decided to create my own in public places.

5
0:00:28.14,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So the first project we're going to take a look at

6
0:00:30.54,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.

7
0:00:32.46,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, this took place in January of 2002.

8
0:00:34.46,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And this woman is the star of the video.

9
0:00:36.42,000 --> 0:00:37,000
She doesn't know she's being filmed.

10
0:00:38.18,000 --> 0:00:39,000
She's being filmed with a hidden camera.

11
0:00:40.14,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This is on the 6 train in New York City.

12
0:00:42.1,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And this is the first stop along the line.

13
0:00:44.22,000 --> 0:00:45,000
These are two Danish guys

14
0:00:45.5,000 --> 0:00:47,000
who come in and sit down next to the hidden camera.

15
0:00:49.14,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And that's me right there in a brown coat.

16
0:00:51.18,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's about 30 degrees outside.

17
0:00:52.86,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.

18
0:00:55.42,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And the girl's going to notice me right here.

19
0:01:00.14,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:05.54,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants.

21
0:01:07.78,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:11.9,000 --> 0:01:12,000
At this point --

23
0:01:13.86,000 --> 0:01:14,000
at this point she's noticed me,

24
0:01:15.38,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car.

25
0:01:18.02,000 --> 0:01:19,000
One person's not that unusual.

26
0:01:19.499,000 --> 0:01:22,000
She goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled "Rape."

27
0:01:22.94,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:26.3,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So she's noticed the unusual thing, but she's gone back to her normal life.

29
0:01:29.86,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now, in the meantime, I have six friends

30
0:01:31.82,000 --> 0:01:33,000
who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops

31
0:01:34.18,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in their underwear as well.

32
0:01:35.86,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They're going to be entering this car one by one.

33
0:01:38.22,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We'll act as though we don't know each other.

34
0:01:40.74,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made,

35
0:01:43.78,000 --> 0:01:45,000
forgetting our pants on this cold January day.

36
0:01:45.98,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:01.06,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter continues)

38
0:02:12.54,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So at this point,

39
0:02:13.82,000 --> 0:02:15,000
she decides to put the rape book away.

40
0:02:16.18,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings.

42
0:02:21.62,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera,

43
0:02:24.62,000 --> 0:02:25,000
they're cracking up.

44
0:02:25.86,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before.

45
0:02:28.86,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now.

46
0:02:33.7,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:38.54,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I love that moment in this video,

48
0:02:40.38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because before it became a shared experience,

49
0:02:42.98,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it was something that was maybe a little bit scary,

50
0:02:45.78,000 --> 0:02:47,000
or something that was at least confusing to her.

51
0:02:48.06,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And then, once it became a shared experience,

52
0:02:50.18,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it was funny and something that she could laugh at.

53
0:02:52.62,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line.

54
0:03:09.98,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:13.46,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So the video won't show everything.

56
0:03:15.18,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This goes on for another four stops.

57
0:03:17.3,000 --> 0:03:2,000
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.

58
0:03:20.58,000 --> 0:03:22,000
At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag

59
0:03:23.34,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar --

60
0:03:25.82,000 --> 0:03:28,000
like you might sell batteries or candy on the train.

61
0:03:29.06,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We all very matter-of-factly bought a pair of pants, put them on

62
0:03:32.14,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and said, "Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today,"

63
0:03:34.9,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and then exited without revealing what had happened

64
0:03:38.1,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and went in all different directions.

65
0:03:39.94,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Applause)

66
0:03:42.94,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Thank you.

67
0:03:44.98,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So that's a still from the video there.

68
0:03:47.7,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And I love that girl's reaction so much.

69
0:03:49.7,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And watching that videotape later that day

70
0:03:51.724,000 --> 0:03:53,000
inspired me to keep doing what I do.

71
0:03:54.06,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere

72
0:03:56.62,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is to cause a scene in a public place

73
0:03:58.66,000 --> 0:04:,000
that is a positive experience for other people.

74
0:04:00.9,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.

75
0:04:04.38,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And her reaction inspired me

76
0:04:05.78,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.

77
0:04:07.82,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And we've continued to do it every year.

78
0:04:09.749,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride

79
0:04:12.46,000 --> 0:04:14,000
where a diverse group of 3,500 people

80
0:04:14.82,000 --> 0:04:16,000
rode the train in their underwear in New York --

81
0:04:17.1,000 --> 0:04:19,000
almost every single train line in the city.

82
0:04:19.18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And also in 50 other cities around the world,

83
0:04:21.58,000 --> 0:04:22,000
people participated.

84
0:04:22.82,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:24.98,000 --> 0:04:27,000
As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater

86
0:04:28.42,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians,

87
0:04:31.7,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I started amassing a mailing list of people

88
0:04:33.779,000 --> 0:04:34,000
who wanted to do these types of projects.

89
0:04:35.779,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I could do more large-scale projects.

90
0:04:37.74,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Well, one day I was walking through Union Square,

91
0:04:40.1,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005.

92
0:04:43.66,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.

93
0:04:46.5,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It was very peculiar, because it was dark out,

94
0:04:48.7,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but she was backlit with florescent lighting.

95
0:04:50.94,000 --> 0:04:51,000
She was very much onstage

96
0:04:52.22,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.

97
0:04:54.46,000 --> 0:04:56,000
After about 15 seconds, her friend appeared --

98
0:04:56.66,000 --> 0:04:57,000
she had been hiding behind a display.

99
0:04:58.5,000 --> 0:05:,000
They laughed, hugged each other and ran away.

100
0:05:00.66,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Maybe she had been dared to do this.

101
0:05:02.42,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So I got inspired by that.

102
0:05:03.74,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows --

103
0:05:06.7,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I knew what I had to do.

104
0:05:08.1,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:09.66,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So this project is called Look Up More.

106
0:05:11.58,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We had 70 actors dress in black.

107
0:05:13.18,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This was completely unauthorized.

108
0:05:14.82,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We didn't let the stores know we were coming.

109
0:05:16.98,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I stood in the park giving signals.

110
0:05:18.9,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters

111
0:05:22.42,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that spelled out "Look Up More,"

112
0:05:24.02,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the name of the project.

113
0:05:26.46,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together.

114
0:05:30.66,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You'll see that start right here.

115
0:05:32.3,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:34.78,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.

117
0:05:37.02,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And then we had dance solos

118
0:05:38.38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them.

119
0:05:41.62,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:48.38,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So then I gave a new hand signal,

121
0:05:50.02,000 --> 0:05:53,000
which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21,

122
0:05:53.42,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and he danced.

123
0:05:55.54,000 --> 0:05:56,000
There were several other activities.

124
0:05:57.34,000 --> 0:06:,000
We had people jumping up and down, people dropping to the ground.

125
0:06:00.78,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt,

126
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement.

127
0:06:06.54,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station,

128
0:06:09.74,000 --> 0:06:12,000
there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up

129
0:06:12.9,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and watched what we were doing.

130
0:06:16.9,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There's a better photo of it.

131
0:06:18.46,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So that particular event was inspired by a moment

132
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that I happened to stumble upon.

133
0:06:24.62,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The next project I want to show

134
0:06:26.14,000 --> 0:06:28,000
was given to me in an email from a stranger.

135
0:06:28.98,000 --> 0:06:3,000
A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006

136
0:06:31.34,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and said, "You should get as many people as possible

137
0:06:33.82,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants

138
0:06:36.42,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and go into a Best Buy and stand around."

139
0:06:38.7,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:41.14,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Applause)

141
0:06:43.42,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So I wrote this high school kid back immediately

142
0:06:47.94,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and I said, "Yes, you are correct.

143
0:06:49.62,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you."

144
0:06:52.14,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So here's the video.

145
0:06:53.54,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So again, this is 2005.

146
0:06:55.06,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is the Best Buy in New York City.

147
0:06:57.58,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We had about 80 people show up to participate,

148
0:07:00.38,000 --> 0:07:01,000
entering one by one.

149
0:07:01.7,000 --> 0:07:03,000
There was an eight-year-old girl, a 10-year-old girl.

150
0:07:04.201,000 --> 0:07:07,000
There was also a 65-year-old man who participated.

151
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So a very diverse group of people.

152
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:10.42,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And I told people, "Don't work. Don't actually do work.

154
0:07:13.1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But also, don't shop.

155
0:07:14.34,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Just stand around and don't face products."

156
0:07:16.78,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now you can see the regular employees

157
0:07:18.62,000 --> 0:07:2,000
by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt.

158
0:07:21.14,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Everybody else is one of our actors.

159
0:07:22.9,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:24.78,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The lower-level employees thought it was very funny.

161
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Several of them went to go get their camera from the break room

162
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and took photos with us.

163
0:07:31.54,000 --> 0:07:34,000
A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back

164
0:07:34.62,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to get heavy television sets for customers.

165
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The managers and the security guards, on the other hand,

166
0:07:40.22,000 --> 0:07:42,000
did not find it particularly funny.

167
0:07:42.54,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You can see them in this footage.

168
0:07:44.18,000 --> 0:07:46,000
They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.

169
0:07:46.82,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And we were there probably 10 minutes

170
0:07:48.66,000 --> 0:07:5,000
before the managers decided to dial 911.

171
0:07:51.18,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:53.46,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So they started running around

173
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
telling everybody the cops were coming, "Watch out, the cops are coming."

174
0:07:58.86,000 --> 0:08:,000
And you can see the cops in this footage right here.

175
0:08:01.5,000 --> 0:08:04,000
That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.

176
0:08:05.02,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Ultimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management

177
0:08:07.7,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that it was not, in fact, illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.

178
0:08:11.3,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:13.62,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Applause)

180
0:08:17.14,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Thank you.

181
0:08:18.38,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Applause)

182
0:08:20.1,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.

183
0:08:24.54,000 --> 0:08:28,000
One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras.

184
0:08:28.62,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.

185
0:08:32.14,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But the one camera guy they never caught

186
0:08:34.069,000 --> 0:08:36,000
was the guy that went in just with a blank tape

187
0:08:36.3,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and went over to the Best Buy camera department

188
0:08:38.54,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and just put his tape in one of their cameras

189
0:08:40.7,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and pretended to shop.

190
0:08:42.78,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them.

191
0:08:45.94,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

192
0:08:47.66,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I think our best projects are ones that are site-specific

193
0:08:50.38,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and happen at a particular place for a reason.

194
0:08:52.58,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And one morning, I was riding the subway.

195
0:08:54.557,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop

196
0:08:56.7,000 --> 0:08:58,000
where there are these two giant escalators.

197
0:08:58.74,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded.

198
0:09:02.22,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So I decided to try and stage something

199
0:09:04.14,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that could make it as happy as possible for one morning.

200
0:09:07.66,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8:30 in the morning.

201
0:09:11.18,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's morning rush hour.

202
0:09:12.74,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's very cold outside.

203
0:09:14.5,000 --> 0:09:15,000
People are coming in from Queens,

204
0:09:16.14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
transferring from the E train to the 6 train.

205
0:09:19.06,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And they're going up these giant escalators

206
0:09:22.18,000 --> 0:09:23,000
on their way to their jobs.

207
0:09:26.1,000 --> 0:09:27,000
[Rob wants]

208
0:09:31.495,000 --> 0:09:32,000
[to give you]

209
0:09:35.435,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:36.609,000 --> 0:09:37,000
[a high five!]

211
0:09:37.886,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Laughter)

212
0:09:40.354,000 --> 0:09:41,000
[Get ready!]

213
0:09:41.627,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Laughter)

214
0:09:48.62,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

215
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Thank you.

216
0:09:56.5,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.

217
0:09:59.54,000 --> 0:10:01,000
He gave 2,000 high fives that day,

218
0:10:02.22,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and he washed his hands before and afterward

219
0:10:04.62,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and did not get sick.

220
0:10:06.06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And that was done also without permission,

221
0:10:08.084,000 --> 0:10:1,000
although no one seemed to care.

222
0:10:10.22,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So I'd say over the years,

223
0:10:11.54,000 --> 0:10:14,000
one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere

224
0:10:14.78,000 --> 0:10:15,000
left anonymously on YouTube comments

225
0:10:16.7,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is: "These people have too much time on their hands."

226
0:10:19.86,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do,

227
0:10:22.82,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments,

228
0:10:26.14,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but that one's always bothered me,

229
0:10:27.82,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because we don't have too much time on our hands.

230
0:10:30.18,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The participants in Improv Everywhere events

231
0:10:32.3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers,

232
0:10:34.98,000 --> 0:10:36,000
they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way.

233
0:10:37.9,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You know, every Saturday and Sunday,

234
0:10:39.66,000 --> 0:10:41,000
hundreds of thousands of people each fall

235
0:10:41.74,000 --> 0:10:43,000
gather in football stadiums to watch games.

236
0:10:44.46,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game,

237
0:10:47.54,000 --> 0:10:5,000
"All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."

238
0:10:51.02,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And of course they don't.

239
0:10:52.3,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon,

240
0:10:55.18,000 --> 0:10:56,000
watching a football game in a stadium.

241
0:10:57.06,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But I think it's also a perfectly valid way

242
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people

243
0:11:02.46,000 --> 0:11:03,000
in the Grand Central terminal

244
0:11:04.14,000 --> 0:11:06,000
or dressing up like a ghostbuster

245
0:11:06.46,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and running through the New York Public Library.

246
0:11:08.74,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

247
0:11:10.86,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people

248
0:11:14.1,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and dancing silently in a park,

249
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
or bursting into song in a grocery store

250
0:11:18.46,000 --> 0:11:2,000
as part of a spontaneous musical,

251
0:11:20.7,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.

252
0:11:24.14,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

253
0:11:25.58,000 --> 0:11:26,000
You know, as kids, we're taught to play.

254
0:11:27.54,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And we're never given a reason why we should play.

255
0:11:29.94,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing.

256
0:11:32.18,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.

257
0:11:34.94,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.

258
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We don't need a reason. As long as it's fun

259
0:11:40.3,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea

260
0:11:42.54,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and it seems like the people who witness it

261
0:11:44.86,000 --> 0:11:45,000
will also have a fun time,

262
0:11:46.34,000 --> 0:11:47,000
then that's enough for us.

263
0:11:47.74,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And I think, as adults, we need to learn

264
0:11:49.78,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that there's no right or wrong way to play.

265
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Thank you very much.

266
0:11:53.5,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Applause)

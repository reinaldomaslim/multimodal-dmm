1
0:00:12.858,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Vincent Moon: How can we use computers,

2
0:00:16.677,000 --> 0:00:2,000
cameras, microphones to represent the world

3
0:00:21.172,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in an alternative way,

4
0:00:23.336,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as much as possible?

5
0:00:25.37,000 --> 0:00:27,000
How, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet

6
0:00:28.324,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to create a new form of cinema?

7
0:00:32.042,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And actually, why do we record?

8
0:00:37.035,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Well, it is with such simple questions in mind

9
0:00:39.953,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that I started to make films 10 years ago,

10
0:00:43.936,000 --> 0:00:46,000
first with a friend, Christophe Abric.

11
0:00:47.424,000 --> 0:00:49,000
He had a website, La Blogothèque,

12
0:00:49.809,000 --> 0:00:51,000
dedicated to independent music.

13
0:00:52.475,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We were crazy about music.

14
0:00:54.13,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We wanted to represent music in a different way,

15
0:00:56.822,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to film the music we love, the musicians we admired,

16
0:00:59.41,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as much as possible, far from the music industry

17
0:01:02.871,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and far from the cliches attached to it.

18
0:01:05.253,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We started to publish every week

19
0:01:08.219,000 --> 0:01:09,000
sessions on the Internet.

20
0:01:09.969,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We are going to see a few extracts now.

21
0:01:17.944,000 --> 0:01:2,000
From Grizzly Bear in the shower

22
0:01:21.744,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe.

23
0:01:28.57,000 --> 0:01:32,000
From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower

24
0:01:33.358,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to Tom Jones in his hotel room in New York.

25
0:01:38.241,000 --> 0:01:4,000
From Arcade Fire in an elevator

26
0:01:40.707,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in the Olympia

27
0:01:42.856,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to Beirut going down a staircase in Brooklyn.

28
0:01:48.486,000 --> 0:01:52,000
From R.E.M. in a car

29
0:01:52.5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to The National around a table at night

30
0:01:54.863,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in the south of France.

31
0:01:58.62,000 --> 0:02:01,000
From Bon Iver playing with some friends

32
0:02:01.952,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in an apartment in Montmartre

33
0:02:04.925,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to Yeasayer having a long night,

34
0:02:08.783,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and many, many, many more

35
0:02:11.866,000 --> 0:02:13,000
unknown or very famous bands.

36
0:02:14.37,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We published all those films

37
0:02:15.926,000 --> 0:02:16,000
for free on the Internet,

38
0:02:17.882,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and we wanted to share

39
0:02:20.898,000 --> 0:02:22,000
all those films and represent music

40
0:02:23.068,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in a different way.

41
0:02:25.828,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We wanted to create another type of intimacy

42
0:02:28.998,000 --> 0:02:29,000
using all those new technologies.

43
0:02:30.662,000 --> 0:02:33,000
At the time, 10 years ago actually,

44
0:02:33.768,000 --> 0:02:35,000
there was no such project on the Internet,

45
0:02:36.018,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and I guess that's why the project we were making, the Take Away Shows,

46
0:02:39.663,000 --> 0:02:4,000
got quite successful,

47
0:02:40.94,000 --> 0:02:43,000
reaching millions of viewers.

48
0:02:44.72,000 --> 0:02:47,000
After a while, I got a bit —

49
0:02:47.92,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I wanted to go somewhere else.

50
0:02:49.83,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I felt the need to travel and to discover some other music,

51
0:02:52.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to explore the world,

52
0:02:54.735,000 --> 0:02:55,000
going to other corners,

53
0:02:56.523,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and actually it was also

54
0:02:58.564,000 --> 0:03:01,000
this idea of nomadic cinema, sort of, that I had in mind.

55
0:03:02.535,000 --> 0:03:09,000
How could the use of new technologies and the road fit together?

56
0:03:09.583,000 --> 0:03:1,000
How could I edit my films in a bus

57
0:03:11.431,000 --> 0:03:13,000
crossing the Andes?

58
0:03:13.466,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So I went on five-year travels

59
0:03:15.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
around the globe.

60
0:03:17.334,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I started at the time in the digital film and music label collection Petites Planètes,

61
0:03:22.31,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which was also an homage to French filmmaker Chris Marker.

62
0:03:25.526,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We're going to see now a few more extracts

63
0:03:28.371,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of those new films.

64
0:03:35.356,000 --> 0:03:42,000
From the tecno brega diva of northern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos

65
0:03:44.904,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to a female ensemble in Chechnya.

66
0:03:51.241,000 --> 0:03:56,000
From experimental electronic music in Singapore with One Man Nation

67
0:03:58.368,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to Brazilian icon Tom Zé singing on his rooftop in São Paolo.

68
0:04:06.672,000 --> 0:04:11,000
From The Bambir, the great rock band from Armenia

69
0:04:11.846,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to some traditional songs

70
0:04:14.303,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia.

71
0:04:19.731,000 --> 0:04:25,000
From White Shoes, a great retro pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia

72
0:04:27.012,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary band from Kiev, Ukraine.

73
0:04:34.32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
From Tomi Lebrero

74
0:04:36.02,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and his bandoneon and his friends in Buenos Aires, Argentina,

75
0:04:40.136,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to many other places

76
0:04:42.735,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and musicians around the world.

77
0:04:45.412,000 --> 0:04:47,000
My desire was to make it as a trek.

78
0:04:48.381,000 --> 0:04:49,000
To do all those films,

79
0:04:50.147,000 --> 0:04:51,000
it would have been impossible

80
0:04:51.778,000 --> 0:04:52,000
with a big company behind me,

81
0:04:53.229,000 --> 0:04:54,000
with a structure or anything.

82
0:04:54.63,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I was traveling alone with a backpack —

83
0:04:57.711,000 --> 0:04:59,000
computer, camera, microphones in it.

84
0:05:00.18,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Alone, actually, but just with local people,

85
0:05:02.965,000 --> 0:05:04,000
meeting my team, which was absolutely not

86
0:05:05.8,000 --> 0:05:08,000
professional people, on the spot there,

87
0:05:09.715,000 --> 0:05:11,000
going from one place to another

88
0:05:11.976,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and to make cinema as a trek.

89
0:05:13.457,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I really believed that cinema could be

90
0:05:16.352,000 --> 0:05:18,000
this very simple thing:

91
0:05:18.544,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I want to make a film and you're going to give me a place to stay for the night.

92
0:05:23.263,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I give you a moment of cinema and you offer me a capirinha.

93
0:05:28.195,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Well, or other drinks,

94
0:05:30.48,000 --> 0:05:32,000
depending on where you are.

95
0:05:32.715,000 --> 0:05:35,000
In Peru, they drink pisco sour.

96
0:05:36.172,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually,

97
0:05:41.014,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I had no idea about what I would do there.

98
0:05:46.289,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And I just had one phone number, actually,

99
0:05:53.569,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of one person.

100
0:05:55.064,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Three months later,

101
0:05:56.407,000 --> 0:06:,000
after traveling all around the country, I had recorded 33 films,

102
0:06:00.735,000 --> 0:06:03,000
only with the help of local people,

103
0:06:03.755,000 --> 0:06:05,000
only with the help of people

104
0:06:06.217,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that I was asking all the time the same question:

105
0:06:08.469,000 --> 0:06:13,000
What is important to record here today?

106
0:06:13.515,000 --> 0:06:14,000
By living in such a way,

107
0:06:15.343,000 --> 0:06:17,000
by working without any structure,

108
0:06:18.174,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I was able to react to the moment

109
0:06:23.369,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and to decide, oh, this is important to make now.

110
0:06:26.787,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This is important to record that whole person.

111
0:06:29.033,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This is important to create this exchange.

112
0:06:33.049,000 --> 0:06:36,000
When I went to Chechnya,

113
0:06:36.1,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the first person I met

114
0:06:38.31,000 --> 0:06:4,000
looked at me and was like,

115
0:06:40.52,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"What are you doing here?

116
0:06:42.73,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Are you a journalist? NGO? Politics?

117
0:06:45.734,000 --> 0:06:48,000
What kind of problems are you going to study?"

118
0:06:48.872,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Well, I was there to research

119
0:06:51.482,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually —

120
0:06:54.44,000 --> 0:06:57,000
incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya,

121
0:06:57.575,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which is absolutely unknown outside of the region.

122
0:07:02.849,000 --> 0:07:04,000
As soon as people understood

123
0:07:04.903,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that I would give them those films —

124
0:07:07.343,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license,

125
0:07:09.953,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but I would also really give them to the people

126
0:07:11.955,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and I would let them do what they want with it.

127
0:07:13.767,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I just want to represent them in a beautiful light.

128
0:07:15.69,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I just want to portray them in a way that

129
0:07:18.378,000 --> 0:07:21,000
their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather,

130
0:07:21.649,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and they're going to be like,

131
0:07:23.204,000 --> 0:07:28,000
"Whoa, my grandfather is as cool as Beyoncé." (Laughter)

132
0:07:28.288,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It's a really important thing.

133
0:07:30.144,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Applause)

134
0:07:33.643,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's really important,

135
0:07:34.948,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because that's the way

136
0:07:36.604,000 --> 0:07:39,000
people are going to look differently at their own culture, at their own land.

137
0:07:40.43,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They're going to think about it differently.

138
0:07:42.614,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It may be a way to maintain a certain diversity.

139
0:07:49.256,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Why you will record?

140
0:07:52.549,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Hmm. There's a really good quote

141
0:07:54.71,000 --> 0:07:55,000
by American thinker Hakim Bey

142
0:07:56.634,000 --> 0:07:59,000
which says, "Every recording

143
0:08:00.06,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is a tombstone of a live performance."

144
0:08:03.966,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's a really good sentence to keep in mind

145
0:08:06.981,000 --> 0:08:09,000
nowadays in an era saturated by images.

146
0:08:10.889,000 --> 0:08:11,000
What's the point of that?

147
0:08:12.409,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Where do we go with it?

148
0:08:15.189,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I was researching. I was still keeping this idea in mind:

149
0:08:18.47,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What's the point?

150
0:08:21.085,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I was researching on music, trying to pull,

151
0:08:23.305,000 --> 0:08:25,000
trying to get closer to a certain origin of it.

152
0:08:26.173,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Where is this all coming from?

153
0:08:28.367,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I am French. I had no idea about

154
0:08:30.718,000 --> 0:08:32,000
what I would discover, which is a very simple thing:

155
0:08:33.164,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Everything was sacred, at first,

156
0:08:35.949,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and music was spiritual healing.

157
0:08:41.472,000 --> 0:08:44,000
How could I use my camera,

158
0:08:44.767,000 --> 0:08:48,000
my little tool, to get closer

159
0:08:49.255,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and maybe not only capture the trance

160
0:08:51.701,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but find an equivalent, a cine-trance, maybe,

161
0:08:57.595,000 --> 0:08:59,000
something in complete harmony

162
0:09:00.047,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with the people?

163
0:09:02.815,000 --> 0:09:06,000
That is now my new research I'm doing

164
0:09:07.154,000 --> 0:09:11,000
on spirituality, on new spirits around the world.

165
0:09:11.575,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Maybe a few more extracts now.

166
0:09:19.913,000 --> 0:09:23,000
From the Tana Toraja funeral ritual in Indonesia

167
0:09:29.127,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to an Easter ceremony in the north of Ethiopia.

168
0:09:35.629,000 --> 0:09:37,000
From jathilan, a popular trance ritual

169
0:09:38.198,000 --> 0:09:41,000
on the island of Java,

170
0:09:42.27,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to Umbanda in the north of Brazil.

171
0:09:50.58,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The Sufi rituals of Chechnya

172
0:09:57.386,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to a mass in the holiest church of Armenia.

173
0:10:06.846,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Some Sufi songs in Harar,

174
0:10:08.691,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the holy city of Ethiopia,

175
0:10:14.102,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to an ayahuasca ceremony

176
0:10:16.281,000 --> 0:10:2,000
deep in the Amazon of Peru with the Shipibo.

177
0:10:23.996,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Then to my new project, the one I'm doing now

178
0:10:26.162,000 --> 0:10:27,000
here in Brazil, named "Híbridos."

179
0:10:27.798,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon.

180
0:10:29.584,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's research on the new spiritualities all around the country.

181
0:10:34.547,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This is my quest, my own little quest of what I call experimental ethnography,

182
0:10:40.505,000 --> 0:10:48,000
trying to hybrid all those different genres,

183
0:10:48.773,000 --> 0:10:51,000
trying to regain a certain complexity.

184
0:10:53.485,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Why do we record?

185
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I was still there.

186
0:10:58.681,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I really believe cinema teaches us to see.

187
0:11:02.494,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The way we show the world

188
0:11:03.9,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is going to change the way we see this world,

189
0:11:08.15,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and we live in a moment where the mass media

190
0:11:10.29,000 --> 0:11:12,000
are doing a terrible, terrible job

191
0:11:12.899,000 --> 0:11:14,000
at representing the world:

192
0:11:15.126,000 --> 0:11:19,000
violence, extremists,

193
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
only spectacular events,

194
0:11:21.314,000 --> 0:11:23,000
only simplifications of everyday life.

195
0:11:23.541,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I think we are recording

196
0:11:25.666,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to regain a certain complexity.

197
0:11:29.252,000 --> 0:11:34,000
To reinvent life today,

198
0:11:34.423,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we have to make new forms of images.

199
0:11:38.213,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And it's very simple.

200
0:11:40.377,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Muito obrigado.

201
0:11:43.06,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Applause)

202
0:11:54.204,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Bruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.

203
0:11:57.263,000 --> 0:12:,000
Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance,

204
0:12:00.301,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and I have a question for you, and the question is this:

205
0:12:02.888,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You show up in places like the ones you just have shown us,

206
0:12:06.914,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and you are carrying a camera

207
0:12:08.818,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and I assume that you are welcome

208
0:12:11.313,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but you are not always absolutely welcome.

209
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You walk into sacred rituals,

210
0:12:16.634,000 --> 0:12:19,000
private moments in a village, a town,

211
0:12:20.471,000 --> 0:12:22,000
a group of people.

212
0:12:22.68,000 --> 0:12:23,000
How do you break the barrier

213
0:12:24.576,000 --> 0:12:26,000
when you show up with a lens?

214
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:32,000
VM: I think you break it with your body,

215
0:12:32.605,000 --> 0:12:34,000
more than with your knowledge.

216
0:12:35.243,000 --> 0:12:37,000
That's what it taught me to travel,

217
0:12:37.61,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to trust the memory of the body

218
0:12:40.433,000 --> 0:12:42,000
more than the memory of the brain.

219
0:12:43.083,000 --> 0:12:45,000
The respect is stepping forward,

220
0:12:45.395,000 --> 0:12:47,000
not stepping backward, and I really think that

221
0:12:48.24,000 --> 0:12:5,000
by engaging your body in the moment, in the ceremony,

222
0:12:51.19,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in the places, people welcome you

223
0:12:53.553,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and understand your energy.

224
0:12:55.237,000 --> 0:12:56,000
BG: You told me that most of the videos

225
0:12:56.9,000 --> 0:12:58,000
you have made are actually one single shot.

226
0:12:59.569,000 --> 0:13:,000
You don't do much editing.

227
0:13:01.177,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I mean, you edited the ones for us

228
0:13:02.921,000 --> 0:13:04,000
at the beginning of the sessions because of the length, etc.

229
0:13:05.486,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Otherwise, you just go in and capture

230
0:13:07.313,000 --> 0:13:08,000
whatever happens in front of your eyes

231
0:13:09.119,000 --> 0:13:11,000
without much planning, and so is that the case?

232
0:13:11.853,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's correct?

233
0:13:13.586,000 --> 0:13:15,000
VM: My idea is that I think that

234
0:13:15.594,000 --> 0:13:19,000
as long as we don't cut, in a way,

235
0:13:19.614,000 --> 0:13:22,000
as long as we let the viewer watch,

236
0:13:22.719,000 --> 0:13:24,000
more and more viewers are going to feel closer,

237
0:13:25.688,000 --> 0:13:27,000
are going to get closer to the moment,

238
0:13:28.501,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to that moment and to that place.

239
0:13:32.337,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I really think of that as a matter of respecting the viewer,

240
0:13:35.869,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to not cut all the time from one place to another,

241
0:13:39.581,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to just let the time go.

242
0:13:41.645,000 --> 0:13:43,000
BG: Tell me in a few words about your new project,

243
0:13:43.749,000 --> 0:13:44,000
"Híbridos," here in Brazil.

244
0:13:45.284,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Just before coming to TEDGlobal, you have actually

245
0:13:47.062,000 --> 0:13:49,000
been traveling around the country for that.

246
0:13:49.333,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Tell us a couple of things.

247
0:13:51.156,000 --> 0:13:53,000
VM: "Híbridos" is — I really believe Brazil,

248
0:13:53.485,000 --> 0:13:57,000
far from the cliches, is the greatest religious country in the world,

249
0:13:57.658,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the greatest country in terms of spirituality

250
0:14:00.504,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and in experimentations in spiritualities.

251
0:14:03.541,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And it's a big project I'm doing over this year,

252
0:14:06.515,000 --> 0:14:1,000
which is researching in very different regions of Brazil,

253
0:14:11.315,000 --> 0:14:13,000
in very different forms of cults,

254
0:14:13.42,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and trying to understand how people live together

255
0:14:15.308,000 --> 0:14:16,000
with spirituality nowadays.

256
0:14:16.753,000 --> 0:14:19,000
BG: The man who is going to appear onstage momentarily,

257
0:14:20.489,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and Vincent's going to introduce him,

258
0:14:22.199,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is one of the subjects of one of his past videos.

259
0:14:25.851,000 --> 0:14:26,000
When did you do a video with him?

260
0:14:27.718,000 --> 0:14:29,000
VM: I guess four years ago,

261
0:14:30.272,000 --> 0:14:32,000
four years in my first travel.

262
0:14:32.758,000 --> 0:14:34,000
BG: So it was one of your first ones in Brazil.

263
0:14:35.602,000 --> 0:14:37,000
VM: It was amongst the first ones in Brazil, yeah.

264
0:14:37.833,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I shot the film in Recife,

265
0:14:39.29,000 --> 0:14:4,000
in the place where he is from.

266
0:14:41.259,000 --> 0:14:44,000
BG: So let's introduce him. Who are we waiting for?

267
0:14:44.269,000 --> 0:14:45,000
VM: I'll just make it very short.

268
0:14:45.74,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It's a very great honor for me to welcome onstage

269
0:14:48.343,000 --> 0:14:5,000
one of the greatest Brazilian musicians of all time.

270
0:14:51.304,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos.

271
0:14:53.643,000 --> 0:14:54,000
BG: Naná Vasconcelos!

272
0:14:55.555,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Applause)

273
0:15:02.563,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Music)

274
0:19:19.657,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Naná Vasconcelos: Let's go to the jungle.

275
0:23:59.636,000 --> 0:24:03,000
(Applause)

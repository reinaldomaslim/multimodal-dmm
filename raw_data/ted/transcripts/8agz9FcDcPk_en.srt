1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's a great honor today

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to share with you

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The Digital Universe,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which was created for humanity

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to really see where we are

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in the universe.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
[The Himalayas.]

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Music)

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The flat horizon that we've evolved with

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
has been a metaphor for the

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
infinite: unbounded resources

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and unlimited capacity

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for disposal of waste.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It wasn't until we really

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
left Earth,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
got above the atmosphere

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and had seen the horizon

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
bend back on itself,

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that we could understand our planet

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as a limited condition.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The Digital Universe Atlas

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
has been built

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
at the American Museum of Natural History

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
over the past 12 years.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We maintain that,

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
put that together

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as a project

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to really chart the universe

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
across all scales.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
What we see here are satellites around the Earth

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and the Earth in proper registration

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
against the universe, as we see.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
NASA supported this work

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
12 years ago

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as part of the rebuilding

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of the Hayden Planetarium

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
so that we would share this with the world.

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The Digital Universe is the basis

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of our space show productions that we do --

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
our main space shows in the dome.

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But what you see here

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is the result of, actually, internships

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that we hosted with Linkoping University

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in Sweden.

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I've had 12 students work on this

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for their graduate work,

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and the result has been this software called Uniview

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and a company called SCISS in Sweden.

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This software

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
allows interactive use,

52
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
so this actual flight path

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and movie that we see here

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
was actually flown live.

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I captured this live from my laptop

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in a cafe called Earth Matters

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live,

58
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it was done

59
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
as a collaborative project

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art

61
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
for an exhibit

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
on comparative cosmology.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And so as we move out,

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we see continuously from our planet

65
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here,

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.

67
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
As we move out,

68
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the light from these distant galaxies

69
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
have taken so long,

70
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we're essentially backing up into the past.

71
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We back so far up

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we're finally seeing a containment around us --

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the afterglow of the Big Bang.

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This is the WMAP

75
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
microwave background

76
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that we see.

77
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
If we were outside this,

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.

80
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But this our containment of the visible universe.

81
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.

82
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Coming back quickly,

83
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning,

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but these are positions,

85
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the latest positions of exoplanets

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that we've mapped,

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
between several orders of magnitude

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to get down to where we see the solar system --

91
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
these are the paths of

92
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10,

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.

94
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Coming in closer,

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
picking up Earth,

96
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.

97
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This map can be updated,

98
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and we can add in new data.

99
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.

100
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
for the Cassini mission.

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But here we see the complex trajectory

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of the Cassini mission

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
color coded for different mission phases,

104
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
ingeniously developed so that

105
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan,

106
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which is larger that the planet Mercury,

107
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.

108
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This software allows us to come close

109
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and look at parts of this.

110
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This software can also be networked between domes.

111
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We have a growing user base of this,

112
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and we network domes.

113
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And we can network between domes and classrooms.

114
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We're actually sharing tours of the universe

115
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
with the first sub-Saharan

116
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
planetarium in Ghana

117
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
as well as

118
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
new libraries that have been built

119
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in the ghettos in Columbia

120
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and a high school

121
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in Cambodia.

122
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And the Cambodians have

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.

124
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This is an image from Saturday,

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.

126
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.

127
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This is Nepal.

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa,

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
right here in Tibet.

130
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But we can see the haze

131
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley

132
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
down below in India.

133
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is Nepal and Tibet.

134
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And just in closing,

135
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on --

136
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
here we see a bit of the snow

137
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that some of you may have had to brave in coming out --

138
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
so I'd like to just say

139
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that what the world needs now

140
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is a sense of being able to

141
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
look at ourselves in this much larger condition now

142
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and a much larger sense of what home is.

143
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Because our home is the universe,

144
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and we are the universe, essentially.

145
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We carry that in us.

146
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And to be able to see our context

147
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in this larger sense at all scales

148
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
helps us all, I think, in understanding

149
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
where we are and who we are in the universe.

150
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Thank you.

151
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Applause)

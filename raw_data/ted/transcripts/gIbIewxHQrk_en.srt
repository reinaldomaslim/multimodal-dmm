1
0:00:12.802,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I moved back home 15 years ago

2
0:00:16.577,000 --> 0:00:18,000
after a 20-year stay in the United States,

3
0:00:19.441,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and Africa called me back.

4
0:00:21.805,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I founded my country's first

5
0:00:25.346,000 --> 0:00:27,000
graphic design and new media college.

6
0:00:27.657,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts.

7
0:00:32.583,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The idea, the dream, was really for a sort of Bauhaus

8
0:00:36.82,000 --> 0:00:4,000
sort of school where new ideas were interrogated

9
0:00:41.426,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and investigated,

10
0:00:44.639,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the creation of a new visual language

11
0:00:47.399,000 --> 0:00:51,000
based on the African creative heritage.

12
0:00:52.38,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We offer a two-year diploma

13
0:00:55.805,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to talented students who have successfully completed

14
0:00:59.569,000 --> 0:01:01,000
their high school education.

15
0:01:01.749,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And typography's a very important part of the curriculum

16
0:01:04.686,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and we encourage our students to look inward for influence.

17
0:01:09.629,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Here's a poster designed by one of the students

18
0:01:11.995,000 --> 0:01:15,000
under the theme "Education is a right."

19
0:01:16.152,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Some logos designed by my students.

20
0:01:20.435,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Africa has had a long tradition of writing,

21
0:01:24.503,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but this is not such a well-known fact,

22
0:01:26.675,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and I wrote the book "Afrikan Alphabets" to address that.

23
0:01:30.608,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The different types of writing in Africa,

24
0:01:34.155,000 --> 0:01:36,000
first was proto-writing,

25
0:01:36.4,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as illustrated by Nsibidi,

26
0:01:38.568,000 --> 0:01:41,000
which is the writing system of a secret society

27
0:01:41.64,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria.

28
0:01:45.47,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So it's a special-interest writing system.

29
0:01:49.34,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The Akan of people of Ghana and [Cote d'Ivoire]

30
0:01:52.915,000 --> 0:01:56,000
developed Adinkra symbols some 400 years ago,

31
0:01:56.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and these are proverbs, historical sayings,

32
0:02:00.828,000 --> 0:02:02,000
objects, animals, plants,

33
0:02:03.538,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and my favorite Adinkra system

34
0:02:05.546,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is the first one at the top on the left.

35
0:02:07.922,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's called Sankofa.

36
0:02:08.924,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It means, "Return and get it." Learn from the past.

37
0:02:14.918,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This pictograph by the Jokwe people of Angola

38
0:02:17.719,000 --> 0:02:2,000
tells the story of the creation of the world.

39
0:02:21.538,000 --> 0:02:26,000
At the top is God, at the bottom is man, mankind,

40
0:02:26.942,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and on the left is the sun, on the right is the moon.

41
0:02:31.85,000 --> 0:02:34,000
All the paths lead to and from God.

42
0:02:35.705,000 --> 0:02:39,000
These secret societies of the Yoruba, Kongo

43
0:02:40.099,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and Palo religions

44
0:02:42.294,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in Nigeria, Congo and Angola respectively,

45
0:02:46.031,000 --> 0:02:49,000
developed this intricate writing system

46
0:02:49.955,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which is alive and well today in the New World

47
0:02:53.724,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti.

48
0:02:59.912,000 --> 0:03:02,000
In the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo,

49
0:03:03.208,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in the Ituri society,

50
0:03:06.099,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree,

51
0:03:09.87,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and the women, who are also the praise singers,

52
0:03:12.963,000 --> 0:03:14,000
paint interweaving patterns

53
0:03:15.644,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that are the same in structure

54
0:03:18.374,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as the polyphonic structures that they use in their singing --

55
0:03:23.029,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a sort of a musical score, if you may.

56
0:03:27.017,000 --> 0:03:29,000
In South Africa, Ndebele women

57
0:03:29.766,000 --> 0:03:32,000
use these symbols and other geometric patterns

58
0:03:33.124,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to paint their homes in bright colors,

59
0:03:36.938,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and the Zulu women use the symbols

60
0:03:39.86,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in the beads that they weave

61
0:03:41.358,000 --> 0:03:44,000
into bracelets and necklaces.

62
0:03:44.501,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Ethiopia has had the longest tradition of writing,

63
0:03:48.58,000 --> 0:03:5,000
with the Ethiopic script that was developed

64
0:03:50.899,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in the fourth century A.D.

65
0:03:52.861,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and is used to write Amharic,

66
0:03:55.375,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which is spoken by over 24 million people.

67
0:03:58.66,000 --> 0:04:02,000
King Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum Kingdom of Cameroon

68
0:04:03.117,000 --> 0:04:06,000
developed Shü-mom at the age of 25.

69
0:04:06.682,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Shü-mom is a writing system.

70
0:04:08.769,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's a syllabary. It's not exactly an alphabet.

71
0:04:11.762,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And here we see three stages of development

72
0:04:15.077,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that it went through in 30 years.

73
0:04:19.716,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The Vai people of Liberia had a long tradition of literacy

74
0:04:25.276,000 --> 0:04:28,000
before their first contact with Europeans in the 1800s.

75
0:04:29.211,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's a syllabary and reads from left to right.

76
0:04:33.793,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Next door, in Sierra Leone, the Mende

77
0:04:37.364,000 --> 0:04:38,000
also developed a syllabary,

78
0:04:39.387,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but theirs reads from right to left.

79
0:04:43.019,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Africa has had a long tradition of design,

80
0:04:46.409,000 --> 0:04:49,000
a well-defined design sensibility,

81
0:04:50.032,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but the problem in Africa has been that,

82
0:04:52.334,000 --> 0:04:54,000
especially today, designers in Africa

83
0:04:55.032,000 --> 0:04:57,000
struggle with all forms of design

84
0:04:57.566,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because they are more apt to look outward

85
0:05:02.072,000 --> 0:05:04,000
for influence and inspiration.

86
0:05:04.7,000 --> 0:05:08,000
The creative spirit in Africa, the creative tradition,

87
0:05:08.897,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is as potent as it has always been,

88
0:05:11.773,000 --> 0:05:15,000
if only designers could look within.

89
0:05:15.82,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This Ethiopic cross illustrates

90
0:05:18.711,000 --> 0:05:2,000
what Dr. Ron Eglash has established:

91
0:05:21.491,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that Africa has a lot to contribute to computing

92
0:05:25.38,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals.

93
0:05:30.756,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Africans of antiquity created civilization,

94
0:05:34.823,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and their monuments, which still stand today,

95
0:05:38.136,000 --> 0:05:41,000
are a true testimony of their greatness.

96
0:05:41.72,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Most probably, one of humanity's greatest achievements

97
0:05:45.638,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is the invention of the alphabet,

98
0:05:48.604,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and that has been attributed to Mesopotamia

99
0:05:51.722,000 --> 0:05:56,000
with their invention of cuneiform in 1600 BC,

100
0:05:57.287,000 --> 0:06:,000
followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt,

101
0:06:01.025,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact.

102
0:06:06.494,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That is, until 1998,

103
0:06:09.208,000 --> 0:06:14,000
when one Yale professor John Coleman Darnell

104
0:06:14.327,000 --> 0:06:17,000
discovered these inscriptions in the Thebes desert

105
0:06:17.717,000 --> 0:06:2,000
on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt,

106
0:06:21.077,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and these have been dated at between 1800 and 1900 B.C.,

107
0:06:27.313,000 --> 0:06:29,000
centuries before Mesopotamia.

108
0:06:30.322,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Called Wadi el-Hol

109
0:06:33.25,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because of the place that they were discovered,

110
0:06:36.456,000 --> 0:06:39,000
these inscriptions -- research is still going on,

111
0:06:39.861,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a few of them have been deciphered,

112
0:06:42.659,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but there is consensus among scholars

113
0:06:45.166,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that this is really humanity's first alphabet.

114
0:06:50.383,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Over here, you see a paleographic chart

115
0:06:53.427,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that shows what has been deciphered so far,

116
0:06:56.544,000 --> 0:06:59,000

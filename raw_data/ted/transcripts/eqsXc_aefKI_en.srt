1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's great being here at TED.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You know, I think there might be some presentations

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that will go over my head,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but the most amazing concepts

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are the ones that go right under my feet.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The little things in life,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
sometimes that we forget about,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
like pollination, that we take for granted.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And you can't tell the story about pollinators --

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies --

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
without telling the story about the invention of flowers

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and how they co-evolved

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
over 50 million years.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I've been filming time-lapse flowers

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
24 hours a day, seven days a week,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for over 35 years.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
To watch them move

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is a dance I'm never going to get tired of.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Beauty and seduction, I believe,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is nature's tool for survival,

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because we will protect what we fall in love with.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Their relationship

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is a love story that feeds the Earth.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It reminds us that we are a part of nature,

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and we're not separate from it.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it motivated me to take action.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We depend on pollinators

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And many scientists believe

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it's the most serious issue facing mankind.

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's like the canary in the coalmine.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
If they disappear, so do we.

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It reminds us that we are a part of nature

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and we need to take care of it.

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What motivated me to film their behavior

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
was something that I asked my scientific advisers:

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"What motivates the pollinators?"

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Well, their answer was,

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"It's all about risk and reward."

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?"

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive."

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I go, "Why?"

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"Well, in order to reproduce."

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"Well, why?"

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex."

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert,

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
he replied, "Nothing lasts forever.

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Everything in the universe wears out."

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And that blew my mind.

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Because I realized

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that nature had invented reproduction

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
as a mechanism for life to move forward,

55
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
as a life force that passes right through us

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and makes us a link in the evolution of life.

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Rarely seen by the naked eye,

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
this intersection

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
between the animal world and the plant world

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is truly a magic moment.

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's the mystical moment

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where life regenerates itself,

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
over and over again.

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So here is some nectar from my film.

65
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I hope you'll drink, tweet

66
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and plant some seeds

67
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to pollinate a friendly garden.

68
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And always take time to smell the flowers,

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and let it fill you with beauty,

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and rediscover that sense of wonder.

71
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Here are some images from the film.

72
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Music)

73
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Applause)

74
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Thank you.

75
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Thank you very much.

76
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

77
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Thank you.

78
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Applause)

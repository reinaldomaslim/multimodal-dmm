1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My name is Jonathan Zittrain,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist.

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist,

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and give reason to hope

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
for the future of the Internet

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
by drawing upon its present.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before.

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
People are less kind. There is less trust around.

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I don't know. As a simple example,

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we could run a test here.

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
How many people have ever hitchhiked?

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I know. How many people have hitchhiked

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
within the past 10 years?

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Right. So what has changed?

15
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's not better public transportation.

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So that's one reason to think that we might be

17
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
declensionists, going in the wrong direction.

18
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But I want to give you three examples

19
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to try to say that the trend line

20
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is in fact in the other direction,

21
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and it's the Internet helping it along.

22
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So example number one: the Internet itself.

23
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
These are three of the founders of the Internet.

24
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They were actually high school classmates together

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
at the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the 1960s.

26
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You might have had a French club or a Debate club.

27
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They had a "Let's build a global network" club,

28
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and it worked out very well.

29
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They are pictured here for their 25th anniversary

30
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Newsweek retrospective on the Internet.

31
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And as you can tell,

32
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
they are basically goof balls.

33
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They had one great limitation

34
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and one great freedom

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
as they tried to conceive of a global network.

36
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The limitation was that they didn't have any money.

37
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
No particular amount of capital to invest,

38
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of the sort that for a physical network

39
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you might need for trucks and people

40
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and a hub to move packages around overnight.

41
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They had none of that.

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But they had an amazing freedom,

43
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
which was they didn't have to make any money from it.

44
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The Internet has no business plan, never did.

45
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
No CEO,

46
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
no firm responsible, singly, for building it.

47
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Instead, it's folks getting together

48
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to do something for fun,

49
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
rather than because they were told to,

50
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it.

51
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
That ethos led to a network architecture,

52
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
a structure that was unlike

53
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
other digital networks then or since.

54
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So unusual, in fact,

55
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work.

56
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
As late as 1992, IBM was known to say

57
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
you couldn't possibly build a corporate network

58
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
using Internet Protocol.

59
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And even some Internet engineers today say

60
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out.

61
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That's why the mascot of Internet engineering,

63
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
if it had one, is said to be the bumblebee.

64
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Because the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee

65
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is far too large for it to be able to fly.

66
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies.

67
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I'm pleased to say that, thanks to massive government funding,

68
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
about three years ago we finally figured out

69
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
how bees fly.

70
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's very complicated, but it turns out they

72
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
flap their wings very quickly.

73
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So what is this bizarre architecture configuration

75
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that makes the network sing and be so unusual?

76
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Well, to move data around

77
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
from one place to another -- again, it's not like a package courier.

78
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's more like a mosh pit.

79
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Imagine, you being part of a network

81
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
where, you're maybe at a sporting event,

82
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and you're sitting in rows like this,

83
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and somebody asks for a beer,

84
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and it gets handed at the aisle.

85
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And your neighborly duty

86
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is to pass the beer along,

87
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
at risk to your own trousers,

88
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to get it to the destination.

89
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
No one pays you to do this.

90
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's just part of your neighborly duty.

91
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And, in a way, that's exactly how packets move around the Internet,

92
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
sometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops,

93
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with the intervening entities

94
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that are passing the data around

95
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
having no particular contractual or legal obligation

96
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to the original sender

97
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or to the receiver.

98
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now, of course, in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination.

99
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You need a lot of trust,

100
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but it's not like, "I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please."

101
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So the Internet needs addressing and directions.

102
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet.

103
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Instead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater,

104
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but we can only see amidst the fog

105
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the people immediately around us.

106
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So what do we do to figure out who is where?

107
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We turn to the person on the right,

108
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and we tell that person what we see on our left,

109
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and vice versa.

110
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it,

111
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
you have a general sense of where everything is.

112
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.

113
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust,

114
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable.

115
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
In rare but striking instances,

116
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a single lie told by just one entity

117
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in this honeycomb

118
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
can lead to real trouble.

119
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So, for example, last year,

120
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the government of Pakistan

121
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
asked its Internet service providers there

122
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.

123
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There was a video there that the government did not like

124
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and they wanted to make sure it was blocked.

125
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere

126
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are often trying to block

127
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and filter and censor content on the Internet.

128
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Well this one ISP in Pakistan

129
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers

130
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in a rather unusual way.

131
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It advertised --

132
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet,

133
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to declare what you see near you -- it advertised

134
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find

135
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that it was YouTube.

136
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
"That's right," it said, "I am YouTube."

137
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Which meant that packets of data

138
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
from subscribers going to YouTube

139
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
stopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there,

140
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and the ISP threw them away unopened

141
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
because the point was to block it.

142
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But it didn't stop there.

143
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You see, that announcement

144
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
went one click out,

145
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
which got reverberated, one click out.

146
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And it turns out that as you look

147
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
at the postmortem of this event,

148
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
you have at one moment

149
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
perfectly working YouTube.

150
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Then, at moment number two,

151
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
you have the fake announcement go out.

152
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And within two minutes,

153
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it reverberates around

154
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world.

155
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube,

156
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
your packets were going to Pakistan

157
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and they weren't coming back.

158
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Now just think about that.

159
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
One of the most popular websites in the world,

160
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
run by the most powerful company in the world,

161
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and there was nothing that YouTube or Google

162
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
were particularly privileged to do about it.

163
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And yet, somehow, within about two hours,

164
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the problem was fixed.

165
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
How did this happen?

166
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG.

167
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The North American Network Operators Group,

168
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
a group of people who,

169
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
on a beautiful day outside,

170
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
enter into a windowless room,

171
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
at their terminals

172
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
reading email and messages

173
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in fixed proportion font, like this,

174
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and they talk about networks.

175
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And some of them are mid-level employees at Internet service providers

176
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
around the world.

177
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And here is the message where one of them says,

178
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
"Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube!

179
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
This is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness

180
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
of YouTube engineers. I promise.

181
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Something is up in Pakistan."

182
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And they came together to help find the problem and fix it.

183
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So it's kind of like if your house catches on fire.

184
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The bad news is there is no fire brigade.

185
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The good news is random people apparate from nowhere,

186
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise.

187
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Applause)

188
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I was trying to think of the right model to describe

189
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
this form of random acts of kindness

190
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
by geeky strangers.

191
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

192
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You know, it's just like the hail goes out

193
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and people are ready to help.

194
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it.

195
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Example number two: Wikipedia.

196
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
If a man named Jimbo came up to you in 2001

197
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and said, "I've got a great idea! We start with seven articles

198
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that anybody can edit anything, at any time,

199
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and we'll get a great encyclopedia! Eh?"

200
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Right. Dumbest idea ever.

201
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

202
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid

203
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that even Jimbo never had it.

204
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Jimbo's idea was for Nupedia.

205
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money

206
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because he was feeling like a good guy,

207
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and the money would go to the people

208
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and they would write the articles.

209
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The wiki was introduced

210
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
so others could make suggestions on edits --

211
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
as almost an afterthought, a back room.

212
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And then it turns out the back room grew

213
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to encompass the entire project.

214
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous

215
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus.

216
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

217
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I am not making this up.

218
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I have a theory I can explain later.

220
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia

221
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
stir-fried with pimentos.

222
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work.

224
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
How does it really work? It turns out

225
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
there is a back room that is kind of windowless,

226
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
metaphorically speaking.

227
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And there are a bunch of people who, on a sunny day,

228
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
would rather be inside

229
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and monitoring this, the administrator's notice board,

230
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
itself a wiki page that anyone can edit.

231
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And you just bring your problems to the page.

232
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's reminiscent of the description of history

233
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
as "one damn thing after another," right?

234
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Number one: "Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil."

235
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Apologies, Andyvphil, if you're here today.

236
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I'm not taking sides.

237
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
"Anon attacking me for reverting."

238
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Here is my favorite: "A long story."

239
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems

241
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and wanting to solve them

242
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
than there are problems arising on the page.

243
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat.

244
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
At all times, Wikipedia is approximately

245
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right?

246
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
There are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article

247
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
into an ad for a Rolex watch.

248
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Laughter)

249
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's this thin geeky line

250
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that keeps it going.

251
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Not because it's a job,

252
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
not because it's a career,

253
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but because it's a calling.

254
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's something they feel impelled to do

255
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because they care about it.

256
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They even gather together in such groups

257
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
as the Counter-Vandalism Unit --

258
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
"Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" --

259
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to just clean up the pages.

260
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It does make you wonder if there were, for instance,

261
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
a massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend,

262
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
who would be minding the store?

263
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Laughter)

264
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So what we see --

265
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Laughter)

266
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
what we see in this phenomenon

267
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is something that the crazed, late traffic engineer

268
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands,

269
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and here in South Kensington, that sometimes

270
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else,

271
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you can actually end up

272
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
with a safer environment in which people can function,

273
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and one in which they are more human with each other.

274
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
They're realizing that they

275
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
have to take responsibility for what they do.

276
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And Wikipedia has embraced this.

277
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid,

278
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever,

279
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
acting as if it were a light saber.

280
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The film, without his permission or even knowledge at first,

281
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
found its way onto the Internet.

282
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Hugely viral video. Extremely popular.

283
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Totally mortifying to him.

284
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Now, it being encyclopedic and all,

285
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.

286
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Every article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page,

287
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and on the discussion page

288
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
they had extensive argument among the Wikipedians

289
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
as to whether to have his real name

290
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
featured in the article.

291
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
You could see arguments on both sides.

292
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Here is just a snapshot of some of them.

293
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
They eventually decided --

294
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
not unanimously by any means --

295
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
not to include his real name,

296
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
despite the fact that nearly all media reports did.

297
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
They just didn't think it was the right thing to do.

298
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It was an act of kindness.

299
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid

300
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
has a warning right at the top

301
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that says you are not to put his real name on the page.

302
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
If you do, it will be removed immediately,

303
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision,

304
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but respect the outcome

305
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
and work to make it stay

306
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion.

307
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
As a lawyer, I've got to say these guys are inventing the law

308
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along.

309
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Now, this isn't just limited to Wikipedia.

310
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We see it on blogs all over the place.

311
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover.

312
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Wow. Blogs are going to change your business.

313
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I know they look silly. And sure they look silly.

314
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
They start off on all sorts of goofy projects.

315
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This is my favorite goofy blog:

316
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Catsthatlooklikehitler.com.

317
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Laughter)

318
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
You send in a picture of your cat

319
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
if it looks like Hitler.

320
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
(Laughter)

321
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Yeah, I know. Number four, it's like, can you imagine

322
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
coming home to that cat everyday?

323
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Laughter)

324
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
But then, you can see the same kind of whimsy

325
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
applied to people.

326
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture.

327
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
This one says, "Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence.

328
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Is that an animal carcass behind her?"

329
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Laughter)

330
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
You're like, "You know? I think that's an animal carcass

331
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
behind her."

332
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And it's one after the other.

333
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner.

334
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
That's it. Image removed at request of owner.

335
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
It turns out that somebody lampooned here

336
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
wrote to the snarky guy that does the site,

337
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment,

338
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but just said, "Hey, would you mind?"

339
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The person said, "No, that's fine."

340
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I believe we can build architectures online

341
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
to make such human requests

342
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that much easier to do,

343
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to make it possible for all of us to see

344
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that the data we encounter online

345
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward

346
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that actually represents human emotion

347
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and endeavor and impact,

348
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and to be able to have an ethical moment

349
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
where we decide how we want to treat it.

350
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I even think it can go into the real world.

351
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We can end up, as we get in a world with more censors --

352
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
everywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online --

353
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to be able to have a little clip you could wear

354
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that says, "You know, I'd rather not."

355
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And then have technology

356
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that the person taking the photo will know later,

357
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
this person requested to be contacted

358
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
before this goes anywhere big,

359
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
if you don't mind.

360
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And that person taking the photo can make a decision

361
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
about how and whether to respect it.

362
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
In the real world, we see filtering of this sort

363
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
taking place in Pakistan.

364
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And we now have means that we can build, like this system,

365
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it.

366
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on,"

367
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but suddenly a collective consciousness

368
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
about what is blocked and censored

369
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
where online.

370
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
In fact, talk about technology imitating life

371
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
imitating tech, or maybe it's the other way around.

372
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots

373
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
with smiley faces on them,

374
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and a motor that just drove them forward

375
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and a flag sticking out the back

376
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
with a desired destination.

377
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
It said, "Can you help me get there?"

378
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Released it on the streets of Manhattan.

379
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Laughter)

380
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
They'll fund anything these days.

381
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Here is the chart of over 43 people

382
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
helping to steer the robot that could not steer

383
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and get it on its way, from one corner

384
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
from one corner of Washington Square Park

385
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
to another.

386
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
That leads to example number three: hitchhiking.

387
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
I'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead.

388
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Why? There is the Craigslist rideshare board.

389
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board,

390
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
tumbleweeds would be blowing through it.

391
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
But it's the rideshare board, and it's basically the same thing.

392
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Now why are people using it?

393
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I don't know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers don't plan ahead?

394
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
(Laughter)

395
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
No. I think the actual answer is

396
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
that once you reframe it,

397
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
once you get out of one set of stale expectations

398
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
from a failed project that had its day,

399
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
but now, for whatever reason, is tarnished,

400
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing

401
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
that something like this on Craigslist represents.

402
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And then you can highlight it

403
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
into something like,

404
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
yes, CouchSurfing.org.

405
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
CouchSurfing: one guy's idea

406
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
to, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away

407
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free,

408
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
with people who live far away,

409
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free.

410
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
It's a brilliant idea.

411
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
It's a bee that, yes, flies.

412
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been.

413
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities

414
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
associated with CouchSurfing.

415
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
Although, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment,

416
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience,

417
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
so there may be some selection bias there.

418
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
(Laughter)

419
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
So, my urging, my thought,

420
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information.

421
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
It's not a noun. It's a verb.

422
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And when you go on it,

423
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
if you listen and see carefully and closely enough,

424
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
what you will discover

425
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
is that that information

426
0:19:30.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
is saying something to you.

427
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
What it's saying to you is what we heard yesterday,

428
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
Demosthenes was saying to us.

429
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:41,000
It's saying, "Let's march." Thank you very much.

430
0:19:41.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.895,000 --> 0:00:13,000
TED is 30.

2
0:00:14.543,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The world wide web is celebrating this month

3
0:00:17.181,000 --> 0:00:19,000
its 25th anniversary.

4
0:00:19.453,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So I've got a question for you.

5
0:00:22.142,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Let's talk about the journey, mainly about the future.

6
0:00:26.966,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Let's talk about the state.

7
0:00:28.681,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Let's talk about what sort of a web we want.

8
0:00:30.995,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN.

9
0:00:34.315,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I got permission in the end after about a year

10
0:00:36.665,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to basically do it as a side project.

11
0:00:39.297,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I wrote the code.

12
0:00:40.995,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was I suppose the first user.

13
0:00:43.144,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There was a lot of concern

14
0:00:45.687,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that people didn't want to pick it up

15
0:00:47.206,000 --> 0:00:48,000
because it would be too complicated.

16
0:00:49.03,000 --> 0:00:5,000
A lot of persuasion, a lot of wonderful

17
0:00:50.749,000 --> 0:00:51,000
collaboration with other people,

18
0:00:52.459,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and bit by bit, it worked.

19
0:00:54.888,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It took off. It was pretty cool.

20
0:00:56.531,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And in fact, a few years later in 2000,

21
0:00:59.748,000 --> 0:01:03,000
five percent of the world population

22
0:01:03.95,000 --> 0:01:04,000
were using the world wide web.

23
0:01:05.769,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In 2007, seven years later, 17 percent.

24
0:01:08.48,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In 2008, we formed the World Wide Web Foundation

25
0:01:11.82,000 --> 0:01:12,000
partly to look at that

26
0:01:13.394,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and worry about that figure.

27
0:01:16.244,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And now here we are in 2014,

28
0:01:18.303,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and 40 percent of the world

29
0:01:20.537,000 --> 0:01:24,000
are using the world wide web, and counting.

30
0:01:24.553,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Obviously it's increasing.

31
0:01:26.555,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I want you to think about both sides of that.

32
0:01:29.963,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Okay, obviously to anybody here at TED,

33
0:01:32.18,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the first question you ask is, what can we do

34
0:01:35.163,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to get the other 60 percent on board

35
0:01:37.219,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as quickly as possible?

36
0:01:38.539,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Lots of important things. Obviously it's going to be around mobile.

37
0:01:40.854,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But also, I want you to think about the 40 percent,

38
0:01:42.834,000 --> 0:01:43,000
because if you're sitting there yourself

39
0:01:44.544,000 --> 0:01:46,000
sort of with a web-enabled life,

40
0:01:47.17,000 --> 0:01:48,000
you don't remember things anymore,

41
0:01:48.466,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you just look them up,

42
0:01:50.18,000 --> 0:01:54,000
then you may feel that it's been a success

43
0:01:54.263,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and we can all sit back.

44
0:01:56.243,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But in fact, yeah, it's been a success,

45
0:01:59.326,000 --> 0:02:,000
there's lots of things, Khan Academy

46
0:02:01.272,000 --> 0:02:03,000
for crying out loud, there's Wikipedia,

47
0:02:03.561,000 --> 0:02:04,000
there's a huge number of free e-books

48
0:02:05.378,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that you can read online,

49
0:02:06.784,000 --> 0:02:07,000
lots of wonderful things for education,

50
0:02:08.552,000 --> 0:02:09,000
things in many areas.

51
0:02:10.276,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Online commerce has in some cases

52
0:02:12.678,000 --> 0:02:14,000
completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether,

53
0:02:15.469,000 --> 0:02:16,000
made types of commerce available

54
0:02:17.024,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which weren't available at all before.

55
0:02:19.35,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Commerce has been almost universally affected.

56
0:02:22.732,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Government, not universally affected,

57
0:02:24.999,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but very affected, and on a good day,

58
0:02:27.112,000 --> 0:02:29,000
lots of open data, lots of e-government,

59
0:02:30.08,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so lots of things which are visible

60
0:02:32.783,000 --> 0:02:33,000
happening on the web.

61
0:02:34.411,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Also, lots of things which are less visible.

62
0:02:36.522,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The healthcare, late at night when they're worried

63
0:02:38.925,000 --> 0:02:39,000
about what sort of cancer

64
0:02:40.636,000 --> 0:02:42,000
somebody they care about might have,

65
0:02:42.761,000 --> 0:02:47,000
when they just talk across the Internet to somebody

66
0:02:47.767,000 --> 0:02:51,000
who they care about very much in another country.

67
0:02:52.276,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Those sorts of things are not, they're not out there,

68
0:02:56.495,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy.

69
0:02:59.715,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So we cannot assume that part of the web,

70
0:03:02.499,000 --> 0:03:03,000
part of the deal with the web,

71
0:03:03.59,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is when I use the web,

72
0:03:05.026,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it's just a transparent, neutral medium.

73
0:03:08.416,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I can talk to you over it without worrying

74
0:03:10.952,000 --> 0:03:12,000
about what we in fact now know is happening,

75
0:03:13.811,000 --> 0:03:15,000
without worrying about the fact

76
0:03:16.261,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that not only will surveillance be happening

77
0:03:18.207,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data.

78
0:03:21.245,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So in fact, something we realized,

79
0:03:22.451,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we can't just use the web,

80
0:03:23.86,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we have to worry about

81
0:03:25.545,000 --> 0:03:28,000
what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing,

82
0:03:29.119,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is it in fact of a quality that we need?

83
0:03:33.315,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech.

84
0:03:38.264,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people

85
0:03:41.302,000 --> 0:03:43,000
can see our tweets, except when they can't,

86
0:03:44.227,000 --> 0:03:47,000
except when actually Twitter is blocked from their country,

87
0:03:47.578,000 --> 0:03:5,000
or in some way the way we try to express ourselves

88
0:03:50.921,000 --> 0:03:52,000
has put some information about the state of ourselves,

89
0:03:53.856,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the state of the country we live in,

90
0:03:55.219,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which isn't available to anybody else.

91
0:03:57.703,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So we must protest and make sure

92
0:04:00.684,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that censorship is cut down,

93
0:04:02.808,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that the web is opened up

94
0:04:04.382,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where there is censorship.

95
0:04:06.839,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We love the fact that the web is open.

96
0:04:09.549,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody.

97
0:04:11.754,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It doesn't matter who we are.

98
0:04:13.592,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And then we join these big

99
0:04:14.929,000 --> 0:04:16,000
social networking companies

100
0:04:17.582,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which are in fact effectively built as silos,

101
0:04:20.944,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so that it's much easier to talk to somebody

102
0:04:22.733,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in the same social network

103
0:04:24.567,000 --> 0:04:26,000
than it is to talk to somebody in a different one,

104
0:04:26.89,000 --> 0:04:3,000
so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves.

105
0:04:31.264,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And we also have, if you've read the book about the filter bubble,

106
0:04:34.19,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the filter bubble phenomenon is that

107
0:04:36.158,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we love to use machines

108
0:04:37.96,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which help us find stuff we like.

109
0:04:40.092,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So we love it when we're bathed in

110
0:04:42.434,000 --> 0:04:43,000
what things we like to click on,

111
0:04:44.166,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and so the machine automatically feeds us

112
0:04:46.326,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the stuff that we like and we end up

113
0:04:47.81,000 --> 0:04:51,000
with this rose-colored spectacles view of the world

114
0:04:52.071,000 --> 0:04:54,000
called a filter bubble.

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So here are some of the things which maybe

116
0:04:56.203,000 --> 0:04:59,000
threaten the social web we have.

117
0:04:59.295,000 --> 0:05:,000
What sort of web do you want?

118
0:05:01.224,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces,

119
0:05:04.662,000 --> 0:05:06,000
as some countries have been suggesting

120
0:05:06.845,000 --> 0:05:09,000
they should do in reaction to recent surveillance.

121
0:05:09.945,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I want a web which has got, for example,

122
0:05:13.628,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is a really good basis for democracy.

123
0:05:16.588,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I want a web where I can use healthcare

124
0:05:21.165,000 --> 0:05:22,000
with privacy and where there's a lot

125
0:05:22.92,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of health data, clinical data is available

126
0:05:25.09,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to scientists to do research.

127
0:05:27.02,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I want a web where the other 60 percent

128
0:05:30.71,000 --> 0:05:32,000
get on board as fast as possible.

129
0:05:33.05,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation

130
0:05:37.668,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that when something nasty happens,

131
0:05:39.051,000 --> 0:05:41,000
some disaster strikes, that we can respond

132
0:05:41.38,000 --> 0:05:44,000
by building stuff to respond to it very quickly.

133
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So this is just some of the things that I want,

134
0:05:48.09,000 --> 0:05:5,000
from a big list, obviously it's longer.

135
0:05:50.526,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You have your list.

136
0:05:51.767,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I want us to use this 25th anniversary

137
0:05:54.541,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to think about what sort of a web we want.

138
0:05:57.534,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You can go to webat25.org

139
0:05:59.233,000 --> 0:06:,000
and find some links.

140
0:06:00.236,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There are lots of sites where people

141
0:06:01.292,000 --> 0:06:03,000
have started to put together a Magna Carta,

142
0:06:04.004,000 --> 0:06:05,000
a bill of rights for the web.

143
0:06:05.53,000 --> 0:06:06,000
How about we do that?

144
0:06:07.043,000 --> 0:06:11,000
How about we decide, these are, in a way,

145
0:06:11.67,000 --> 0:06:14,000
becoming fundamental rights, the right to communicate with whom I want.

146
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
What would be on your list for that Magna Carta?

147
0:06:17.288,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta

148
0:06:20.156,000 --> 0:06:22,000
for the web.

149
0:06:22.398,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Let's do that this year.

150
0:06:24.49,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Let's use the energy from the 25th anniversary

151
0:06:27.797,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to crowdsource a Magna Carta

152
0:06:30.409,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to the web. (Applause)

153
0:06:31.891,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Thank you. And do me a favor, will you?

154
0:06:36.397,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Fight for it for me. Okay? Thanks.

155
0:06:38.963,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Applause)

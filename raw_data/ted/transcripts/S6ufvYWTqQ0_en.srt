1
0:00:12.3,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So I would like to start by telling you about one of my greatest friends,

2
0:00:17.02,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Okoloma Maduewesi.

3
0:00:19.54,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Okoloma lived on my street

4
0:00:21.18,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and looked after me like a big brother.

5
0:00:23.5,000 --> 0:00:26,000
If I liked a boy, I would ask Okoloma's opinion.

6
0:00:27.98,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Okoloma died in the notorious Sosoliso plane crash

7
0:00:31.86,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in Nigeria in December of 2005.

8
0:00:34.82,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Almost exactly seven years ago.

9
0:00:37.9,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Okoloma was a person I could argue with, laugh with and truly talk to.

10
0:00:43.5,000 --> 0:00:45,000
He was also the first person to call me a feminist.

11
0:00:47.34,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I was about fourteen, we were at his house, arguing.

12
0:00:50.78,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Both of us bristling with half bit knowledge

13
0:00:53.3,000 --> 0:00:54,000
from books that we had read.

14
0:00:55.38,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I don't remember what this particular argument was about,

15
0:00:59.14,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but I remember that as I argued and argued,

16
0:01:01.22,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Okoloma looked at me and said, "You know, you're a feminist."

17
0:01:05.7,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It was not a compliment.

18
0:01:06.94,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:08.38,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I could tell from his tone,

20
0:01:09.74,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the same tone that you would use to say something like,

21
0:01:12.54,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"You're a supporter of terrorism."

22
0:01:14.3,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:17.1,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I did not know exactly what this word "feminist" meant,

24
0:01:20.78,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I did not want Okoloma to know that I did not know.

25
0:01:24.02,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So I brushed it aside, and I continued to argue.

26
0:01:27.06,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And the first thing I planned to do when I got home

27
0:01:29.5,000 --> 0:01:31,000
was to look up the word "feminist" in the dictionary.

28
0:01:32.1,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now fast forward to some years later,

29
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I wrote a novel about a man who among other things beats his wife

30
0:01:39.42,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and whose story doesn't end very well.

31
0:01:42.42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
While I was promoting the novel in Nigeria,

32
0:01:44.5,000 --> 0:01:47,000
a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man,

33
0:01:47.54,000 --> 0:01:49,000
told me he wanted to advise me.

34
0:01:51.1,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And for the Nigerians here,

35
0:01:52.46,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I'm sure we're all familiar

36
0:01:53.98,000 --> 0:01:59,000
with how quick our people are to give unsolicited advice.

37
0:02:01.58,000 --> 0:02:04,000
He told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist

38
0:02:05.06,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and his advice to me --

39
0:02:06.7,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke --

40
0:02:09.9,000 --> 0:02:11,000
was that I should never call myself a feminist

41
0:02:12.1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
because feminists are women who are unhappy

42
0:02:14.7,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because they cannot find husbands.

43
0:02:16.66,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:21.1,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So I decided to call myself "a happy feminist."

45
0:02:24.86,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Then an academic, a Nigerian woman told me

46
0:02:27.54,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that feminism was not our culture

47
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and that feminism wasn't African,

48
0:02:30.9,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and that I was calling myself a feminist

49
0:02:32.86,000 --> 0:02:34,000
because I had been corrupted by "Western books."

50
0:02:35.94,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Which amused me,

51
0:02:37.18,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because a lot of my early readings were decidedly unfeminist.

52
0:02:40.54,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I think I must have read every single Mills & Boon romance published

53
0:02:43.78,000 --> 0:02:44,000
before I was sixteen.

54
0:02:45.78,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And each time I tried to read those books

55
0:02:47.78,000 --> 0:02:48,000
called "the feminist classics,"

56
0:02:49.62,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I'd get bored, and I really struggled to finish them.

57
0:02:52.42,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But anyway, since feminism was un-African,

58
0:02:55.18,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I decided that I would now call myself "a happy African feminist."

59
0:02:59.66,000 --> 0:03:03,000
At some point I was a happy African feminist who does not hate men

60
0:03:04.1,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and who likes lip gloss

61
0:03:05.46,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and who wears high heels for herself but not for men.

62
0:03:07.98,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:09.74,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Of course a lot of this was tongue-in-cheek,

64
0:03:11.94,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but that word feminist is so heavy with baggage, negative baggage.

65
0:03:16.58,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You hate men, you hate bras,

66
0:03:18.94,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you hate African culture, that sort of thing.

67
0:03:22.06,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now here's a story from my childhood.

68
0:03:24.82,000 --> 0:03:25,000
When I was in primary school,

69
0:03:26.62,000 --> 0:03:3,000
my teacher said at the beginning of term that she would give the class a test

70
0:03:31.18,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and whoever got the highest score would be the class monitor.

71
0:03:34.14,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, class monitor was a big deal.

72
0:03:37.06,000 --> 0:03:38,000
If you were a class monitor,

73
0:03:38.82,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you got to write down the names of noisemakers --

74
0:03:41.3,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:42.98,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which was having enough power of its own.

76
0:03:46.3,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But my teacher would also give you a cane to hold in your hand

77
0:03:51.1,000 --> 0:03:53,000
while you walk around and patrol the class for noisemakers.

78
0:03:55.18,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, of course you were not actually allowed to use the cane.

79
0:03:58.74,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But it was an exciting prospect for the nine-year-old me.

80
0:04:02.18,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I very much wanted to be the class monitor.

81
0:04:04.98,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And I got the highest score on the test.

82
0:04:07.62,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Then, to my surprise, my teacher said that the monitor had to be a boy.

83
0:04:12.06,000 --> 0:04:14,000
She had forgotten to make that clear earlier

84
0:04:14.18,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because she assumed it was ... obvious.

85
0:04:16.062,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:18.14,000 --> 0:04:2,000
A boy had the second highest score on the test,

87
0:04:20.94,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and he would be monitor.

88
0:04:23.78,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, what was even more interesting about this

89
0:04:25.98,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul

90
0:04:29.82,000 --> 0:04:31,000
who had no interest in patrolling the class with the cane,

91
0:04:33.94,000 --> 0:04:36,000
while I was full of ambition to do so.

92
0:04:38.38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But I was female and he was male,

93
0:04:40.5,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and so he became the class monitor.

94
0:04:43.06,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I've never forgotten that incident.

95
0:04:45.98,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I often make the mistake of thinking

96
0:04:47.9,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone else.

97
0:04:51.38,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now, take my dear friend Louis

98
0:04:52.98,000 --> 0:04:53,000
for example.

99
0:04:54.34,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Louis is a brilliant, progressive man,

100
0:04:56.22,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and we would have conversations and he would tell me,

101
0:04:58.74,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"I don't know what you mean by things being different or harder for women.

102
0:05:02.78,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Maybe in the past, but not now."

103
0:05:05.38,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I didn't understand how Louis could not see what seems so self-evident.

104
0:05:09.98,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Then one evening, in Lagos, Louis and I went out with friends.

105
0:05:14.14,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And for people here who are not familiar with Lagos,

106
0:05:16.62,000 --> 0:05:17,000
there's that wonderful Lagos' fixture,

107
0:05:18.54,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the sprinkling of energetic men who hang around outside establishments

108
0:05:23.22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and very dramatically "help" you park your car.

109
0:05:27.82,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I was impressed with the particular theatrics

110
0:05:31.14,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of the man who found us a parking spot that evening.

111
0:05:34.14,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And so as we were leaving, I decided to leave him a tip.

112
0:05:38.58,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I opened my bag,

113
0:05:40.02,000 --> 0:05:41,000
put my hand inside my bag,

114
0:05:41.42,000 --> 0:05:43,000
brought out my money that I had earned from doing my work,

115
0:05:44.98,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I gave it to the man.

116
0:05:47.42,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And he, this man who was very grateful and very happy,

117
0:05:51.82,000 --> 0:05:52,000
took the money from me,

118
0:05:53.62,000 --> 0:05:54,000
looked across at Louis

119
0:05:55.06,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and said, "Thank you, sir!"

120
0:05:56.94,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:02.98,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Louis looked at me, surprised,

122
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and asked, "Why is he thanking me? I didn't give him the money."

123
0:06:10.66,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Then I saw realization dawn on Louis' face.

124
0:06:14.86,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The man believed that whatever money I had

125
0:06:17.3,000 --> 0:06:2,000
had ultimately come from Louis.

126
0:06:21.54,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Because Louis is a man.

127
0:06:24.42,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Men and women are different.

128
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We have different hormones, we have different sexual organs,

129
0:06:29.14,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we have different biological abilities.

130
0:06:31.22,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Women can have babies, men can't.

131
0:06:34.62,000 --> 0:06:35,000
At least not yet.

132
0:06:35.86,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:37.3,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Men have testosterone and are in general physically stronger than women.

134
0:06:42.34,000 --> 0:06:44,000
There's slightly more women than men in the world,

135
0:06:45.02,000 --> 0:06:48,000
about 52 percent of the world's population is female.

136
0:06:48.14,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But most of the positions of power and prestige are occupied by men.

137
0:06:52.66,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The late Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate,

138
0:06:55.14,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Wangari Maathai,

139
0:06:56.5,000 --> 0:06:58,000
put it simply and well when she said:

140
0:06:59.42,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"The higher you go, the fewer women there are."

141
0:07:03.74,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In the recent US elections we kept hearing of the Lilly Ledbetter law,

142
0:07:08.38,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and if we go beyond the nicely alliterative name of that law,

143
0:07:11.82,000 --> 0:07:13,000
it was really about a man and a woman

144
0:07:13.98,000 --> 0:07:15,000
doing the same job, being equally qualified,

145
0:07:16.78,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and the man being paid more because he's a man.

146
0:07:19.98,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So in the literal way, men rule the world,

147
0:07:23.34,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and this made sense a thousand years ago

148
0:07:26.94,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because human beings lived then in a world

149
0:07:29.82,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival.

150
0:07:34.02,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The physically stronger person was more likely to lead,

151
0:07:39.1,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and men, in general, are physically stronger.

152
0:07:41.7,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Of course there are many exceptions.

153
0:07:43.439,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:45.02,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But today we live in a vastly different world.

155
0:07:49.54,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The person more likely to lead is not the physically stronger person;

156
0:07:53.62,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it is the more creative person, the more intelligent person,

157
0:07:57.14,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the more innovative person,

158
0:07:59.58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and there are no hormones for those attributes.

159
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
A man is as likely as a woman to be intelligent,

160
0:08:04.9,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to be creative, to be innovative.

161
0:08:07.62,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We have evolved;

162
0:08:08.94,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but it seems to me that our ideas of gender had not evolved.

163
0:08:13.58,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Some weeks ago, I walked into a lobby of one of the best Nigerian hotels.

164
0:08:18.1,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I thought about naming the hotel, but I thought I probably shouldn't.

165
0:08:21.38,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And a guard at the entrance stopped me and asked me annoying questions,

166
0:08:25.78,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because their automatic assumption is

167
0:08:27.62,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that a Nigerian female walking into a hotel alone is a sex worker.

168
0:08:32.82,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And by the way,

169
0:08:34.06,000 --> 0:08:37,000
why do these hotels focus on the ostensible supply

170
0:08:37.22,000 --> 0:08:39,000
rather than the demand for sex workers?

171
0:08:41.34,000 --> 0:08:46,000
In Lagos I cannot go alone into many "reputable" bars and clubs.

172
0:08:46.619,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They just don't let you in if you're a woman alone,

173
0:08:49.06,000 --> 0:08:5,000
you have to be accompanied by a man.

174
0:08:51.42,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Each time I walk into a Nigerian restaurant with a man,

175
0:08:54.18,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the waiter greets the man and ignores me.

176
0:08:58.14,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The waiters are products --

177
0:08:59.66,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

178
0:09:00.82,000 --> 0:09:02,000
At this some women felt like, "Yes! I thought that!"

179
0:09:03.74,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The waiters are products of a society

180
0:09:05.7,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that has taught them that men are more important than women.

181
0:09:10.06,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And I know that waiters don't intend any harm.

182
0:09:12.94,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But it's one thing to know intellectually and quite another to feel it emotionally.

183
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Each time they ignore me, I feel invisible.

184
0:09:19.66,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I feel upset.

185
0:09:21.54,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I want to tell them that I am just as human as the man,

186
0:09:24.9,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that I'm just as worthy of acknowledgment.

187
0:09:28.58,000 --> 0:09:29,000
These are little things,

188
0:09:29.86,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but sometimes it's the little things that sting the most.

189
0:09:33.14,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And not long ago, I wrote an article

190
0:09:34.9,000 --> 0:09:37,000
about what it means to be young and female in Lagos,

191
0:09:38.22,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and the printers told me,

192
0:09:40.94,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"It was so angry."

193
0:09:42.78,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Of course it was angry!

194
0:09:44.18,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:48.66,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I am angry.

196
0:09:50.34,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice.

197
0:09:53.5,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We should all be angry.

198
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Anger has a long history of bringing about positive change;

199
0:09:59.14,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but, in addition to being angry, I'm also hopeful.

200
0:10:02.7,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings

201
0:10:05.34,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to make and remake themselves for the better.

202
0:10:08.74,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Gender matters everywhere in the world,

203
0:10:10.66,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but I want to focus on Nigeria

204
0:10:13.34,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and on Africa in general,

205
0:10:14.82,000 --> 0:10:17,000
because it is where I know, and because it is where my heart is.

206
0:10:18.42,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And I would like today to ask

207
0:10:20.38,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that we begin to dream about and plan for a different world,

208
0:10:24.54,000 --> 0:10:25,000
a fairer world,

209
0:10:28.06,000 --> 0:10:32,000
a world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves.

210
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And this is how to start:

211
0:10:33.82,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we must raise our daughters differently.

212
0:10:36.3,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We must also raise our sons differently.

213
0:10:39.82,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We do a great disservice to boys on how we raise them;

214
0:10:43.5,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we stifle the humanity of boys.

215
0:10:46.3,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We define masculinity in a very narrow way,

216
0:10:48.9,000 --> 0:10:51,000
masculinity becomes this hard, small cage

217
0:10:52.42,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and we put boys inside the cage.

218
0:10:54.74,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We teach boys to be afraid of fear.

219
0:10:57.3,000 --> 0:11:,000
We teach boys to be afraid of weakness, of vulnerability.

220
0:11:02.02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We teach them to mask their true selves,

221
0:11:04.5,000 --> 0:11:08,000
because they have to be, in Nigerian speak, "hard man!"

222
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
In secondary school, a boy and a girl, both of them teenagers,

223
0:11:14.42,000 --> 0:11:17,000
both of them with the same amount of pocket money, would go out

224
0:11:17.94,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and then the boy would be expected always to pay,

225
0:11:20.74,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to prove his masculinity.

226
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And yet we wonder why boys are more likely to steal money from their parents.

227
0:11:29.06,000 --> 0:11:32,000
What if both boys and girls were raised

228
0:11:32.58,000 --> 0:11:34,000
not to link masculinity with money?

229
0:11:35.54,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What if the attitude was not "the boy has to pay"

230
0:11:38.58,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but rather "whoever has more should pay?"

231
0:11:42.18,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now, of course because of that historical advantage,

232
0:11:44.78,000 --> 0:11:46,000
it is mostly men who will have more today,

233
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but if we start raising children differently,

234
0:11:49.9,000 --> 0:11:51,000
then in fifty years, in a hundred years,

235
0:11:52.46,000 --> 0:11:55,000
boys will no longer have the pressure of having to prove this masculinity.

236
0:11:57.5,000 --> 0:12:,000
But by far the worst thing we do to males,

237
0:12:00.54,000 --> 0:12:02,000
by making them feel that they have to be hard,

238
0:12:02.9,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is that we leave them with very fragile egos.

239
0:12:06.94,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The more "hard man" the man feels compelled to be,

240
0:12:11.14,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the weaker his ego is.

241
0:12:14.78,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And then we do a much greater disservice to girls

242
0:12:17.82,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because we raise them to cater to the fragile egos of men.

243
0:12:22.02,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller,

244
0:12:25.54,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we say to girls,

245
0:12:27.46,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"You can have ambition, but not too much."

246
0:12:29.66,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter)

247
0:12:31.06,000 --> 0:12:33,000
"You should aim to be successful, but not too successful,

248
0:12:33.78,000 --> 0:12:35,000
otherwise you would threaten the man."

249
0:12:36.54,000 --> 0:12:38,000
If you are the breadwinner in your relationship with a man,

250
0:12:39.46,000 --> 0:12:4,000
you have to pretend that you're not,

251
0:12:41.46,000 --> 0:12:42,000
especially in public,

252
0:12:43.14,000 --> 0:12:45,000
otherwise you will emasculate him.

253
0:12:46.54,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But what if we question the premise itself?

254
0:12:48.9,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Why should a woman's success be a threat to a man?

255
0:12:53.02,000 --> 0:12:56,000
What if we decide to simply dispose of that word,

256
0:12:56.58,000 --> 0:13:,000
and I don't think there's an English word I dislike more than "emasculation."

257
0:13:02.54,000 --> 0:13:04,000
A Nigerian acquaintance once asked me

258
0:13:04.86,000 --> 0:13:06,000
if I was worried that men would be intimidated by me.

259
0:13:08.38,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I was not worried at all.

260
0:13:10.14,000 --> 0:13:12,000
In fact, it had not occurred to me to be worried

261
0:13:12.42,000 --> 0:13:14,000
because a man who would be intimidated by me

262
0:13:14.66,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is exactly the kind of man I would have no interest in.

263
0:13:17.3,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Laughter)

264
0:13:18.54,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause)

265
0:13:25.94,000 --> 0:13:27,000
But still I was really struck by this.

266
0:13:29.46,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Because I'm female, I'm expected to aspire to marriage;

267
0:13:33.78,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I'm expected to make my life choices

268
0:13:35.58,000 --> 0:13:38,000
always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important.

269
0:13:39.86,000 --> 0:13:4,000
A marriage can be a good thing;

270
0:13:41.86,000 --> 0:13:45,000
it can be a source of joy and love and mutual support.

271
0:13:46.3,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage

272
0:13:48.78,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and we don't teach boys the same?

273
0:13:52.66,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I know a woman who decided to sell her house

274
0:13:54.86,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because she didn't want to intimidate a man who might marry her.

275
0:13:59.7,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I know an unmarried woman in Nigeria who, when she goes to conferences,

276
0:14:04.18,000 --> 0:14:05,000
wears a wedding ring

277
0:14:05.58,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because according to her,

278
0:14:06.82,000 --> 0:14:09,000
she wants the other participants in the conference to "give her respect."

279
0:14:11.94,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I know young women who are under so much pressure

280
0:14:14.3,000 --> 0:14:18,000
from family, from friends, even from work to get married,

281
0:14:18.42,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and they're pushed to make terrible choices.

282
0:14:21.34,000 --> 0:14:23,000
A woman at a certain age who is unmarried,

283
0:14:23.98,000 --> 0:14:27,000
our society teaches her to see it as a deep, personal failure.

284
0:14:28.86,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And a man at a certain age who is unmarried,

285
0:14:31.66,000 --> 0:14:33,000
we just think he hasn't come around to making his pick.

286
0:14:34.3,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Laughter)

287
0:14:36.18,000 --> 0:14:37,000
It's easy for us to say,

288
0:14:37.82,000 --> 0:14:39,000
"Oh, but women can just say no to all of this."

289
0:14:40.1,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But the reality is more difficult and more complex.

290
0:14:43.18,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We're all social beings.

291
0:14:44.98,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We internalize ideas from our socialization.

292
0:14:47.5,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Even the language we use

293
0:14:49.5,000 --> 0:14:52,000
in talking about marriage and relationships illustrates this.

294
0:14:52.94,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The language of marriage is often the language of ownership

295
0:14:55.82,000 --> 0:14:57,000
rather than the language of partnership.

296
0:14:58.62,000 --> 0:15:,000
We use the word "respect"

297
0:15:01.34,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to mean something a woman shows a man

298
0:15:04.14,000 --> 0:15:06,000
but often not something a man shows a woman.

299
0:15:07.98,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Both men and women in Nigeria will say --

300
0:15:10.46,000 --> 0:15:12,000
this is an expression I'm very amused by --

301
0:15:12.78,000 --> 0:15:14,000
"I did it for peace in my marriage."

302
0:15:16.22,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Now, when men say it,

303
0:15:17.82,000 --> 0:15:2,000
it is usually about something that they should not be doing anyway.

304
0:15:21.02,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Laughter)

305
0:15:22.98,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Sometimes they say it to their friends,

306
0:15:25.78,000 --> 0:15:28,000
it's something to say to their friends in a kind of fondly exasperated way,

307
0:15:29.74,000 --> 0:15:32,000
you know, something that ultimately proves how masculine they are,

308
0:15:32.9,000 --> 0:15:33,000
how needed, how loved.

309
0:15:34.38,000 --> 0:15:36,000
"Oh, my wife said I can't go to the club every night,

310
0:15:36.9,000 --> 0:15:38,000
so for peace in my marriage, I do it only on weekends."

311
0:15:39.74,000 --> 0:15:4,000
(Laughter)

312
0:15:41.46,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Now, when a woman says, "I did it for peace in my marriage,"

313
0:15:45.74,000 --> 0:15:48,000
she's usually talking about giving up a job,

314
0:15:49.3,000 --> 0:15:5,000
a dream,

315
0:15:50.78,000 --> 0:15:51,000
a career.

316
0:15:52.9,000 --> 0:15:54,000
We teach females that in relationships,

317
0:15:55.34,000 --> 0:15:57,000
compromise is what women do.

318
0:15:58.9,000 --> 0:16:,000
We raise girls to see each other as competitors --

319
0:16:01.5,000 --> 0:16:04,000
not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing,

320
0:16:04.98,000 --> 0:16:05,000
but for attention of men.

321
0:16:07.74,000 --> 0:16:09,000
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings

322
0:16:10.7,000 --> 0:16:11,000
in the way that boys are.

323
0:16:12.22,000 --> 0:16:15,000
If we have sons, we don't mind knowing about our sons' girlfriends.

324
0:16:16.3,000 --> 0:16:18,000
But our daughters' boyfriends? God forbid.

325
0:16:18.66,000 --> 0:16:19,000
(Laughter)

326
0:16:20.3,000 --> 0:16:21,000
But of course when the time is right,

327
0:16:22.14,000 --> 0:16:25,000
we expect those girls to bring back the perfect man to be their husbands.

328
0:16:26.06,000 --> 0:16:29,000
We police girls, we praise girls for virginity,

329
0:16:29.46,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but we don't praise boys for virginity,

330
0:16:31.42,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and it's always made me wonder how exactly this is supposed to work out because ...

331
0:16:35.349,000 --> 0:16:37,000
(Laughter)

332
0:16:37.7,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Applause)

333
0:16:45.58,000 --> 0:16:48,000
I mean, the loss of virginity is usually a process that involves ...

334
0:16:50.5,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Recently a young woman was gang raped in a university in Nigeria,

335
0:16:54.7,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I think some of us know about that.

336
0:16:56.42,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And the response of many young Nigerians, both male and female,

337
0:16:59.7,000 --> 0:17:01,000
was something along the lines of this:

338
0:17:02.22,000 --> 0:17:04,000
"Yes, rape is wrong.

339
0:17:04.42,000 --> 0:17:07,000
But what is a girl doing in a room with four boys?"

340
0:17:08.74,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Now, if we can forget the horrible inhumanity of that response,

341
0:17:13.9,000 --> 0:17:16,000
these Nigerians have been raised to think of women as inherently guilty,

342
0:17:19.139,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and they have been raised to expect so little of men

343
0:17:22.3,000 --> 0:17:25,000
that the idea of men as savage beings without any control

344
0:17:26.02,000 --> 0:17:27,000
is somehow acceptable.

345
0:17:28.659,000 --> 0:17:3,000
We teach girls shame.

346
0:17:30.7,000 --> 0:17:31,000
"Close your legs." "Cover yourself."

347
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We make them feel as though by being born female

348
0:17:35.54,000 --> 0:17:37,000
they're already guilty of something.

349
0:17:37.659,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And so, girls grow up to be women

350
0:17:40.02,000 --> 0:17:42,000
who cannot see they have desire.

351
0:17:42.18,000 --> 0:17:44,000
They grow up to be women who silence themselves.

352
0:17:46.9,000 --> 0:17:49,000
They grow up to be women who cannot say what they truly think,

353
0:17:50.34,000 --> 0:17:51,000
and they grow up --

354
0:17:51.7,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and this is the worst thing we did to girls --

355
0:17:53.9,000 --> 0:17:57,000
they grow up to be women who have turned pretense into an art form.

356
0:17:58.06,000 --> 0:18:01,000
(Applause)

357
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I know a woman who hates domestic work,

358
0:18:07.7,000 --> 0:18:08,000
she just hates it,

359
0:18:09.22,000 --> 0:18:1,000
but she pretends that she likes it,

360
0:18:12.02,000 --> 0:18:16,000
because she's been taught that to be "good wife material"

361
0:18:16.14,000 --> 0:18:18,000
she has to be -- to use that Nigerian word --

362
0:18:18.54,000 --> 0:18:19,000
very "homely."

363
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And then she got married,

364
0:18:22.82,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and after a while her husband's family began to complain that she had changed.

365
0:18:26.66,000 --> 0:18:27,000
(Laughter)

366
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Actually, she had not changed,

367
0:18:29.74,000 --> 0:18:3,000
she just got tired of pretending.

368
0:18:32.54,000 --> 0:18:35,000
The problem with gender,

369
0:18:35.7,000 --> 0:18:37,000
is that it prescribes how we should be

370
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
rather than recognizing how we are.

371
0:18:41.22,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Now imagine how much happier we would be,

372
0:18:43.7,000 --> 0:18:46,000
how much freer to be our true individual selves,

373
0:18:47.22,000 --> 0:18:49,000
if we didn't have the weight of gender expectations.

374
0:18:51.06,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Boys and girls are undeniably different biologically,

375
0:18:55.86,000 --> 0:18:57,000
but socialization exaggerates the differences

376
0:18:58.86,000 --> 0:19:,000
and then it becomes a self-fulfilling process.

377
0:19:01.46,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Now, take cooking for example.

378
0:19:04.1,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Today women in general are more likely to do the housework than men,

379
0:19:07.62,000 --> 0:19:08,000
the cooking and cleaning.

380
0:19:08.9,000 --> 0:19:09,000
But why is that?

381
0:19:10.5,000 --> 0:19:12,000
Is it because women are born with a cooking gene?

382
0:19:13.38,000 --> 0:19:14,000
(Laughter)

383
0:19:14.82,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Or because over years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role?

384
0:19:19.1,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Actually, I was going to say that maybe women are born with a cooking gene,

385
0:19:22.7,000 --> 0:19:25,000
until I remember that the majority of the famous cooks in the world,

386
0:19:26.18,000 --> 0:19:28,000
whom we give the fancy title of "chefs,"

387
0:19:28.5,000 --> 0:19:29,000
are men.

388
0:19:30.78,000 --> 0:19:31,000
I used to look up to my grandmother

389
0:19:32.5,000 --> 0:19:34,000
who was a brilliant, brilliant woman,

390
0:19:34.58,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and wonder how she would have been

391
0:19:36.34,000 --> 0:19:39,000
if she had the same opportunities as men when she was growing up.

392
0:19:40.78,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Now today, there are many more opportunities for women

393
0:19:43.38,000 --> 0:19:45,000
than there were during my grandmother's time

394
0:19:45.66,000 --> 0:19:47,000
because of changes in policy, changes in law,

395
0:19:48.3,000 --> 0:19:49,000
all of which are very important.

396
0:19:49.9,000 --> 0:19:53,000
But what matters even more is our attitude, our mindset,

397
0:19:54.46,000 --> 0:19:57,000
what we believe and what we value about gender.

398
0:19:57.78,000 --> 0:19:59,000
What if in raising children

399
0:20:00.22,000 --> 0:20:02,000
we focus on ability instead of gender?

400
0:20:03.82,000 --> 0:20:07,000
What if in raising children we focus on interest instead of gender?

401
0:20:08.82,000 --> 0:20:1,000
I know a family who have a son and a daughter,

402
0:20:11.06,000 --> 0:20:12,000
both of whom are brilliant at school,

403
0:20:12.98,000 --> 0:20:13,000
who are wonderful, lovely children.

404
0:20:14.9,000 --> 0:20:16,000
When the boy is hungry, the parents say to the girl,

405
0:20:17.46,000 --> 0:20:19,000
"Go and cook Indomie noodles for your brother."

406
0:20:19.7,000 --> 0:20:2,000
(Laughter)

407
0:20:20.94,000 --> 0:20:23,000
Now, the daughter doesn't particularly like to cook Indomie noodles,

408
0:20:24.46,000 --> 0:20:26,000
but she's a girl, and so she has to.

409
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Now, what if the parents,

410
0:20:29.06,000 --> 0:20:3,000
from the beginning,

411
0:20:30.7,000 --> 0:20:33,000
taught both the boy and the girl to cook Indomie?

412
0:20:35.74,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Cooking, by the way, is a very useful skill for boys to have.

413
0:20:38.78,000 --> 0:20:42,000
I've never thought it made sense to leave such a crucial thing,

414
0:20:43.66,000 --> 0:20:44,000
the ability to nourish oneself --

415
0:20:45.58,000 --> 0:20:46,000
(Laughter)

416
0:20:46.82,000 --> 0:20:47,000
in the hands of others.

417
0:20:48.38,000 --> 0:20:5,000
(Applause)

418
0:20:53.58,000 --> 0:20:56,000
I know a woman who has the same degree and the same job as her husband.

419
0:20:57.46,000 --> 0:20:59,000
When they get back from work, she does most of the housework,

420
0:21:00.38,000 --> 0:21:02,000
which I think is true for many marriages.

421
0:21:02.58,000 --> 0:21:03,000
But what struck me about them

422
0:21:04.34,000 --> 0:21:06,000
was that whenever her husband changed the baby's diaper,

423
0:21:07.34,000 --> 0:21:09,000
she said "thank you" to him.

424
0:21:10.86,000 --> 0:21:14,000
Now, what if she saw this as perfectly normal and natural

425
0:21:15.3,000 --> 0:21:18,000
that he should, in fact, care for his child?

426
0:21:18.66,000 --> 0:21:19,000
(Laughter)

427
0:21:21.5,000 --> 0:21:24,000
I'm trying to unlearn many of the lessons of gender

428
0:21:25.02,000 --> 0:21:27,000
that I internalized when I was growing up.

429
0:21:27.34,000 --> 0:21:32,000
But I sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations.

430
0:21:32.42,000 --> 0:21:35,000
The first time I taught a writing class in graduate school,

431
0:21:36.18,000 --> 0:21:37,000
I was worried.

432
0:21:37.46,000 --> 0:21:39,000
I wasn't worried about the material I would teach

433
0:21:39.82,000 --> 0:21:4,000
because I was well-prepared,

434
0:21:41.18,000 --> 0:21:43,000
and I was going to teach what I enjoy teaching.

435
0:21:43.42,000 --> 0:21:45,000
Instead, I was worried about what to wear.

436
0:21:46.5,000 --> 0:21:47,000
I wanted to be taken seriously.

437
0:21:49.3,000 --> 0:21:5,000
I knew that because I was female

438
0:21:50.9,000 --> 0:21:53,000
I will automatically have to prove my worth.

439
0:21:55.06,000 --> 0:21:57,000
And I was worried that if I looked too feminine,

440
0:21:57.34,000 --> 0:21:58,000
I would not be taken seriously.

441
0:21:59.14,000 --> 0:22:03,000
I really wanted to wear my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt,

442
0:22:03.5,000 --> 0:22:04,000
but I decided not to.

443
0:22:05.34,000 --> 0:22:07,000
Instead, I wore a very serious,

444
0:22:07.74,000 --> 0:22:09,000
very manly and very ugly suit.

445
0:22:10.34,000 --> 0:22:11,000
(Laughter)

446
0:22:11.86,000 --> 0:22:13,000
Because the sad truth is that when it comes to appearance

447
0:22:14.58,000 --> 0:22:16,000
we start off with men as the standard, as the norm.

448
0:22:17.78,000 --> 0:22:19,000
If a man is getting ready for a business meeting,

449
0:22:20.14,000 --> 0:22:22,000
he doesn't worry about looking too masculine

450
0:22:22.3,000 --> 0:22:24,000
and therefore not being taken for granted.

451
0:22:24.82,000 --> 0:22:26,000
If a woman has to get ready for business meeting,

452
0:22:27.34,000 --> 0:22:29,000
she has to worry about looking too feminine

453
0:22:30.14,000 --> 0:22:34,000
and what it says and whether or not she will be taken seriously.

454
0:22:35.82,000 --> 0:22:37,000
I wish I had not worn that ugly suit that day.

455
0:22:39.26,000 --> 0:22:42,000
I've actually banished it from my closet, by the way.

456
0:22:42.42,000 --> 0:22:46,000
Had I then the confidence that I have now to be myself,

457
0:22:47.38,000 --> 0:22:49,000
my students would have benefited even more from my teaching,

458
0:22:50.34,000 --> 0:22:52,000
because I would have been more comfortable

459
0:22:52.42,000 --> 0:22:54,000
and more fully and more truly myself.

460
0:22:55.62,000 --> 0:22:59,000
I have chosen to no longer be apologetic for my femaleness

461
0:22:59.66,000 --> 0:23:,000
and for my femininity.

462
0:23:01.5,000 --> 0:23:04,000
(Applause)

463
0:23:07.62,000 --> 0:23:09,000
And I want to be respected in all of my femaleness

464
0:23:10.5,000 --> 0:23:11,000
because I deserve to be.

465
0:23:13.02,000 --> 0:23:15,000
Gender is not an easy conversation to have.

466
0:23:16.9,000 --> 0:23:17,000
For both men and women,

467
0:23:18.5,000 --> 0:23:21,000
to bring up gender is sometimes to encounter almost immediate resistance.

468
0:23:22.46,000 --> 0:23:25,000
I can imagine some people here are actually thinking,

469
0:23:25.74,000 --> 0:23:26,000
"Women too do sef."

470
0:23:29.34,000 --> 0:23:31,000
Some of the men here might be thinking,

471
0:23:31.54,000 --> 0:23:32,000
"OK, all of this is interesting,

472
0:23:33.3,000 --> 0:23:34,000
but I don't think like that."

473
0:23:35.78,000 --> 0:23:37,000
And that is part of the problem.

474
0:23:38.02,000 --> 0:23:4,000
That many men do not actively think about gender

475
0:23:41.02,000 --> 0:23:42,000
or notice gender

476
0:23:42.54,000 --> 0:23:44,000
is part of the problem of gender.

477
0:23:44.58,000 --> 0:23:46,000
That many men, say, like my friend Louis,

478
0:23:47.26,000 --> 0:23:48,000
that everything is fine now.

479
0:23:49.98,000 --> 0:23:51,000
And that many men do nothing to change it.

480
0:23:52.86,000 --> 0:23:54,000
If you are a man and you walk into a restaurant with a woman

481
0:23:55.74,000 --> 0:23:56,000
and the waiter greets only you,

482
0:23:58.22,000 --> 0:24:,000
does it occur to you to ask the waiter,

483
0:24:00.74,000 --> 0:24:01,000
"Why haven't you greeted her?"

484
0:24:05.14,000 --> 0:24:06,000
Because gender can be --

485
0:24:06.66,000 --> 0:24:08,000
(Laughter)

486
0:24:16.7,000 --> 0:24:2,000
Actually, we may repose part of a longer version of this talk.

487
0:24:21.22,000 --> 0:24:24,000
So, because gender can be a very uncomfortable conversation to have,

488
0:24:24.82,000 --> 0:24:27,000
there are very easy ways to close it, to close the conversation.

489
0:24:27.94,000 --> 0:24:31,000
So some people will bring up evolutionary biology and apes,

490
0:24:32.14,000 --> 0:24:35,000
how, you know, female apes bow down to male apes

491
0:24:35.82,000 --> 0:24:36,000
and that sort of thing.

492
0:24:37.7,000 --> 0:24:39,000
But the point is we're not apes.

493
0:24:39.78,000 --> 0:24:4,000
(Laughter)

494
0:24:41.22,000 --> 0:24:45,000
(Applause)

495
0:24:45.98,000 --> 0:24:49,000
Apes also live on trees and have earthworms for breakfast,

496
0:24:50.82,000 --> 0:24:51,000
and we don't.

497
0:24:53.06,000 --> 0:24:57,000
Some people will say, "Well, poor men also have a hard time."

498
0:24:57.7,000 --> 0:24:58,000
And this is true.

499
0:24:59.74,000 --> 0:25:,000
But that is not what this --

500
0:25:01.1,000 --> 0:25:02,000
(Laughter)

501
0:25:02.22,000 --> 0:25:04,000
But this is not what this conversation is about.

502
0:25:06.3,000 --> 0:25:09,000
Gender and class are different forms of oppression.

503
0:25:10.1,000 --> 0:25:13,000
I actually learned quite a bit about systems of oppression

504
0:25:13.78,000 --> 0:25:15,000
and how they can be blind to one another

505
0:25:16.26,000 --> 0:25:17,000
by talking to black men.

506
0:25:19.14,000 --> 0:25:22,000
I was once talking to a black man about gender

507
0:25:22.34,000 --> 0:25:23,000
and he said to me,

508
0:25:23.74,000 --> 0:25:26,000
"Why do you have to say 'my experience as a woman'?

509
0:25:27.22,000 --> 0:25:28,000
Why can't it be

510
0:25:28.46,000 --> 0:25:29,000
'your experience as a human being'?"

511
0:25:31.66,000 --> 0:25:32,000
Now, this was the same man

512
0:25:32.94,000 --> 0:25:35,000
who would often talk about his experience as a black man.

513
0:25:39.18,000 --> 0:25:4,000
Gender matters.

514
0:25:40.42,000 --> 0:25:42,000
Men and women experience the world differently.

515
0:25:42.94,000 --> 0:25:44,000
Gender colors the way we experience the world.

516
0:25:45.78,000 --> 0:25:46,000
But we can change that.

517
0:25:48.34,000 --> 0:25:49,000
Some people will say,

518
0:25:50.3,000 --> 0:25:52,000
"Oh, but women have the real power,

519
0:25:52.78,000 --> 0:25:53,000
bottom power."

520
0:25:54.58,000 --> 0:25:56,000
And for non-Nigerians, bottom power is an expression

521
0:25:57.5,000 --> 0:25:58,000
which I suppose means something like a woman

522
0:25:59.38,000 --> 0:26:01,000
who uses her sexuality to get favors from men.

523
0:26:03.02,000 --> 0:26:05,000
But bottom power is not power at all.

524
0:26:08.22,000 --> 0:26:1,000
Bottom power means that a woman

525
0:26:11.02,000 --> 0:26:13,000
simply has a good root to tap into, from time to time --

526
0:26:13.94,000 --> 0:26:14,000
somebody else's power.

527
0:26:16.46,000 --> 0:26:17,000
And then, of course, we have to wonder

528
0:26:18.34,000 --> 0:26:2,000
what happens when that somebody else is in a bad mood,

529
0:26:21.02,000 --> 0:26:22,000
or sick

530
0:26:22.42,000 --> 0:26:23,000
or impotent.

531
0:26:24.1,000 --> 0:26:27,000
(Laughter)

532
0:26:27.54,000 --> 0:26:33,000
Some people will say that a woman being subordinate to a man is our culture.

533
0:26:34.46,000 --> 0:26:35,000
But culture is constantly changing.

534
0:26:36.46,000 --> 0:26:4,000
I have beautiful twin nieces who are fifteen and live in Lagos.

535
0:26:41.14,000 --> 0:26:42,000
If they had been born a hundred years ago

536
0:26:43.82,000 --> 0:26:45,000
they would have been taken away and killed.

537
0:26:45.98,000 --> 0:26:48,000
Because it was our culture, it was our culture to kill twins.

538
0:26:50.86,000 --> 0:26:51,000
So what is the point of culture?

539
0:26:53.3,000 --> 0:26:54,000
I mean there's the decorative,

540
0:26:54.9,000 --> 0:26:55,000
the dancing ...

541
0:26:56.54,000 --> 0:27:,000
but also, culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people.

542
0:27:01.18,000 --> 0:27:02,000
In my family,

543
0:27:02.46,000 --> 0:27:05,000
I am the child who is most interested in the story of who we are,

544
0:27:05.66,000 --> 0:27:06,000
in our traditions,

545
0:27:06.94,000 --> 0:27:08,000
in the knowledge about ancestral lands.

546
0:27:09.14,000 --> 0:27:11,000
My brothers are not as interested as I am.

547
0:27:11.74,000 --> 0:27:12,000
But I cannot participate,

548
0:27:14.02,000 --> 0:27:16,000
I cannot go to umunna meetings,

549
0:27:16.06,000 --> 0:27:17,000
I cannot have a say.

550
0:27:17.82,000 --> 0:27:18,000
Because I'm female.

551
0:27:19.9,000 --> 0:27:21,000
Culture does not make people,

552
0:27:22.02,000 --> 0:27:23,000
people make culture.

553
0:27:24.74,000 --> 0:27:25,000
So if it is in fact true --

554
0:27:26.54,000 --> 0:27:29,000
(Applause)

555
0:27:30.06,000 --> 0:27:31,000
So if it is in fact true

556
0:27:31.7,000 --> 0:27:33,000
that the full humanity of women is not our culture,

557
0:27:34.62,000 --> 0:27:35,000
then we must make it our culture.

558
0:27:37.86,000 --> 0:27:42,000
I think very often of my dear friend, Okoloma Maduewesi.

559
0:27:43.5,000 --> 0:27:46,000
May he and all the others who passed away in that Sosoliso crash

560
0:27:47.5,000 --> 0:27:48,000
continue to rest in peace.

561
0:27:50.22,000 --> 0:27:53,000
He will always be remembered by those of us who loved him.

562
0:27:54.7,000 --> 0:27:58,000
And he was right that day many years ago when he called me a feminist.

563
0:27:59.22,000 --> 0:28:,000
I am a feminist.

564
0:28:01.22,000 --> 0:28:03,000
And when I looked up the word in the dictionary that day,

565
0:28:03.94,000 --> 0:28:04,000
this is what it said:

566
0:28:05.22,000 --> 0:28:08,000
"Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political

567
0:28:08.62,000 --> 0:28:11,000
and economic equality of the sexes."

568
0:28:12.34,000 --> 0:28:14,000
My great grandmother, from the stories I've heard,

569
0:28:15.3,000 --> 0:28:16,000
was a feminist.

570
0:28:16.9,000 --> 0:28:19,000
She ran away from the house of the man she did not want to marry

571
0:28:20.3,000 --> 0:28:22,000
and ended up marrying the man of her choice.

572
0:28:22.98,000 --> 0:28:24,000
She refused, she protested, she spoke up

573
0:28:25.98,000 --> 0:28:3,000
whenever she felt she was being deprived of access, of land, that sort of thing.

574
0:28:31.3,000 --> 0:28:34,000
My great grandmother did not know that word "feminist,"

575
0:28:34.62,000 --> 0:28:35,000
but it doesn't mean that she wasn't one.

576
0:28:37.98,000 --> 0:28:38,000
More of us should reclaim that word.

577
0:28:41.86,000 --> 0:28:43,000
My own definition of feminist is:

578
0:28:45.02,000 --> 0:28:47,000
"A feminist is a man or a woman

579
0:28:47.42,000 --> 0:28:48,000
who says --

580
0:28:49.3,000 --> 0:28:52,000
(Laughter)

581
0:28:52.46,000 --> 0:28:55,000
(Applause)

582
0:28:58.42,000 --> 0:29:01,000
A feminist is a man or a woman who says,

583
0:29:01.7,000 --> 0:29:04,000
"Yes, there's a problem with gender as it is today,

584
0:29:05.02,000 --> 0:29:06,000
and we must fix it.

585
0:29:06.34,000 --> 0:29:07,000
We must do better."

586
0:29:09.78,000 --> 0:29:11,000
The best feminist I know

587
0:29:11.86,000 --> 0:29:12,000
is my brother Kene.

588
0:29:14.74,000 --> 0:29:17,000
He's also a kind, good-looking, lovely man,

589
0:29:18.66,000 --> 0:29:19,000
and he's very masculine.

590
0:29:21.14,000 --> 0:29:22,000
Thank you.

591
0:29:22.38,000 --> 0:29:26,000
(Applause)

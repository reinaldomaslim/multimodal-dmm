1
0:00:12.954,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It is very fashionable and proper to speak about food

2
0:00:20.319,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in all its forms, all its colors, aromas and tastes.

3
0:00:27.529,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But after the food goes through the digestive system,

4
0:00:33.183,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when it is thrown out as crap,

5
0:00:36.429,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it is no longer fashionable to speak about it.

6
0:00:40.026,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It is rather revolting.

7
0:00:45.192,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm a guy who has graduated from bullshit to full-shit.

8
0:00:52.732,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:55.801,000 --> 0:01:01,000
My organization, Gram Vikas, which means "village development organization,"

10
0:01:02.466,000 --> 0:01:05,000
was working in the area of renewable energy.

11
0:01:05.572,000 --> 0:01:08,000
On the most part, we were producing biogas,

12
0:01:09.322,000 --> 0:01:12,000
biogas for rural kitchens.

13
0:01:14.257,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We produce biogas in India by using animal manure,

14
0:01:20.147,000 --> 0:01:22,000
which usually, in India, is called cow dung.

15
0:01:22.551,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But as the gender-sensitive person that I am,

16
0:01:26.605,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I would like to call it bullshit.

17
0:01:29.533,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But realizing later on

18
0:01:31.916,000 --> 0:01:38,000
how important were sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way,

19
0:01:39.493,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we went into the arena of sanitation.

20
0:01:45.071,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Eighty percent of all diseases in India and most developing countries

21
0:01:53.87,000 --> 0:01:57,000
are because of poor quality water.

22
0:01:57.917,000 --> 0:02:,000
And when we look at the reason for poor quality water,

23
0:02:01.511,000 --> 0:02:06,000
you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste.

24
0:02:08.305,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Human waste, in its rawest form,

25
0:02:12.344,000 --> 0:02:18,000
finds its way back to drinking water, bathing water, washing water,

26
0:02:18.4,000 --> 0:02:2,000
irrigation water, whatever water you see.

27
0:02:22.293,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And this is the cause for 80 percent of the diseases in rural areas.

28
0:02:29.474,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In India, it is unfortunately only the women who carry water.

29
0:02:35.695,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So for all domestic needs, women have to carry water.

30
0:02:40.824,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So that is a pitiable state of affairs.

31
0:02:46.178,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Open defecation is rampant.

32
0:02:48.761,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Seventy percent of India defecates in the open.

33
0:02:53.713,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They sit there out in the open,

34
0:02:56.15,000 --> 0:02:58,000
with the wind on their sails,

35
0:02:58.178,000 --> 0:03:01,000
hiding their faces, exposing their bases,

36
0:03:02.021,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and sitting there in pristine glory --

37
0:03:06.889,000 --> 0:03:08,000
70 percent of India.

38
0:03:09.195,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And if you look at the world total,

39
0:03:12.428,000 --> 0:03:18,000
60 percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by Indians.

40
0:03:21.153,000 --> 0:03:23,000
A fantastic distinction.

41
0:03:23.929,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I don't know if we Indians can be proud of such a distinction.

42
0:03:28.081,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

43
0:03:30.096,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So we, together with a lot of villages,

44
0:03:32.278,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation.

45
0:03:37.022,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And we came together and formed a project called MANTRA.

46
0:03:42.979,000 --> 0:03:48,000
MANTRA stands for Movement and Action Network for Transformation of Rural Areas.

47
0:03:50.256,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So we are speaking about transformation, transformation in rural areas.

48
0:03:57.612,000 --> 0:04:,000
Villages that agree to implement this project,

49
0:04:01.224,000 --> 0:04:03,000
they organize a legal society

50
0:04:04.087,000 --> 0:04:08,000
where the general body consists of all members

51
0:04:08.453,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who elect a group of men and women who implement the project

52
0:04:14.336,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and, later on, who look after the operation and maintenance.

53
0:04:19.101,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They decide to build a toilet and a shower room.

54
0:04:24.862,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And from a protected water source,

55
0:04:27.943,000 --> 0:04:33,000
water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households

56
0:04:34.862,000 --> 0:04:36,000
through three taps:

57
0:04:37.327,000 --> 0:04:43,000
one in the toilet, one in the shower, one in the kitchen, 24 hours a day.

58
0:04:44.769,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The pity is that our cities, like New Delhi and Bombay,

59
0:04:48.94,000 --> 0:04:51,000
do not have a 24-hour water supply.

60
0:04:52.371,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But in these villages, we want to have it.

61
0:04:57.084,000 --> 0:05:,000
There is a distinct difference in the quality.

62
0:05:01.459,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Well in India, we have a theory, which is very much accepted

63
0:05:07.328,000 --> 0:05:1,000
by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter,

64
0:05:10.91,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that poor people deserve poor solutions

65
0:05:15.823,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions.

66
0:05:22.058,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This, combined with a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that

67
0:05:28.503,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the cheapest is the most economic,

68
0:05:30.872,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink.

69
0:05:38.091,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We are fighting against this.

70
0:05:40.45,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries.

71
0:05:46.941,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And even in sanitation,

72
0:05:49.359,000 --> 0:05:51,000
they should not be humiliated.

73
0:05:51.545,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Sanitation is more about dignity

74
0:05:54.239,000 --> 0:05:56,000
than about human disposal of waste.

75
0:05:56.907,000 --> 0:06:,000
And so you build these toilets and very often,

76
0:06:01.236,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses.

77
0:06:07.442,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And you can see that in front are the attached houses

78
0:06:11.323,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and the others are the toilets.

79
0:06:14.151,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So these people, without a single exception of a family in a village,

80
0:06:20.799,000 --> 0:06:22,000
decide to build a toilet, a bathing room.

81
0:06:24.598,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And for that, they come together, collect all the local materials --

82
0:06:30.256,000 --> 0:06:35,000
local materials like rubble, sand, aggregates,

83
0:06:35.611,000 --> 0:06:37,000
usually a government subsidy is available

84
0:06:38.139,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to meet at least part of the cost of external materials

85
0:06:41.417,000 --> 0:06:44,000
like cement, steel, toilet commode.

86
0:06:46.211,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And they build a toilet and a bathing room.

87
0:06:50.317,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Also, all the unskilled laborers, that is daily wage earners, mostly landless,

88
0:06:56.695,000 --> 0:07:02,000
are given an opportunity to be trained as masons and plumbers.

89
0:07:04.098,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So while these people are being trained, others are collecting the materials.

90
0:07:09.175,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And when both are ready, they build a toilet, a shower room,

91
0:07:14.841,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and of course also a water tower, an elevated water reservoir.

92
0:07:21.84,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We use a system of two leach pits to treat the waste.

93
0:07:27.171,000 --> 0:07:31,000
From the toilet, the muck comes into the first leach pit.

94
0:07:31.469,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And when it is full, it is blocked and it can go to the next.

95
0:07:36.494,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But we discovered that if you plant banana trees, papaya trees

96
0:07:41.343,000 --> 0:07:44,000
on the periphery of these leach pits,

97
0:07:44.726,000 --> 0:07:47,000
they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients

98
0:07:47.987,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and you get very tasty bananas, papayas.

99
0:07:53.478,000 --> 0:07:55,000
If any of you come to my place,

100
0:07:56.18,000 --> 0:08:,000
I would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you.

101
0:08:01.478,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So there you can see the completed toilets, the water towers.

102
0:08:07.288,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is in a village where most of the people are even illiterate.

103
0:08:13.098,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It is always a 24-hour water supply

104
0:08:15.508,000 --> 0:08:2,000
because water gets polluted very often when you store it --

105
0:08:21.114,000 --> 0:08:26,000
a child dips his or her hand into it, something falls into it.

106
0:08:26.936,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So no water is stored. It's always on tap.

107
0:08:33.288,000 --> 0:08:37,000
This is how an elevated water reservoir is constructed.

108
0:08:37.416,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And that is the end product.

109
0:08:39.596,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Because it has to go high, and there is some space available,

110
0:08:44.283,000 --> 0:08:46,000
two or three rooms are made under the water tower,

111
0:08:47.159,000 --> 0:08:51,000
which are used by the village for different committee meetings.

112
0:08:51.801,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program.

113
0:08:58.675,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Before we started, there were, as usual,

114
0:09:02.428,000 --> 0:09:07,000
more than 80 percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases.

115
0:09:07.858,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But after this, we have empirical evidence that 82 percent, on average,

116
0:09:14.231,000 --> 0:09:18,000
among all these villages -- 1,200 villages have completed it --

117
0:09:18.686,000 --> 0:09:23,000
waterborne diseases have come down 82 percent.

118
0:09:23.823,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

119
0:09:30.073,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Women usually used to spend, especially in the summer months,

120
0:09:35.544,000 --> 0:09:41,000
about six to seven hours a day carrying water.

121
0:09:43.206,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And when they went to carry water,

122
0:09:46.89,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because, as I said earlier, it's only women who carry water,

123
0:09:52.259,000 --> 0:09:58,000
they used to take their little children, girl children, also to carry water,

124
0:09:58.834,000 --> 0:10:02,000
or else to be back at home to look after the siblings.

125
0:10:03.615,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school,

126
0:10:07.856,000 --> 0:10:09,000
even if there was a school.

127
0:10:10.207,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And boys, about 30 percent.

128
0:10:13.179,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But girls, it has gone to about 90 percent and boys, almost to 100 percent.

129
0:10:20.148,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Applause)

130
0:10:24.795,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The most vulnerable section in a village

131
0:10:28.027,000 --> 0:10:32,000
are the landless laborers who are the daily wage-earners.

132
0:10:32.086,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Because they have gone through this training

133
0:10:34.696,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to be masons and plumbers and bar benders,

134
0:10:38.296,000 --> 0:10:44,000
now their ability to earn has increased 300 to 400 percent.

135
0:10:46.325,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So this is a democracy in action

136
0:10:49.765,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because there is a general body, a governing board, the committee.

137
0:10:53.591,000 --> 0:10:55,000
People are questioning, people are governing themselves,

138
0:10:56.461,000 --> 0:10:58,000
people are learning to manage their own affairs,

139
0:10:59.11,000 --> 0:11:02,000
they are taking their own futures into their hands.

140
0:11:02.882,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And that is democracy at the grassroots level in action.

141
0:11:10.831,000 --> 0:11:15,000
More than 1,200 villages have so far done this.

142
0:11:17.035,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It benefits over 400,000 people and it's still going on.

143
0:11:22.614,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And I hope it continues to move ahead.

144
0:11:29.245,000 --> 0:11:33,000
For India and such developing countries,

145
0:11:34.052,000 --> 0:11:39,000
armies and armaments,

146
0:11:39.684,000 --> 0:11:44,000
software companies and spaceships

147
0:11:48.486,000 --> 0:11:54,000
may not be as important as taps and toilets.

148
0:11:54.944,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

149
0:11:57.375,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

150
0:12:01.897,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Thank you.

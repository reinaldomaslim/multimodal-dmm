1
0:00:13.232,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, I'm afraid.

2
0:00:15.438,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Right now,

3
0:00:16.916,000 --> 0:00:17,000
on this stage,

4
0:00:18.461,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I feel fear.

5
0:00:20.919,000 --> 0:00:21,000
In my life, I ain't met many people

6
0:00:22.646,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that will readily admit when they are afraid.

7
0:00:25.418,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I think that's because deep down,

8
0:00:27.485,000 --> 0:00:28,000
they know how easy it spreads.

9
0:00:30.288,000 --> 0:00:31,000
See, fear is like a disease.

10
0:00:32.732,000 --> 0:00:34,000
When it moves, it moves like wildfire.

11
0:00:35.732,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But what happens when,

12
0:00:37.334,000 --> 0:00:38,000
even in the face of that fear,

13
0:00:39.108,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you do what you've got to do?

14
0:00:41.114,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That's called courage.

15
0:00:43.174,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And just like fear,

16
0:00:44.881,000 --> 0:00:45,000
courage is contagious.

17
0:00:47.69,000 --> 0:00:49,000
See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.

18
0:00:49.963,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That's a small city

19
0:00:51.147,000 --> 0:00:53,000
across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Missouri.

20
0:00:53.985,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I have lived in and around St. Louis my entire life.

21
0:01:00.263,000 --> 0:01:01,000
When Michael Brown, Jr.,

22
0:01:01.591,000 --> 0:01:02,000
an ordinary teenager,

23
0:01:02.867,000 --> 0:01:06,000
was gunned down by police in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri --

24
0:01:07.441,000 --> 0:01:1,000
another suburb, but north of St. Louis --

25
0:01:10.624,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I remember thinking,

26
0:01:12.181,000 --> 0:01:13,000
he ain't the first,

27
0:01:13.964,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and he won't be the last young kid to lose his life to law enforcement.

28
0:01:18.308,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But see, his death was different.

29
0:01:20.885,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When Mike was killed,

30
0:01:22.232,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I remember the powers that be trying to use fear as a weapon.

31
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The police response to a community in mourning was to use force

32
0:01:30.552,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to impose fear:

33
0:01:32.564,000 --> 0:01:33,000
fear of militarized police,

34
0:01:34.733,000 --> 0:01:35,000
imprisonment,

35
0:01:35.986,000 --> 0:01:36,000
fines.

36
0:01:37.179,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The media even tried to make us afraid of each other

37
0:01:39.723,000 --> 0:01:4,000
by the way they spun the story.

38
0:01:41.299,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And all of these things have worked in the past.

39
0:01:43.682,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But like I said, this time it was different.

40
0:01:47.484,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Michael Brown's death and the subsequent treatment of the community

41
0:01:50.882,000 --> 0:01:53,000
led to a string of protests in and around Ferguson and St. Louis.

42
0:01:55.38,000 --> 0:01:58,000
When I got out to those protests about the fourth or fifth day,

43
0:01:59.169,000 --> 0:02:,000
it was not out of courage;

44
0:02:01.187,000 --> 0:02:02,000
it was out of guilt.

45
0:02:03.315,000 --> 0:02:04,000
See, I'm black.

46
0:02:05.043,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I don't know if y'all noticed that.

47
0:02:06.812,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:07.861,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But I couldn't sit in St. Louis, minutes away from Ferguson,

49
0:02:13.362,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and not go see.

50
0:02:14.855,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So I got off my ass to go check it out.

51
0:02:17.321,000 --> 0:02:18,000
When I got out there,

52
0:02:18.785,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I found something surprising.

53
0:02:22.47,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I found anger; there was a lot of that.

54
0:02:25.327,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But what I found more of was love.

55
0:02:28.565,000 --> 0:02:29,000
People with love for themselves.

56
0:02:30.497,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Love for their community.

57
0:02:32.161,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And it was beautiful --

58
0:02:33.874,000 --> 0:02:34,000
until the police showed up.

59
0:02:36.495,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Then a new emotion was interjected into the conversation:

60
0:02:40.815,000 --> 0:02:41,000
fear.

61
0:02:42.447,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now, I'm not going to lie;

62
0:02:44.156,000 --> 0:02:46,000
when I saw those armored vehicles,

63
0:02:46.974,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and all that gear

64
0:02:48.159,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and all those guns

65
0:02:49.549,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and all those police

66
0:02:51.334,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I was terrified --

67
0:02:52.821,000 --> 0:02:53,000
personally.

68
0:02:55.791,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And when I looked around that crowd,

69
0:02:57.569,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I saw a lot of people that had the same thing going on.

70
0:03:00.355,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But I also saw people with something else inside of them.

71
0:03:04.05,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That was courage.

72
0:03:05.667,000 --> 0:03:06,000
See, those people yelled,

73
0:03:07.069,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and they screamed,

74
0:03:08.335,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and they were not about to back down from the police.

75
0:03:10.911,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They were past that point.

76
0:03:12.583,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And then I could feel something in me changing,

77
0:03:14.858,000 --> 0:03:15,000
so I yelled and I screamed,

78
0:03:17.309,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and I noticed that everybody around me was doing the same thing.

79
0:03:21.647,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And there was nothing like that feeling.

80
0:03:24.843,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I decided I wanted to do something more.

81
0:03:27.425,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I went home, I thought: I'm an artist. I make shit.

82
0:03:30.753,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So I started making things specific to the protest,

83
0:03:35.912,000 --> 0:03:37,000
things that would be weapons in a spiritual war,

84
0:03:40.257,000 --> 0:03:41,000
things that would give people voice

85
0:03:43.291,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and things that would fortify them for the road ahead.

86
0:03:46.874,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I did a project where I took pictures of the hands of protesters

87
0:03:50.311,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and put them up and down the boarded-up buildings

88
0:03:54.325,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and community shops.

89
0:03:56.69,000 --> 0:03:59,000
My goal was to raise awareness and to raise the morale.

90
0:04:00.334,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I think, for a minute at least,

91
0:04:02.759,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it did just that.

92
0:04:05.77,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Then I thought, I want to uplift the stories of these people

93
0:04:09.334,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I was watching being courageous in the moment.

94
0:04:12.258,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And myself and my friend,

95
0:04:15.95,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan

96
0:04:17.946,000 --> 0:04:19,000
did just that with our documentary,

97
0:04:20.148,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"Whose Streets?"

98
0:04:23.316,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I kind of became a conduit

99
0:04:25.452,000 --> 0:04:28,000
for all of this courage that was given to me.

100
0:04:28.998,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I think that's part of our job as artists.

101
0:04:32.836,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I think we should be conveyors of courage in the work that we do.

102
0:04:37.154,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And I think that we are the wall between the normal folks

103
0:04:41.46,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the people that use their power to spread fear and hate,

104
0:04:44.94,000 --> 0:04:45,000
especially in times like these.

105
0:04:48.257,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So I'm going to ask you.

106
0:04:50.082,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Y'all the movers and the shakers,

107
0:04:52.37,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you know, the thought leaders:

108
0:04:54.448,000 --> 0:04:55,000
What are you gonna do

109
0:04:56.312,000 --> 0:04:58,000
with the gifts that you've been given

110
0:04:58.359,000 --> 0:05:,000
to break us from the fear the binds us every day?

111
0:05:01.58,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Because, see, I'm afraid every day.

112
0:05:04.304,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I can't remember a time when I wasn't.

113
0:05:07.126,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But once I figured out that fear was not put in me to cripple me,

114
0:05:11.393,000 --> 0:05:12,000
it was there to protect me,

115
0:05:13.624,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and once I figured out how to use that fear,

116
0:05:16.644,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I found my power.

117
0:05:18.926,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Thank you.

118
0:05:20.146,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Applause)

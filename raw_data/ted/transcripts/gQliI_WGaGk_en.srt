1
0:00:25.182,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.

2
0:00:30.786,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I'll try and do that,

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.

4
0:00:38.52,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known

5
0:00:41.805,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for most of recorded history,

6
0:00:45.082,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system,

7
0:00:49.883,000 --> 0:00:51,000
or our environment or whatever,

8
0:00:52.829,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution --

9
0:00:59.271,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or creation, as it used to be thought --

10
0:01:02.104,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.

11
0:01:09.263,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Nowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.

12
0:01:13.819,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And the idea there is that outside the spaceship,

13
0:01:16.533,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the universe is implacably hostile,

14
0:01:19.47,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and inside is all we have, all we depend on,

15
0:01:23.27,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,

16
0:01:26.501,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we've got nowhere else to go.

17
0:01:28.398,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now, the second thing that everyone already knows

18
0:01:31.124,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history,

19
0:01:36.593,000 --> 0:01:41,000
human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.

20
0:01:42.411,000 --> 0:01:44,000
As Stephen Hawking famously said,

21
0:01:44.676,000 --> 0:01:48,000
we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet

22
0:01:49.596,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that's in orbit around a typical star,

23
0:01:51.906,000 --> 0:01:54,000
which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.

24
0:01:56.941,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying

25
0:02:01.806,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on.

26
0:02:07.069,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.

27
0:02:09.95,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by

28
0:02:14.835,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and to inform your life decisions,

29
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:22,000
then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.

30
0:02:23.48,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.

31
0:02:28.861,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:30.266,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And they are.

33
0:02:32.333,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So let me start with the second one: typical.

34
0:02:39.569,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Well, is this a typical place?

35
0:02:42.175,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction,

36
0:02:45.164,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and we see a wall and chemical scum --

37
0:02:50.777,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:52.187,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and that's not typical of the universe at all.

39
0:02:56.852,000 --> 0:02:59,000
All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction

40
0:03:00.343,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and look back,

41
0:03:01.539,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all --

42
0:03:04.848,000 --> 0:03:05,000
all you see is a blue planet.

43
0:03:06.658,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And if you go further than that,

44
0:03:09.301,000 --> 0:03:13,000
you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on,

45
0:03:13.614,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but that's still not typical of the universe,

46
0:03:15.769,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because stars come in galaxies.

47
0:03:19.176,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,

48
0:03:23.919,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is nowhere near any galaxies.

49
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy,

50
0:03:30.722,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and look back,

51
0:03:31.907,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.

52
0:03:37.379,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.

53
0:03:43.491,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.

54
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
To get to a typical place,

55
0:03:49.773,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that,

56
0:03:54.314,000 --> 0:03:56,000
into intergalactic space.

57
0:03:56.87,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And so, what does that look like -- "typical?"

58
0:03:59.937,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What does a "typical" place in the universe look like?

59
0:04:02.51,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged

60
0:04:06.544,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering

61
0:04:11.761,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of the view from intergalactic space.

62
0:04:15.11,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?

63
0:04:23.04,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Well, not quite, not quite perfect.

64
0:04:26.39,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.

65
0:04:33.095,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's so dark,

66
0:04:35.002,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you,

67
0:04:40.714,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and that star were to explode as a supernova,

68
0:04:44.814,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,

69
0:04:49.726,000 --> 0:04:52,000
you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.

70
0:04:53.667,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That's how big and how dark the universe is.

71
0:04:56.786,000 --> 0:05:,000
And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright,

72
0:05:01.683,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so brilliant an event,

73
0:05:04.152,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.

74
0:05:08.306,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

75
0:05:09.949,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And yet, from intergalactic space,

76
0:05:11.888,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.

77
0:05:14.347,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's also very cold out there --

78
0:05:17.384,000 --> 0:05:2,000
less than three degrees above absolute zero.

79
0:05:20.553,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And it's very empty.

80
0:05:22.435,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum

81
0:05:28.417,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that our best technology on Earth can currently create.

82
0:05:31.645,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So that's how different a typical place is from this place.

83
0:05:38.049,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And that is how untypical this place is.

84
0:05:41.151,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.

85
0:05:46.343,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different

86
0:05:51.628,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and so alien from anything we're used to?

87
0:05:54.699,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us --

88
0:05:58.199,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is creating knowledge.

89
0:06:00.139,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Well, what does that mean?

90
0:06:01.503,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Well, look out even further than we've just been --

91
0:06:05.233,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I mean from here, with a telescope --

92
0:06:07.384,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars.

93
0:06:11.611,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"Quasars" originally meant "quasi-stellar object,"

94
0:06:14.759,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which means "things that look a bit like stars."

95
0:06:17.679,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

96
0:06:19.028,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But they're not stars.

97
0:06:20.252,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And we know what they are.

98
0:06:24.58,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away,

99
0:06:27.853,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed

100
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
towards a supermassive black hole.

101
0:06:34.465,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy

102
0:06:39.222,000 --> 0:06:4,000
of that gravitational collapse

103
0:06:40.716,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and some of the matter

104
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
back out in the form of tremendous jets,

105
0:06:44.123,000 --> 0:06:45,000
which illuminated lobes

106
0:06:45.981,000 --> 0:06:49,000
with the brilliance of -- I think it's a trillion -- suns.

107
0:06:52.925,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike

108
0:06:57.486,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the physics of such a jet.

109
0:06:59.434,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We couldn't survive for an instant in it.

110
0:07:01.745,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Language breaks down when trying to describe

111
0:07:04.778,000 --> 0:07:06,000
what it would be like in one of those jets.

112
0:07:07.113,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion,

113
0:07:10.137,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.

114
0:07:13.779,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

115
0:07:17.376,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way

116
0:07:23.288,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe,

117
0:07:27.032,000 --> 0:07:31,000
some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe

118
0:07:31.198,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and model and predict and explain, above all --

119
0:07:35.212,000 --> 0:07:37,000
there's your reference --

120
0:07:37.472,000 --> 0:07:4,000
what was happening there, in reality.

121
0:07:41.673,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model

122
0:07:46.331,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of the other, the quasar.

123
0:07:48.281,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well,

124
0:07:51.802,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but an explanatory model,

125
0:07:53.807,000 --> 0:07:56,000
embodying the same mathematical relationships

126
0:07:56.878,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and the same causal structure.

127
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Now, that is knowledge.

128
0:08:02.058,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And if that weren't amazing enough,

129
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other

130
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
is increasing with time.

131
0:08:10.107,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That is the growth of knowledge.

132
0:08:12.604,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So, the laws of physics have this special property,

133
0:08:16.087,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be

134
0:08:20.781,000 --> 0:08:25,000
can, nevertheless, embody the same mathematical and causal structure

135
0:08:26.588,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and to do it more and more so over time.

136
0:08:30.068,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So we are a chemical scum that is different.

137
0:08:33.367,000 --> 0:08:36,000
This chemical scum has universality.

138
0:08:36.88,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision,

139
0:08:41.359,000 --> 0:08:42,000
the structure of everything.

140
0:08:42.726,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This place, and not other places in the universe,

141
0:08:46.517,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence

142
0:08:52.554,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of the whole of the rest of physical reality.

143
0:08:55.315,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And so, far from being insignificant,

144
0:08:57.187,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the fact that the laws of physics allow this

145
0:08:59.982,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or even mandate that this can happen

146
0:09:03.507,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is one of the most important things about the physical world.

147
0:09:08.431,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now, how does the solar system -- our environment, in the form of us --

148
0:09:13.722,000 --> 0:09:16,000
acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?

149
0:09:17.072,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark --

150
0:09:21.914,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis --

151
0:09:25.964,000 --> 0:09:3,000
one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics,

152
0:09:31.926,000 --> 0:09:33,000
there's no special dispensation, no miracles involved.

153
0:09:34.941,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.

154
0:09:39.11,000 --> 0:09:4,000
One of them is matter,

155
0:09:40.745,000 --> 0:09:44,000
because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.

156
0:09:45.754,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer,

157
0:09:49.715,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and there's no known way of making a computer without matter.

158
0:09:52.738,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We also need energy to make the computer, and most important,

159
0:09:56.237,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to make the media, in effect, onto which we record

160
0:10:00.231,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the knowledge that we discover.

161
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential

162
0:10:06.165,000 --> 0:10:1,000
for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations,

163
0:10:10.497,000 --> 0:10:12,000
is evidence.

164
0:10:14.245,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, our environment is inundated with evidence.

165
0:10:17.347,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We happened to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's law of gravity,

166
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:24,000
about 300 years ago.

167
0:10:24.802,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But the evidence that we used to do that

168
0:10:28.116,000 --> 0:10:31,000
was falling down on every square meter of the Earth

169
0:10:31.429,000 --> 0:10:32,000
for billions of years before that,

170
0:10:33.106,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and we'll continue to fall for billions of years afterwards.

171
0:10:37.567,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And the same is true for all the other sciences.

172
0:10:40.095,000 --> 0:10:41,000
As far as we know,

173
0:10:42.053,000 --> 0:10:46,000
evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences

174
0:10:46.232,000 --> 0:10:49,000
is here just for the taking, on our planet.

175
0:10:49.298,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Our location is saturated with evidence

176
0:10:52.186,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and also with matter and energy.

177
0:10:54.642,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Out in intergalactic space,

178
0:10:56.904,000 --> 0:10:59,000
those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge

179
0:11:00.317,000 --> 0:11:02,000
are at their lowest possible supply --

180
0:11:02.761,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there.

181
0:11:07.528,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Or is it?

182
0:11:09.29,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.

183
0:11:13.137,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Laughter)

184
0:11:14.237,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space,

185
0:11:19.195,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the same size as our home, the solar system.

186
0:11:22.749,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now, that cube is very empty by human standards,

187
0:11:26.115,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.

188
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station,

189
0:11:36.116,000 --> 0:11:38,000
on which there's a colony of scientists

190
0:11:38.374,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.

191
0:11:42.799,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now, it's way beyond present technology

192
0:11:45.023,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space

193
0:11:49.058,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and form it into other elements and so on.

194
0:11:52.872,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe,

195
0:11:55.824,000 --> 0:11:58,000
if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics,

196
0:11:59.214,000 --> 0:12:03,000
then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?

197
0:12:03.383,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.

198
0:12:07.079,000 --> 0:12:1,000
If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply,

199
0:12:10.419,000 --> 0:12:13,000
because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.

200
0:12:13.973,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And evidence?

201
0:12:15.648,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses,

202
0:12:18.847,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but all you've got to do is take a telescope,

203
0:12:20.99,000 --> 0:12:22,000
even one of present-day design,

204
0:12:23.157,000 --> 0:12:26,000
look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.

205
0:12:27.682,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And with a more powerful telescope,

206
0:12:29.967,000 --> 0:12:31,000
you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies,

207
0:12:32.843,000 --> 0:12:35,000
you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics.

208
0:12:36.147,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And locally there, you could build particle accelerators

209
0:12:38.871,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.

210
0:12:42.167,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips --

211
0:12:46.554,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Laughter)

212
0:12:47.895,000 --> 0:12:5,000
because it would take several hundred million years

213
0:12:50.938,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.

214
0:12:54.272,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard --

215
0:12:56.507,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but I never did like biology field trips much --

216
0:12:59.865,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter)

217
0:13:01.197,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and I think we can just about make do

218
0:13:03.217,000 --> 0:13:05,000
with one every few hundred million years.

219
0:13:05.341,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Laughter)

220
0:13:07.382,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So, in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites

221
0:13:14.362,000 --> 0:13:16,000
for the open-ended creation of knowledge.

222
0:13:17.357,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Any such cube anywhere in the universe

223
0:13:20.45,000 --> 0:13:24,000
could become the same kind of hub that we are,

224
0:13:25.059,000 --> 0:13:29,000
if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.

225
0:13:30.758,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.

226
0:13:34.256,000 --> 0:13:36,000
If intergalactic space is capable of creating

227
0:13:36.708,000 --> 0:13:38,000
an open-ended stream of explanations,

228
0:13:39.318,000 --> 0:13:41,000
then so is almost every other environment,

229
0:13:41.509,000 --> 0:13:42,000
so is the Earth.

230
0:13:42.763,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So is a polluted Earth.

231
0:13:45.521,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And the limiting factor, there and here,

232
0:13:49.292,000 --> 0:13:51,000
is not resources -- because they're plentiful --

233
0:13:52.09,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but knowledge, which is scarce.

234
0:13:54.679,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and, I think, ought to --

235
0:14:00.604,000 --> 0:14:02,000
make us feel very special.

236
0:14:03.036,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But it should also make us feel vulnerable,

237
0:14:05.585,000 --> 0:14:08,000
because it means that without the specific knowledge

238
0:14:09.024,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe,

239
0:14:12.795,000 --> 0:14:13,000
we won't survive them.

240
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away,

241
0:14:17.572,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and we'll all be dead!

242
0:14:19.254,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Martin Rees has recently written a book

243
0:14:21.677,000 --> 0:14:24,000
about our vulnerability to all sorts of things,

244
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:28,000
from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong,

245
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.

246
0:14:33.459,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance

247
0:14:36.825,000 --> 0:14:37,000
of surviving this century.

248
0:14:38.276,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.

249
0:14:41.435,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Now, I don't think that probability is the right category

250
0:14:46.607,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to discuss this issue in,

251
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:49,000
but I do agree with him about this:

252
0:14:49.759,000 --> 0:14:53,000
we can survive and we can fail to survive.

253
0:14:54.565,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But it depends, not on chance,

254
0:14:57.345,000 --> 0:15:,000
but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.

255
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
The danger is not at all unprecedented.

256
0:15:03.826,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Species go extinct all the time.

257
0:15:07.071,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Civilizations end.

258
0:15:09.35,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations

259
0:15:12.713,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that have ever existed

260
0:15:14.021,000 --> 0:15:15,000
are now history.

261
0:15:15.322,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And if we want to be the exception to that,

262
0:15:18.22,000 --> 0:15:23,000
then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature

263
0:15:24.143,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others,

264
0:15:28.791,000 --> 0:15:32,000
namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics,

265
0:15:33.262,000 --> 0:15:37,000
our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge --

266
0:15:37.759,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to be a hub of existence.

267
0:15:40.919,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So let me now apply this to a current controversy,

268
0:15:44.663,000 --> 0:15:47,000
not because I want to advocate any particular solution,

269
0:15:47.902,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.

270
0:15:50.56,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And the controversy is global warming.

271
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.

272
0:15:56.029,000 --> 0:15:59,000
In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman.

273
0:15:59.84,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And the rational thing for a layman to do

274
0:16:02.642,000 --> 0:16:06,000
is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.

275
0:16:07.167,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster,

276
0:16:11.858,000 --> 0:16:16,000
because, if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions

277
0:16:17.712,000 --> 0:16:18,000
with something like the Kyoto Protocol,

278
0:16:19.633,000 --> 0:16:22,000
with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost

279
0:16:23.385,000 --> 0:16:25,000
of hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is,

280
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.

281
0:16:31.441,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,

282
0:16:36.475,000 --> 0:16:38,000
merely to postpone it by a little.

283
0:16:38.879,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So it's already too late to avoid it,

284
0:16:40.688,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and it probably has been too late to avoid it

285
0:16:43.596,000 --> 0:16:46,000
ever since before anyone realized the danger.

286
0:16:47.441,000 --> 0:16:5,000
It was probably already too late in the 1970s,

287
0:16:50.529,000 --> 0:16:53,000
when the best available scientific theory was telling us

288
0:16:53.748,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age,

289
0:16:57.388,000 --> 0:16:59,000
in which billions would die.

290
0:17:00.312,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me,

291
0:17:02.495,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.

292
0:17:06.106,000 --> 0:17:09,000
It is that we can't always know.

293
0:17:09.436,000 --> 0:17:11,000
When we know of an impending disaster

294
0:17:12.153,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself,

295
0:17:16.72,000 --> 0:17:18,000
then there's not going to be much argument, really.

296
0:17:19.73,000 --> 0:17:23,000
But no precautions and no precautionary principle

297
0:17:24.269,000 --> 0:17:28,000
can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.

298
0:17:29.069,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing,

299
0:17:33.522,000 --> 0:17:35,000
not just problem-avoidance.

300
0:17:36.712,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure,

301
0:17:40.12,000 --> 0:17:42,000
but that's only if we know what to prevent.

302
0:17:43.072,000 --> 0:17:44,000
If you've been punched on the nose,

303
0:17:45.057,000 --> 0:17:47,000
then the science of medicine does not consist of

304
0:17:47.684,000 --> 0:17:48,000
teaching you how to avoid punches.

305
0:17:49.654,000 --> 0:17:5,000
(Laughter)

306
0:17:50.694,000 --> 0:17:55,000
If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only,

307
0:17:56.176,000 --> 0:17:58,000
then it would achieve very little of either.

308
0:17:58.771,000 --> 0:18:,000
The world is buzzing at the moment

309
0:18:00.82,000 --> 0:18:04,000
with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.

310
0:18:05.998,000 --> 0:18:09,000
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature

311
0:18:10.253,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and with plans to live at the higher temperature --

312
0:18:13.364,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply.

313
0:18:16.532,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And some such plans exist,

314
0:18:17.883,000 --> 0:18:21,000
things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away

315
0:18:22.545,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.

316
0:18:26.307,000 --> 0:18:28,000
At the moment, these things are fringe research;

317
0:18:29.312,000 --> 0:18:32,000
they're not central to the human effort to face this problem

318
0:18:33.088,000 --> 0:18:34,000
or problems in general.

319
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:37,000
And with problems that we are not aware of yet,

320
0:18:37.876,000 --> 0:18:43,000
the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely --

321
0:18:43.978,000 --> 0:18:45,000
is our only hope, not just of solving problems,

322
0:18:46.795,000 --> 0:18:47,000
but of survival.

323
0:18:48.711,000 --> 0:18:51,000
So, take two stone tablets

324
0:18:53.47,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and carve on them.

325
0:18:56.114,000 --> 0:18:58,000
On one of them, carve:

326
0:18:58.199,000 --> 0:19:,000
"Problems are soluble."

327
0:19:00.763,000 --> 0:19:02,000
And on the other one, carve:

328
0:19:02.912,000 --> 0:19:03,000
"Problems are inevitable."

329
0:19:05.444,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Thank you.

330
0:19:06.626,000 --> 0:19:07,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.457,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Throughout the history of computers

2
0:00:15.581,000 --> 0:00:18,000
we've been striving to shorten the gap between us

3
0:00:18.828,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and digital information,

4
0:00:20.422,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the gap between our physical world

5
0:00:22.256,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and the world in the screen

6
0:00:24.054,000 --> 0:00:26,000
where our imagination can go wild.

7
0:00:26.896,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And this gap has become shorter,

8
0:00:30.823,000 --> 0:00:32,000
shorter, and even shorter,

9
0:00:33.588,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and now this gap is shortened down

10
0:00:35.232,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to less than a millimeter,

11
0:00:36.542,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the thickness of a touch-screen glass,

12
0:00:38.42,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the power of computing

13
0:00:39.87,000 --> 0:00:43,000
has become accessible to everyone.

14
0:00:44.773,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?

15
0:00:49.812,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I started to imagine what this would look like.

16
0:00:53.556,000 --> 0:00:55,000
First, I created this tool

17
0:00:56.007,000 --> 0:00:58,000
which penetrates into the digital space,

18
0:00:58.516,000 --> 0:01:,000
so when you press it hard on the screen,

19
0:01:00.607,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it transfers its physical body into pixels.

20
0:01:03.94,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Designers can materialize their ideas

21
0:01:06.052,000 --> 0:01:07,000
directly in 3D,

22
0:01:07.748,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and surgeons can practice on virtual organs

23
0:01:10.3,000 --> 0:01:12,000
underneath the screen.

24
0:01:12.524,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.

25
0:01:17.421,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But our two hands still remain outside the screen.

26
0:01:20.388,000 --> 0:01:22,000
How can you reach inside and interact

27
0:01:22.872,000 --> 0:01:23,000
with the digital information

28
0:01:24.299,000 --> 0:01:26,000
using the full dexterity of our hands?

29
0:01:27.303,000 --> 0:01:29,000
At Microsoft Applied Sciences,

30
0:01:29.605,000 --> 0:01:3,000
along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,

31
0:01:31.521,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I redesigned the computer

32
0:01:32.792,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and turned a little space above the keyboard

33
0:01:35.673,000 --> 0:01:37,000
into a digital workspace.

34
0:01:38.038,000 --> 0:01:4,000
By combining a transparent display and depth cameras

35
0:01:40.539,000 --> 0:01:41,000
for sensing your fingers and face,

36
0:01:42.189,000 --> 0:01:44,000
now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard

37
0:01:44.499,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and reach inside this 3D space

38
0:01:47.337,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and grab pixels with your bare hands.

39
0:01:49.837,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Applause)

40
0:01:52.808,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Because windows and files have a position in the real space,

41
0:01:57.014,000 --> 0:02:,000
selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.

42
0:02:00.373,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Then you can flip through this book

43
0:02:02.526,000 --> 0:02:03,000
while highlighting the lines, words

44
0:02:04.243,000 --> 0:02:06,000
on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.

45
0:02:06.807,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Architects can stretch or rotate the models

46
0:02:09.342,000 --> 0:02:11,000
with their two hands directly.

47
0:02:11.767,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So in these examples,

48
0:02:13.387,000 --> 0:02:15,000
we are reaching into the digital world.

49
0:02:16.124,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But how about reversing its role

50
0:02:18.47,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and having the digital information reach us instead?

51
0:02:23.289,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'm sure many of us have had the experience

52
0:02:25.361,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of buying and returning items online.

53
0:02:27.468,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But now you don't have to worry about it.

54
0:02:29.445,000 --> 0:02:33,000
What I got here is an online augmented fitting room.

55
0:02:34.083,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is a view that you get from

56
0:02:35.985,000 --> 0:02:36,000
head-mounted or see-through display

57
0:02:37.729,000 --> 0:02:42,000
when the system understands the geometry of your body.

58
0:02:42.876,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Taking this idea further, I started to think,

59
0:02:46.427,000 --> 0:02:49,000
instead of just seeing these pixels in our space,

60
0:02:49.796,000 --> 0:02:5,000
how can we make it physical

61
0:02:51.318,000 --> 0:02:55,000
so that we can touch and feel it?

62
0:02:55.58,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What would such a future look like?

63
0:02:58.629,000 --> 0:03:01,000
At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii

64
0:03:02.287,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and my collaborator Rehmi Post,

65
0:03:04.31,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we created this one physical pixel.

66
0:03:07.954,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Well, in this case, this spherical magnet

67
0:03:10.578,000 --> 0:03:12,000
acts like a 3D pixel in our space,

68
0:03:12.93,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which means that both computers and people

69
0:03:15.834,000 --> 0:03:16,000
can move this object to anywhere

70
0:03:17.732,000 --> 0:03:18,000
within this little 3D space.

71
0:03:19.701,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What we did was essentially canceling gravity

72
0:03:23.193,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and controlling the movement by combining

73
0:03:25.332,000 --> 0:03:27,000
magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation

74
0:03:28.156,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and sensing technologies.

75
0:03:30.633,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And by digitally programming the object,

76
0:03:33.138,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we are liberating the object from constraints

77
0:03:35.915,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of time and space, which means that now,

78
0:03:39.35,000 --> 0:03:42,000
human motions can be recorded and played back

79
0:03:43.246,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and left permanently in the physical world.

80
0:03:46.865,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So choreography can be taught physically over distance

81
0:03:49.898,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated

82
0:03:52.494,000 --> 0:03:55,000
over and over as a physical reality.

83
0:03:55.972,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Students can use this as a tool

84
0:03:58.152,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to learn about the complex concepts

85
0:04:00.094,000 --> 0:04:04,000
such as planetary motion, physics,

86
0:04:04.178,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and unlike computer screens or textbooks,

87
0:04:06.997,000 --> 0:04:08,000
this is a real, tangible experience

88
0:04:09.479,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.

89
0:04:13.137,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And what's more exciting

90
0:04:15.119,000 --> 0:04:18,000
than just turning what's currently in the computer physical

91
0:04:18.467,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is to start imagining how programming the world

92
0:04:21.656,000 --> 0:04:24,000
will alter even our daily physical activities.

93
0:04:27.46,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:29.942,000 --> 0:04:31,000
As you can see, the digital information

95
0:04:32.699,000 --> 0:04:33,000
will not just show us something

96
0:04:34.217,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but it will start directly acting upon us

97
0:04:36.327,000 --> 0:04:38,000
as a part of our physical surroundings

98
0:04:38.626,000 --> 0:04:42,000
without disconnecting ourselves from our world.

99
0:04:42.824,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Today, we started by talking about the boundary,

100
0:04:47.17,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but if we remove this boundary,

101
0:04:49.85,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the only boundary left is our imagination.

102
0:04:53.738,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Thank you.

103
0:04:54.986,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Applause)

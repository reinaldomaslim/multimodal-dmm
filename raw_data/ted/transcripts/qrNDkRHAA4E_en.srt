0:00:14.468,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to discuss with you this afternoon

3
0:00:18.15,000 --> 0:00:2,000
why you're going to fail to have a great career.

4
0:00:20.612,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:22.011,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm an economist.

6
0:00:24.706,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I do dismal.

7
0:00:26.823,000 --> 0:00:29,000
End of the day, it's ready for dismal remarks.

8
0:00:31.204,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I only want to talk to those of you who want a great career.

9
0:00:35.185,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I know some of you have already decided you want a good career.

10
0:00:38.931,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You're going to fail, too.

11
0:00:40.345,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:41.44,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Because -- goodness, you're all cheery about failing.

13
0:00:44.073,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:45.106,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Canadian group, undoubtedly.

15
0:00:46.932,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:50.082,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Those trying to have good careers are going to fail,

17
0:00:52.924,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because, really, good jobs are now disappearing.

18
0:00:56.297,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There are great jobs and great careers,

19
0:00:59.658,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and then there are the high-workload,

20
0:01:02.314,000 --> 0:01:06,000
high-stress, bloodsucking, soul-destroying kinds of jobs,

21
0:01:06.814,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and practically nothing in-between.

22
0:01:08.539,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So people looking for good jobs are going to fail.

23
0:01:10.964,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I want to talk about those looking for great jobs, great careers,

24
0:01:14.17,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and why you're going to fail.

25
0:01:17.937,000 --> 0:01:22,000
First reason is that no matter how many times people tell you,

26
0:01:23.923,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"If you want a great career, you have to pursue your passion,

27
0:01:27.177,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you have to pursue your dreams, you have to pursue

28
0:01:30.446,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the greatest fascination in your life,"

29
0:01:33.438,000 --> 0:01:36,000
you hear it again and again, and then you decide not to do it.

30
0:01:36.717,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It doesn't matter how many times you download

31
0:01:40.065,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address,

32
0:01:44.264,000 --> 0:01:46,000
you still look at it and decide not to do it.

33
0:01:47.1,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it.

34
0:01:49.814,000 --> 0:01:51,000
You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.

35
0:01:51.915,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You're afraid if you look for your passion and don't find it,

36
0:01:54.806,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you'll feel like you're an idiot, so then you make excuses

37
0:01:57.56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
about why you're not going to look for your passion.

38
0:02:00.306,000 --> 0:02:01,000
They are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.

39
0:02:02.226,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We're going to go through a whole long list --

40
0:02:04.425,000 --> 0:02:08,000
your creativity in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do

41
0:02:08.715,000 --> 0:02:1,000
if you want to have a great career.

42
0:02:10.961,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So, for example, one of your great excuses is:

43
0:02:16.609,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Sigh)

44
0:02:17.99,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"Well, great careers are really and truly, for most people,

45
0:02:21.769,000 --> 0:02:23,000
just a matter of luck.

46
0:02:23.92,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I'm going to stand around, I'm going to try to be lucky,

47
0:02:27.016,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and if I'm lucky, I'll have a great career.

48
0:02:29.286,000 --> 0:02:3,000
If not, I'll have a good career."

49
0:02:30.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But a good career is an impossibility, so that's not going to work.

50
0:02:34.547,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Then, your other excuse is,

51
0:02:36.222,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"Yes, there are special people who pursue their passions,

52
0:02:40.808,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but they are geniuses.

53
0:02:42.166,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They are Steven J.

54
0:02:43.744,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'm not a genius.

55
0:02:45.371,000 --> 0:02:47,000
When I was five, I thought I was a genius,

56
0:02:48.002,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since."

57
0:02:51.946,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:53.325,000 --> 0:02:57,000
"And now I know I am completely competent."

59
0:02:57.841,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now, you see, if this was 1950,

60
0:03:00.547,000 --> 0:03:03,000
being completely competent --

61
0:03:03.587,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that would have given you a great career.

62
0:03:05.653,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But guess what?

63
0:03:06.83,000 --> 0:03:09,000
This is almost 2012, and saying to the world,

64
0:03:10.575,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"I am totally, completely competent,"

65
0:03:13.914,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is damning yourself with the faintest of praise.

66
0:03:18.424,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And then, of course, another excuse:

67
0:03:20.416,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"Well, I would do this, I would do this, but, but --

68
0:03:23.996,000 --> 0:03:26,000
well, after all, I'm not weird.

69
0:03:27.963,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Everybody knows that people who pursue their passions

70
0:03:30.677,000 --> 0:03:31,000
are somewhat obsessive.

71
0:03:32.104,000 --> 0:03:33,000
A little strange.

72
0:03:33.597,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Hmm? Hmm? Okay?

73
0:03:35.256,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You know, a fine line between madness and genius.

74
0:03:38.502,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"I'm not weird. I've read Steven J.'s biography.

75
0:03:42.811,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Oh my goodness -- I'm not that person. I am nice.

76
0:03:46.694,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I am normal.

77
0:03:48.052,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I'm a nice, normal person, and nice, normal people --

78
0:03:53.003,000 --> 0:03:54,000
don't have passion."

79
0:03:54.574,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:55.622,000 --> 0:03:57,000
"Ah, but I still want a great career.

81
0:03:58.147,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I'm not prepared to pursue my passion,

82
0:04:00.1,000 --> 0:04:01,000
so I know what I'm going to do,

83
0:04:01.655,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because I have a solution.

84
0:04:03.543,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I have a strategy.

85
0:04:05.019,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's the one Mommy and Daddy told me about.

86
0:04:07.457,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Mommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard,

87
0:04:10.536,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I'd have a good career.

88
0:04:12.877,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So, if you work hard and have a good career,

89
0:04:15.639,000 --> 0:04:17,000
if you work really, really, really hard,

90
0:04:17.671,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you'll have a great career.

91
0:04:19.016,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Doesn't that, like, mathematically make sense?"

92
0:04:21.456,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Hmm. Not.

93
0:04:22.964,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But you've managed to talk yourself into that.

94
0:04:25.453,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You know what? Here's a little secret:

95
0:04:27.553,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You want to work? You want to work really, really, really hard?

96
0:04:30.647,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You know what? You'll succeed.

97
0:04:32.124,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The world will give you the opportunity

98
0:04:34.054,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to work really, really, really, really hard.

99
0:04:37.693,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But, are you so sure

100
0:04:40.657,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that that's going to give you a great career,

101
0:04:43.601,000 --> 0:04:45,000
when all the evidence is to the contrary?

102
0:04:46.443,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So let's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion.

103
0:04:51.97,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You actually understand that you really had better do it,

104
0:04:54.667,000 --> 0:04:55,000
never mind the excuses.

105
0:04:56.017,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You're trying to find your passion --

106
0:04:58.658,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Sigh)

107
0:04:59.683,000 --> 0:05:,000
and you're so happy.

108
0:05:01.842,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You found something you're interested in.

109
0:05:04.125,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"I have an interest! I have an interest!"

110
0:05:06.19,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You tell me.

111
0:05:07.372,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You say, "I have an interest!" I say, "That's wonderful!

112
0:05:10.419,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And what are you trying to tell me?"

113
0:05:12.69,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"Well, I have an interest."

114
0:05:14.229,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I say, "Do you have passion?"

115
0:05:15.813,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"I have an interest," you say.

116
0:05:18.022,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"Your interest is compared to what?"

117
0:05:19.768,000 --> 0:05:2,000
"Well, I'm interested in this."

118
0:05:22.879,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"And what about the rest of humanity's activities?"

119
0:05:26.001,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"I'm not interested in them."

120
0:05:27.82,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"You've looked at them all, have you?"

121
0:05:29.947,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"No. Not exactly."

122
0:05:32.693,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Passion is your greatest love.

123
0:05:35.327,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Passion is the thing

124
0:05:37.605,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that will help you create the highest expression of your talent.

125
0:05:42.649,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Passion, interest -- it's not the same thing.

126
0:05:45.244,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Are you really going to go to your sweetie and say,

127
0:05:47.799,000 --> 0:05:49,000
"Marry me! You're interesting."

128
0:05:50.682,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:53.816,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Won't happen.

130
0:05:55.776,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Won't happen, and you will die alone.

131
0:05:57.894,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
What you want,

133
0:06:00.569,000 --> 0:06:02,000
what you want, what you want,

134
0:06:03.101,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is passion.

135
0:06:04.513,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It is beyond interest.

136
0:06:06.347,000 --> 0:06:09,000
You need 20 interests, and then one of them,

137
0:06:09.997,000 --> 0:06:1,000
one of them might grab you,

138
0:06:11.767,000 --> 0:06:13,000
one of them might engage you more than anything else,

139
0:06:14.371,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and then you may have found your greatest love,

140
0:06:16.989,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in comparison to all the other things that interest you,

141
0:06:21.204,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and that's what passion is.

142
0:06:22.945,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.

143
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
He was an economically rational person.

144
0:06:29.315,000 --> 0:06:31,000
He said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.

145
0:06:33.355,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Let us merge our interests."

146
0:06:35.625,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:37.521,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Yes, he did.

148
0:06:39.259,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"I love you truly," he said. "I love you deeply.

149
0:06:43.014,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I love you more than any other woman I've ever encountered.

150
0:06:47.314,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I love you more than Mary, Jane, Susie, Penelope,

151
0:06:51.891,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Ingrid, Gertrude, Gretel --

152
0:06:53.931,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I was on a German exchange program then.

153
0:06:56.407,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I love you more than --"

154
0:06:59.47,000 --> 0:07:,000
All right.

155
0:07:01.043,000 --> 0:07:02,000
She left the room

156
0:07:02.448,000 --> 0:07:06,000
halfway through his enumeration of his love for her.

157
0:07:07.82,000 --> 0:07:11,000
After he got over his surprise at being, you know, turned down,

158
0:07:11.976,000 --> 0:07:14,000
he concluded he'd had a narrow escape

159
0:07:15.745,000 --> 0:07:18,000
from marrying an irrational person.

160
0:07:19.512,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Although, he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed,

161
0:07:22.925,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it was perhaps not necessary

162
0:07:24.608,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part.

163
0:07:29.791,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:31.906,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But the point stands.

165
0:07:33.37,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny,

166
0:07:37.035,000 --> 0:07:39,000
or are you afraid of the word "destiny"?

167
0:07:39.694,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Does the word "destiny" scare you?

168
0:07:42.554,000 --> 0:07:43,000
That's what we're talking about.

169
0:07:44.14,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And if you don't find the highest expression of your talent,

170
0:07:47.109,000 --> 0:07:5,000
if you settle for "interesting," what the hell ever that means,

171
0:07:50.307,000 --> 0:07:53,000
do you know what will happen at the end of your long life?

172
0:07:53.49,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery,

173
0:07:56.728,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone,

174
0:08:00.244,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and inscribed on that tombstone

175
0:08:01.87,000 --> 0:08:04,000
it will say, "Here lies a distinguished engineer,

176
0:08:05.745,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who invented Velcro."

177
0:08:10.505,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But what that tombstone should have said,

178
0:08:14.498,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in an alternative lifetime,

179
0:08:17.196,000 --> 0:08:21,000
what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent,

180
0:08:21.672,000 --> 0:08:25,000
was, "Here lies the last Nobel Laureate in Physics,

181
0:08:26.248,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who formulated the Grand Unified Field Theory

182
0:08:29.613,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive."

183
0:08:33.602,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:35.805,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Velcro, indeed!

185
0:08:37.576,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:40.686,000 --> 0:08:41,000
One was a great career.

187
0:08:43.694,000 --> 0:08:46,000
One was a missed opportunity.

188
0:08:47.652,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But then, there are some of you who,

189
0:08:50.066,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in spite of all these excuses, you will find,

190
0:08:53.446,000 --> 0:08:55,000
you will find your passion.

191
0:08:56.997,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And you'll still fail.

192
0:09:00.176,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You're going to fail, because --

193
0:09:04.041,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because you're not going to do it,

194
0:09:06.643,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because you will have invented a new excuse,

195
0:09:10.651,000 --> 0:09:13,000
any excuse to fail to take action,

196
0:09:14.452,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and this excuse, I've heard so many times:

197
0:09:18.57,000 --> 0:09:24,000
"Yes, I would pursue a great career,

198
0:09:25.496,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but, I value human relationships --

199
0:09:32.257,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:33.282,000 --> 0:09:34,000
more than accomplishment.

201
0:09:35.394,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I want to be a great friend.

202
0:09:37.776,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I want to be a great spouse.

203
0:09:40.044,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I want to be a great parent,

204
0:09:41.917,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and I will not sacrifice them

205
0:09:44.06,000 --> 0:09:46,000
on the altar of great accomplishment."

206
0:09:48.586,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:49.727,000 --> 0:09:5,000
What do you want me to say?

208
0:09:51.251,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Now, do you really want me to say now, tell you,

209
0:09:54.037,000 --> 0:09:56,000
"Really, I swear I don't kick children."

210
0:09:56.56,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:59.227,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Look at the worldview you've given yourself.

212
0:10:02.013,000 --> 0:10:04,000
You're a hero no matter what.

213
0:10:05.42,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And I, by suggesting ever so delicately

214
0:10:08.246,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that you might want a great career, must hate children.

215
0:10:11.444,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I don't hate children. I don't kick them.

216
0:10:13.477,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Yes, there was a little kid wandering through this building

217
0:10:16.396,000 --> 0:10:18,000
when I came here, and no, I didn't kick him.

218
0:10:18.844,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:20.311,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Course, I had to tell him the building was for adults only,

220
0:10:23.447,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and to get out.

221
0:10:25.073,000 --> 0:10:26,000
He mumbled something about his mother,

222
0:10:26.993,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and I told him she'd probably find him outside anyway.

223
0:10:30.541,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Last time I saw him, he was on the stairs crying.

224
0:10:33.249,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Laughter)

225
0:10:34.361,000 --> 0:10:35,000
What a wimp.

226
0:10:35.542,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

227
0:10:36.573,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But what do you mean? That's what you expect me to say.

228
0:10:39.189,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Do you really think it's appropriate

229
0:10:41.19,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that you should actually take children and use them as a shield?

230
0:10:47.827,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You know what will happen someday,

231
0:10:50.065,000 --> 0:10:52,000
you ideal parent, you?

232
0:10:54.071,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The kid will come to you someday and say,

233
0:10:57.112,000 --> 0:10:59,000
"I know what I want to be.

234
0:10:59.548,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I know what I'm going to do with my life."

235
0:11:01.587,000 --> 0:11:02,000
You are so happy.

236
0:11:02.786,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's the conversation a parent wants to hear,

237
0:11:05.032,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because your kid's good in math,

238
0:11:06.913,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and you know you're going to like what comes next.

239
0:11:09.73,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Says your kid,

240
0:11:11.212,000 --> 0:11:14,000
"I have decided I want to be a magician.

241
0:11:14.639,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I want to perform magic tricks on the stage."

242
0:11:19.322,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Laughter)

243
0:11:20.783,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And what do you say?

244
0:11:23.156,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You say, you say,

245
0:11:25.655,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"That's risky, kid.

246
0:11:29.002,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Might fail, kid. Don't make a lot of money at that, kid.

247
0:11:31.825,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I don't know, kid, you should think about that again, kid.

248
0:11:34.817,000 --> 0:11:35,000
You're so good at math, why don't you --"

249
0:11:36.816,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The kid interrupts you and says,

250
0:11:38.374,000 --> 0:11:41,000
"But it is my dream. It is my dream to do this."

251
0:11:42.286,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And what are you going to say?

252
0:11:44.335,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You know what you're going to say?

253
0:11:46.001,000 --> 0:11:48,000
"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but --

254
0:11:50.595,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But --"

255
0:11:51.793,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So how are you going to finish the sentence with your "but"?

256
0:11:54.717,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"But. I had a dream too, once, kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."

257
0:12:00.781,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Or are you going to tell him this:

258
0:12:03.384,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"I had a dream once, kid.

259
0:12:07.161,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But then, you were born."

260
0:12:08.727,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Laughter)

261
0:12:11.061,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Applause)

262
0:12:13.727,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Do you really want to use your family,

263
0:12:18.798,000 --> 0:12:22,000
do you really ever want to look at your spouse and your kid,

264
0:12:23.369,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and see your jailers?

265
0:12:26.601,000 --> 0:12:29,000
There was something you could have said to your kid,

266
0:12:30.236,000 --> 0:12:32,000
when he or she said, "I have a dream."

267
0:12:34.012,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You could have said --

268
0:12:35.972,000 --> 0:12:39,000
looked the kid in the face and said,

269
0:12:40.017,000 --> 0:12:41,000
"Go for it, kid!

270
0:12:43.162,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Just like I did."

271
0:12:46.58,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But you won't be able to say that,

272
0:12:49.175,000 --> 0:12:5,000
because you didn't.

273
0:12:50.857,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So you can't.

274
0:12:52.456,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Laughter)

275
0:12:57.086,000 --> 0:13:,000
And so the sins of the parents

276
0:13:00.277,000 --> 0:13:02,000
are visited on the poor children.

277
0:13:04.277,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Why will you seek refuge in human relationships

278
0:13:09.824,000 --> 0:13:14,000
as your excuse not to find and pursue your passion?

279
0:13:16.53,000 --> 0:13:17,000
You know why.

280
0:13:18.363,000 --> 0:13:2,000
In your heart of hearts, you know why,

281
0:13:20.903,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and I'm being deadly serious.

282
0:13:23.149,000 --> 0:13:25,000
You know why you would get all warm and fuzzy

283
0:13:25.861,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and wrap yourself up in human relationships.

284
0:13:29.543,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It is because you are --

285
0:13:32.969,000 --> 0:13:33,000
you know what you are.

286
0:13:34.761,000 --> 0:13:36,000
You're afraid to pursue your passion.

287
0:13:38.18,000 --> 0:13:4,000
You're afraid to look ridiculous.

288
0:13:40.236,000 --> 0:13:41,000
You're afraid to try.

289
0:13:41.768,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You're afraid you may fail.

290
0:13:47.043,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Great friend, great spouse, great parent, great career.

291
0:13:54.083,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Is that not a package? Is that not who you are?

292
0:13:58.253,000 --> 0:13:59,000
How can you be one without the other?

293
0:14:01.412,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But you're afraid.

294
0:14:04.166,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And that's why you're not going to have a great career.

295
0:14:11.401,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Unless --

296
0:14:13.792,000 --> 0:14:18,000
"unless," that most evocative of all English words --

297
0:14:19.003,000 --> 0:14:2,000
"unless."

298
0:14:21.371,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But the "unless" word is also attached

299
0:14:25.828,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to that other, most terrifying phrase,

300
0:14:30.804,000 --> 0:14:31,000
"If only I had ..."

301
0:14:33.463,000 --> 0:14:35,000
"If only I had ..."

302
0:14:36.191,000 --> 0:14:41,000
If you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain,

303
0:14:41.461,000 --> 0:14:43,000
it will hurt a lot.

304
0:14:45.007,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So, those are the many reasons

305
0:14:47.659,000 --> 0:14:48,000
why you are going to fail

306
0:14:49.659,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to have a great career.

307
0:14:53.198,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Unless --

308
0:14:58.698,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Unless.

309
0:15:01.912,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Thank you.

310
0:15:03.088,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.071,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that

2
0:00:15.117,000 --> 0:00:17,000
companies, the really cool companies,

3
0:00:17.197,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the innovative ones, the creative,

4
0:00:18.709,000 --> 0:00:19,000
new economy-type companies --

5
0:00:20.511,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Apple, Google, Facebook --

6
0:00:23.885,000 --> 0:00:25,000
are coming out of one particular country,

7
0:00:26.573,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the United States of America?

8
0:00:28.304,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!

9
0:00:30.262,000 --> 0:00:31,000
That's Europe." But, yeah.

10
0:00:31.74,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.

11
0:00:35.424,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now what I do is I'm an economist,

12
0:00:37.392,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I actually study the relationship

13
0:00:38.88,000 --> 0:00:4,000
between innovation and economic growth

14
0:00:40.925,000 --> 0:00:42,000
at the level of the company, the industry and the nation,

15
0:00:43.824,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and I work with policymakers worldwide,

16
0:00:45.939,000 --> 0:00:46,000
especially in the European Commission,

17
0:00:47.41,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but recently also in interesting places like China,

18
0:00:50.721,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I can tell you that that question

19
0:00:52.596,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is on the tip of all of their tongues:

20
0:00:55.196,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Where are the European Googles?

21
0:00:57.415,000 --> 0:01:,000
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,

22
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
which they understand is different

23
0:01:03.168,000 --> 0:01:05,000
from this old economy growth model?

24
0:01:06.049,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And what is interesting is that often,

25
0:01:08.728,000 --> 0:01:09,000
even if we're in the 21st century,

26
0:01:10.307,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we kind of come down in the end to these ideas

27
0:01:12.69,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of market versus state.

28
0:01:14.663,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's talked about in these modern ways,

29
0:01:16.715,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,

30
0:01:20.478,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,

31
0:01:24.264,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the private initiative, whether this be about

32
0:01:27.536,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a dynamic venture capital sector

33
0:01:29.75,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance

34
0:01:32.096,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to these innovative companies,

35
0:01:33.769,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the gazelles as we often call them,

36
0:01:35.894,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which traditional banks are scared of,

37
0:01:37.889,000 --> 0:01:39,000
or different types of really successful

38
0:01:39.921,000 --> 0:01:42,000
commercialization policies which actually allow these companies

39
0:01:42.927,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to bring these great inventions, their products,

40
0:01:45.182,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to the market and actually get over this

41
0:01:47.205,000 --> 0:01:49,000
really scary Death Valley period

42
0:01:49.456,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in which many companies instead fail.

43
0:01:52.022,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But what really interests me, especially nowadays

44
0:01:54.798,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and because of what's happening politically around the world,

45
0:01:57.759,000 --> 0:02:,000
is the language that's used, the narrative,

46
0:02:01.012,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the discourse, the images, the actual words.

47
0:02:04.171,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So we often are presented

48
0:02:06.476,000 --> 0:02:08,000
with the kind of words like that the private sector

49
0:02:09.449,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is also much more innovative because it's able to

50
0:02:11.719,000 --> 0:02:12,000
think out of the box.

51
0:02:13.319,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They are more dynamic.

52
0:02:15.572,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech

53
0:02:18.326,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,

54
0:02:21.464,000 --> 0:02:23,000
where he said to be innovative,

55
0:02:23.556,000 --> 0:02:25,000
you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.

56
0:02:26.326,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry

57
0:02:27.861,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and foolish and colorful guys, right?

58
0:02:30.012,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And in places like Europe,

59
0:02:31.965,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it might be more equitable,

60
0:02:33.55,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we might even be a bit better dressed

61
0:02:35.112,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and eat better than the U.S.,

62
0:02:37.378,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but the problem is this damn public sector.

63
0:02:41.41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed

64
0:02:45.403,000 --> 0:02:47,000
these things like dynamic venture capital

65
0:02:48.168,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and commercialization to actually be able to really

66
0:02:50.902,000 --> 0:02:51,000
be as fruitful as it could.

67
0:02:52.606,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And even really respectable newspapers,

68
0:02:54.558,000 --> 0:02:56,000
some that I'm actually subscribed to,

69
0:02:56.645,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the words they use are, you know,

70
0:02:58.598,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the state as this Leviathan. Right?

71
0:03:01.701,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This monster with big tentacles.

72
0:03:03.834,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They're very explicit in these editorials.

73
0:03:05.738,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary

74
0:03:08.267,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to fix these little market failures

75
0:03:10.193,000 --> 0:03:11,000
when you have public goods

76
0:03:11.952,000 --> 0:03:13,000
or different types of negative externalities like pollution,

77
0:03:14.784,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but you know what, what is the next big revolution

78
0:03:17.839,000 --> 0:03:18,000
going to be after the Internet?

79
0:03:19.257,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We all hope it might be something green,

80
0:03:21.191,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say --

81
0:03:25.4,000 --> 0:03:27,000
this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution --

82
0:03:28.266,000 --> 0:03:3,000
they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?

83
0:03:30.921,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.

84
0:03:33.409,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Even fund the basic research, because this is

85
0:03:35.432,000 --> 0:03:37,000
popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good

86
0:03:38.101,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which private companies don't want to invest in,

87
0:03:40.259,000 --> 0:03:41,000
do that, but you know what?

88
0:03:41.82,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."

89
0:03:44.6,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.

90
0:03:47.897,000 --> 0:03:48,000
They're often called garage tinkerers,

91
0:03:49.524,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because some of them actually did some things in garages,

92
0:03:51.554,000 --> 0:03:53,000
even though that's partly a myth.

93
0:03:54.129,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And so what I want to do with you in, oh God,

94
0:03:56.423,000 --> 0:03:57,000
only 10 minutes,

95
0:03:57.607,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is to really think again this juxtaposition,

96
0:04:00.597,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because it actually has massive, massive implications

97
0:04:03.456,000 --> 0:04:04,000
beyond innovation policy,

98
0:04:04.95,000 --> 0:04:05,000
which just happens to be the area

99
0:04:06.71,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that I often talk with with policymakers.

100
0:04:09.59,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It has huge implications, even with this whole notion

101
0:04:13.308,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that we have on where, when and why

102
0:04:16.508,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we should actually be cutting back on public spending

103
0:04:19.581,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and different types of public services which,

104
0:04:21.626,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of course, as we know, are increasingly being

105
0:04:23.383,000 --> 0:04:25,000
outsourced because of this juxtaposition.

106
0:04:25.445,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools

107
0:04:28.908,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened

108
0:04:32.77,000 --> 0:04:34,000
by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.

109
0:04:35.521,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So these kind of words are constantly,

110
0:04:37.504,000 --> 0:04:38,000
these juxtapositions come up everywhere,

111
0:04:39.368,000 --> 0:04:41,000
not just with innovation policy.

112
0:04:42.216,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And so to think again,

113
0:04:43.887,000 --> 0:04:45,000
there's no reason that you should believe me,

114
0:04:46.293,000 --> 0:04:47,000
so just think of some of the smartest

115
0:04:47.755,000 --> 0:04:49,000
revolutionary things that you have in your pockets

116
0:04:50.026,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.

117
0:04:52.968,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Ask who actually funded the really cool,

118
0:04:55.614,000 --> 0:04:57,000
revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box

119
0:04:57.746,000 --> 0:04:58,000
things in the iPhone.

120
0:04:59.533,000 --> 0:05:,000
What actually makes your phone

121
0:05:01.276,000 --> 0:05:02,000
a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?

122
0:05:03.195,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So the Internet, which you can surf the web

123
0:05:05.286,000 --> 0:05:06,000
anywhere you are in the world;

124
0:05:06.994,000 --> 0:05:08,000
GPS, where you can actually know where you are

125
0:05:09.578,000 --> 0:05:1,000
anywhere in the world;

126
0:05:10.911,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the touchscreen display, which makes it also

127
0:05:13.044,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.

128
0:05:15.509,000 --> 0:05:18,000
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,

129
0:05:19.226,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and they're all government-funded.

130
0:05:23.627,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And the point is that the Internet

131
0:05:26.216,000 --> 0:05:28,000
was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.

132
0:05:28.46,000 --> 0:05:31,000
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.

133
0:05:32.355,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.

134
0:05:35.113,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The touchscreen display was funded

135
0:05:37.052,000 --> 0:05:41,000
by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF

136
0:05:41.847,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.

137
0:05:46.302,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said

138
0:05:48.52,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,"

139
0:05:50.855,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but what's really interesting is that this is actually true

140
0:05:53.107,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in sector after sector and department after department.

141
0:05:56.115,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally

142
0:05:58.253,000 --> 0:05:59,000
very interested in because I've actually had the fortune

143
0:06:00.182,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to study it in quite some depth,

144
0:06:02.896,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is wonderful to be asking this question

145
0:06:05.073,000 --> 0:06:07,000
about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,

146
0:06:07.82,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because each and every medicine can actually be

147
0:06:09.836,000 --> 0:06:12,000
divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.

148
0:06:13.807,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So the new molecular entities with priority rating

149
0:06:16.58,000 --> 0:06:18,000
are the revolutionary new drugs,

150
0:06:18.855,000 --> 0:06:2,000
whereas the slight variations of existing drugs --

151
0:06:21.756,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Viagra, different color, different dosage --

152
0:06:23.747,000 --> 0:06:25,000
are the less revolutionary ones.

153
0:06:26.04,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And it turns out that a full 75 percent

154
0:06:28.897,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of the new molecular entities with priority rating

155
0:06:31.674,000 --> 0:06:36,000
are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.

156
0:06:36.785,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.

157
0:06:39.468,000 --> 0:06:41,000
They do. They spend on the marketing part.

158
0:06:41.519,000 --> 0:06:43,000
They spend on the D part of R&D.

159
0:06:43.667,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,

160
0:06:46.214,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which is quite problematic.

161
0:06:48.115,000 --> 0:06:5,000
In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently

162
0:06:50.332,000 --> 0:06:52,000
have spent more money in buying back their shares

163
0:06:52.923,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to boost their stock price than on R&D,

164
0:06:54.959,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day

165
0:06:57.287,000 --> 0:07:,000
I'd be fascinated to tell you about.

166
0:07:00.551,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now, what's interesting in all of this

167
0:07:02.554,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is the state, in all these examples,

168
0:07:04.788,000 --> 0:07:08,000
was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.

169
0:07:08.902,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It was actually shaping and creating markets.

170
0:07:11.631,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It was funding not only the basic research,

171
0:07:13.907,000 --> 0:07:15,000
which again is a typical public good,

172
0:07:16.266,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but even the applied research.

173
0:07:17.858,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.

174
0:07:21.534,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So these SBIR and SDTR programs,

175
0:07:24.633,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which give small companies early-stage finance

176
0:07:28.664,000 --> 0:07:3,000
have not only been extremely important

177
0:07:30.879,000 --> 0:07:32,000
compared to private venture capital,

178
0:07:32.976,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but also have become increasingly important.

179
0:07:35.993,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Why? Because, as many of us know,

180
0:07:38.869,000 --> 0:07:39,000
V.C. is actually quite short-term.

181
0:07:40.736,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They want their returns in three to five years.

182
0:07:42.525,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Innovation takes a much longer time than that,

183
0:07:45.054,000 --> 0:07:46,000
15 to 20 years.

184
0:07:46.881,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?

185
0:07:49.268,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Who's actually funding the hard stuff?

186
0:07:51.595,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Of course, it's not just the state.

187
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The private sector does a lot.

188
0:07:54.55,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But the narrative that we've always been told

189
0:07:56.749,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is the state is important for the basics,

190
0:07:59.632,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but not really providing that sort of high-risk,

191
0:08:01.912,000 --> 0:08:03,000
revolutionary thinking out of the box.

192
0:08:04.212,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet

193
0:08:06.544,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to doing the spending, but also the envisioning,

194
0:08:09.449,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the strategic vision, for these investments,

195
0:08:11.74,000 --> 0:08:12,000
it was actually coming within the state.

196
0:08:13.328,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating

197
0:08:15.697,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,

198
0:08:18.795,000 --> 0:08:19,000
came from within government.

199
0:08:20.766,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And so there's huge implications of this.

200
0:08:23.113,000 --> 0:08:25,000
First of all, of course I'm not someone,

201
0:08:25.218,000 --> 0:08:27,000
this old-fashioned person, market versus state.

202
0:08:27.22,000 --> 0:08:29,000
What we all know in dynamic capitalism

203
0:08:29.745,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.

204
0:08:32.804,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But the point is, by constantly depicting

205
0:08:35.543,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the state part as necessary

206
0:08:37.668,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring

207
0:08:40.549,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,

208
0:08:43.598,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I think we've actually really stunted the possibility

209
0:08:46.35,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to build these public-private partnerships

210
0:08:47.922,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in a really dynamic way.

211
0:08:49.468,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part,

212
0:08:52.662,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the public part -- well, they're both P's --

213
0:08:54.89,000 --> 0:08:55,000
with public-private partnerships

214
0:08:56.25,000 --> 0:08:58,000
is in terms of de-risking.

215
0:08:58.305,000 --> 0:09:,000
What the public sector did in all these examples

216
0:09:00.766,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I just gave you, and there's many more,

217
0:09:02.853,000 --> 0:09:05,000
which myself and other colleagues have been looking at,

218
0:09:06.317,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is doing much more than de-risking.

219
0:09:07.867,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.

220
0:09:10.433,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.

221
0:09:13.006,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience

222
0:09:15.717,000 --> 0:09:17,000
with local, regional, national governments,

223
0:09:17.777,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."

224
0:09:20.924,000 --> 0:09:23,000
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.

225
0:09:24.368,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

226
0:09:26.182,000 --> 0:09:28,000
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,

227
0:09:28.348,000 --> 0:09:3,000
boring, it's sometimes

228
0:09:30.675,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that we actually create those organizations in that way.

229
0:09:32.887,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So what we have to actually do is build

230
0:09:35.088,000 --> 0:09:37,000
these entrepreneurial state organizations.

231
0:09:37.264,000 --> 0:09:39,000
DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,

232
0:09:39.753,000 --> 0:09:4,000
actually thought really hard about this,

233
0:09:41.338,000 --> 0:09:43,000
how to welcome failure, because you will fail.

234
0:09:44.031,000 --> 0:09:45,000
You will fail when you innovative.

235
0:09:45.956,000 --> 0:09:48,000
One out of 10 experiments has any success.

236
0:09:49.828,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And the V.C. guys know this,

237
0:09:51.566,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and they're able to actually fund the other losses

238
0:09:53.438,000 --> 0:09:54,000
from that one success.

239
0:09:55.292,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And this brings me, actually, probably,

240
0:09:56.785,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to the biggest implication,

241
0:09:59.38,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and this has huge implications beyond innovation.

242
0:10:02.047,000 --> 0:10:05,000
If the state is more than just a market fixer,

243
0:10:05.707,000 --> 0:10:06,000
if it actually is a market shaper,

244
0:10:07.519,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,

245
0:10:10.487,000 --> 0:10:11,000
what happened to the reward?

246
0:10:12.481,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,

247
0:10:14.855,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,

248
0:10:18.261,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and so some people are foolish enough

249
0:10:19.881,000 --> 0:10:21,000
or probably smart enough if they have time to wait,

250
0:10:22.343,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk

251
0:10:24.825,000 --> 0:10:26,000
which over time will make a greater reward than bonds,

252
0:10:27.345,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that whole risk-reward thing.

253
0:10:28.924,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Well, where's the reward for the state

254
0:10:30.897,000 --> 0:10:32,000
of having taken on these massive risks

255
0:10:33.353,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?

256
0:10:35.812,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The Internet was crazy.

257
0:10:37.764,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.

258
0:10:40.916,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You had to be completely nuts to do it,

259
0:10:43.526,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and luckily, they were.

260
0:10:45.307,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards

261
0:10:47.808,000 --> 0:10:51,000
unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.

262
0:10:51.956,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And the problem is that economists often think,

263
0:10:54.557,000 --> 0:10:56,000
well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.

264
0:10:57.043,000 --> 0:10:58,000
You know, the companies will pay tax,

265
0:10:58.592,000 --> 0:11:,000
the jobs they create will create growth

266
0:11:00.882,000 --> 0:11:03,000
so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise

267
0:11:04.033,000 --> 0:11:07,000
will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.

268
0:11:07.257,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Well, unfortunately, that's not true.

269
0:11:09.247,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.

270
0:11:12.766,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.

271
0:11:15.733,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.

272
0:11:17.94,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I mean, one can take a position on that.

273
0:11:20.029,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But also these companies

274
0:11:21.693,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that have actually had this massive benefit from the state --

275
0:11:24.765,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Apple's a great example.

276
0:11:26.626,000 --> 0:11:28,000
They even got the first -- well, not the first,

277
0:11:28.675,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,

278
0:11:33.243,000 --> 0:11:35,000
through this SBIC program,

279
0:11:35.912,000 --> 0:11:37,000
which predated the SBIR program,

280
0:11:37.96,000 --> 0:11:4,000
as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.

281
0:11:41.278,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And yet we know they legally,

282
0:11:43.768,000 --> 0:11:46,000
as many other companies, pay very little tax back.

283
0:11:47.45,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So what we really need to actually rethink

284
0:11:50.437,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism

285
0:11:54.696,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that's much more direct than tax. Why not?

286
0:11:57.383,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It could happen perhaps through equity.

287
0:11:59.953,000 --> 0:12:,000
This, by the way, in the countries

288
0:12:01.76,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that are actually thinking about this strategically,

289
0:12:04.064,000 --> 0:12:06,000
countries like Finland in Scandinavia,

290
0:12:06.195,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but also in China and Brazil,

291
0:12:08.23,000 --> 0:12:1,000
they're retaining equity in these investments.

292
0:12:10.56,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,

293
0:12:14.386,000 --> 0:12:16,000
it's a public funding agency in Finland,

294
0:12:17.046,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which then funded the next round of Nokias.

295
0:12:19.872,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The Brazilian Development Bank,

296
0:12:21.881,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which is providing huge amounts of funds today

297
0:12:24.676,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to clean technology, they just announced

298
0:12:26.473,000 --> 0:12:3,000
a $56 billion program for the future on this,

299
0:12:30.722,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is retaining equity in these investments.

300
0:12:34.261,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So to put it provocatively,

301
0:12:35.773,000 --> 0:12:37,000
had the U.S. government thought about this,

302
0:12:38.712,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and maybe just brought back

303
0:12:40.556,000 --> 0:12:42,000
just something called an innovation fund,

304
0:12:42.981,000 --> 0:12:45,000
you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent

305
0:12:46.113,000 --> 0:12:47,000
of the profits from what the Internet produced

306
0:12:47.996,000 --> 0:12:48,000
had come back to that innovation fund,

307
0:12:49.654,000 --> 0:12:5,000
there would be so much more money

308
0:12:51.278,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to spend today on green technology.

309
0:12:53.506,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Instead, many of the state budgets

310
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
which in theory are trying to do that

311
0:12:57.598,000 --> 0:12:58,000
are being constrained.

312
0:12:59.434,000 --> 0:13:,000
But perhaps even more important,

313
0:13:01.244,000 --> 0:13:02,000
we heard before about the one percent,

314
0:13:03.111,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the 99 percent.

315
0:13:04.686,000 --> 0:13:07,000
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way,

316
0:13:08.431,000 --> 0:13:11,000
as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,

317
0:13:11.464,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because that's what we're talking about, right?

318
0:13:13.285,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Who are the different players in creating value

319
0:13:15.219,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in the economy, and is the state's role,

320
0:13:17.514,000 --> 0:13:2,000
has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?

321
0:13:21.243,000 --> 0:13:23,000
If we can actually have a broader theory

322
0:13:23.598,000 --> 0:13:25,000
of value creation and allow us to actually admit

323
0:13:25.651,000 --> 0:13:28,000
what the state has been doing and reap something back,

324
0:13:28.702,000 --> 0:13:3,000
it might just be that in the next round,

325
0:13:31.521,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution

326
0:13:34.087,000 --> 0:13:35,000
will in fact be green,

327
0:13:35.728,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that that period of growth

328
0:13:37.451,000 --> 0:13:39,000
will not only be smart, innovation-led,

329
0:13:40.141,000 --> 0:13:43,000
not only green, but also more inclusive,

330
0:13:43.327,000 --> 0:13:46,000
so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley

331
0:13:46.581,000 --> 0:13:48,000
can actually also benefit from that growth,

332
0:13:49.321,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because they have not.

333
0:13:50.92,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Thank you.

334
0:13:52.173,000 --> 0:13:57,000

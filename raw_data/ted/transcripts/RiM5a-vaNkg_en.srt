1
0:00:12.873,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As a student of adversity,

2
0:00:16.309,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges

3
0:00:21.641,000 --> 0:00:23,000
seem to draw strength from them.

4
0:00:24.649,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning.

5
0:00:28.94,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And for a long time,

6
0:00:30.425,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I thought the meaning was out there,

7
0:00:32.824,000 --> 0:00:34,000
some great truth waiting to be found.

8
0:00:35.985,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But over time,

9
0:00:37.64,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant.

10
0:00:40.593,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We call it "finding meaning,"

11
0:00:42.8,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but we might better call it "forging meaning."

12
0:00:46.983,000 --> 0:00:48,000
My last book was about how families manage to deal

13
0:00:49.952,000 --> 0:00:52,000
with various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring.

14
0:00:54.303,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And one of the mothers I interviewed,

15
0:00:56.494,000 --> 0:00:58,000
who had two children with multiple severe disabilities,

16
0:00:59.481,000 --> 0:01:03,000
said to me, "People always give us these little sayings like,

17
0:01:04.202,000 --> 0:01:06,000
'God doesn't give you any more than you can handle.'

18
0:01:07.789,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But children like ours are not preordained as a gift.

19
0:01:13.145,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They're a gift

20
0:01:14.32,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because that's what we have chosen."

21
0:01:18.68,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We make those choices all our lives.

22
0:01:23.351,000 --> 0:01:25,000
When I was in second grade,

23
0:01:25.419,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Bobby Finkel had a birthday party

24
0:01:28.3,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and invited everyone in our class but me.

25
0:01:32.637,000 --> 0:01:34,000
My mother assumed there had been some sort of error,

26
0:01:35.155,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and she called Mrs. Finkel,

27
0:01:36.817,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who said that Bobby didn't like me and didn't want me at his party.

28
0:01:42.022,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And that day, my mom took me to the zoo

29
0:01:45.243,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and out for a hot fudge sundae.

30
0:01:48.047,000 --> 0:01:49,000
When I was in seventh grade,

31
0:01:49.975,000 --> 0:01:53,000
one of the kids on my school bus nicknamed me "Percy,"

32
0:01:54.317,000 --> 0:01:56,000
as a shorthand for my demeanor.

33
0:01:57.011,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And sometimes, he and his cohort would chant that provocation

34
0:02:02.083,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the entire school bus ride,

35
0:02:04.137,000 --> 0:02:07,000
45 minutes up, 45 minutes back:

36
0:02:07.774,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"Percy! Percy! Percy! Percy!"

37
0:02:12.572,000 --> 0:02:16,000
When I was in eighth grade, our science teacher told us

38
0:02:16.777,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence

39
0:02:20.825,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because of the trauma to their anal sphincter.

40
0:02:25.294,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria,

41
0:02:29.941,000 --> 0:02:32,000
where I would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so,

42
0:02:33.863,000 --> 0:02:34,000
or sat with the boys,

43
0:02:35.625,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls.

44
0:02:40.026,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance.

45
0:02:45.801,000 --> 0:02:46,000
What I didn't know then

46
0:02:47.579,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and do know now,

47
0:02:49.079,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning.

48
0:02:56.366,000 --> 0:02:58,000
After you've forged meaning,

49
0:02:58.533,000 --> 0:03:01,000
you need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity.

50
0:03:02.921,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You need to take the traumas

51
0:03:04.801,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and make them part of who you've come to be,

52
0:03:08.1,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and you need to fold the worst events of your life

53
0:03:11.112,000 --> 0:03:13,000
into a narrative of triumph,

54
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:17,000
evincing a better self in response to things that hurt.

55
0:03:18.493,000 --> 0:03:22,000
One of the other mothers I interviewed when I was working on my book

56
0:03:22.819,000 --> 0:03:24,000
had been raped as an adolescent,

57
0:03:25.168,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and had a child following that rape,

58
0:03:28.183,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which had thrown away her career plans

59
0:03:31.087,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and damaged all of her emotional relationships.

60
0:03:35.073,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But when I met her, she was 50,

61
0:03:38.06,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I said to her,

62
0:03:39.462,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Do you often think about the man who raped you?"

63
0:03:42.232,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And she said, "I used to think about him with anger,

64
0:03:46.908,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but now only with pity."

65
0:03:49.387,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I thought she meant pity because he was so unevolved

66
0:03:52.044,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as to have done this terrible thing.

67
0:03:54.576,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I said, "Pity?"

68
0:03:56.343,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And she said, "Yes,

69
0:03:58.033,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because he has a beautiful daughter and two beautiful grandchildren,

70
0:04:03.092,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and he doesn't know that,

71
0:04:05.063,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and I do.

72
0:04:06.82,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So as it turns out,

73
0:04:08.669,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I'm the lucky one."

74
0:04:12.331,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Some of our struggles are things we're born to:

75
0:04:15.888,000 --> 0:04:19,000
our gender, our sexuality, our race, our disability.

76
0:04:21.507,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And some are things that happen to us:

77
0:04:23.785,000 --> 0:04:26,000
being a political prisoner, being a rape victim,

78
0:04:27.383,000 --> 0:04:28,000
being a Katrina survivor.

79
0:04:29.9,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Identity involves entering a community

80
0:04:32.813,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to draw strength from that community,

81
0:04:35.37,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and to give strength there, too.

82
0:04:37.981,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It involves substituting "and" for "but" --

83
0:04:42.207,000 --> 0:04:45,000
not "I am here but I have cancer,"

84
0:04:46.275,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but rather, "I have cancer and I am here."

85
0:04:51.952,000 --> 0:04:54,000
When we're ashamed, we can't tell our stories,

86
0:04:55.476,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and stories are the foundation

87
0:04:58.102,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of identity.

88
0:05:00.539,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Forge meaning,

89
0:05:02.211,000 --> 0:05:03,000
build identity.

90
0:05:04.485,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Forge meaning and build identity.

91
0:05:08.058,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That became my mantra.

92
0:05:10.213,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Forging meaning is about changing yourself.

93
0:05:13.801,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Building identity is about changing the world.

94
0:05:17.619,000 --> 0:05:21,000
All of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily:

95
0:05:22.096,000 --> 0:05:26,000
How much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves,

96
0:05:26.659,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and how much to break the limits

97
0:05:29.099,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of what constitutes a valid life?

98
0:05:32.41,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Forging meaning and building identity

99
0:05:35.514,000 --> 0:05:37,000
does not make what was wrong right.

100
0:05:38.499,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It only makes what was wrong precious.

101
0:05:43.094,000 --> 0:05:45,000
In January of this year,

102
0:05:45.221,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners,

103
0:05:49.384,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and I was surprised to find them less bitter than I'd anticipated.

104
0:05:53.863,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Most of them had knowingly committed the offenses

105
0:05:56.427,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that landed them in prison,

106
0:05:58.268,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and they had walked in with their heads held high,

107
0:06:01.747,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and they walked out with their heads still held high,

108
0:06:05.812,000 --> 0:06:06,000
many years later.

109
0:06:07.897,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Dr. Ma Thida, a leading human rights activist

110
0:06:11.333,000 --> 0:06:12,000
who had nearly died in prison

111
0:06:12.761,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and had spent many years in solitary confinement,

112
0:06:15.815,000 --> 0:06:2,000
told me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think,

113
0:06:21.795,000 --> 0:06:23,000
for the wisdom she had gained,

114
0:06:23.921,000 --> 0:06:26,000
for the chance to hone her meditation skills.

115
0:06:27.861,000 --> 0:06:28,000
She had sought meaning

116
0:06:29.429,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and made her travail into a crucial identity.

117
0:06:33.458,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But if the people I met were less bitter than I'd anticipated

118
0:06:37.323,000 --> 0:06:38,000
about being in prison,

119
0:06:38.884,000 --> 0:06:4,000
they were also less thrilled than I'd expected

120
0:06:41.749,000 --> 0:06:44,000
about the reform process going on in their country.

121
0:06:45.343,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Ma Thida said,

122
0:06:46.956,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"We Burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure,

123
0:06:51.936,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but we also have grievance under glamour."

124
0:06:56.587,000 --> 0:06:59,000
She said, "And the fact that there have been these shifts and changes

125
0:07:00.328,000 --> 0:07:03,000
doesn't erase the continuing problems in our society

126
0:07:04.189,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that we learned to see so well while we were in prison."

127
0:07:08.385,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I understood her to be saying

128
0:07:10.545,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that concessions confer only a little humanity

129
0:07:14.096,000 --> 0:07:15,000
where full humanity is due;

130
0:07:16.355,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that crumbs are not the same as a place at the table.

131
0:07:20.598,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Which is to say,

132
0:07:21.942,000 --> 0:07:24,000
you can forge meaning and build identity

133
0:07:25.096,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and still be mad as hell.

134
0:07:29.539,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I've never been raped,

135
0:07:31.204,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and I've never been in anything remotely approaching a Burmese prison.

136
0:07:36.214,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But as a gay American,

137
0:07:38.071,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I've experienced prejudice and even hatred,

138
0:07:42.284,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and I've forged meaning

139
0:07:44.422,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and I've built identity,

140
0:07:46.648,000 --> 0:07:48,000
which is a move I learned from people

141
0:07:48.996,000 --> 0:07:51,000
who had experienced far worse privation than I've ever known.

142
0:07:54.082,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In my own adolescence,

143
0:07:55.931,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I went to extreme lengths to try to be straight.

144
0:07:59.241,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I enrolled myself in something called "sexual surrogacy therapy,"

145
0:08:03.482,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in which people I was encouraged to call doctors

146
0:08:07.168,000 --> 0:08:1,000
prescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises

147
0:08:11.12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
with women I was encouraged to call surrogates,

148
0:08:14.685,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who were not exactly prostitutes

149
0:08:17.25,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but who were also not exactly anything else.

150
0:08:20.175,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

151
0:08:24.443,000 --> 0:08:28,000
My particular favorite was a blonde woman from the Deep South

152
0:08:28.68,000 --> 0:08:32,000
who eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac,

153
0:08:32.731,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and had taken this job after she got in trouble

154
0:08:35.534,000 --> 0:08:36,000
down at the morgue.

155
0:08:37.007,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

156
0:08:43.704,000 --> 0:08:45,000
These experiences eventually allowed me to have

157
0:08:46.707,000 --> 0:08:48,000
some happy physical relationships with women,

158
0:08:49.548,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for which I'm grateful.

159
0:08:51.175,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But I was at war with myself,

160
0:08:53.665,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche.

161
0:08:58.544,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We don't seek the painful experiences

162
0:09:01.763,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that hew our identities,

163
0:09:04.066,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but we seek our identities

164
0:09:06.17,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in the wake of painful experiences.

165
0:09:09.643,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We cannot bear a pointless torment,

166
0:09:12.529,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but we can endure great pain

167
0:09:15.029,000 --> 0:09:17,000
if we believe that it's purposeful.

168
0:09:17.972,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Ease makes less of an impression on us

169
0:09:20.46,000 --> 0:09:21,000
than struggle.

170
0:09:21.856,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We could have been ourselves without our delights,

171
0:09:24.688,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning.

172
0:09:29.728,000 --> 0:09:32,000
"Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities,"

173
0:09:33.191,000 --> 0:09:35,000
St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians,

174
0:09:35.856,000 --> 0:09:38,000
"for when I am weak, then I am strong."

175
0:09:40.09,000 --> 0:09:44,000
In 1988, I went to Moscow to interview artists

176
0:09:44.379,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of the Soviet underground.

177
0:09:46.047,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I expected their work to be dissident and political.

178
0:09:50.373,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But the radicalism in their work

179
0:09:52.498,000 --> 0:09:55,000
actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society

180
0:09:56.358,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that was annihilating humanity itself,

181
0:09:58.972,000 --> 0:10:01,000
as, in some senses, Russian society is now doing again.

182
0:10:03.234,000 --> 0:10:05,000
One of the artists I met said to me,

183
0:10:05.822,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"We were in training to be not artists but angels."

184
0:10:10.129,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In 1991, I went back to see the artists I'd been writing about,

185
0:10:14.764,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and I was with them during the putsch that ended the Soviet Union.

186
0:10:19.09,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch.

187
0:10:23.98,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And on the third day of the putsch,

188
0:10:27.4,000 --> 0:10:29,000
one of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya.

189
0:10:30.613,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And we went there,

190
0:10:32.045,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and we arranged ourselves in front of one of the barricades,

191
0:10:35.265,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and a little while later,

192
0:10:36.736,000 --> 0:10:37,000
a column of tanks rolled up.

193
0:10:38.895,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And the soldier on the front tank said,

194
0:10:41.21,000 --> 0:10:44,000
"We have unconditional orders to destroy this barricade.

195
0:10:45.381,000 --> 0:10:47,000
If you get out of the way, we don't need to hurt you.

196
0:10:48.039,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But if you won't move, we'll have no choice but to run you down."

197
0:10:51.831,000 --> 0:10:54,000
The artist I was with said, "Give us just a minute.

198
0:10:55.326,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Give us just a minute to tell you why we're here."

199
0:10:59.381,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And the soldier folded his arms,

200
0:11:01.495,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and the artist launched into a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy

201
0:11:06.094,000 --> 0:11:09,000
such as those of us who live in a Jeffersonian democracy

202
0:11:09.873,000 --> 0:11:11,000
would be hard-pressed to present.

203
0:11:12.905,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And they went on and on,

204
0:11:14.844,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and the soldier watched.

205
0:11:16.808,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished

206
0:11:20.096,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and looked at us, so bedraggled in the rain,

207
0:11:22.718,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and said, "What you have said is true,

208
0:11:26.844,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and we must bow to the will of the people.

209
0:11:30.238,000 --> 0:11:32,000
If you'll clear enough space for us to turn around,

210
0:11:32.871,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we'll go back the way we came."

211
0:11:35.272,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And that's what they did.

212
0:11:37.102,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Sometimes, forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need

213
0:11:42.1,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to fight for your ultimate freedom.

214
0:11:45.254,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion

215
0:11:48.114,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that oppression breeds the power to oppose it.

216
0:11:50.995,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And I gradually understood that as the cornerstone of identity.

217
0:11:56.496,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It took identity to rescue me from sadness.

218
0:12:00.576,000 --> 0:12:02,000
The gay rights movement posits a world

219
0:12:02.875,000 --> 0:12:04,000
in which my aberrances are a victory.

220
0:12:05.915,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Identity politics always works on two fronts:

221
0:12:09.354,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic,

222
0:12:13.957,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and to cause the outside world to treat such people

223
0:12:16.816,000 --> 0:12:17,000
more gently and more kindly.

224
0:12:19.201,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Those are two totally separate enterprises,

225
0:12:22.482,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but progress in each sphere reverberates in the other.

226
0:12:26.613,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Identity politics can be narcissistic.

227
0:12:30.29,000 --> 0:12:33,000
People extol a difference only because it's theirs.

228
0:12:33.849,000 --> 0:12:36,000
People narrow the world and function in discrete groups

229
0:12:37.168,000 --> 0:12:38,000
without empathy for one another.

230
0:12:39.546,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But properly understood and wisely practiced,

231
0:12:43.517,000 --> 0:12:47,000
identity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human.

232
0:12:48.223,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Identity itself should be not a smug label or a gold medal,

233
0:12:54.617,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but a revolution.

234
0:12:56.848,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I would have had an easier life if I were straight,

235
0:13:00.47,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but I would not be me.

236
0:13:02.182,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And I now like being myself better

237
0:13:04.883,000 --> 0:13:06,000
than the idea of being someone else,

238
0:13:07.017,000 --> 0:13:08,000
someone who, to be honest,

239
0:13:08.666,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine.

240
0:13:13.257,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But if you banish the dragons, you banish the heroes,

241
0:13:17.879,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and we become attached to the heroic strain in our own lives.

242
0:13:22.428,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I've sometimes wondered

243
0:13:23.829,000 --> 0:13:25,000
whether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself

244
0:13:26.612,000 --> 0:13:28,000
without gay pride's technicolor fiesta,

245
0:13:29.469,000 --> 0:13:31,000
of which this speech is one manifestation.

246
0:13:32.139,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Laughter)

247
0:13:33.756,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I used to think I would know myself to be mature

248
0:13:36.713,000 --> 0:13:38,000
when I could simply be gay without emphasis.

249
0:13:39.834,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But the self-loathing of that period left a void,

250
0:13:43.66,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and celebration needs to fill and overflow it,

251
0:13:46.938,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and even if I repay my private debt of melancholy,

252
0:13:50.798,000 --> 0:13:52,000
there's still an outer world of homophobia

253
0:13:53.713,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that it will take decades to address.

254
0:13:56.53,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Someday, being gay will be a simple fact,

255
0:13:59.822,000 --> 0:14:01,000
free of party hats and blame.

256
0:14:02.678,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But not yet.

257
0:14:04.602,000 --> 0:14:08,000
A friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself,

258
0:14:08.799,000 --> 0:14:11,000
once suggested that we organize Gay Humility Week.

259
0:14:12.077,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

260
0:14:13.489,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Applause)

261
0:14:18.752,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It's a great idea.

262
0:14:19.967,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Laughter)

263
0:14:21.355,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But its time has not yet come.

264
0:14:23.206,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Laughter)

265
0:14:25.551,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And neutrality, which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration,

266
0:14:30.593,000 --> 0:14:31,000
is actually the endgame.

267
0:14:33.388,000 --> 0:14:35,000
In 29 states in the US,

268
0:14:36.211,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I could legally be fired or denied housing

269
0:14:39.38,000 --> 0:14:4,000
for being gay.

270
0:14:41.352,000 --> 0:14:43,000
In Russia, the anti-propaganda law

271
0:14:44.119,000 --> 0:14:46,000
has led to people being beaten in the streets.

272
0:14:47.316,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Twenty-seven African countries have passed laws against sodomy.

273
0:14:52.191,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And in Nigeria, gay people can legally be stoned to death,

274
0:14:55.951,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and lynchings have become common.

275
0:14:58.578,000 --> 0:15:,000
In Saudi Arabia recently,

276
0:15:00.676,000 --> 0:15:02,000
two men who had been caught in carnal acts

277
0:15:03.573,000 --> 0:15:07,000
were sentenced to 7,000 lashes each,

278
0:15:08.113,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and are now permanently disabled as a result.

279
0:15:11.337,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So who can forge meaning

280
0:15:13.584,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and build identity?

281
0:15:16.118,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights,

282
0:15:19.617,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and for the millions who live in unaccepting places

283
0:15:22.712,000 --> 0:15:23,000
with no resources,

284
0:15:24.581,000 --> 0:15:25,000
dignity remains elusive.

285
0:15:27.106,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I am lucky to have forged meaning

286
0:15:30.261,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and built identity,

287
0:15:32.438,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but that's still a rare privilege.

288
0:15:34.821,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And gay people deserve more, collectively,

289
0:15:37.548,000 --> 0:15:39,000
than the crumbs of justice.

290
0:15:40.714,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And yet,

291
0:15:42.141,000 --> 0:15:44,000
every step forward is so sweet.

292
0:15:45.815,000 --> 0:15:48,000
In 2007, six years after we met,

293
0:15:49.708,000 --> 0:15:51,000
my partner and I decided to get married.

294
0:15:53.311,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Meeting John had been the discovery of great happiness

295
0:15:57.339,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and also the elimination of great unhappiness.

296
0:16:00.707,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And sometimes, I was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain,

297
0:16:05.796,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that I forgot about the joy,

298
0:16:08.148,000 --> 0:16:1,000
which was at first the less remarkable part of it to me.

299
0:16:11.764,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Marrying was a way to declare our love

300
0:16:14.395,000 --> 0:16:16,000
as more a presence than an absence.

301
0:16:18.451,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Marriage soon led us to children,

302
0:16:20.839,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and that meant new meanings

303
0:16:22.775,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and new identities -- ours and theirs.

304
0:16:26.849,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I want my children to be happy,

305
0:16:29.689,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and I love them most achingly when they are sad.

306
0:16:33.39,000 --> 0:16:37,000
As a gay father, I can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives,

307
0:16:38.827,000 --> 0:16:42,000
but I believe that if I succeed in sheltering them from adversity,

308
0:16:42.94,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I will have failed as a parent.

309
0:16:45.83,000 --> 0:16:47,000
A Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me

310
0:16:48.813,000 --> 0:16:5,000
that Westerners mistakenly think

311
0:16:51.007,000 --> 0:16:55,000
that nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you,

312
0:16:55.909,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and you have only bliss to look forward to.

313
0:16:59.021,000 --> 0:17:01,000
But he said that would not be nirvana,

314
0:17:01.187,000 --> 0:17:03,000
because your bliss in the present

315
0:17:03.212,000 --> 0:17:05,000
would always be shadowed by the joy from the past.

316
0:17:06.6,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Nirvana, he said, is what you arrive at

317
0:17:09.431,000 --> 0:17:11,000
when you have only bliss to look forward to

318
0:17:12.051,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy.

319
0:17:17.426,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And I sometimes wonder

320
0:17:19.202,000 --> 0:17:22,000
whether I could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children

321
0:17:22.923,000 --> 0:17:23,000
if they'd come more readily,

322
0:17:25.115,000 --> 0:17:28,000
if I'd been straight in my youth or were young now,

323
0:17:29.07,000 --> 0:17:31,000
in either of which cases this might be easier.

324
0:17:32.585,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Perhaps I could.

325
0:17:34.071,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Perhaps all the complex imagining I've done

326
0:17:36.302,000 --> 0:17:38,000
could have been applied to other topics.

327
0:17:38.601,000 --> 0:17:41,000
But if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning,

328
0:17:42.278,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the question is not whether I'd be happier for having been bullied,

329
0:17:46.875,000 --> 0:17:49,000
but whether assigning meaning to those experiences

330
0:17:50.284,000 --> 0:17:51,000
has made me a better father.

331
0:17:52.878,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys,

332
0:17:56.738,000 --> 0:17:59,000
because I did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me.

333
0:18:01.265,000 --> 0:18:05,000
I know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families,

334
0:18:05.348,000 --> 0:18:07,000
but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh,

335
0:18:08.316,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and gay families so exhilaratingly new,

336
0:18:11.657,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and I found meaning in that surprise.

337
0:18:15.772,000 --> 0:18:18,000
In October, it was my 50th birthday,

338
0:18:19.286,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and my family organized a party for me.

339
0:18:22.42,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And in the middle of it, my son said to my husband

340
0:18:25.229,000 --> 0:18:26,000
that he wanted to make a speech.

341
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And John said,

342
0:18:28.182,000 --> 0:18:32,000
"George, you can't make a speech. You're four."

343
0:18:32.265,000 --> 0:18:33,000
(Laughter)

344
0:18:33.97,000 --> 0:18:37,000
"Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I are going to make speeches tonight."

345
0:18:38.515,000 --> 0:18:4,000
But George insisted and insisted,

346
0:18:41.134,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and finally, John took him up to the microphone,

347
0:18:44.606,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and George said very loudly,

348
0:18:47.479,000 --> 0:18:49,000
"Ladies and gentlemen!

349
0:18:49.923,000 --> 0:18:51,000
May I have your attention, please?"

350
0:18:52.419,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And everyone turned around, startled.

351
0:18:55.135,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And George said,

352
0:18:57.327,000 --> 0:18:58,000
"I'm glad it's daddy's birthday.

353
0:18:59.976,000 --> 0:19:,000
I'm glad we all get cake.

354
0:19:03.284,000 --> 0:19:05,000
And Daddy, if you were little,

355
0:19:06.312,000 --> 0:19:07,000
I'd be your friend."

356
0:19:07.934,000 --> 0:19:08,000
(Gasp)

357
0:19:09.958,000 --> 0:19:1,000
And I thought -- (Applause)

358
0:19:11.988,000 --> 0:19:12,000
Thank you.

359
0:19:13.163,000 --> 0:19:16,000
I thought that I was indebted even to Bobby Finkel,

360
0:19:16.875,000 --> 0:19:18,000
because all those earlier experiences

361
0:19:19.541,000 --> 0:19:21,000
were what had propelled me to this moment,

362
0:19:21.98,000 --> 0:19:23,000
and I was finally unconditionally grateful

363
0:19:24.513,000 --> 0:19:27,000
for a life I'd once have done anything to change.

364
0:19:28.719,000 --> 0:19:32,000
The gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man

365
0:19:32.98,000 --> 0:19:34,000
what he could do to help the movement,

366
0:19:35.084,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and Harvey Milk said,

367
0:19:36.702,000 --> 0:19:37,000
"Go out and tell someone."

368
0:19:39.138,000 --> 0:19:42,000
There's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity.

369
0:19:43.011,000 --> 0:19:45,000
And there are always stories that restore it.

370
0:19:45.816,000 --> 0:19:46,000
If we live out loud,

371
0:19:47.395,000 --> 0:19:48,000
we can trounce the hatred,

372
0:19:49.416,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and expand everyone's lives.

373
0:19:52.569,000 --> 0:19:53,000
Forge meaning.

374
0:19:54.222,000 --> 0:19:55,000
Build identity.

375
0:19:56.169,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Forge meaning.

376
0:19:58.393,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Build identity.

377
0:20:01.228,000 --> 0:20:03,000
And then invite the world to share your joy.

378
0:20:04.675,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Thank you.

379
0:20:05.898,000 --> 0:20:08,000
(Applause)

380
0:20:08.94,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Thank you.

381
0:20:10.182,000 --> 0:20:12,000
(Applause)

382
0:20:12.224,000 --> 0:20:13,000
Thank you.

383
0:20:13.427,000 --> 0:20:15,000
(Applause)

384
0:20:16.149,000 --> 0:20:17,000
Thank you.

385
0:20:17.326,000 --> 0:20:22,000
(Applause)

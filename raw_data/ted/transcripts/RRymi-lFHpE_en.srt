1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today

2
0:00:28.215,000 --> 0:00:31,000
are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance

3
0:00:31.96,000 --> 0:00:34,000
with all the things that have been talked about the last two days.

4
0:00:35.48,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So many different points of resonance

5
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that it's going to be difficult to bring them all up,

6
0:00:39.781,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but I'll try to do my best.

7
0:00:41.12,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Does anybody remember these?

8
0:00:42.52,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:44.32,000 --> 0:00:49,000
OK, so these are LP records and they've been replaced, right?

10
0:00:50.32,000 --> 0:00:52,000
They've been swept away over the last two decades

11
0:00:53.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right?

12
0:00:57.92,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I think it was best witnessed

13
0:01:00.56,000 --> 0:01:03,000
when Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today.

14
0:01:04.4,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What's happened in the music world is there's a culture,

15
0:01:07.08,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or an ecosystem that's been created

16
0:01:08.88,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that, if you take some words from Apple,

17
0:01:11.48,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the catchphrase -- that we create, rip, mix and burn.

18
0:01:15.48,000 --> 0:01:18,000
What I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed

19
0:01:18.68,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to create new music and musical ideas.

20
0:01:21.04,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas,

21
0:01:24.76,000 --> 0:01:25,000
use them in innovative ways.

22
0:01:26.52,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Anyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways,

23
0:01:29.519,000 --> 0:01:31,000
draw connections between musical ideas,

24
0:01:31.72,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle.

25
0:01:35.72,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And what that's done is it's created, like I said,

26
0:01:38.08,000 --> 0:01:4,000
a vibrant community that's very inclusive,

27
0:01:40.104,000 --> 0:01:43,000
with people continually working to connect musical ideas,

28
0:01:43.84,000 --> 0:01:46,000
innovate them and keep things constantly up to date.

29
0:01:47.28,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Today's hit single is not last year's hit single.

30
0:01:51.08,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But I'm not here to talk about music today.

31
0:01:53.28,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I'm here to talk about books.

32
0:01:54.76,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials

33
0:01:58.2,000 --> 0:02:,000
that we use every day in school.

34
0:02:00.64,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Has anyone here ever been to school?

35
0:02:02.379,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:03.8,000 --> 0:02:06,000
OK, does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools,

37
0:02:07.8,000 --> 0:02:08,000
around the world?

38
0:02:09.6,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I'm not going to spend too much time on that,

39
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects

40
0:02:15.52,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that appear when an author publishes a book.

41
0:02:18.04,000 --> 0:02:19,000
That in fact, the publishing process --

42
0:02:19.922,000 --> 0:02:21,000
just because of the fact that it's complicated,

43
0:02:22.137,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it's heavy, books are expensive --

44
0:02:23.84,000 --> 0:02:26,000
creates a sort of a wall between authors of books

45
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the ultimate users of books,

46
0:02:28.72,000 --> 0:02:32,000
be they teachers, students or just general readers.

47
0:02:32.84,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language

48
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
other than one of the world's major languages, and especially English.

49
0:02:39.96,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm going to call these people below the barrier "shutouts"

50
0:02:42.8,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because they're really shut out of the process

51
0:02:44.967,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of being able to share their knowledge with the world.

52
0:02:47.519,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas

53
0:02:50.735,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that we've seen in the musical culture

54
0:02:52.582,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and try to bring these towards reinventing the way

55
0:02:54.947,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we think about writing books, using them and teaching from them.

56
0:02:58.8,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So, that's what I'd like to talk about

57
0:03:00.64,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and, really, how we get from where we are now

58
0:03:02.903,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to where we need to go.

59
0:03:04.2,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment.

60
0:03:07.32,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Imagine taking all the world's books.

61
0:03:09.106,000 --> 0:03:12,000
OK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages.

62
0:03:12.64,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So, liberating these pages

63
0:03:14.76,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and imagine digitizing them and then storing them

64
0:03:18.04,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in a vast, interconnected, global repository.

65
0:03:20.96,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book-type content.

66
0:03:26.6,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And then take that material and imagine making it all open,

67
0:03:29.88,000 --> 0:03:32,000
so that people can modify it, play with it, improve it.

68
0:03:32.96,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Imagine making it free,

69
0:03:34.24,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge,

70
0:03:37.503,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and imagine using information technology

71
0:03:39.88,000 --> 0:03:42,000
so that you can update this content, improve it, play with it,

72
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:47,000
on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years.

73
0:03:47.92,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Instead of editions of a book coming out every two years,

74
0:03:50.8,000 --> 0:03:52,000
imagine them coming out every 25 seconds.

75
0:03:53.76,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So, imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this.

76
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors,

77
0:04:01.44,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but all the people who could be or want to be authors

78
0:04:05.04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in all the different languages of the world,

79
0:04:07.12,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I think if you could do this, it would be called --

80
0:04:09.72,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem.

81
0:04:12.32,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So, really, this is the dream,

82
0:04:14.44,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and in a sense what you can think of it

83
0:04:16.322,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is we're trying to enable anyone in the world,

84
0:04:18.489,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I mean anyone in the world --

85
0:04:20.04,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:21.28,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to be their own educational DJ,

87
0:04:23.4,000 --> 0:04:25,000
creating educational materials, sharing them with the world,

88
0:04:26.24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
constantly innovating on them.

89
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So, this is the dream.

90
0:04:29.24,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In fact, this dream is actually being realized.

91
0:04:32.08,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Over the last six-and-a-half years,

92
0:04:33.92,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we've been working really hard at Rice University

93
0:04:36.6,000 --> 0:04:37,000
on a project called Connexions,

94
0:04:38.2,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk

95
0:04:40.64,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is just tell you a little bit

96
0:04:42.045,000 --> 0:04:44,000
about what people are doing with Connexions,

97
0:04:44.12,000 --> 0:04:46,000
which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint

98
0:04:46.48,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,

99
0:04:48.409,000 --> 0:04:51,000
where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world.

100
0:04:51.862,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We're working on the open-source tools

101
0:04:54.36,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and the content.

102
0:04:55.92,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So, that's sort of to put it in perspective here.

103
0:04:58.76,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So, create.

104
0:05:00.36,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What are some of the people that are using these kind of tools?

105
0:05:03.36,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Well, the first thing is,

106
0:05:04.6,000 --> 0:05:06,000
there's a community of engineering professors,

107
0:05:07.48,000 --> 0:05:09,000
from Cambridge to Kyoto,

108
0:05:09.6,000 --> 0:05:12,000
who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering

109
0:05:13.56,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to develop what you can think of as a massive, super textbook

110
0:05:17.56,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that covers the entire area of electrical engineering.

111
0:05:20.52,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And not only that --

112
0:05:21.76,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions.

113
0:05:27.12,000 --> 0:05:3,000
If people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out --

114
0:05:30.6,000 --> 0:05:34,000
a private music teacher and mom from Champagne, Illinois,

115
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world,

116
0:05:38.4,000 --> 0:05:4,000
on how to teach kids how to play music --

117
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Her material is now used over 600,000 times per month.

118
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Tremendous use.

119
0:05:47.68,000 --> 0:05:51,000
In fact, a lot of this use coming from United States K-12 schools,

120
0:05:51.96,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because anyone who's involved in a school scale back,

121
0:05:56.4,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum.

122
0:05:59.08,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst

123
0:06:01.6,000 --> 0:06:03,000
for this kind of open, free content.

124
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:05,000
A lot of teachers are using this stuff.

125
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What about ripping? What about copying, reusing?

126
0:06:09.24,000 --> 0:06:12,000
A team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso --

127
0:06:12.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas.

128
0:06:17.56,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And within about a week,

129
0:06:19.2,000 --> 0:06:21,000
having this be some of our most popular material

130
0:06:21.56,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in widespread use all over Latin America, and in particular in Mexico,

131
0:06:25.96,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because of the open, extensible nature of this.

132
0:06:28.8,000 --> 0:06:3,000
People, volunteers and even companies

133
0:06:31.64,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that are translating materials into Asian languages

134
0:06:34.28,000 --> 0:06:36,000
like Chinese, Japanese and Thai,

135
0:06:36.48,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to spread the knowledge even further.

136
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:41,000
OK, what about people who are mixing?

137
0:06:42.56,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What does "mixing" mean?

138
0:06:43.76,000 --> 0:06:45,000
"Mixing" means building customized courses,

139
0:06:45.8,000 --> 0:06:48,000
means building customized books.

140
0:06:49.32,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Companies like National Instruments,

141
0:06:51.08,000 --> 0:06:56,000
who are embedding very powerful, interactive simulations

142
0:06:56.2,000 --> 0:06:57,000
into the materials,

143
0:06:57.4,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook

144
0:07:00.36,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to an experience

145
0:07:01.6,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with

146
0:07:05.56,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and play around with and actually learn as you do.

147
0:07:09.52,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We've been working with Teachers Without Borders,

148
0:07:11.88,000 --> 0:07:13,000
who are very interested in mixing our materials.

149
0:07:14.143,000 --> 0:07:16,000
They're going to be using Connexions as their platform

150
0:07:16.84,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach

151
0:07:22.08,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in 84 countries around the world.

152
0:07:24.68,000 --> 0:07:27,000
TWB is currently in Iraq,

153
0:07:27.92,000 --> 0:07:31,000
training 20,000 teachers supported by USAID.

154
0:07:32.48,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And to them, this idea of being able to remix

155
0:07:35.32,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important,

156
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because just providing free content to people

157
0:07:42.76,000 --> 0:07:45,000
has actually been likened by people in the developing world

158
0:07:45.8,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to a kind of cultural imperialism --

159
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that if you don't empower people

160
0:07:49.72,000 --> 0:07:51,000
with the ability to re-contextualize the material,

161
0:07:52.12,000 --> 0:07:55,000
translate it into their own language and take ownership of it,

162
0:07:55.32,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it's not good.

163
0:07:57.08,000 --> 0:08:01,000
OK, other organizations we've been working with, UC Merced --

164
0:08:01.48,000 --> 0:08:02,000
people know about UC Merced.

165
0:08:03.28,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's a new university in California, in the Central Valley,

166
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:09,000
working very closely with community colleges.

167
0:08:09.96,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They're actually developing

168
0:08:11.32,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a lot of their science and engineering curriculum

169
0:08:13.64,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to spread widely around the world in our system.

170
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And they're also trying to develop all of their software tools

171
0:08:21.089,000 --> 0:08:22,000
completely open-source.

172
0:08:22.52,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We've been working with AMD, which has a project called 50x15,

173
0:08:27.28,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which is trying to bring Internet connectivity

174
0:08:30.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to 50 percent of the world's population by 2015.

175
0:08:33.68,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We're going to be providing content to them

176
0:08:35.72,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in a whole range of different languages.

177
0:08:37.88,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And we've also been working with a number of other organizations.

178
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In particular, a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation,

179
0:08:45.04,000 --> 0:08:49,000
who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content.

180
0:08:49.52,000 --> 0:08:52,000
OK, burn -- I think this is, sort of, quite interesting.

181
0:08:53.12,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"Burn" is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation

182
0:08:57.4,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of one of these courses.

183
0:08:58.64,000 --> 0:09:,000
And I think a lot of you received --

184
0:09:00.72,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack.

185
0:09:06.6,000 --> 0:09:07,000
A little present for you.

186
0:09:08.08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.

187
0:09:11.6,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It's about 300 pages long, hardbound.

188
0:09:16.2,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This costs -- anybody guess?

189
0:09:20.32,000 --> 0:09:22,000
How much would it cost in a bookstore?

190
0:09:22.4,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Audience) 65 dollars.

191
0:09:23.64,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Richard Baraniuk: OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.

192
0:09:28.4,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Why does it cost 22 dollars?

193
0:09:29.76,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Because it's published on demand

194
0:09:31.76,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and it's developed from this repository of open materials.

195
0:09:35.32,000 --> 0:09:37,000
If this book were to be published by a regular publisher,

196
0:09:38.04,000 --> 0:09:41,000
it would cost at least 122 dollars.

197
0:09:41.24,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So what we're seeing

198
0:09:42.48,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is moving this burning or publication process

199
0:09:45.4,000 --> 0:09:48,000
from the regular, sort of single-authored book

200
0:09:48.92,000 --> 0:09:5,000
towards community-authored materials

201
0:09:51.32,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that are modular, that are customized to each individual class

202
0:09:55.08,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and published on demand very inexpensively,

203
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:09:59,000
either pushed out through Amazon

204
0:10:00.28,000 --> 0:10:04,000
or published directly through an on-demand press, like QOOP.

205
0:10:04.48,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area

206
0:10:07.92,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing.

207
0:10:13.76,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We're not talking about the Harry Potter end,

208
0:10:15.92,000 --> 0:10:16,000
right at the left side.

209
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We're talking about books

210
0:10:18.4,000 --> 0:10:2,000
on hypergeometric partial differential equations.

211
0:10:21.04,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Books that might sell 100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.

212
0:10:25.36,000 --> 0:10:29,000
There is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail

213
0:10:30.24,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to sustain open projects like ours,

214
0:10:32.68,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but also to sustain this new emergence of on-demand publishers,

215
0:10:37.56,000 --> 0:10:39,000
like QOOP, who produced these two books.

216
0:10:39.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk

217
0:10:43.19,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is that there's an impending cut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation,

218
0:10:47.24,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that's going to be happening in the publishing industry.

219
0:10:49.92,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years,

220
0:10:52.8,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and I think that it's for our benefit, really, and for the world's benefit.

221
0:10:56.64,000 --> 0:10:57,000
OK, so what are the enablers?

222
0:10:58.32,000 --> 0:10:59,000
What's really making all of this happen?

223
0:11:00.28,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There's tons of technology,

224
0:11:01.92,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML.

225
0:11:05.8,000 --> 0:11:06,000
How many people know about XML?

226
0:11:07.56,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Oh, great.

227
0:11:08.8,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So it's the future of the web, right?

228
0:11:10.6,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's semantic representation of content.

229
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And what you can really think of XML in this case

230
0:11:17.4,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages.

231
0:11:20.32,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Remember we took the book, tore the pages out?

232
0:11:22.6,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Well, what the XML is going to do

233
0:11:24.52,000 --> 0:11:28,000
is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks.

234
0:11:28.88,000 --> 0:11:29,000
XML are the nubs on the Lego

235
0:11:30.8,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways,

236
0:11:34.88,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and it provides us a framework to share content.

237
0:11:38.4,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So, it lets you take this ecosystem

238
0:11:41.72,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in its primordial state of all this content,

239
0:11:44.32,000 --> 0:11:45,000
all the pages you've torn out of books,

240
0:11:46.202,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and create highly sophisticated learning machines:

241
0:11:50.2,000 --> 0:11:52,000
books, courses, course packs.

242
0:11:52.96,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience

243
0:11:56.68,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to each individual student,

244
0:11:58.4,000 --> 0:12:,000
so that every student can have a book or a course

245
0:12:01.08,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that's customized to their learning style, their context,

246
0:12:04.56,000 --> 0:12:06,000
their language and the things that excite them.

247
0:12:07.32,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways,

248
0:12:10.96,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and surprising new ways.

249
0:12:12.96,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It lets you interconnect ideas,

250
0:12:14.92,000 --> 0:12:18,000
indicating how fields relate to each other.

251
0:12:19.12,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And I'll just give you my personal story.

252
0:12:21.4,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We came up with this six-and-a-half years ago

253
0:12:23.92,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because I teach the stuff in the red box.

254
0:12:26.56,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And my day job, as Chris said -- I'm an electrical engineering professor.

255
0:12:30.36,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I teach signal processing

256
0:12:32.04,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and my challenge was to show that this math --

257
0:12:34.6,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Wow, about half of you have already fallen asleep

258
0:12:36.96,000 --> 0:12:37,000
just looking at the equation.

259
0:12:38.44,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Laughter)

260
0:12:39.64,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But this seemingly dry math

261
0:12:41.12,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web

262
0:12:45.48,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that links technology --

263
0:12:47.2,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that links really cool applications like music synthesizers

264
0:12:50.96,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to tremendous economic opportunities,

265
0:12:54.12,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but also governed by intellectual property.

266
0:12:56.28,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And the thing that I realized

267
0:12:57.72,000 --> 0:12:59,000
is there was no way that I, as an engineer,

268
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:02,000
could write this book that would get all of this across.

269
0:13:02.644,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We needed a community to do it

270
0:13:04.097,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas.

271
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do

272
0:13:11.04,000 --> 0:13:12,000
is make Minsky's dream come to a reality,

273
0:13:13.04,000 --> 0:13:15,000
where you can imagine all the books in a library

274
0:13:15.32,000 --> 0:13:16,000
actually starting to talk to each other.

275
0:13:17.28,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And people who are teachers out here -- whoever taught, you know this --

276
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.

277
0:13:25.52,000 --> 0:13:27,000
OK, back to math.

278
0:13:27.6,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Imagine -- this is possible:

279
0:13:30.12,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that every single equation that you click on in one of your new e-texts

280
0:13:34.72,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with.

281
0:13:38.48,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade.

282
0:13:42.04,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You can click on every single equation

283
0:13:43.96,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it,

284
0:13:46.84,000 --> 0:13:47,000
tinker with it, understand it.

285
0:13:48.72,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Because we really don't understand until we do.

286
0:13:51.48,000 --> 0:13:55,000
The same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry.

287
0:13:55.68,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Imagine chemistry textbooks

288
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed.

289
0:14:01.24,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Imagine Music XML

290
0:14:03.2,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music,

291
0:14:06.64,000 --> 0:14:07,000
play with it, understand it.

292
0:14:08.48,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It's no wonder that everybody's getting into it, right?

293
0:14:11.68,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Even the three wise men.

294
0:14:12.96,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

295
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
OK, the second big enabler, and this is where I told a big lie.

296
0:14:19.72,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The second big enabler is intellectual property.

297
0:14:22.88,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Because, in fact, I got up here

298
0:14:24.4,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and I talked about how great the music culture is.

299
0:14:26.76,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We can share and rip, mix and burn, but in fact, that's all illegal.

300
0:14:30.4,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And we would be accused of [piracy] for doing that,

301
0:14:33.8,000 --> 0:14:36,000
because this music has been propertized.

302
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's now owned, much of it by big industries.

303
0:14:41.48,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So, really, the key thing here is we can't let this happen.

304
0:14:44.266,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We can't let this Napster thing happen here.

305
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning.

306
0:14:49.977,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework

307
0:14:53.4,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable.

308
0:14:58.48,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And the inspiration here is taken from open-source software.

309
0:15:02.32,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Things like Linux and the GPL.

310
0:15:05.92,000 --> 0:15:07,000
The Creative Commons licenses.

311
0:15:08.325,000 --> 0:15:1,000
How many people have heard of creative commons?

312
0:15:10.54,000 --> 0:15:11,000
If you have not, you must learn about it.

313
0:15:12.52,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Creativecommons.org.

314
0:15:14.12,000 --> 0:15:17,000
At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions

315
0:15:17.48,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and in lots of other projects,

316
0:15:19.36,000 --> 0:15:2,000
you can find their logo.

317
0:15:20.96,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense,

318
0:15:24.56,000 --> 0:15:27,000
human-readable document, a deed,

319
0:15:27.72,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that tells you exactly what you can do with this content.

320
0:15:30.411,000 --> 0:15:33,000
In fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things:

321
0:15:34.04,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it,

322
0:15:37.12,000 --> 0:15:39,000
as long as you attribute the author.

323
0:15:40.04,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing,

324
0:15:44.48,000 --> 0:15:48,000
it's really this idea of sharing knowledge

325
0:15:48.84,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and making impact.

326
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
That's why people write, not necessarily making bucks.

327
0:15:54.04,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We're not talking about Harry Potter, right?

328
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
We're at the long tail end here.

329
0:15:57.88,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Behind that is the legal code, very carefully constructed.

330
0:16:02.56,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And Creative Commons is taking off --

331
0:16:04.44,000 --> 0:16:08,000
over 43 million things out there,

332
0:16:08.6,000 --> 0:16:1,000
licensed with a Creative Commons license.

333
0:16:10.72,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Not just text,

334
0:16:13.84,000 --> 0:16:15,000
but music, images, video.

335
0:16:16.36,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And there's actually a tremendous uptake

336
0:16:18.4,000 --> 0:16:21,000
of the number of people that are actually licensing music

337
0:16:21.88,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling,

338
0:16:25.12,000 --> 0:16:27,000
ripping, mixing, burning and sharing.

339
0:16:27.28,000 --> 0:16:3,000
OK, I'd like to conclude with just the last few points.

340
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
So, we've built this idea of a commons.

341
0:16:33.4,000 --> 0:16:34,000
People are using it.

342
0:16:35.32,000 --> 0:16:41,000
We get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site.

343
0:16:41.64,000 --> 0:16:45,000
MIT OpenCourseWare, which is another large open-content site,

344
0:16:45.72,000 --> 0:16:47,000
gets a similar number of hits.

345
0:16:47.96,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But how do we protect this?

346
0:16:49.64,000 --> 0:16:5,000
How do we protect it into the future?

347
0:16:51.44,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And the first thing that people are probably thinking

348
0:16:54.2,000 --> 0:16:55,000
is quality control, right?

349
0:16:55.84,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons.

350
0:17:00.56,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Anybody can contribute anything.

351
0:17:03.4,000 --> 0:17:05,000
So that could be a problem.

352
0:17:05.96,000 --> 0:17:09,000
It didn't take long until people started contributing materials,

353
0:17:10.2,000 --> 0:17:12,000
for example, on lingerie,

354
0:17:12.36,000 --> 0:17:13,000
which is actually a pretty good module.

355
0:17:14.36,000 --> 0:17:19,000
The only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal,

356
0:17:19.96,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and when you go to the supposed course website,

357
0:17:22.8,000 --> 0:17:26,000
it points to a lingerie-selling website.

358
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So this is a little bit of a problem.

359
0:17:29.2,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control

360
0:17:32.28,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in.

361
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:37,000
You come to TED. Why do you come to TED?

362
0:17:38.4,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Because Chris and his team have ensured

363
0:17:40.839,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that things are very, very high quality, right?

364
0:17:44.04,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And so we need to be able to do the same thing.

365
0:17:46.48,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And we need to be able to design structures,

366
0:17:49.56,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and what we're doing is designing social software

367
0:17:52.64,000 --> 0:17:55,000
to enable anyone to build their own peer review process,

368
0:17:55.76,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and we call these things "lenses."

369
0:17:57.6,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And basically what they allow

370
0:17:59.04,000 --> 0:18:02,000
is anyone out there can develop their own peer-review process,

371
0:18:02.48,000 --> 0:18:05,000
so that they can focus on the content in the repository

372
0:18:06.48,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that they think is really important.

373
0:18:08.219,000 --> 0:18:11,000
And you can think of TED as a potential lens.

374
0:18:11.52,000 --> 0:18:12,000
So I'd just like to end by saying:

375
0:18:13.321,000 --> 0:18:17,000
you can really view this as a call to action.

376
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge.

377
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:28,000
All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge,

378
0:18:28.04,000 --> 0:18:3,000
and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you

379
0:18:30.84,000 --> 0:18:33,000
to contribute to this project and other projects of its type,

380
0:18:34.08,000 --> 0:18:37,000
because I think together we can truly change the landscape

381
0:18:37.88,000 --> 0:18:39,000
of education and educational publishing.

382
0:18:40.12,000 --> 0:18:41,000
So, thanks very much.

0:00:12.772,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Some years ago, I was visiting Paris

2
0:00:15.579,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and walking along the Seine River during a beautiful summer afternoon.

3
0:00:19.928,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I saw giant bubbles floating on the riverbank,

4
0:00:23.201,000 --> 0:00:24,000
like this one.

5
0:00:24.636,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The next moment, it popped and was gone.

6
0:00:28.273,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Making them were two street performers surrounded by a crowd.

7
0:00:32.845,000 --> 0:00:35,000
They visibly make a living by asking for donations

8
0:00:36.268,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and by selling pairs of sticks tied with two strings.

9
0:00:40.152,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When I was there, a man bought a pair of sticks for 10 euros,

10
0:00:45.243,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which surprised me.

11
0:00:47.773,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I am a scientist who is passionate about bubbles.

12
0:00:51.71,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I know the right trick to make the giant bubbles

13
0:00:55.09,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is the right soapy water mixture itself --

14
0:00:58.515,000 --> 0:00:59,000
not the sticks,

15
0:00:59.97,000 --> 0:01:,000
which may be needed,

16
0:01:01.305,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but you can easily make them at home.

17
0:01:03.924,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Focusing on the sticks makes us not see that the real tool is the bubble itself.

18
0:01:10.97,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Bubbles might seem like something just children make while playing,

19
0:01:16.117,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but sometimes it can be really stunning.

20
0:01:19.659,000 --> 0:01:23,000
However, there are more fascinating science to bubbles,

21
0:01:24.021,000 --> 0:01:26,000
such as problem-solving tools.

22
0:01:27.192,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So I would like to share with you

23
0:01:29.589,000 --> 0:01:32,000
a few stories about the science of creating bubbles

24
0:01:33.284,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and the science of eliminating the microscopic ones.

25
0:01:37.742,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Since it's up on the screen, let's start with the soap bubble.

26
0:01:42.478,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It is made from very common substances:

27
0:01:45.548,000 --> 0:01:48,000
air, water, soap, in the right mixture.

28
0:01:50.214,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You can see soap bubbles constantly changing their colors.

29
0:01:53.839,000 --> 0:01:57,000
This is due to the interaction with light at various directions

30
0:01:58.36,000 --> 0:02:,000
and the changes of their thickness.

31
0:02:01.471,000 --> 0:02:04,000
One of the common substances, water molecules,

32
0:02:05.254,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are formed by two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen -- H2O.

33
0:02:12.35,000 --> 0:02:16,000
On most surfaces, water droplets tend to curve inwards,

34
0:02:17.165,000 --> 0:02:19,000
forming a semihemisphere shape.

35
0:02:20.237,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is because the water droplet's surface is like an elastic sheet.

36
0:02:25.729,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The water molecule on the surface is constantly being pulled inwards

37
0:02:29.777,000 --> 0:02:3,000
by the molecule at the center.

38
0:02:32.826,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And the quality of the elasticity is what we call "surface tension."

39
0:02:38.422,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now by adding soap,

40
0:02:40.497,000 --> 0:02:44,000
what happens is the soap molecule reduces the surface tension of water,

41
0:02:45.065,000 --> 0:02:48,000
making it more elastic and easier to form bubbles.

42
0:02:50.505,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You can think of a bubble as a mathematical problem-solver.

43
0:02:55.779,000 --> 0:03:,000
You see it relentlessly trying to achieve geometry perfection.

44
0:03:00.845,000 --> 0:03:05,000
For instance, a sphere is the shape with the least surface area

45
0:03:06.681,000 --> 0:03:07,000
for a given volume.

46
0:03:08.322,000 --> 0:03:12,000
That's why a single bubble is always in the shape of a sphere.

47
0:03:12.69,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Let me show you. Check it out.

48
0:03:30.112,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is a single bubble.

49
0:03:31.954,000 --> 0:03:33,000
When two bubbles touch each other,

50
0:03:37.437,000 --> 0:03:4,000
they can save materials by sharing a common wall.

51
0:03:48.385,000 --> 0:03:5,000
When more and more bubbles are added together,

52
0:03:51.334,000 --> 0:03:52,000
their geometry changes.

53
0:03:53.556,000 --> 0:03:55,000
These four bubbles are added together.

54
0:03:55.939,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They meet at one point at the center.

55
0:04:42.871,000 --> 0:04:44,000
When six bubbles are added together,

56
0:04:45.265,000 --> 0:04:47,000
a magical cube appears at the center.

57
0:04:47.929,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Applause)

58
0:04:55.059,000 --> 0:04:57,000
That is surface tension at work,

59
0:04:57.766,000 --> 0:05:,000
trying to find the most effective geometry arrangement.

60
0:05:03.693,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, let me give you another example.

61
0:05:09.153,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is a very simple prop.

62
0:05:13.258,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This is made from two layers of plastic

63
0:05:17.19,000 --> 0:05:19,000
with four pins connected to each other.

64
0:05:19.7,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Imagine these four pins represent four cities that are equally apart,

65
0:05:25.714,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and we would like to make roads to connect these four cities.

66
0:05:30.426,000 --> 0:05:34,000
My question is: What is the shortest length to connect these four cities?

67
0:05:35.723,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Let's find out the answer by dipping it into the soapy water.

68
0:05:43.775,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Remember, the soap bubble forms will always try to minimize

69
0:05:49.322,000 --> 0:05:5,000
their surface area

70
0:05:50.946,000 --> 0:05:52,000
with a perfect geometry arrangement.

71
0:05:54.632,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So the solution might not be something you expected.

72
0:06:02.175,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The shortest length to connect these four cities

73
0:06:05.607,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is 2.73 times the distance between these two cities.

74
0:06:11.495,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

75
0:06:17.401,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now you've got the idea.

76
0:06:19.391,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The soap bubble forms will always try to minimize their surface area

77
0:06:24.694,000 --> 0:06:26,000
with a perfect geometry arrangement.

78
0:06:29.416,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now, let us look at bubbles in another perspective.

79
0:06:36.357,000 --> 0:06:39,000
My daughter, Zoe, loves visiting zoos.

80
0:06:40.289,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Her favorite spot is Penguin Cove at Marwell Zoo in Southern England,

81
0:06:46.242,000 --> 0:06:5,000
where she could see penguins swim at speed under the water.

82
0:06:51.653,000 --> 0:06:54,000
One day, she noticed that the body of penguins

83
0:06:55.456,000 --> 0:06:58,000
leaves a trail of bubbles when they swim

84
0:06:58.48,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and asked why.

85
0:07:00.384,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Animals and birds like penguins

86
0:07:03.375,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that spend a lot of their time under the water

87
0:07:06.897,000 --> 0:07:12,000
have evolved an ingenious way of utilizing the capability of bubbles

88
0:07:13.336,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to reduce the density of water.

89
0:07:17.066,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Emperor penguins are thought to be able to dive a few hundred meters

90
0:07:21.802,000 --> 0:07:23,000
below the sea surface.

91
0:07:24.562,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They are thought to store the air under their feathers

92
0:07:28.278,000 --> 0:07:29,000
before they dive

93
0:07:29.957,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and then progressively release it as a cloud of bubbles.

94
0:07:35.3,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This reduces the density of water surrounding them,

95
0:07:38.992,000 --> 0:07:4,000
making it easier to swim through

96
0:07:41.801,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and speed up their swimming speed at least 40 percent.

97
0:07:47.779,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This feature has been noticed by the ship manufacturers.

98
0:07:52.364,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I am talking about the big ships here,

99
0:07:55.877,000 --> 0:08:,000
the ones that are used to transport thousands of containers across the ocean.

100
0:08:01.559,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Recently, they developed a system called "air lubricating system,"

101
0:08:06.985,000 --> 0:08:07,000
inspired by the penguins.

102
0:08:09.704,000 --> 0:08:13,000
In this system, they produce a lot of air bubbles

103
0:08:13.894,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and redistribute them across the whole of the ship,

104
0:08:18.007,000 --> 0:08:22,000
like an air carpet that reduces the water resistance

105
0:08:22.591,000 --> 0:08:24,000
when a ship is moving.

106
0:08:26.167,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This feature cuts off the energy consumption for the ship

107
0:08:30.209,000 --> 0:08:32,000
up to 15 percent.

108
0:08:34.848,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Bubbles can also be used for medicines.

109
0:08:38.388,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It can also play a role in medicines,

110
0:08:42.889,000 --> 0:08:48,000
for instance, as a method for noninvasive delivery systems for drugs and genes

111
0:08:49.882,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to a specific part of the body.

112
0:08:52.412,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Imagine a microbubble

113
0:08:54.492,000 --> 0:08:58,000
filled with a mixture of drugs and magnetic agents

114
0:08:58.613,000 --> 0:09:,000
being injected into our bloodstream.

115
0:09:02.273,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The bubbles will move to the target areas.

116
0:09:05.709,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But how do they know where to go?

117
0:09:08.336,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Because we placed a magnet there.

118
0:09:10.476,000 --> 0:09:12,000
For instance, this part of my hand.

119
0:09:12.861,000 --> 0:09:16,000
When the microbubbles move to this part of my hand,

120
0:09:16.897,000 --> 0:09:19,000
we can pop it via ultrasound

121
0:09:20.712,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and release the drug exactly where it's needed.

122
0:09:25.895,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now, I mentioned about the science of creating bubbles.

123
0:09:29.393,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But sometimes we also need to remove them.

124
0:09:33.718,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That's actually part of my job.

125
0:09:36.731,000 --> 0:09:4,000
My exact job title is "ink formulation scientist."

126
0:09:41.633,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But I don't work on the ink that you use for your writing pens.

127
0:09:46.366,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I'm working on some cool applications

128
0:09:49.202,000 --> 0:09:53,000
such as organic photovoltaics, OPVs,

129
0:09:53.646,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and organic light-emitting diodes, OLEDs.

130
0:09:57.342,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Part of my job is to figure out how and why we want to remove the bubbles

131
0:10:03.646,000 --> 0:10:05,000
from the ink that my company produces.

132
0:10:06.989,000 --> 0:10:09,000
During the formulation-mixing process,

133
0:10:10.275,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or preparation process,

134
0:10:12.058,000 --> 0:10:18,000
we mix active ingredients, solvents and additives

135
0:10:18.277,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in order to achieve the formulations with the properties we want

136
0:10:22.83,000 --> 0:10:23,000
when the ink is being used.

137
0:10:25.196,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But just like you would make drinks

138
0:10:28.137,000 --> 0:10:29,000
or bake cakes,

139
0:10:29.431,000 --> 0:10:34,000
it is unavoidable that some air bubbles will be trapped inside that ink.

140
0:10:35.686,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Here, we are talking about a different space

141
0:10:38.972,000 --> 0:10:4,000
from the bubbles I'd seen in Paris.

142
0:10:42.96,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The bubbles that are trapped inside those inks

143
0:10:45.186,000 --> 0:10:47,000
vary between a few millimeters,

144
0:10:48.141,000 --> 0:10:49,000
a few microns

145
0:10:49.408,000 --> 0:10:51,000
or even a few nanometers in size.

146
0:10:52.405,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And what we are concerned about

147
0:10:54.352,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is the oxygen and the moisture that is trapped inside.

148
0:10:58.525,000 --> 0:11:03,000
At this size scale, removing them is not easy.

149
0:11:04.254,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But it matters,

150
0:11:06.21,000 --> 0:11:1,000
for instance, for organic light-emitting diodes inks

151
0:11:11.772,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that we can use to produce display for your smartphone, for example.

152
0:11:19.674,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's supposed to last for many years,

153
0:11:21.933,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but if the ink that we use has been absorbed with oxygen and moisture

154
0:11:26.977,000 --> 0:11:28,000
[which] are not being removed,

155
0:11:29.364,000 --> 0:11:33,000
then we can quickly see dark spots appear in the pixels.

156
0:11:34.943,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Now, one challenge we face in removing the microbubbles

157
0:11:41.95,000 --> 0:11:44,000
is that they are not very cooperative.

158
0:11:45.42,000 --> 0:11:46,000
They like to sit there,

159
0:11:47.392,000 --> 0:11:49,000
bathing in the ink without moving much.

160
0:11:50.937,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But how do we kick them out?

161
0:11:54.741,000 --> 0:11:56,000
One technology we use

162
0:11:56.86,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is to force the ink going through a thin, long and tiny tube

163
0:12:02.425,000 --> 0:12:04,000
with a porous wall,

164
0:12:04.58,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and we place the tubes inside the vacuum chamber,

165
0:12:07.715,000 --> 0:12:11,000
so that the bubbles can be squeezed out from the ink

166
0:12:12.079,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and be removed.

167
0:12:14.73,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Once we manage to remove the bubbles from the ink that we produce,

168
0:12:21.31,000 --> 0:12:23,000
it is time for celebration.

169
0:12:25.726,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Let's open a bubbling champagne.

170
0:12:35.693,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Ooh, this is going to be fun!

171
0:12:37.905,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Laughter)

172
0:12:42.327,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Woooo!

173
0:12:44.681,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Applause)

174
0:12:52.317,000 --> 0:12:57,000
You could see a lot of bubbles rushing out from the champagne bottle.

175
0:12:58.566,000 --> 0:13:02,000
These are the bubbles filled with carbon dioxide,

176
0:13:02.933,000 --> 0:13:07,000
a gas that's been produced during the fermentation process of the wine.

177
0:13:09.226,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Let me pour some out.

178
0:13:12.919,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I can't miss the chance.

179
0:13:22.292,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I guess it's enough.

180
0:13:24.407,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Laughter)

181
0:13:29.178,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Here, I can see a lot of microbubbles

182
0:13:34.394,000 --> 0:13:39,000
moving from the bottom of the glass to the top of the champagne.

183
0:13:40.286,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Before it pops,

184
0:13:42.68,000 --> 0:13:47,000
it will jet tiny droplets of aroma molecules

185
0:13:47.902,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and intensify the flavor of champagne,

186
0:13:51.597,000 --> 0:13:54,000
making us enjoy much more the flavor of champagne.

187
0:13:56.226,000 --> 0:13:59,000
As a scientist who is passionate about bubbles,

188
0:13:59.752,000 --> 0:14:,000
I love to see them,

189
0:14:02.306,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I love to play with them,

190
0:14:04.465,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and I love to study them.

191
0:14:06.757,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And also, I love to drink them.

192
0:14:09.033,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Thank you.

193
0:14:10.266,000 --> 0:14:14,000
(Applause)

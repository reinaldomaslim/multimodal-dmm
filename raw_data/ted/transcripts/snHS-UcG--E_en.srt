1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
What is it about flying cars?

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And there are historic attempts

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that have had some level of technical success.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But we haven't yet gotten to the point

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
where on your way here this morning

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
with the three-dimensional sky above us --

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in.

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and realized that, despite the fact

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that we have a lot of modern innovations

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to draw on today

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that weren't available previously --

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we have modern composite materials,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we have glass cockpit avionics

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that bring the information you need to fly

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
directly to you in the cockpit --

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective,

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we realized that we were going to be getting

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the same result that people had been getting

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
for the last hundred years,

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which isn't where we want to be right now.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So instead of trying to make a car that can fly,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we decided to try to make a plane that could drive.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that works just like any other small airplane.

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You take off and land at a local airport.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Then once you're on the ground,

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
you fold up the wings, drive it home,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
park it in your garage.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And it works.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
After two years of an innovative design and construction process,

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the proof of concept made its public debut

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in 2008.

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now like with anything

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that's really different from the status quo,

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft.

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And we discovered that it's a very good thing

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that, when you go home with something that's been broken,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
you've actually learned a lot more

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the first time through.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Still, we very much wanted to see

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the aircraft that we'd all helped build

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in the air, off the ground,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
like it was supposed to be.

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And on our third high-speed testing deployment

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York,

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we got to do that for the first time.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And we were all very flattered to see that image

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
become a symbol of accomplishing something

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that people had thought was impossible

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
really the world over.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The flight testing that followed that

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
was as basic and low-risk as we could make it,

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but it still accomplished what we needed to

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to take the program to the next step

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and to gain the credibility that we needed

66
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
within our eventual market, the general aviation community,

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and with the regulators

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The FAA, about a year ago,

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
gave us an exemption for the Transition

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
within the light sport aircraft category.

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important,

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
makes it simpler for us to certify it,

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but it also makes it much easier

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
for you to learn how to fly it.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
A sport pilot can be certificated

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in as little as 20 hours of flight time.

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And at 110 lbs.,

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that's very important for solving the other side of the equation --

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
driving.

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It turns out that driving,

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles,

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground,

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
this may be counter-intuitive,

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but driving has potholes, cobblestones,

89
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
pedestrians, other drivers

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and a rather long and detailed list

91
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention,

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and a lot of the design work

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that we're the most proud of with the aircraft

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
came out of solving the unique problems

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
of operating it on the ground --

97
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
everything from a continuously-variable transmission

98
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and liquid-based cooling system

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that allows us to use an aircraft engine

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in stop-and-go traffic,

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to a custom-designed gearbox

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground,

103
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment,

104
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to crash safety features.

105
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We have a carbon fiber safety cage

106
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that protects the occupants

107
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough.

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The regulations for vehicles on the road

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
weren't written with an airplane in mind.

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So we did need a little bit of support

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now you may have seen in the news recently,

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
they came through with us at the end of last month

115
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with a few special exemptions

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that will allow the Transition to be sold

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in the same category as SUVs and light trucks.

118
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
As a multi-purpose passenger vehicle,

119
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
it is now officially "designed for occasional off-road use."

120
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

121
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now let's see it in action.

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
You're not powering the propeller, you're powering the wheels.

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And it is under seven feet tall,

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so it will fit in a standard construction garage.

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And that's the automated wing-folding mechanism.

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
That's real time.

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out.

129
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Once they're fully deployed,

130
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
there's a mechanical lock that goes into place,

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
again, from inside the cockpit.

132
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And they're now fully capable of handling

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
any of the loads you would see in flight --

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
just like putting down your convertible top.

135
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Video) Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies,

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
75 percent of your risk is that first flight.

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Radio: It actually flew. Yes.

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Radio 2: That was gorgeous.

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Radio: What did you think of that?

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
That was beautiful from up here, I tell you.

142
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
AMD: See, we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop.

143
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And our test pilot gave us

144
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight,

145
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which was that it was "remarkably unremarkable."

146
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He would go onto tell us

147
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land

148
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.

149
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So despite making something

150
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that is seemingly revolutionary,

151
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we really focused on doing

152
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
as little new as possible.

153
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviation

154
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and from automotive racing.

155
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
When we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box,

156
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cycle

157
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that lets us reduce risk in baby steps.

158
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Now since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago,

159
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we've had a lot of those baby steps.

160
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We've gone from being three of us

161
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school

162
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to about two-dozen of us

163
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
working in an initial production facility outside of Boston.

164
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We've had to overcome challenges

165
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about,

166
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
figuring out how to politely respond

167
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
when a regulator tells you,

168
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended --

169
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues

171
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that we talked about on the ground.

172
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Still, if everything goes to our satisfaction

173
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
with the testing and construction

174
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
of the two production prototypes

175
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that we're working on right now,

176
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
those first deliveries

177
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point

178
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
should begin at the end of next year.

179
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.

180
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy,

181
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane.

182
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Here's why.

183
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world

184
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports,

185
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
there is a huge underutilized resource out there.

186
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
There are thousands of local airstrips

187
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.

188
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
On average, there's one within 20 to 30 miles

189
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
of wherever you are in the United States.

190
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The Transition gives you

191
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
a safer, more convenient and more fun way

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of using this resource.

193
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
For those of you who aren't yet pilots,

194
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
there's four main reasons why those of us who are

195
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
don't fly as much as we'd like to:

196
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the weather, primarily,

197
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
cost, long door-to-door travel time

198
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and mobility at your destination.

199
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, bad weather comes in,

200
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
just land, fold up the wings, drive home.

201
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Doesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.

202
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger,

203
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
park it in your garage.

204
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use

205
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
is both cheaper and better for the environment

206
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
than traditional avgas.

207
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Door-to-door travel time is reduced,

208
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space,

209
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger,

210
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.

211
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved.

212
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Just fold up the wings and keep going.

213
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons

214
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
while making the world a smaller, more accessible place.

215
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure.

216
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I hope you'll each take a moment

217
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to think about how you could use something like this

218
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to give yourself more access to your own world,

219
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun.

220
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you.

221
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This is the Large Hadron Collider.

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's 27 kilometers in circumference.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from 85 countries around the world

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
have come together over several decades

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to build this machine.

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
What we do is we accelerate protons --

9
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so, hydrogen nuclei --

10
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
around 99.999999

11
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
percent the speed of light.

12
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Right? At that speed, they go around

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.

14
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And we collide them with another beam of protons

15
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
going in the opposite direction.

16
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We collide them inside giant detectors.

17
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They're essentially digital cameras.

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
You get some sense of the size --

20
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you can just see these EU standard-size

21
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
people underneath.

22
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide,

24
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.

25
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And we re-create the conditions that were present

26
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began

27
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
up to 600 million times a second

28
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
inside that detector -- immense numbers.

29
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And if you see those metal bits there --

30
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
those are huge magnets that bend

31
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
electrically charged particles,

32
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so it can measure how fast they're traveling.

33
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is a picture about a year ago.

34
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Those magnets are in there.

35
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And, again, a EU standard-size, real person,

36
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so you get some sense of the scale.

37
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created,

38
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
sometime in the summer this year.

39
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And actually, this morning, I got an email

40
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
saying that we've just finished, today,

41
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
building the last piece of ATLAS.

42
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say

43
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
that I planned that for TED,

44
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.

45
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Applause)

46
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement.

47
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So, you might be asking, "Why?

48
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Why create the conditions that were present

49
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"

50
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.

51
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And the aim of particle physics is to understand

52
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.

53
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And by everything I mean, of course,

54
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
me and you, the Earth, the Sun,

55
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the 100 billion suns in our galaxy

56
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and the 100 billion galaxies

57
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in the observable universe.

58
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Absolutely everything.

59
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?

60
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me."

61
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Well, we found that as you look back in time,

62
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the universe gets hotter and hotter,

63
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
denser and denser, and simpler and simpler.

64
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,

65
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but that seems to be the case.

66
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
So, way back in the early times of the universe,

67
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we believe it was very simple and understandable.

68
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things --

69
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
human brains -- are a property of an old

70
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and cold and complicated universe.

71
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second,

72
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.

73
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It's almost like ...

74
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
imagine a snowflake in your hand,

75
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,

76
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
beautiful object. But as you heat it up,

77
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it'll melt into a pool of water,

78
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made

79
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of H20, water.

80
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So it's in that same sense that we look back in time

81
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to understand what the universe is made of.

82
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And, as of today, it's made of these things.

83
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Just 12 particles of matter,

84
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
stuck together by four forces of nature.

85
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons

86
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that make up the atomic nuclei in your body.

87
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The electron -- the thing that goes around

88
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the atomic nucleus --

89
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force

90
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that's carried by this thing, the photon.

91
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.

92
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,

93
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
probably the least familiar.

94
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.

95
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And when the sun shines, you get copious quantities

96
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.

97
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail --

98
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
about a square centimeter --

99
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second

100
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
from the sun, passing

101
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
through every square centimeter of your body.

102
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But you don't feel them, because the weak force

103
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is correctly named --

104
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
very short range and very weak,

105
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
so they just fly through you.

106
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And these particles have been discovered

107
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
over the last century, pretty much.

108
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,

109
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,

110
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in the year 2000. Actually just --

111
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,

112
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
America, isn't it?

113
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Just up the road.

114
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.

115
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,

117
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so it's a relatively recent picture.

118
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
One of the wonderful things, actually, I find,

119
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.

120
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You know, they're a step in size

121
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
from the entire observable universe.

122
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, 100 billion galaxies,

123
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
13.7 billion light years away --

124
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a step in size from that to Monterey, actually,

125
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
is about the same as from Monterey to these things.

126
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Absolutely, exquisitely minute,

127
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.

128
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So, one of my most illustrious forebears

129
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,

130
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
discoverer of the atomic nucleus,

131
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
once said, "All science is either physics

132
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or stamp collecting."

133
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, I don't think he meant to insult

134
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the rest of science,

135
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.

136
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

137
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But what he meant was that what we've done, really,

138
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
is stamp collect there.

139
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
OK, we've discovered the particles,

140
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but unless you understand the underlying

141
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is --

142
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.

143
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Fortunately, we have

144
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century

145
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that underpins that pattern.

146
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It's the Newton's laws, if you want,

147
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of particle physics.

148
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.

149
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,

150
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
which is always the sign of elegance.

151
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This is it.

152
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

153
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out

154
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in all its gory detail.

155
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything --

156
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.

157
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together --

158
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in principle, you've got a big enough computer --

159
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
why DNA is the shape it is.

160
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.

161
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But there's a problem.

162
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Can anyone see what it is?

163
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.

164
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.

165
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Basically, each of these terms

166
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
refers to some of the particles.

167
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.

168
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.

169
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.

170
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Right, H.

171
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
H stands for Higgs particle.

172
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Higgs particles have not been discovered.

173
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But they're necessary: they're necessary

174
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to make that mathematics work.

175
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do

176
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
with that wonderful equation

177
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.

178
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So it's a prediction:

179
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
a prediction of a new particle.

180
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
What does it do?

181
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.

182
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money

183
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
for the LHC from the U.K. government,

184
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said,

185
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
"If you guys can explain, in language

186
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
a politician can understand,

187
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.

188
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."

189
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.

190
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.

191
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And the picture is that the whole universe --

192
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you --

193
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.

194
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Higgs particles, if you will.

195
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The analogy is that these people in a room

196
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
are the Higgs particles.

197
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Now when a particle moves through the universe,

198
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it can interact with these Higgs particles.

199
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.

200
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,

201
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
essentially at the speed of light. They're massless.

202
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And imagine someone incredibly important

203
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and popular and intelligent

204
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
walks into the room.

205
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.

206
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.

207
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.

208
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks

209
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in your body and in the universe that we see around us

210
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
are heavy, in a sense, and massive,

211
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.

212
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They're interacting with the Higgs field.

213
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
If that picture's true,

214
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.

215
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,

216
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
although it's the simplest we've been able to think of --

217
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles

218
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we know have to turn up

219
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
at the LHC.

220
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.

221
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.

222
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Actually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but --

223
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

224
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
anyway.

225
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So that's one thing.

226
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.

227
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
There are many other things. You've heard

228
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
many of the big problems in particle physics.

229
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
One of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.

230
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
There's another issue,

231
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually --

232
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
seem, as you go back in time,

233
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
they seem to change in strength.

234
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Well, they do change in strength.

235
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,

236
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.

237
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,

238
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model --

239
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you can calculate how these change -- is the forces,

240
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the three forces, other than gravity,

241
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
almost seem to come together at one point.

242
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It's almost as if there was one beautiful

243
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.

244
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But they just miss.

245
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry,

246
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which doubles the number of particles in the standard model,

247
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.

248
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But actually, with this theory,

249
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
we find that the forces of nature

250
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang --

251
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,

252
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but it seems to do it.

253
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Also, those super-symmetric particles

254
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are very strong candidates for the dark matter.

255
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So a very compelling theory

256
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that's really mainstream physics.

257
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on --

258
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
in a very unscientific way -- that

259
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that these things would also crop up at the LHC.

260
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Many other things that the LHC could discover.

261
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you

262
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
a different perspective

263
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
of what I think -- what particle physics

264
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.

265
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful

266
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
narrative -- almost a creation story,

267
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
if you'd like -- about the universe,

268
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
from modern science over the last few decades.

269
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And I'd say that it deserves,

270
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,

271
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories

272
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.

273
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.

274
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The story goes like this: we know that

275
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the universe began 13.7 billion years ago,

276
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
in an immensely hot, dense state,

277
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
much smaller than a single atom.

278
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It began to expand about

279
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
a million, billion, billion, billion billionth

280
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.

281
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Gravity separated away from the other forces.

282
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
The universe then underwent

283
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
an exponential expansion called inflation.

284
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
In about the first billionth of a second or so,

285
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks

286
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and the gluons and the electrons

287
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that make us up got mass.

288
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The universe continued to expand and cool.

289
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
After about a few minutes,

290
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.

291
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,

292
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
25 percent helium. It still is today.

293
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It continued to expand

294
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
about 300 million years.

295
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Then light began to travel through the universe.

296
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It was big enough to be transparent to light,

297
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background

298
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that George Smoot described

299
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
as looking at the face of God.

300
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
After about 400 million years, the first stars formed,

301
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook

302
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
into the heavier elements.

303
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So the elements of life --

304
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
carbon, and oxygen and iron,

305
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
all the elements that we need to make us up --

306
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
were cooked in those first generations of stars,

307
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
which then ran out of fuel, exploded,

308
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
threw those elements back into the universe.

309
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
They then re-collapsed into another generation

310
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of stars and planets.

311
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created

312
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen

313
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to form water, liquid water on the surface.

314
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,

315
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
primitive life evolved,

316
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
which evolved over millions of years into

317
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
things that walked upright and left footprints

318
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,

319
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and eventually

320
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
left a footprint on another world.

321
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And built this civilization,

322
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
this wonderful picture,

323
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that turned the darkness into light,

324
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and you can see the civilization from space.

325
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,

326
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
these are the things -- and actually, not only these,

327
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but I was looking around -- these are the things,

328
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,

329
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and DNA, and literature and science --

330
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
these are the things that hydrogen atoms do

331
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
when given 13.7 billion years.

332
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Absolutely remarkable.

333
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And, the laws of physics. Right?

334
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So, the right laws of physics --

335
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
they're beautifully balanced.

336
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
If the weak force had been a little bit different,

337
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable

338
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
inside the hearts of stars,

339
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and there would be none of that in the universe.

340
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I think that's

341
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
a wonderful and significant story.

342
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,

343
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because we didn't know it.

344
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It makes me really feel that

345
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that civilization --

346
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
which, as I say, if you believe

347
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the scientific creation story,

348
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,

349
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and a few hydrogen atoms --

350
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
then I think, to me anyway,

351
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
it makes me feel incredibly valuable.

352
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So that's the LHC.

353
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,

354
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
going to write the next chapter of that book.

355
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And I'm certainly looking forward with

356
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
immense excitement to it being turned on.

357
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Thanks.

358
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000

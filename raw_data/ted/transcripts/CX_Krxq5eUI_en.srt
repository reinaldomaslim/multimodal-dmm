0:00:16.985,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hi. I'm here to talk about congestion,

3
0:00:19.902,000 --> 0:00:2,000
namely road congestion.

4
0:00:21.256,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon.

5
0:00:23.517,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world,

6
0:00:26.377,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which is a little bit surprising when you think about it.

7
0:00:28.325,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I mean, think about how different cities are, actually.

8
0:00:31.288,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I mean, you have the typical European cities,

9
0:00:33.05,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with a dense urban core, good public transportation

10
0:00:36.042,000 --> 0:00:38,000
mostly, not a lot of road capacity.

11
0:00:38.497,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But then, on the other hand, you have the American cities.

12
0:00:40.946,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's moving by itself, okay.

13
0:00:43.737,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Anyway, the American cities:

14
0:00:46.743,000 --> 0:00:48,000
lots of roads dispersed over large areas,

15
0:00:49.671,000 --> 0:00:5,000
almost no public transportation.

16
0:00:51.13,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And then you have the emerging world cities,

17
0:00:53.34,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with a mixed variety of vehicles,

18
0:00:54.866,000 --> 0:00:56,000
mixed land-use patterns, also rather dispersed

19
0:00:57.408,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but often with a very dense urban core.

20
0:01:00.007,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And traffic planners all around the world have tried

21
0:01:02.409,000 --> 0:01:05,000
lots of different measures: dense cities or dispersed cities,

22
0:01:06.063,000 --> 0:01:08,000
lots of roads or lots of public transport

23
0:01:08.614,000 --> 0:01:1,000
or lots of bike lanes or more information,

24
0:01:11.4,000 --> 0:01:14,000
or lots of different things, but nothing seems to work.

25
0:01:15.194,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But all of these attempts have one thing in common.

26
0:01:18.197,000 --> 0:01:2,000
They're basically attempts at figuring out

27
0:01:20.548,000 --> 0:01:23,000
what people should do instead of rush hour car driving.

28
0:01:23.875,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They're essentially, to a point, attempts at planning

29
0:01:26.987,000 --> 0:01:29,000
what other people should do, planning their life for them.

30
0:01:30.189,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, planning a complex social system

31
0:01:32.641,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is a very hard thing to do, and let me tell you a story.

32
0:01:35.716,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Back in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell,

33
0:01:38.443,000 --> 0:01:4,000
an urban planner in London got a phone call

34
0:01:41.065,000 --> 0:01:43,000
from a colleague in Moscow saying, basically,

35
0:01:43.615,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"Hi, this is Vladimir. I'd like to know,

36
0:01:46.133,000 --> 0:01:49,000
who's in charge of London's bread supply?"

37
0:01:49.155,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And the urban planner in London goes,

38
0:01:50.808,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"What do you mean, who's in charge of London's —

39
0:01:52.778,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I mean, no one is in charge."

40
0:01:54.049,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Oh, but surely someone must be in charge.

41
0:01:55.931,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this."

42
0:01:59.587,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"No. No. No one is in charge.

43
0:02:02.693,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I mean, it basically -- I haven't really thought of it.

44
0:02:05.294,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It basically organizes itself."

45
0:02:07.883,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It organizes itself.

46
0:02:10.46,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That's an example of a complex social system

47
0:02:13.303,000 --> 0:02:15,000
which has the ability of self-organizing,

48
0:02:16.031,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and this is a very deep insight.

49
0:02:18.619,000 --> 0:02:21,000
When you try to solve really complex social problems,

50
0:02:21.932,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the right thing to do is most of the time

51
0:02:23.648,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to create the incentives.

52
0:02:25.239,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You don't plan the details,

53
0:02:27.183,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and people will figure out what to do,

54
0:02:29.803,000 --> 0:02:3,000
how to adapt to this new framework.

55
0:02:31.663,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And let's now look at how we can use this insight

56
0:02:35.154,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to combat road congestion.

57
0:02:36.79,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This is a map of Stockholm, my hometown.

58
0:02:39.022,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, Stockholm is a medium-sized city, roughly two million people,

59
0:02:42.663,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water

60
0:02:45.452,000 --> 0:02:48,000
means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges, old bridges --

61
0:02:48.729,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which means lots of road congestion.

62
0:02:51.764,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And these red dots show the most congested parts,

63
0:02:55.404,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which are the bridges that lead into the inner city.

64
0:02:57.981,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And then someone came up with the idea that,

65
0:03:00.507,000 --> 0:03:01,000
apart from good public transport,

66
0:03:02.344,000 --> 0:03:04,000
apart from spending money on roads,

67
0:03:04.945,000 --> 0:03:08,000
let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks.

68
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money,

69
0:03:12.084,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc.,

70
0:03:14.741,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so you would probably expect that car drivers

71
0:03:17.459,000 --> 0:03:19,000
wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge.

72
0:03:19.897,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You would be wrong.

73
0:03:21.197,000 --> 0:03:25,000
One or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars

74
0:03:25.225,000 --> 0:03:27,000
disappear from rush hours.

75
0:03:27.609,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think,

76
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right?

77
0:03:33.367,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic.

78
0:03:35.236,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be

79
0:03:38.503,000 --> 0:03:4,000
a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that

80
0:03:41.195,000 --> 0:03:44,000
once you reach above a certain capacity threshold

81
0:03:44.336,000 --> 0:03:47,000
then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.

82
0:03:47.504,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But fortunately, it also works the other way around.

83
0:03:49.964,000 --> 0:03:52,000
If you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion

84
0:03:53.295,000 --> 0:03:56,000
will go down much faster than you might think.

85
0:03:56.924,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm

86
0:03:59.815,000 --> 0:04:03,000
on January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture

87
0:04:04.419,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2.

88
0:04:08.402,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this.

89
0:04:12.215,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This is what happens when you take away

90
0:04:15.135,000 --> 0:04:17,000
20 percent of the cars from the streets.

91
0:04:17.2,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You really reduce congestion quite substantially.

92
0:04:19.91,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right?

93
0:04:23.568,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So after a while they would all come back because they

94
0:04:26.07,000 --> 0:04:27,000
have sort of gotten used to charges.

95
0:04:28.018,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago

96
0:04:31.694,000 --> 0:04:32,000
since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm,

97
0:04:33.677,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and we basically have the same low traffic levels still.

98
0:04:37.666,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series

99
0:04:39.937,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in 2007.

100
0:04:41.4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges,

101
0:04:43.789,000 --> 0:04:46,000
they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced

102
0:04:46.885,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in January and then abolished again at the end of July,

103
0:04:50.854,000 --> 0:04:52,000
followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced

104
0:04:53.448,000 --> 0:04:57,000
again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.

105
0:04:57.648,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with,

106
0:05:01.785,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we actually got to do it twice.

107
0:05:03.566,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so,

108
0:05:05.675,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but they won't let me do that.

109
0:05:07.163,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But it was fun anyway.

110
0:05:09.348,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So, we followed up. What happened?

111
0:05:12.733,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31,

112
0:05:16.599,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and you see the same street but now it's summer,

113
0:05:18.377,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and summer in Stockholm is a very nice

114
0:05:20.121,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and light time of the year,

115
0:05:22.371,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and the first day without the congestion charges

116
0:05:25.214,000 --> 0:05:26,000
looked like this.

117
0:05:26.581,000 --> 0:05:28,000
All the cars were back again, and you even have to admire

118
0:05:29.244,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly.

119
0:05:32.154,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The first day they all came back.

120
0:05:34.401,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this.

121
0:05:39.751,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now these traffic figures are really exciting

122
0:05:42.082,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and a little bit surprising and very useful to know,

123
0:05:44.733,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but I would say that the most surprising slide here

124
0:05:47.492,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one.

125
0:05:51.522,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm,

126
0:05:54.853,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced

127
0:05:57.522,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it.

128
0:06:01.839,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Seventy percent of the population didn't want this.

129
0:06:04.867,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But what happened when the congestion charges

130
0:06:06.515,000 --> 0:06:09,000
were there is not what you would expect, that people hated it more and more.

131
0:06:09.976,000 --> 0:06:12,000
No, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point

132
0:06:13.129,000 --> 0:06:16,000
where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges,

133
0:06:16.83,000 --> 0:06:17,000
meaning that -- I mean, let me repeat that:

134
0:06:18.671,000 --> 0:06:2,000
70 percent of the population in Stockholm

135
0:06:21.478,000 --> 0:06:24,000
want to keep a price for something that used to be free.

136
0:06:25.471,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Okay. So why can that be? Why is that?

137
0:06:29.097,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Well, think about it this way. Who changed?

138
0:06:32.097,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared,

139
0:06:34.723,000 --> 0:06:35,000
surely they must be discontent in a way.

140
0:06:36.668,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And where did they go? If we can understand this,

141
0:06:39.002,000 --> 0:06:43,000
then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.

142
0:06:43.132,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Well, so we did this huge interview survey

143
0:06:45.534,000 --> 0:06:46,000
with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out

144
0:06:47.369,000 --> 0:06:48,000
who changed, and where did they go?

145
0:06:49.124,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter)

146
0:06:53.538,000 --> 0:06:57,000
For some reason, the car drivers are --

147
0:06:58.386,000 --> 0:07:01,000
they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do.

148
0:07:01.882,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And why is that? It's because that travel patterns

149
0:07:04.138,000 --> 0:07:06,000
are much less stable than you might think.

150
0:07:06.537,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Each day, people make new decisions, and people change

151
0:07:09.368,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and the world changes around them, and each day

152
0:07:11.793,000 --> 0:07:14,000
all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly

153
0:07:15.046,000 --> 0:07:16,000
away from rush hour car driving

154
0:07:17.013,000 --> 0:07:19,000
in a way that people don't even notice.

155
0:07:19.597,000 --> 0:07:21,000
They're not even aware of this themselves.

156
0:07:21.642,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And the other question, who changed their mind?

157
0:07:24.443,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Who changed their opinion, and why?

158
0:07:26.409,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So we did another interview survey, tried to figure out

159
0:07:28.935,000 --> 0:07:32,000
why people changed their mind, and what type of group changed their minds?

160
0:07:33.311,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And after analyzing the answers, it turned out that

161
0:07:36.204,000 --> 0:07:39,000
more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds.

162
0:07:40.089,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They're actually confident that they have

163
0:07:42.376,000 --> 0:07:44,000
liked congestion pricing all along.

164
0:07:45.065,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Which means that we are now in a position

165
0:07:46.784,000 --> 0:07:48,000
where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon

166
0:07:49.777,000 --> 0:07:52,000
with 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers,

167
0:07:52.988,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and people aren't even aware that they have changed,

168
0:07:56.535,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.

169
0:08:00.446,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This is the power of nudges when trying to solve

170
0:08:03.92,000 --> 0:08:05,000
complex social problems, and when you do that,

171
0:08:06.552,000 --> 0:08:09,000
you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt.

172
0:08:10.182,000 --> 0:08:12,000
You should just nudge them in the right direction.

173
0:08:12.369,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And if you do it right,

174
0:08:14.091,000 --> 0:08:16,000
people will actually embrace the change,

175
0:08:16.143,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and if you do it right, people will actually even like it.

176
0:08:19.205,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Thank you. (Applause)

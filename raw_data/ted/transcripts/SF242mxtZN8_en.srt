1
0:00:12.822,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So over the long course of human history,

2
0:00:16.257,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the infectious disease that's killed more humans

3
0:00:18.749,000 --> 0:00:2,000
than any other is malaria.

4
0:00:21.235,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos,

5
0:00:24.096,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and it's probably our oldest scourge.

6
0:00:26.305,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.

7
0:00:30.192,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.

8
0:00:33.794,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We've got 300 million cases a year

9
0:00:36.245,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and over half a million deaths.

10
0:00:39.237,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now this really makes no sense.

11
0:00:42.202,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We've known how to cure malaria

12
0:00:44.854,000 --> 0:00:45,000
since the 1600s.

13
0:00:46.494,000 --> 0:00:48,000
That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru

14
0:00:48.791,000 --> 0:00:5,000
discovered the bark of the cinchona tree,

15
0:00:51.693,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and inside that bark was quinine,

16
0:00:53.566,000 --> 0:00:56,000
still an effective cure for malaria to this day.

17
0:00:56.904,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries.

18
0:00:59.805,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We've known how to prevent malaria since 1897.

19
0:01:02.989,000 --> 0:01:04,000
That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross

20
0:01:05.262,000 --> 0:01:08,000
discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria,

21
0:01:08.62,000 --> 0:01:12,000
not bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.

22
0:01:12.812,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve,

23
0:01:18.095,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people

24
0:01:22.025,000 --> 0:01:25,000
are going to die from the bite of a mosquito.

25
0:01:25.5,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Why is that?

26
0:01:26.745,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This is a question that's

27
0:01:28.275,000 --> 0:01:3,000
personally intrigued me for a long time.

28
0:01:30.43,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants

29
0:01:33.189,000 --> 0:01:35,000
visiting my cousins in India every summer,

30
0:01:35.448,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and because I had no immunity to the local malarias,

31
0:01:38.636,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night

32
0:01:42.87,000 --> 0:01:43,000
while my cousins, they were allowed to sleep

33
0:01:44.561,000 --> 0:01:45,000
out on the terrace and have

34
0:01:45.79,000 --> 0:01:47,000
this nice, cool night breeze wafting over them.

35
0:01:48.552,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I really hated the mosquitos for that.

36
0:01:52.076,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But at the same time, I come from a Jain family,

37
0:01:55.444,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and Jainism is a religion that espouses

38
0:01:57.758,000 --> 0:02:,000
a very extreme form of nonviolence.

39
0:02:00.896,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So Jains are not supposed to eat meat.

40
0:02:04.224,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We're not supposed to walk on grass,

41
0:02:06.081,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because you could, you know,

42
0:02:07.342,000 --> 0:02:08,000
inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass.

43
0:02:09.242,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos.

44
0:02:12.019,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So the fearsome power of this little insect

45
0:02:15.735,000 --> 0:02:16,000
was apparent to me from a very young age,

46
0:02:17.714,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist

47
0:02:20.985,000 --> 0:02:22,000
trying to understand, why has malaria

48
0:02:23.673,000 --> 0:02:27,000
been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long?

49
0:02:28.213,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I think there's three main reasons why.

50
0:02:30.87,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason,

51
0:02:33.338,000 --> 0:02:35,000
which is probably the biggest reason of all.

52
0:02:36.149,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The first reason is certainly scientific.

53
0:02:39.11,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This little parasite that causes malaria,

54
0:02:41.425,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it's probably one of the most complex

55
0:02:43.352,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and wily pathogens known to humankind.

56
0:02:45.943,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito

57
0:02:49.283,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and half its life inside the warm-blooded human.

58
0:02:53.685,000 --> 0:02:55,000
These two environments are totally different,

59
0:02:56.683,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but not only that, they're both utterly hostile.

60
0:02:59.699,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite,

61
0:03:03.706,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off.

62
0:03:06.667,000 --> 0:03:09,000
This little creature survives under siege like that,

63
0:03:10.417,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but not only does it survive, it has thrived.

64
0:03:13.492,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know.

65
0:03:17.814,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It's a shape-shifter, for one thing.

66
0:03:19.928,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly,

67
0:03:23.087,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the malaria parasite transforms itself like that

68
0:03:25.726,000 --> 0:03:28,000
seven times in its life cycle.

69
0:03:28.949,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other,

70
0:03:33.206,000 --> 0:03:36,000
they have totally different physiology.

71
0:03:36.27,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So say you came up with some great drug

72
0:03:38.262,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle.

73
0:03:41.202,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages.

74
0:03:44.667,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It can hide in our bodies, undetected,

75
0:03:47.53,000 --> 0:03:49,000
unbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks,

76
0:03:49.894,000 --> 0:03:52,000
for months, for years, in some cases even decades.

77
0:03:53.693,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle,

78
0:03:58.077,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite.

79
0:04:01.282,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Only about 12 species of mosquitos

80
0:04:03.58,000 --> 0:04:04,000
carry most of the world's malaria,

81
0:04:05.514,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and we know quite a bit about the kinds of

82
0:04:07.99,000 --> 0:04:09,000
watery habitats that they specialize in.

83
0:04:10.915,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So you might think, then, well, why don't we just

84
0:04:13.197,000 --> 0:04:16,000
avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live? Right?

85
0:04:16.353,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live

86
0:04:18.631,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.

87
0:04:21.39,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But say you live in the tropics

88
0:04:24.62,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and you walk outside your hut one day

89
0:04:27.893,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt

90
0:04:29.915,000 --> 0:04:3,000
around your home.

91
0:04:31.838,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Or say your cow does, or say your pig does,

92
0:04:35.068,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and then, say, it rains,

93
0:04:37.202,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.

94
0:04:39.57,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That's it. You've created the perfect

95
0:04:41.651,000 --> 0:04:44,000
malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door.

96
0:04:45.229,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects.

97
0:04:48.091,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We kind of create places that they love to live

98
0:04:50.725,000 --> 0:04:51,000
just by living our own lives.

99
0:04:52.724,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So there's a huge scientific challenge,

100
0:04:54.103,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but there's a huge economic challenge too.

101
0:04:56.31,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Malaria occurs in some of the poorest

102
0:04:58.245,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and most remote places on Earth,

103
0:05:00.184,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and there's a reason for that.

104
0:05:02.029,000 --> 0:05:04,000
If you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria.

105
0:05:04.729,000 --> 0:05:06,000
If you're poor, you're more likely to live

106
0:05:06.882,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.

107
0:05:10.951,000 --> 0:05:12,000
These are places where mosquitos breed.

108
0:05:13.54,000 --> 0:05:16,000
You're less likely to have door screens or window screens.

109
0:05:17.14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You're less likely to have electricity

110
0:05:19.043,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible,

111
0:05:22.049,000 --> 0:05:23,000
so you're outside more.

112
0:05:23.282,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You're getting bitten by mosquitos more.

113
0:05:25.614,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So poverty causes malaria,

114
0:05:27.239,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but what we also know now is that malaria itself

115
0:05:30.272,000 --> 0:05:31,000
causes poverty.

116
0:05:31.919,000 --> 0:05:33,000
For one thing, it strikes hardest during harvest season,

117
0:05:34.57,000 --> 0:05:36,000
so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields

118
0:05:37.326,000 --> 0:05:4,000
collecting their crops, they're home sick with a fever.

119
0:05:41.235,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But it also predisposes people to death

120
0:05:44.096,000 --> 0:05:45,000
from all other causes.

121
0:05:45.881,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So this has happened historically.

122
0:05:47.241,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We've been able to take malaria out of a society.

123
0:05:50.623,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Everything else stays the same,

124
0:05:52.08,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so we still have bad food, bad water, bad sanitation,

125
0:05:54.755,000 --> 0:05:55,000
all the things that make people sick.

126
0:05:56.516,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But just if you take malaria out,

127
0:05:58.66,000 --> 0:06:01,000
deaths from everything else go down.

128
0:06:02.472,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified

129
0:06:05.183,000 --> 0:06:07,000
what this means for a society.

130
0:06:07.368,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What it means is, if you have malaria in your society,

131
0:06:10.122,000 --> 0:06:12,000
your economic growth is depressed

132
0:06:12.583,000 --> 0:06:15,000
by 1.3 percent every year,

133
0:06:16.553,000 --> 0:06:19,000
year after year after year, just this one disease alone.

134
0:06:20.352,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So this poses a huge economic challenge,

135
0:06:22.916,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because say you do come up with your great drug

136
0:06:25.1,000 --> 0:06:27,000
or your great vaccine -- how do you deliver it

137
0:06:27.31,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in a place where there's no roads,

138
0:06:29.88,000 --> 0:06:3,000
there's no infrastructure,

139
0:06:31.073,000 --> 0:06:34,000
there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold,

140
0:06:34.407,000 --> 0:06:36,000
there's no clinics, there's no clinicians

141
0:06:37.127,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to deliver these things where they're needed?

142
0:06:39.661,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria.

143
0:06:43.664,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge,

144
0:06:46.72,000 --> 0:06:47,000
there's also a cultural challenge,

145
0:06:48.532,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and this is probably the part about malaria

146
0:06:51.917,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that people don't like to talk about.

147
0:06:54.218,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And it's the paradox that the people

148
0:06:56.929,000 --> 0:06:57,000
who have the most malaria in the world

149
0:06:58.737,000 --> 0:07:,000
tend to care about it the least.

150
0:07:01.317,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.

151
0:07:04.729,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They ask people in malarious parts of the world,

152
0:07:07.496,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"What do you think about malaria?"

153
0:07:09.552,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And they don't say, "It's a killer disease. We're scared of it."

154
0:07:13.461,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They say, "Malaria is a normal problem of life."

155
0:07:18.799,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And that was certainly my personal experience.

156
0:07:20.565,000 --> 0:07:22,000
When I told my relatives in India

157
0:07:22.584,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that I was writing a book about malaria,

158
0:07:24.068,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they kind of looked at me like

159
0:07:26.035,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I told them I was writing a book about warts or something.

160
0:07:28.736,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Like, why would you write about something so boring,

161
0:07:31.783,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so ordinary? You know?

162
0:07:33.449,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And it's simple risk perception, really.

163
0:07:36.177,000 --> 0:07:38,000
A child in Malawi, for example,

164
0:07:38.612,000 --> 0:07:42,000
she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two,

165
0:07:43.424,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but if she survives,

166
0:07:45.477,000 --> 0:07:47,000
she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life,

167
0:07:48.091,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but she's much less likely to die of it.

168
0:07:50.814,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And so in her lived experience,

169
0:07:52.766,000 --> 0:07:55,000
malaria is something that comes and goes.

170
0:07:56.097,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria.

171
0:07:58.127,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own.

172
0:08:01.704,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's just, there's so much malaria

173
0:08:04.828,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death

174
0:08:08.599,000 --> 0:08:1,000
add up to this big, huge number.

175
0:08:11.56,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So I think people in malarious parts of the world

176
0:08:13.553,000 --> 0:08:14,000
must think of malaria the way

177
0:08:15.075,000 --> 0:08:16,000
those of us who live in the temperate world

178
0:08:16.734,000 --> 0:08:18,000
think of cold and flu. Right?

179
0:08:18.985,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies

180
0:08:22.391,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and on our own lives,

181
0:08:24.072,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but we don't really even take

182
0:08:25.336,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the most rudimentary precautions against it because

183
0:08:27.878,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we consider it normal to get cold and flu

184
0:08:30.599,000 --> 0:08:32,000
during cold and flu season.

185
0:08:32.836,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria,

186
0:08:37.248,000 --> 0:08:4,000
because if people think it's normal to have malaria,

187
0:08:41.022,000 --> 0:08:44,000
then how do you get them to run to the doctor

188
0:08:44.48,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription,

189
0:08:47.626,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to get it filled, to take the drugs,

190
0:08:49.148,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?

191
0:08:52.627,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease.

192
0:08:57.294,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So take all that together.

193
0:08:58.796,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated,

194
0:09:03.248,000 --> 0:09:05,000
it's economically challenging to deal with,

195
0:09:05.676,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and it's one for which the people who stand

196
0:09:07.321,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to benefit the most care about it the least.

197
0:09:09.625,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And that adds up to the biggest problem of all,

198
0:09:11.713,000 --> 0:09:13,000
which, of course, is the political problem.

199
0:09:14.662,000 --> 0:09:16,000
How do you get a political leader to do anything

200
0:09:17.52,000 --> 0:09:19,000
about a problem like this?

201
0:09:19.581,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And the answer is, historically, you don't.

202
0:09:24.206,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Most malarious societies throughout history

203
0:09:26.339,000 --> 0:09:28,000
have simply lived with the disease.

204
0:09:28.455,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So the main attacks on malaria have come

205
0:09:30.458,000 --> 0:09:32,000
from outside of malarious societies,

206
0:09:33.082,000 --> 0:09:34,000
from people who aren't constrained

207
0:09:34.876,000 --> 0:09:36,000
by these rather paralyzing politics.

208
0:09:37.855,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But this, I think, introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties.

209
0:09:41.15,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The first concerted attack against malaria

210
0:09:43.57,000 --> 0:09:44,000
started in the 1950s.

211
0:09:45.316,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department.

212
0:09:48.406,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And this effort well understood the economic challenge.

213
0:09:51.443,000 --> 0:09:54,000
They knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools,

214
0:09:54.924,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and they focused on DDT.

215
0:09:56.699,000 --> 0:09:57,000
They understood the cultural challenge.

216
0:09:58.138,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In fact, their rather patronizing view was that

217
0:10:01.143,000 --> 0:10:03,000
people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all.

218
0:10:04.046,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Everything should be done to them and for them.

219
0:10:07.768,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.

220
0:10:10.888,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They had so much faith in their tools

221
0:10:13.215,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that they stopped doing malaria research.

222
0:10:16.206,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And so when those tools started to fail,

223
0:10:18.674,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and public opinion started to turn against those tools,

224
0:10:21.374,000 --> 0:10:25,000
they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do.

225
0:10:25.568,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back,

226
0:10:29.019,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but now it was even worse than before

227
0:10:30.833,000 --> 0:10:32,000
because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places

228
0:10:33.594,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in the most difficult-to-control forms.

229
0:10:36.78,000 --> 0:10:39,000
One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign

230
0:10:40.079,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health."

231
0:10:45.136,000 --> 0:10:47,000
The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s.

232
0:10:47.643,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It's similarly directed and financed primarily

233
0:10:51.355,000 --> 0:10:53,000
from outside of malarious societies.

234
0:10:53.503,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge.

235
0:10:56.007,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They are doing tons of malaria research.

236
0:10:58.228,000 --> 0:11:,000
And they understand the economic challenge too.

237
0:11:00.681,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools.

238
0:11:04.241,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But now, I think, the dilemma is the cultural challenge.

239
0:11:08.133,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net.

240
0:11:11.767,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's treated with insecticides.

241
0:11:13.543,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This thing has been distributed across the malarious world

242
0:11:15.913,000 --> 0:11:16,000
by the millions.

243
0:11:17.346,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And when you think about the bed net,

244
0:11:19.578,000 --> 0:11:21,000
it's sort of a surgical intervention.

245
0:11:22.137,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You know, it doesn't really have any value

246
0:11:24.283,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria.

247
0:11:27.946,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night.

248
0:11:31.955,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They have to sleep under them every night.

249
0:11:33.232,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That's the only way they are effective.

250
0:11:35.269,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And they have to do that

251
0:11:36.622,000 --> 0:11:39,000
even if the net blocks the breeze,

252
0:11:39.708,000 --> 0:11:42,000
even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night

253
0:11:42.853,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and relieve themselves,

254
0:11:44.387,000 --> 0:11:46,000
even if they might have to move all their furnishings

255
0:11:46.636,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to put this thing up,

256
0:11:48.103,000 --> 0:11:5,000
even if, you know, they might live in a round hut

257
0:11:50.956,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in which it's difficult to string up a square net.

258
0:11:54.693,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease.

259
0:11:59.631,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I mean, these are minor inconveniences.

260
0:12:01.962,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.

261
0:12:05.801,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So for them, the calculus must be quite different.

262
0:12:10.681,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Imagine, for example, if a bunch of well-meaning Kenyans

263
0:12:14.599,000 --> 0:12:16,000
came up to those of us in the temperate world and said,

264
0:12:16.68,000 --> 0:12:18,000
"You know, you people have a lot of cold and flu.

265
0:12:19.502,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We've designed this great, easy-to-use, cheap tool,

266
0:12:22.63,000 --> 0:12:23,000
we're going to give it to you for free.

267
0:12:23.7,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It's called a face mask,

268
0:12:25.133,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and all you need to do is

269
0:12:29.006,000 --> 0:12:31,000
wear it every day during cold and flu season

270
0:12:31.416,000 --> 0:12:33,000
when you go to school and when you go to work."

271
0:12:34.185,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Would we do that?

272
0:12:36.115,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I wonder if that's how people

273
0:12:38.251,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in the malarious world thought of those nets

274
0:12:40.317,000 --> 0:12:41,000
when they first received them?

275
0:12:42.02,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Indeed, we know from studies

276
0:12:45.418,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that only 20 percent of the bed nets

277
0:12:48.096,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that were first distributed were actually used.

278
0:12:51.264,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And even that's probably an overestimate,

279
0:12:52.975,000 --> 0:12:54,000
because the same people who distributed the nets

280
0:12:55.397,000 --> 0:12:56,000
went back and asked the recipients,

281
0:12:56.888,000 --> 0:12:58,000
"Oh, did you use that net I gave you?"

282
0:12:59.361,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you,

283
0:13:01.973,000 --> 0:13:03,000
"Oh, did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas?"

284
0:13:04.934,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So it's probably an overestimate.

285
0:13:06.8,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But that's not an insurmountable problem.

286
0:13:10.124,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We can do more education,

287
0:13:11.954,000 --> 0:13:13,000
we can try to convince these people to use the nets.

288
0:13:14.629,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And that's what happening now.

289
0:13:15.904,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We're throwing a lot more time and money

290
0:13:17.608,000 --> 0:13:21,000
into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays

291
0:13:22.125,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and school meetings,

292
0:13:24.538,000 --> 0:13:26,000
all these things to convince people

293
0:13:26.833,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to use the nets we gave you.

294
0:13:29.317,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And that might work.

295
0:13:31.457,000 --> 0:13:33,000
But it takes time. It takes money.

296
0:13:34.135,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It takes resources. It takes infrastructure.

297
0:13:36.915,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It takes all the things that that cheap,

298
0:13:39.597,000 --> 0:13:41,000
easy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be.

299
0:13:42.376,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies,

300
0:13:45.78,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it

301
0:13:48.318,000 --> 0:13:5,000
from outside of those societies.

302
0:13:51.128,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We end up imposing our own priorities

303
0:13:52.915,000 --> 0:13:53,000
on the people of the malarious world.

304
0:13:54.459,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That's exactly what we did in the 1950s,

305
0:13:57.253,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and that effort backfired.

306
0:13:59.131,000 --> 0:14:,000
I would argue today,

307
0:14:00.762,000 --> 0:14:04,000
when we are distributing tools that we've designed

308
0:14:04.992,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives,

309
0:14:08.745,000 --> 0:14:11,000
we run the risk of making the same mistake again.

310
0:14:12.298,000 --> 0:14:13,000
That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable,

311
0:14:14.106,000 --> 0:14:15,000
because I think it is,

312
0:14:15.569,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but what if we attacked this disease

313
0:14:17.777,000 --> 0:14:2,000
according to the priorities of the people who lived with it?

314
0:14:21.32,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Take the example of England and the United States.

315
0:14:23.756,000 --> 0:14:26,000
We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years,

316
0:14:26.927,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and we got rid of it completely,

317
0:14:29.085,000 --> 0:14:32,000
not because we attacked malaria. We didn't.

318
0:14:32.094,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We attacked bad roads and bad houses

319
0:14:36.201,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.

320
0:14:41.083,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We attacked the malarious way of life,

321
0:14:44.4,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and by doing that, we slowly built malaria out.

322
0:14:50.12,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Now attacking the malarious way of life,

323
0:14:51.758,000 --> 0:14:54,000
this is something -- these are things people care about today.

324
0:14:55.32,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And attacking the malarious way of life,

325
0:14:57.707,000 --> 0:15:01,000
it's not fast, it's not cheap, it's not easy,

326
0:15:02.466,000 --> 0:15:05,000
but I think it's the only lasting way forward.

327
0:15:05.534,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Thank you so much.

328
0:15:06.827,000 --> 0:15:11,000
(Applause)

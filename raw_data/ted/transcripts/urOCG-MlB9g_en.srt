1
0:00:12.46,000 --> 0:00:13,000
As patients,

2
0:00:13.7,000 --> 0:00:16,000
we usually remember the names of our doctors,

3
0:00:17.34,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but often we forget the names of our nurses.

4
0:00:21.42,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I remember one.

5
0:00:23.22,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I had breast cancer a few years ago,

6
0:00:25.46,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and somehow I managed to get through the surgeries

7
0:00:28.94,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and the beginning of the treatment just fine.

8
0:00:31.66,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I could hide what was going on.

9
0:00:33.94,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Everybody didn't really have to know.

10
0:00:36.18,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I could walk my daughter to school,

11
0:00:38.42,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I could go out to dinner with my husband;

12
0:00:40.42,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I could fool people.

13
0:00:42.54,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But then my chemo was scheduled to begin

14
0:00:44.9,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and that terrified me

15
0:00:46.66,000 --> 0:00:5,000
because I knew that I was going to lose every single hair on my body

16
0:00:51.22,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because of the kind of chemo that I was going to have.

17
0:00:54.3,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I wasn't going to be able to pretend anymore

18
0:00:56.62,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as though everything was normal.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I was scared.

20
0:01:00.58,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I knew what it felt like to have everybody treating me with kid gloves,

21
0:01:04.18,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I just wanted to feel normal.

22
0:01:06.58,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I had a port installed in my chest.

23
0:01:08.78,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I went to my first day of chemotherapy,

24
0:01:11.58,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I was an emotional wreck.

25
0:01:13.94,000 --> 0:01:16,000
My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,

26
0:01:16.98,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and every bone in my body was telling me to get up out of that chair

27
0:01:20.98,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and take for the hills.

28
0:01:22.5,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But Joanne looked at me and talked to me like we were old friends.

29
0:01:27.06,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And then she asked me,

30
0:01:28.5,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"Where'd you get your highlights done?"

31
0:01:30.62,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:31.74,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I was like, are you kidding me?

33
0:01:33.7,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You're going to talk to me about my hair when I'm on the verge of losing it?

34
0:01:38.58,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was kind of angry,

35
0:01:40.34,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and I said, "Really? Hair?"

36
0:01:43.46,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And with a shrug of her shoulders she said,

37
0:01:45.82,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"It's gonna grow back."

38
0:01:48.1,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And in that moment she said the one thing I had overlooked,

39
0:01:51.38,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and that was that at some point, my life would get back to normal.

40
0:01:55.22,000 --> 0:01:56,000
She really believed that.

41
0:01:56.94,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so I believed it, too.

42
0:01:59.34,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, worrying about losing your hair when you're fighting cancer

43
0:02:04.14,000 --> 0:02:05,000
may seem silly at first,

44
0:02:05.78,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but it's not just that you're worried about how you're going to look.

45
0:02:09.94,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's that you're worried that everybody's going to treat you so carefully.

46
0:02:14.58,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Joanne made me feel normal for the first time in six months.

47
0:02:18.14,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We talked about her boyfriends,

48
0:02:20.019,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we talked about looking for apartments in New York City,

49
0:02:22.78,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and we talked about my reaction to the chemotherapy --

50
0:02:25.66,000 --> 0:02:26,000
all kind of mixed in together.

51
0:02:28.18,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I always wondered,

52
0:02:30.18,000 --> 0:02:34,000
how did she so instinctively know just how to talk to me?

53
0:02:35.3,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Joanne Staha and my admiration for her

54
0:02:38.74,000 --> 0:02:41,000
marked the beginning of my journey into the world of nurses.

55
0:02:43.18,000 --> 0:02:45,000
A few years later, I was asked to do a project

56
0:02:45.62,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that would celebrate the work that nurses do.

57
0:02:48.94,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I started with Joanne,

58
0:02:50.46,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and I met over 100 nurses across the country.

59
0:02:54.14,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I spent five years interviewing, photographing and filming nurses

60
0:02:59.22,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for a book and a documentary film.

61
0:03:02.38,000 --> 0:03:03,000
With my team,

62
0:03:03.62,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we mapped a trip across America that would take us to places

63
0:03:06.98,000 --> 0:03:1,000
dealing with some of the biggest public health issues facing our nation --

64
0:03:11.94,000 --> 0:03:15,000
aging, war, poverty, prisons.

65
0:03:16.66,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And then we went places

66
0:03:17.94,000 --> 0:03:2,000
where we would find the largest concentration of patients

67
0:03:21.82,000 --> 0:03:22,000
dealing with those issues.

68
0:03:24.1,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Then we asked hospitals and facilities to nominate nurses

69
0:03:28.18,000 --> 0:03:29,000
who would best represent them.

70
0:03:30.62,000 --> 0:03:32,000
One of the first nurses I met was Bridget Kumbella.

71
0:03:34.02,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Bridget was born in Cameroon,

72
0:03:35.66,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the oldest of four children.

73
0:03:38.22,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Her father was at work when he had fallen from the fourth floor

74
0:03:42.1,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and really hurt his back.

75
0:03:44.1,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And he talked a lot about what it was like to be flat on your back

76
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and not get the kind of care that you need.

77
0:03:51.22,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And that propelled Bridget to go into the profession of nursing.

78
0:03:55.82,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now, as a nurse in the Bronx,

79
0:03:57.46,000 --> 0:04:,000
she has a really diverse group of patients that she cares for,

80
0:04:00.9,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from all walks of life,

81
0:04:02.82,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and from all different religions.

82
0:04:05.22,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And she's devoted her career to understanding the impact

83
0:04:09.42,000 --> 0:04:12,000
of our cultural differences when it comes to our health.

84
0:04:14.1,000 --> 0:04:15,000
She spoke of a patient --

85
0:04:15.46,000 --> 0:04:17,000
a Native American patient that she had --

86
0:04:18.18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that wanted to bring a bunch of feathers into the ICU.

87
0:04:22.9,000 --> 0:04:25,000
That's how he found spiritual comfort.

88
0:04:25.94,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And she spoke of advocating for him

89
0:04:28.18,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and said that patients come from all different religions

90
0:04:30.98,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and use all different kinds of objects for comfort;

91
0:04:34.9,000 --> 0:04:37,000
whether it's a holy rosary or a symbolic feather,

92
0:04:38.18,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it all needs to be supported.

93
0:04:41.02,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This is Jason Short.

94
0:04:42.86,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Jason is a home health nurse in the Appalachian mountains,

95
0:04:45.94,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and his dad had a gas station and a repair shop when he was growing up.

96
0:04:50.34,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So he worked on cars in the community that he now serves as a nurse.

97
0:04:55.42,000 --> 0:04:56,000
When he was in college,

98
0:04:56.7,000 --> 0:04:59,000
it was just not macho at all to become a nurse,

99
0:05:00.38,000 --> 0:05:02,000
so he avoided it for years.

100
0:05:02.58,000 --> 0:05:03,000
He drove trucks for a little while,

101
0:05:04.54,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but his life path was always pulling him back to nursing.

102
0:05:10.06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,

103
0:05:12.06,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Jason goes places that an ambulance can't even get to.

104
0:05:15.9,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In this photograph, he's standing in what used to be a road.

105
0:05:19.9,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Top of the mountain mining flooded that road,

106
0:05:22.74,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and now the only way for Jason to get to the patient

107
0:05:26.06,000 --> 0:05:28,000
living in that house with black lung disease

108
0:05:28.98,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is to drive his SUV against the current up that creek.

109
0:05:34.18,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The day I was with him, we ripped the front fender off the car.

110
0:05:37.98,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The next morning he got up, put the car on the lift,

111
0:05:41.22,000 --> 0:05:42,000
fixed the fender,

112
0:05:42.5,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and then headed out to meet his next patient.

113
0:05:45.5,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I witnessed Jason caring for this gentleman

114
0:05:48.78,000 --> 0:05:5,000
with such enormous compassion,

115
0:05:51.62,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and I was struck again by how intimate the work of nursing really is.

116
0:05:57.86,000 --> 0:06:,000
When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.

117
0:06:00.98,000 --> 0:06:02,000
He had just come back from a deployment

118
0:06:03.62,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and he hadn't really settled back in to life in San Diego yet.

119
0:06:08.22,000 --> 0:06:11,000
He talked about his experience of being a nurse in Germany

120
0:06:11.78,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and taking care of the soldiers coming right off the battlefield.

121
0:06:15.78,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Very often, he would be the first person they would see

122
0:06:19.58,000 --> 0:06:21,000
when they opened their eyes in the hospital.

123
0:06:22.3,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And they would look at him as they were lying there,

124
0:06:24.9,000 --> 0:06:25,000
missing limbs,

125
0:06:26.58,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and the first thing they would say is,

126
0:06:29.22,000 --> 0:06:32,000
"When can I go back? I left my brothers out there."

127
0:06:33.9,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And Brian would have to say,

128
0:06:35.46,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"You're not going anywhere.

129
0:06:37.06,000 --> 0:06:38,000
You've already given enough, brother."

130
0:06:39.82,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Brian is both a nurse and a soldier who's seen combat.

131
0:06:45.1,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So that puts him in a unique position

132
0:06:47.18,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to be able to relate to and help heal the veterans in his care.

133
0:06:53.38,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This is Sister Stephen,

134
0:06:54.9,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and she runs a nursing home in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.

135
0:06:59.14,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the entire circle of life can be found under her roof.

136
0:07:03.62,000 --> 0:07:05,000
She grew up wishing they lived on a farm,

137
0:07:06.1,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so given the opportunity to adopt local farm animals,

138
0:07:10.82,000 --> 0:07:13,000
she enthusiastically brings them in.

139
0:07:13.9,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And in the springtime, those animals have babies.

140
0:07:17.46,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And Sister Stephen uses those baby ducks, goats and lambs

141
0:07:22.66,000 --> 0:07:26,000
as animal therapy for the residents at Villa Loretto

142
0:07:26.94,000 --> 0:07:29,000
who sometimes can't remember their own name,

143
0:07:30.3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but they do rejoice in the holding of a baby lamb.

144
0:07:35.22,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The day I was with Sister Stephen,

145
0:07:37.06,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I needed to take her away from Villa Loretto

146
0:07:39.18,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to film part of her story.

147
0:07:41.3,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And before we left,

148
0:07:42.58,000 --> 0:07:44,000
she went into the room of a dying patient.

149
0:07:45.82,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And she leaned over and she said,

150
0:07:48.62,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"I have to go away for the day,

151
0:07:51.34,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but if Jesus calls you,

152
0:07:53.06,000 --> 0:07:54,000
you go.

153
0:07:54.3,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You go straight home to Jesus."

154
0:07:57.1,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I was standing there and thinking

155
0:07:59.7,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it was the first time in my life

156
0:08:01.74,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I witnessed that you could show someone you love them completely

157
0:08:06.06,000 --> 0:08:07,000
by letting go.

158
0:08:07.86,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We don't have to hold on so tightly.

159
0:08:11.22,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto

160
0:08:14.82,000 --> 0:08:19,000
than I have ever seen at any other time at any other place in my life.

161
0:08:21.14,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We live in a complicated time when it comes to our health care.

162
0:08:25.22,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It's easy to lose sight of the need for quality of life,

163
0:08:29.42,000 --> 0:08:3,000
not just quantity of life.

164
0:08:31.94,000 --> 0:08:34,000
As new life-saving technologies are created,

165
0:08:35.38,000 --> 0:08:38,000
we're going to have really complicated decisions to make.

166
0:08:39.1,000 --> 0:08:41,000
These technologies often save lives,

167
0:08:41.98,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but they can also prolong pain and the dying process.

168
0:08:47.739,000 --> 0:08:49,000
How in the world are we supposed to navigate these waters?

169
0:08:50.66,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We're going to need all the help we can get.

170
0:08:53.58,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Nurses have a really unique relationship with us

171
0:08:57.18,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because of the time spent at bedside.

172
0:09:00.58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
During that time,

173
0:09:01.82,000 --> 0:09:03,000
a kind of emotional intimacy develops.

174
0:09:06.46,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This past summer, on August 9,

175
0:09:09.06,000 --> 0:09:1,000
my father died of a heart attack.

176
0:09:12.42,000 --> 0:09:13,000
My mother was devastated,

177
0:09:14.1,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and she couldn't imagine her world without him in it.

178
0:09:19.18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Four days later she fell,

179
0:09:21.14,000 --> 0:09:22,000
she broke her hip,

180
0:09:23.02,000 --> 0:09:24,000
she needed surgery

181
0:09:24.54,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and she found herself fighting for her own life.

182
0:09:28.7,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Once again I found myself

183
0:09:30.46,000 --> 0:09:32,000
on the receiving end of the care of nurses --

184
0:09:33.46,000 --> 0:09:34,000
this time for my mom.

185
0:09:36.02,000 --> 0:09:38,000
My brother and my sister and I stayed by her side

186
0:09:38.58,000 --> 0:09:4,000
for the next three days in the ICU.

187
0:09:41.78,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And as we tried to make the right decisions

188
0:09:44.94,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and follow my mother's wishes,

189
0:09:47.34,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we found that we were depending upon the guidance of nurses.

190
0:09:52.02,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And once again,

191
0:09:53.5,000 --> 0:09:54,000
they didn't let us down.

192
0:09:56.42,000 --> 0:10:,000
They had an amazing insight in terms of how to care for my mom

193
0:10:01.22,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in the last four days of her life.

194
0:10:03.5,000 --> 0:10:06,000
They brought her comfort and relief from pain.

195
0:10:08.14,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They knew to encourage my sister and I to put a pretty nightgown on my mom,

196
0:10:13.42,000 --> 0:10:14,000
long after it mattered to her,

197
0:10:15.34,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but it sure meant a lot to us.

198
0:10:18.82,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And they knew to come and wake me up just in time for my mom's last breath.

199
0:10:25.42,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And then they knew how long to leave me in the room

200
0:10:27.86,000 --> 0:10:28,000
with my mother after she died.

201
0:10:30.78,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I have no idea how they know these things,

202
0:10:34.54,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but I do know that I am eternally grateful

203
0:10:37.7,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that they've guided me once again.

204
0:10:40.74,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Thank you so very much.

205
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Applause)

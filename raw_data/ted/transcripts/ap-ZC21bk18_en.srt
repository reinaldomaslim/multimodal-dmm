1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:32,000
exactly what technology means in my life.

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.

6
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I gave up all of my possessions,

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle --

9
0:00:54,000 --> 0:01:,000
and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,

10
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.

11
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

12
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I've since then tried to keep technology

13
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.

14
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
At the same time, I run a website on cool tools,

15
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.

16
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is

17
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,

18
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
as it relates to the spiritual.

19
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I'm not even sure we know what technology is.

20
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.

21
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.

22
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with

23
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.

24
0:01:56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.

25
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.

26
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:09,000
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.

27
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

28
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.

29
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that --

30
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.

31
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.

33
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But I was interested in another definition of technology.

34
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental.

35
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,

36
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I came up with a way of framing the question

37
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that seemed to work for me in my investigations.

38
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.

39
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.

40
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The question that I came up with was this question:

41
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,

42
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:04,000
does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,

43
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
what are its inherent trends and biases?

44
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:11,000
What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is

45
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.

46
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,

47
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.

48
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.

49
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I'm applying a similar trick to say,

50
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
what if we looked at the universe in our culture

51
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:36,000
through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?

52
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Obviously, this in an incomplete question,

53
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
just as looking at an organism as only a gene

54
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is an incomplete way of looking at it.

55
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,

56
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?

57
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I think once we ask that question

58
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,

59
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
if we keep extending the origins of technology far back,

60
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I think we come back to life at some point.

61
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.

62
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And like you heard from the previous speakers,

63
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.

64
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We have really no idea.

65
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt

66
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.

67
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try

68
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and actually discover all the species on Earth.

69
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe

70
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,

71
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
just to see what's on life. And if we did that

72
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,

73
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we would begin to see some incredible species.

74
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This is not on another planet. These are things

75
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that are hidden away on our planet.

76
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.

77
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen

78
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:58,000
from Jamie and others, these magnificent things --

79
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
what they're doing, each one of them,

80
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is they're hacking the rules of life.

81
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I can't think of a single general principle of biology

82
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.

83
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Every single thing that we can think of --

84
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,

85
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,

86
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because every single one of them is hacking something about it.

87
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch

88
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.

89
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,

90
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet

91
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in

92
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.

93
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:57,000
These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape

94
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,

95
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,

96
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria

97
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.

98
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.

99
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But a more interesting way,

100
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the current way to take the long view,

101
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.

102
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution

103
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.

104
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart

105
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.

106
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.

107
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But what I like about this is it shows that

108
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:53,000
every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.

109
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.

110
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They've been around just as long and gone through

111
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:03,000
just the same kind of trial and error to get here.

112
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking,

113
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and has a different way of finding out how to do life.

114
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,

115
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.

116
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:23,000
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth

117
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
have we ever been where we don't find life.

118
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We find life at the bottom of every long-term,

119
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
long-distance drilling core into the center of rock

120
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.

121
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.

122
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
More and more of the inert matter of the globe

123
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is being touched and animated by life.

124
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.

125
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell

126
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to the more specific and specialized.

127
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.

128
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And actually, we have current data that does show

129
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.

130
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.

131
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:14,000
One of the things we see about life is that it moves

132
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:18,000
from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means

133
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.

134
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Like those chloroplast cells --

135
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they're completely surrounded by other life.

136
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.

137
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And so the general, long-term trends of evolution

138
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:38,000
are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,

139
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:43,000
complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,

140
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:48,000
OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?

141
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And again, my question is, what does technology want?

142
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And so, remarkably, I discovered

143
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that there's also a drift toward specialization.

144
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
That we see there's a general hammer,

145
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and hammers become more and more specific over time.

146
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.

147
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
This is all the contents of a Japanese home.

148
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter,

149
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around

150
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and count the number of species of technology in our household.

151
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.

152
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,

153
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
had only about 7,000 items in his household.

154
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And he was the King of England,

155
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.

156
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.

157
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out

158
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and he sees machines making machines. How depraved!

159
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.

160
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.

161
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology

162
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and not non-technology, or even life.

163
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:,000
And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex

164
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,

165
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I was partly responsible for that cliche

166
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.

167
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So the major trends in technology evolution actually

168
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:2,000
are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see

169
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,

170
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:27,000
towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise

171
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:32,000
because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,

172
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.

173
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.

174
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That its operations and how it works is so similar

175
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.

176
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And so it would be sort of approximately up there,

177
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:58,000
coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,

178
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.

179
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:06,000
This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould

180
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.

181
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.

182
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.

183
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,

184
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and to do a morphological analysis,

185
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and try to derive their genealogical history over time.

186
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.

187
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But the most interesting aspect about this

188
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,

189
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:39,000
those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet

190
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.

191
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.

192
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out

193
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,

194
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and you can actually use it to determine

195
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
that this is a technological system versus a biological system.

196
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important

197
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that I began to think about what happens with old technology.

198
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.

199
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,

200
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:2,000
"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?

201
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They're not around anymore." Well actually, they are.

202
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:31,000
In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.

203
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts

204
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:38,000
for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked

205
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button --

206
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Laughter) --

207
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:47,000
for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there.

208
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.

209
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.

210
0:12:55,000 --> 0:13:,000
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog

211
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page --

212
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I took a page that was actually more difficult than others

213
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
because lots of the pages are filled with things

214
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that are still being made. But I took this page

215
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and I said, how many of these things are still being made?

216
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.

217
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And the answer is: all of them.

218
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:3,000
All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.

219
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I don't know who needs a corn sheller.

220
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills;

221
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are --

222
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,

223
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:47,000
brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.

224
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:54,000
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife

225
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:58,000
made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.

226
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,

227
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:05,000
what's important is that this information actually never died out.

228
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.

229
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes

230
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:17,000
until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.

231
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.

232
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.

233
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.

234
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and

235
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:32,000
took what I could find, the examples in history

236
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
where there have been prohibitions against technology,

237
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and then I tried to find out when they came back in,

238
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:41,000
because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,

239
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,

240
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,

241
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense

242
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:56,000
what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.

243
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.

244
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing

245
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution --

246
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:14,000
we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life --

247
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
what they're really about is accelerating and changing

248
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
the way in which evolution happens.

249
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.

250
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,

251
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:29,000
the evolution of evolvability.

252
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So what's happening over time in life is

253
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,

254
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:38,000
are increasing. And the real tricks are ways

255
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.

256
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And then what we see in the singularity,

257
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
that prophesized by Kurzweil and others --

258
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:5,000
his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.

259
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:53,000
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.

260
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So if you have life hacking --

261
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
life means hacking, the game of survival --

262
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:02,000
then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.

263
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.

264
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
That is what we call an "infinite game."

265
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:12,000
That's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win,

266
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and an infinite game is played to keep playing.

267
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.

268
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
The origins of technology was not in 1829,

269
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,

270
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe

271
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:34,000
were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,

272
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.

273
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
That's the definition. There was no temperature.

274
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,

275
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
what it expanded was the potential for difference.

276
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So as it expands and as things expand what we have

277
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:53,000
is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,

278
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.

279
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Those are all basically the same thing.

280
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And those are the things that technology brings us.

281
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:05,000
That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.

282
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:09,000
That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.

283
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.

284
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And that's why we continue to grab technology --

285
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
because we want those things. Those things are good.

286
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities.

287
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And each time we make a new opportunity place,

288
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:28,000
we're allowing a platform to make new ones.

289
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine

290
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented --

291
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:36,000
what a loss to society there would be.

292
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Imagine Van Gogh being born

293
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:41,000
before the technologies of cheap oil paints.

294
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.

295
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born

296
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:55,000
whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.

297
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:58,000
We have a moral obligation to invent technology

298
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:,000
so that every person on the globe has the potential

299
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:03,000
to realize their true difference.

300
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:06,000
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.

301
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:09,000
That's what technology really wants.

302
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:11,000
I'm going to skip through some of the objections

303
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:15,000
because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.

304
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:18,000
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be

305
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:2,000
bad technologies. I don't have an answer to

306
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:24,000
how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that

307
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:3,000
maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about,

308
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:33,000
maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.

309
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Maybe in some ways

310
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:4,000
the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.

311
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:43,000
It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,

312
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:45,000
but it's a really good thing to use

313
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:49,000
to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.

314
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:52,000
Our humanity is actually defined by technology.

315
0:18:52,000 --> 0:18:55,000
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity

316
0:18:55,000 --> 0:19:,000
is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.

317
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:02,000
That's what we're talking about.

318
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:06,000
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.

319
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:12,000
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.

320
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.

321
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:19,000
That's what technology wants.

322
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And so when I think about what technology wants,

323
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:27,000
I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this --

324
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:32,000
every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is

325
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:35,000
to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.

326
0:19:35,000 --> 0:19:38,000
That recursive nature is the infinite game.

327
0:19:38,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved,

328
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:45,000
so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.

329
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:48,000
That is the infinite game. And what technology is

330
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:51,000
is the medium in which we play that infinite game.

331
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:54,000
And so I think that we should embrace technology

332
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:57,000
because it is an essential part of our journey

333
0:19:57,000 --> 0:19:59,000
in finding out who we are.

334
0:19:59,000 --> 0:20:01,000
Thank you.

335
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:02,000

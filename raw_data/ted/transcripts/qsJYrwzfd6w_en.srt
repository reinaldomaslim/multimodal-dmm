2
0:00:12.349,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Living in Africa is to be on the edge,

3
0:00:15.543,000 --> 0:00:17,000
metaphorically, and quite literally

4
0:00:18.297,000 --> 0:00:21,000
when you think about connectivity before 2008.

5
0:00:21.929,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Though many human intellectual and technological leaps

6
0:00:25.641,000 --> 0:00:28,000
had happened in Europe and the rest of the world,

7
0:00:28.665,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but Africa was sort of cut off.

8
0:00:31.254,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And that changed, first with ships

9
0:00:33.881,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution

10
0:00:37.158,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and also the Industrial Revolution.

11
0:00:39.259,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And now we've got the digital revolution.

12
0:00:42.286,000 --> 0:00:45,000
These revolutions have not been evenly distributed

13
0:00:45.286,000 --> 0:00:47,000
across continents and nations.

14
0:00:47.619,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Never have been.

15
0:00:50.349,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables

16
0:00:54.114,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that connect Africa to the rest of the world.

17
0:00:57.018,000 --> 0:00:59,000
What I find amazing is that Africa

18
0:00:59.058,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is transcending its geography problem.

19
0:01:01.868,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Africa is connecting to the rest of the world

20
0:01:03.682,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and within itself.

21
0:01:05.518,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The connectivity situation has improved greatly,

22
0:01:08.794,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but some barriers remain.

23
0:01:10.995,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.

24
0:01:14.683,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In 2008, one of the problems that we faced

25
0:01:19.219,000 --> 0:01:21,000
was lack of information flow.

26
0:01:21.757,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There was a media blackout in 2008,

27
0:01:24.053,000 --> 0:01:26,000
when there was post-election violence in Kenya.

28
0:01:26.429,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.

29
0:01:29.253,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So we came together and we created software

30
0:01:32.003,000 --> 0:01:33,000
called Ushahidi.

31
0:01:33.569,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili.

32
0:01:37.169,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.

33
0:01:40.339,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This is David and Erik.

34
0:01:42.445,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I call them brothers from another mother.

35
0:01:44.517,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Clearly I have a German mother somewhere.

36
0:01:47.529,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And we worked together first with building

37
0:01:50.118,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and growing Ushahidi.

38
0:01:51.566,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And the idea of the software was to gather information

39
0:01:54.565,000 --> 0:01:56,000
from SMS, email and web, and put a map

40
0:01:57.338,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so that you could see what was happening where,

41
0:02:00.253,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and you could visualize that data.

42
0:02:02.357,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And after that initial prototype,

43
0:02:04.613,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we set out to make free and open-source software

44
0:02:07.108,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.

45
0:02:11.959,000 --> 0:02:12,000
All the while, we also wanted to give back

46
0:02:13.93,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to the local tech community that helped us

47
0:02:16.162,000 --> 0:02:19,000
grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.

48
0:02:19.667,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,

49
0:02:22.25,000 --> 0:02:24,000
an actual physical space

50
0:02:24.274,000 --> 0:02:26,000
where we could collaborate,

51
0:02:26.74,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.

52
0:02:31.297,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We did that with the support of different organizations

53
0:02:34.067,000 --> 0:02:37,000
like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.

54
0:02:37.072,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And we were able to grow this software footprint,

55
0:02:40.249,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and a few years later it became

56
0:02:43.015,000 --> 0:02:45,000
very useful software,

57
0:02:45.712,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti

58
0:02:48.939,000 --> 0:02:51,000
where citizens could indicate where they are

59
0:02:52.008,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and what their needs were,

60
0:02:53.402,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis

61
0:02:56.699,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the tsunami in Japan.

62
0:02:58.738,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Now, this year the Internet turns 20,

63
0:03:02.132,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and Ushahidi turned five.

64
0:03:04.414,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Ushahidi is not only the software that we made.

65
0:03:07.215,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It is the team, and it's also the community

66
0:03:10.272,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.

67
0:03:14.557,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We did not imagine that there would be this many maps

68
0:03:17.877,000 --> 0:03:18,000
around the world.

69
0:03:19.388,000 --> 0:03:22,000
There are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps,

70
0:03:22.91,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and even environmental monitoring crowd maps.

71
0:03:26.437,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya

72
0:03:29.893,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and that it has some use to people around the world

73
0:03:32.609,000 --> 0:03:35,000
trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.

74
0:03:35.96,000 --> 0:03:37,000
There is more that we're doing to explore this idea

75
0:03:38.831,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen,

76
0:03:41.446,000 --> 0:03:43,000
if I share the information with whatever device that I have,

77
0:03:44.382,000 --> 0:03:46,000
could inform you about what is going on,

78
0:03:46.925,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture

79
0:03:49.783,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of what's going on.

80
0:03:51.627,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I moved back to Kenya in 2011.

81
0:03:53.688,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Erik moved in 2010.

82
0:03:55.836,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago

83
0:03:57.983,000 --> 0:03:59,000
where there was abundant Internet access.

84
0:04:00.133,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I had never had to deal with a blackout.

85
0:04:02.965,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And in Kenya, it's a very different reality,

86
0:04:05.849,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress

87
0:04:08.946,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and the digital revolution is the electricity problem.

88
0:04:12.73,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this

89
0:04:15.501,000 --> 0:04:18,000
can be, let's just say very annoying.

90
0:04:18.737,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Blackouts are not fun.

91
0:04:20.702,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Imagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden

92
0:04:23.615,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the power goes out,

93
0:04:25.295,000 --> 0:04:27,000
your Internet connection goes down with it,

94
0:04:27.97,000 --> 0:04:3,000
so you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem,

95
0:04:31.618,000 --> 0:04:32,000
how do I switch back?

96
0:04:33.607,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.

97
0:04:36.325,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now,

98
0:04:39.517,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and other parts of Africa.

99
0:04:41.882,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The other problem that we're facing

100
0:04:43.838,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is that communication costs are also still a challenge.

101
0:04:48.125,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It costs me five Kenyan shillings,

102
0:04:50.289,000 --> 0:04:56,000
or .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.

103
0:04:56.342,000 --> 0:05:,000
Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?

104
0:05:00.912,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost

105
0:05:04.186,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to connect within Africa.

106
0:05:06.296,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And also, when traveling within Africa,

107
0:05:08.43,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you've got different settings for different mobile providers.

108
0:05:11.696,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This is the reality that we deal with.

109
0:05:14.405,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So we've got a joke in Ushahidi

110
0:05:17.02,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where we say, "If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere."

111
0:05:21.818,000 --> 0:05:23,000
[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.]

112
0:05:23.97,000 --> 0:05:25,000
What if we could overcome the problem

113
0:05:26.216,000 --> 0:05:29,000
of unreliable Internet and electricity

114
0:05:30.081,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and reduce the cost of connection?

115
0:05:32.106,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Could we leverage the cloud?

116
0:05:34.072,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.

117
0:05:35.903,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Could we leverage these technologies

118
0:05:38.328,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country?

119
0:05:43.393,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So we looked at the modem,

120
0:05:44.691,000 --> 0:05:47,000
an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet,

121
0:05:47.97,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and asked ourselves why

122
0:05:50.481,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the modems that we are using right now

123
0:05:52.436,000 --> 0:05:54,000
are built for a different context, where you've got

124
0:05:54.66,000 --> 0:05:57,000
ubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity,

125
0:05:58.615,000 --> 0:06:03,000
yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.

126
0:06:03.652,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We wanted to redesign the modem

127
0:06:06.149,000 --> 0:06:09,000
for the developing world, for our context,

128
0:06:09.196,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and for our reality.

129
0:06:11.107,000 --> 0:06:14,000
What if we could have connectivity with less friction?

130
0:06:14.784,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This is the BRCK.

131
0:06:18.313,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It acts as a backup to the Internet

132
0:06:21.217,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so that, when the power goes out,

133
0:06:24.994,000 --> 0:06:3,000
it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.

134
0:06:31.142,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.

135
0:06:33.983,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's actually everywhere.

136
0:06:36.323,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Most towns at least have a 3G connection.

137
0:06:39.251,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.

138
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The other reason that we built this

139
0:06:44.358,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is when electricity goes down, this has eight hours

140
0:06:46.944,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of battery left, so you can continue working,

141
0:06:48.958,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you can continue being productive,

142
0:06:51.046,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and let's just say you are less stressed.

143
0:06:55.268,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And for rural areas, it can be

144
0:06:57.598,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the primary means of connection.

145
0:06:59.701,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play

146
0:07:02.437,000 --> 0:07:05,000
when we wondered how can we use the cloud

147
0:07:05.496,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to be more intelligent so that

148
0:07:07.438,000 --> 0:07:09,000
you can analyze the different networks,

149
0:07:09.823,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and whenever you switch on the backup,

150
0:07:12.962,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you pick on the fastest network,

151
0:07:15.471,000 --> 0:07:17,000
so we'll have multi-SIM capability

152
0:07:17.87,000 --> 0:07:19,000
so that you can put multiple SIMs,

153
0:07:19.966,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on,

154
0:07:23.38,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and if the up time on that is not very good,

155
0:07:26.729,000 --> 0:07:28,000
then you hop onto the next one.

156
0:07:29.144,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.

157
0:07:32.881,000 --> 0:07:34,000
With load balancing, this can be possible.

158
0:07:35.769,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors --

159
0:07:39.622,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is this idea that you could have an on-ramp

160
0:07:43.05,000 --> 0:07:44,000
for the Internet of things.

161
0:07:44.977,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this.

162
0:07:48.597,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach

163
0:07:51.336,000 --> 0:07:52,000
a satellite module so that you could have

164
0:07:53.106,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Internet connectivity even in very remote areas.

165
0:07:56.631,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Out of adversity can come innovation,

166
0:07:59.376,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers

167
0:08:03.415,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?

168
0:08:07.494,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And for us, we begin with solving the problem

169
0:08:09.75,000 --> 0:08:11,000
in our own backyard in Kenya.

170
0:08:12.694,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It is not without challenge.

171
0:08:15.094,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Our team has basically been mules carrying components

172
0:08:17.847,000 --> 0:08:2,000
from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations

173
0:08:21.041,000 --> 0:08:22,000
with customs border agents.

174
0:08:22.969,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"What are you carrying?"

175
0:08:24.767,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And the local financing is not

176
0:08:27.537,000 --> 0:08:32,000
part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.

177
0:08:32.888,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that,

178
0:08:35.607,000 --> 0:08:37,000
through the support of many people,

179
0:08:37.848,000 --> 0:08:38,000
not only here but online,

180
0:08:39.847,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the BRCK has been Kickstarted,

181
0:08:42.102,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins.

182
0:08:46.192,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I will close by saying that, if we solve this

183
0:08:49.086,000 --> 0:08:51,000
for the local market, it could be impactful

184
0:08:51.646,000 --> 0:08:53,000
not only for the coders in Nairobi

185
0:08:54.096,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but also for small business owners

186
0:08:56.448,000 --> 0:08:58,000
who need reliable connectivity,

187
0:08:59.112,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and it can reduce the cost of connecting,

188
0:09:01.312,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and hopefully collaboration within African countries.

189
0:09:05.992,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy

190
0:09:10.964,000 --> 0:09:13,000
are connectivity and entrepreneurship.

191
0:09:14.483,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The BRCK is our part

192
0:09:16.923,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to keep Africans connected,

193
0:09:19.507,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and to help them drive the global digital revolution.

194
0:09:23.291,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Thank you.

195
0:09:24.505,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

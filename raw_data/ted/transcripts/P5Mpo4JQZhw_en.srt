1
0:00:12.598,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It was the middle of summer and well past closing time

2
0:00:15.211,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in the downtown Berkeley bar where my friend Polly and I

3
0:00:17.898,000 --> 0:00:19,000
worked together as bartenders.

4
0:00:20.693,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Usually at the end of our shift we had a drink -- but not that night.

5
0:00:25.732,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"I'm pregnant.

6
0:00:27.224,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Not sure what I'm going to do yet," I told Polly.

7
0:00:30.729,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Without hesitation, she replied, "I've had an abortion."

8
0:00:34.819,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Before Polly, no one had ever told me that she'd had an abortion.

9
0:00:40.631,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'd graduated from college just a few months earlier

10
0:00:43.336,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant.

11
0:00:47.797,000 --> 0:00:51,000
When I thought about my choices, I honestly did not know how to decide,

12
0:00:52.534,000 --> 0:00:54,000
what criteria I should use.

13
0:00:55.459,000 --> 0:00:57,000
How would I know what the right decision was?

14
0:00:58.408,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I worried that I would regret an abortion later.

15
0:01:03.044,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Coming of age on the beaches of Southern California,

16
0:01:05.785,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I grew up in the middle of our nation's abortion wars.

17
0:01:09.646,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade.

18
0:01:15.578,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Our community was surfing Christians.

19
0:01:18.265,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We cared about God, the less fortunate, and the ocean.

20
0:01:22.022,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Everyone was pro-life.

21
0:01:24.413,000 --> 0:01:29,000
As a kid, the idea of abortion made me so sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant

22
0:01:30.125,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I could never have one.

23
0:01:33.412,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And then I did.

24
0:01:36.789,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It was a step towards the unknown.

25
0:01:39.531,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But Polly had given me a very special gift:

26
0:01:42.305,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the knowledge that I wasn't alone

27
0:01:44.687,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about.

28
0:01:49.055,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Abortion is common.

29
0:01:51.37,000 --> 0:01:54,000
According to the Guttmacher Institute, one in three women in America

30
0:01:54.714,000 --> 0:01:56,000
will have an abortion in their lifetime.

31
0:02:00.147,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But for the last few decades, the dialogue around abortion in the United States

32
0:02:04.05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
has left little room for anything beyond pro-life and pro-choice.

33
0:02:07.944,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It's political and polarizing.

34
0:02:10.688,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But as much as abortion is hotly debated, it's still rare for us,

35
0:02:14.982,000 --> 0:02:17,000
whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people,

36
0:02:18.898,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to talk with one another about the abortions that we have.

37
0:02:24.028,000 --> 0:02:25,000
There is a gap.

38
0:02:25.43,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Between what happens in politics and what happens in real life,

39
0:02:29.215,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and in that gap, a battlefield mentality.

40
0:02:31.794,000 --> 0:02:33,000
An "are you with us or against us?" stance takes root.

41
0:02:36.058,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This isn't just about abortion.

42
0:02:38.655,000 --> 0:02:42,000
There are so many important issues that we can't talk about.

43
0:02:44.278,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation

44
0:02:49.524,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is the work of my life.

45
0:02:53.41,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There are two main ways to get started.

46
0:02:56.332,000 --> 0:02:58,000
One way is to listen closely.

47
0:02:58.634,000 --> 0:03:,000
And the other way is to share stories.

48
0:03:03.073,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So, 15 years ago, I cofounded an organization called Exhale

49
0:03:06.664,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to start listening to people who have had abortions.

50
0:03:10.593,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The first thing we did was create a talk-line, where women and men

51
0:03:13.963,000 --> 0:03:15,000
could call to get emotional support.

52
0:03:16.862,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Free of judgment and politics, believe it or not, nothing like our sevice

53
0:03:21.064,000 --> 0:03:22,000
had ever existed.

54
0:03:24.257,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We needed a new framework that could hold all the experiences that we were

55
0:03:28.467,000 --> 0:03:29,000
hearing on our talk-line.

56
0:03:30.934,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The feminist who regrets her abortion.

57
0:03:33.555,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The Catholic who is grateful for hers.

58
0:03:36.132,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The personal experiences that weren't fitting neatly into one box or the other.

59
0:03:41.416,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We didn't think it was right to ask women to pick a side.

60
0:03:45.467,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side,

61
0:03:50.469,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as they were going through this deeply personal experience.

62
0:03:54.964,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So we invented "pro-voice."

63
0:03:58.191,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Beyond abortion, pro-voice works on hard issues that we've struggled with globally

64
0:04:02.751,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for years,

65
0:04:04.022,000 --> 0:04:09,000
issues like immigration, religious tolerance, violence against women.

66
0:04:09.315,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It also works on deeply personal topics that might only matter to you

67
0:04:13.366,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and your immediate family and friends.

68
0:04:15.989,000 --> 0:04:18,000
They have a terminal illness, their mother just died,

69
0:04:19.878,000 --> 0:04:22,000
they have a child with special needs and they can't talk about it.

70
0:04:25.636,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Listening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro-voice practice.

71
0:04:31.302,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Listening and storytelling.

72
0:04:33.484,000 --> 0:04:34,000
That sounds pretty nice.

73
0:04:35.551,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Sounds maybe, easy? We could all do that.

74
0:04:39.15,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's not easy. It's very hard.

75
0:04:42.354,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Pro-voice is hard because we are talking about things everyone's fighting about

76
0:04:48.233,000 --> 0:04:5,000
or the things that no one wants to talk about.

77
0:04:51.409,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I wish I could tell you that when you decide to be pro-voice, that you'll find

78
0:04:58.365,000 --> 0:05:01,000
beautiful moments of breakthrough and gardens full of flowers,

79
0:05:02.615,000 --> 0:05:05,000
where listening and storytelling creates wonderful "a-ha" moments.

80
0:05:07.22,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I wish I could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you,

81
0:05:11.279,000 --> 0:05:14,000
or that there's a long-lost sisterhood of people who are just ready

82
0:05:14.641,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to have your back when you get slammed.

83
0:05:18.301,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But it can be vulnerable and exhausting to tell our own stories

84
0:05:22.546,000 --> 0:05:24,000
when it feels like nobody cares.

85
0:05:26.52,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And if we truly listen to one another,

86
0:05:30.755,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we will hear things that demand that we shift our own perceptions.

87
0:05:37.921,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There is no perfect time and there is no perfect place

88
0:05:40.827,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to start a difficult conversation.

89
0:05:43.811,000 --> 0:05:48,000
There's never a time when everyone will be on the same page, share the same lens,

90
0:05:49.414,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or know the same history.

91
0:05:53.153,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So, let's talk about listening and how to be a good listener.

92
0:05:58.65,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple.

93
0:06:02.905,000 --> 0:06:04,000
One is to ask open-ended questions.

94
0:06:05.807,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You can ask yourself or someone that you know,

95
0:06:08.519,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"How are you feeling?"

96
0:06:11.519,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"What was that like?"

97
0:06:14.166,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"What do you hope for, now?"

98
0:06:18.368,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Another way to be a good listener is to use reflective language.

99
0:06:22.757,000 --> 0:06:24,000
If someone is talking about their own personal experience,

100
0:06:25.661,000 --> 0:06:27,000
use the words that they use.

101
0:06:28.169,000 --> 0:06:31,000
If someone is talking about an abortion and they say the word "baby,"

102
0:06:31.539,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you can say "baby."

103
0:06:33.483,000 --> 0:06:35,000
If they say "fetus," you can say "fetus."

104
0:06:36.479,000 --> 0:06:38,000
If someone describes themselves as gender queer to you,

105
0:06:39.224,000 --> 0:06:4,000
you can say "gender queer."

106
0:06:41.782,000 --> 0:06:44,000
If someone kind of looks like a he, but they say they're a she -- it's cool.

107
0:06:45.62,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Call that person a she.

108
0:06:48.081,000 --> 0:06:51,000
When we reflect the language of the person who is sharing their own story,

109
0:06:51.647,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we are conveying that we are interested in understanding who they are

110
0:06:57.029,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and what they're going through.

111
0:06:59.745,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The same way that we hope people are interested in knowing us.

112
0:07:05.062,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So, I'll never forget being in one of the Exhale counselor meetings,

113
0:07:08.473,000 --> 0:07:11,000
listening to a volunteer talk about how she was getting a lot of calls

114
0:07:12.374,000 --> 0:07:14,000
from Christian women who were talking about God.

115
0:07:16.114,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, some of our volunteers are religious, but this particular one was not.

116
0:07:20.247,000 --> 0:07:23,000
At first, it felt a little weird for her to talk to callers about God.

117
0:07:24.852,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, she decided to get comfortable.

118
0:07:27.282,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And she stood in front of her mirror at home, and she said the word "God."

119
0:07:31.671,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"God."

120
0:07:32.785,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"God."

121
0:07:33.505,000 --> 0:07:33,000
"God."

122
0:07:34.225,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"God."

123
0:07:35.325,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"God."

124
0:07:36.282,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"God."

125
0:07:37.801,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Over and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange

126
0:07:41.081,000 --> 0:07:43,000
coming out her mouth.

127
0:07:43.455,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Saying the word God did not turn this volunteer into a Christian,

128
0:07:47.395,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but it did make her a much better listener of Christian women.

129
0:07:54.693,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So, another way to be pro-voice is to share stories,

130
0:07:58.576,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and one risk that you take on, when you share your story with someone else,

131
0:08:02.796,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is that given the same set of circumstances as you

132
0:08:05.983,000 --> 0:08:07,000
they might actually make a different decision.

133
0:08:09.227,000 --> 0:08:13,000
For example, if you're telling a story about your abortion,

134
0:08:13.423,000 --> 0:08:15,000
realize that she might have had the baby.

135
0:08:18.284,000 --> 0:08:19,000
She might have placed for adoption.

136
0:08:21.79,000 --> 0:08:24,000
She might have told her parents and her partner -- or not.

137
0:08:26.503,000 --> 0:08:31,000
She might have felt relief and confidence, even though you felt sad and lost.

138
0:08:32.45,000 --> 0:08:33,000
This is okay.

139
0:08:35.723,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Empathy gets created the moment we imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.

140
0:08:41.606,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It doesn't mean we all have to end up in the same place.

141
0:08:46.729,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's not agreement, it's not sameness that pro-voice is after.

142
0:08:53.207,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It creates a culture and a society that values what make us special and unique.

143
0:08:59.569,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It values what makes us human, our flaws and our imperfections.

144
0:09:04.932,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respect,

145
0:09:09.551,000 --> 0:09:1,000
instead of fear.

146
0:09:12.386,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And it generates the empathy that we need

147
0:09:14.6,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another.

148
0:09:18.026,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Stigma, shame, prejudice, discrimination, oppression.

149
0:09:24.69,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Pro-voice is contagious, and the more it's practiced

150
0:09:29.603,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the more it spreads.

151
0:09:35.149,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, last year I was pregnant again.

152
0:09:38.253,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This time I was looking forward to the birth of my son.

153
0:09:42.35,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And while pregnant, I had never been asked how I was feeling so much in all my life.

154
0:09:48.927,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

155
0:09:50.346,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And however I replied, whether I was feeling wonderful and excited

156
0:09:54.408,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or scared and totally freaked out,

157
0:09:57.217,000 --> 0:10:01,000
there was always someone there giving me a "been there" response.

158
0:10:01.578,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It was awesome.

159
0:10:03.35,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It was a welcome, yet dramatic departure from what I experience

160
0:10:08.52,000 --> 0:10:11,000
when I talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion.

161
0:10:13.087,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Pro-voice is about the real stories of real people

162
0:10:16.864,000 --> 0:10:18,000
making an impact on the way abortion

163
0:10:19.444,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and so many other politicized and stigmatized issues

164
0:10:23.542,000 --> 0:10:25,000
are understood and discussed.

165
0:10:25.857,000 --> 0:10:29,000
From sexuality and mental health to poverty and incarceration.

166
0:10:31.562,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Far beyond definition as single right or wrong decisions,

167
0:10:35.05,000 --> 0:10:38,000
our experiences can exist on a spectrum.

168
0:10:40.478,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Pro-voice focuses that conversation on human experience

169
0:10:44.8,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and it makes support and respect possible for all.

170
0:10:50.755,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Thank you.

171
0:10:52.39,000 --> 0:10:54,000

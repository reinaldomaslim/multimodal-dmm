1
0:00:12.826,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment

2
0:00:15.493,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that you're a soldier in the heat of battle.

3
0:00:18.73,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer

4
0:00:22.285,000 --> 0:00:23,000
or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.

5
0:00:24.189,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Regardless of your time and place, there are some things that are constant.

6
0:00:28.467,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Your adrenaline is elevated,

7
0:00:30.385,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes,

8
0:00:35.218,000 --> 0:00:39,000
reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side

9
0:00:39.598,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and to defeat the enemy.

10
0:00:42.826,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role,

11
0:00:46.387,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that of the scout.

12
0:00:48.012,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The scout's job is not to attack or defend.

13
0:00:51.425,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The scout's job is to understand.

14
0:00:54.233,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The scout is the one going out,

15
0:00:56.318,000 --> 0:01:,000
mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles.

16
0:01:00.405,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge

17
0:01:04.005,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in a convenient location across a river.

18
0:01:06.363,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But above all, the scout wants to know what's really there,

19
0:01:09.434,000 --> 0:01:1,000
as accurately as possible.

20
0:01:12.195,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And in a real, actual army, both the soldier and the scout are essential.

21
0:01:17.265,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset --

22
0:01:22.599,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas

23
0:01:26.25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in our daily lives.

24
0:01:28.192,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What I'm going to argue today is that having good judgment,

25
0:01:32.046,000 --> 0:01:35,000
making accurate predictions, making good decisions,

26
0:01:35.284,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is mostly about which mindset you're in.

27
0:01:38.994,000 --> 0:01:4,000
To illustrate these mindsets in action,

28
0:01:41.611,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'm going to take you back to 19th-century France,

29
0:01:45.119,000 --> 0:01:47,000
where this innocuous-looking piece of paper

30
0:01:48.126,000 --> 0:01:51,000
launched one of the biggest political scandals in history.

31
0:01:51.718,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff.

32
0:01:56.616,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It was torn up in a wastepaper basket,

33
0:01:59.332,000 --> 0:02:,000
but when they pieced it back together,

34
0:02:01.281,000 --> 0:02:03,000
they discovered that someone in their ranks

35
0:02:03.337,000 --> 0:02:05,000
had been selling military secrets to Germany.

36
0:02:06.462,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So they launched a big investigation,

37
0:02:08.843,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and their suspicions quickly converged on this man,

38
0:02:12.733,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Alfred Dreyfus.

39
0:02:14.867,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He had a sterling record,

40
0:02:16.209,000 --> 0:02:19,000
no past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell.

41
0:02:20.342,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army,

42
0:02:25.484,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.

43
0:02:29.683,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They compared Dreyfus's handwriting to that on the memo

44
0:02:32.929,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and concluded that it was a match,

45
0:02:34.89,000 --> 0:02:37,000
even though outside professional handwriting experts

46
0:02:37.956,000 --> 0:02:39,000
were much less confident in the similarity,

47
0:02:40.13,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but never mind that.

48
0:02:41.544,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment,

49
0:02:43.608,000 --> 0:02:44,000
looking for any signs of espionage.

50
0:02:45.388,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They went through his files, and they didn't find anything.

51
0:02:48.372,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty,

52
0:02:51.53,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but sneaky as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence

53
0:02:54.847,000 --> 0:02:55,000
before they had managed to get to it.

54
0:02:57.212,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Next, they went and looked through his personal history

55
0:02:59.928,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for any incriminating details.

56
0:03:02.253,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They talked to his teachers,

57
0:03:03.879,000 --> 0:03:05,000
they found that he had studied foreign languages in school,

58
0:03:06.688,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments

59
0:03:10.765,000 --> 0:03:11,000
later in life.

60
0:03:11.972,000 --> 0:03:17,000
His teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory,

61
0:03:18.007,000 --> 0:03:2,000
which was highly suspicious, right?

62
0:03:20.143,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things.

63
0:03:24.439,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So the case went to trial, and Dreyfus was found guilty.

64
0:03:28.816,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Afterwards, they took him out into this public square

65
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform

66
0:03:35.908,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and broke his sword in two.

67
0:03:37.837,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This was called the Degradation of Dreyfus.

68
0:03:40.86,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And they sentenced him to life imprisonment

69
0:03:43.401,000 --> 0:03:45,000
on the aptly named Devil's Island,

70
0:03:46.165,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which is this barren rock off the coast of South America.

71
0:03:49.556,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So there he went, and there he spent his days alone,

72
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
writing letters and letters to the French government

73
0:03:55.858,000 --> 0:03:58,000
begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence.

74
0:03:59.634,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But for the most part, France considered the matter closed.

75
0:04:03.301,000 --> 0:04:07,000
One thing that's really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair

76
0:04:07.618,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is this question of why the officers were so convinced

77
0:04:11.42,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that Dreyfus was guilty.

78
0:04:13.556,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up,

79
0:04:16.427,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that they were intentionally framing him.

80
0:04:18.419,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But historians don't think that's what happened.

81
0:04:20.71,000 --> 0:04:21,000
As far as we can tell,

82
0:04:21.893,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong.

83
0:04:26.154,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Which makes you wonder:

84
0:04:28.654,000 --> 0:04:3,000
What does it say about the human mind

85
0:04:30.952,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that we can find such paltry evidence

86
0:04:33.289,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to be compelling enough to convict a man?

87
0:04:36.21,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Well, this is a case of what scientists call "motivated reasoning."

88
0:04:40.52,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations,

89
0:04:43.598,000 --> 0:04:45,000
our desires and fears,

90
0:04:45.974,000 --> 0:04:47,000
shape the way we interpret information.

91
0:04:48.344,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Some information, some ideas, feel like our allies.

92
0:04:51.778,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We want them to win. We want to defend them.

93
0:04:54.444,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And other information or ideas are the enemy,

94
0:04:56.999,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and we want to shoot them down.

95
0:04:59.408,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So this is why I call motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."

96
0:05:03.988,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Probably most of you have never persecuted

97
0:05:07.017,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a French-Jewish officer for high treason,

98
0:05:09.322,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I assume,

99
0:05:10.819,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but maybe you've followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed

100
0:05:15.702,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that when the referee judges that your team committed a foul,

101
0:05:19.848,000 --> 0:05:2,000
for example,

102
0:05:21.034,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong.

103
0:05:24.482,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But if he judges that the other team committed a foul -- awesome!

104
0:05:27.618,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That's a good call, let's not examine it too closely.

105
0:05:30.792,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Or, maybe you've read an article or a study

106
0:05:32.933,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that examined some controversial policy,

107
0:05:35.663,000 --> 0:05:36,000
like capital punishment.

108
0:05:37.735,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And, as researchers have demonstrated,

109
0:05:39.876,000 --> 0:05:4,000
if you support capital punishment

110
0:05:41.605,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and the study shows that it's not effective,

111
0:05:44.145,000 --> 0:05:47,000
then you're highly motivated to find all the reasons

112
0:05:47.415,000 --> 0:05:49,000
why the study was poorly designed.

113
0:05:49.612,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But if it shows that capital punishment works,

114
0:05:51.842,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it's a good study.

115
0:05:53.025,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And vice versa: if you don't support capital punishment, same thing.

116
0:05:56.297,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Our judgment is strongly influenced, unconsciously,

117
0:05:59.15,000 --> 0:06:01,000
by which side we want to win.

118
0:06:02.071,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And this is ubiquitous.

119
0:06:03.984,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This shapes how we think about our health, our relationships,

120
0:06:07.046,000 --> 0:06:08,000
how we decide how to vote,

121
0:06:08.966,000 --> 0:06:1,000
what we consider fair or ethical.

122
0:06:12.036,000 --> 0:06:14,000
What's most scary to me about motivated reasoning

123
0:06:14.823,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or soldier mindset,

124
0:06:15.998,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is how unconscious it is.

125
0:06:17.269,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We can think we're being objective and fair-minded

126
0:06:20.573,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man.

127
0:06:25.008,000 --> 0:06:27,000
However, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story is not over.

128
0:06:27.915,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This is Colonel Picquart.

129
0:06:29.307,000 --> 0:06:31,000
He's another high-ranking officer in the French Army,

130
0:06:31.875,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and like most people, he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.

131
0:06:34.893,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Also like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic.

132
0:06:39.342,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect:

133
0:06:43.302,000 --> 0:06:45,000
"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"

134
0:06:46.448,000 --> 0:06:48,000
What happened was, he had discovered evidence

135
0:06:48.65,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that the spying for Germany had continued,

136
0:06:51.151,000 --> 0:06:52,000
even after Dreyfus was in prison.

137
0:06:53.516,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And he had also discovered that another officer in the army

138
0:06:56.836,000 --> 0:06:58,000
had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo,

139
0:06:59.433,000 --> 0:07:01,000
much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.

140
0:07:02.382,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So he brought these discoveries to his superiors,

141
0:07:06.017,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but to his dismay, they either didn't care

142
0:07:09.718,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings,

143
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
like, "Well, all you've really shown, Picquart, is that there's another spy

144
0:07:18.727,000 --> 0:07:2,000
who learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting,

145
0:07:21.124,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left.

146
0:07:25.148,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But Dreyfus is still guilty."

147
0:07:27.854,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Eventually, Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated.

148
0:07:30.903,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But it took him 10 years,

149
0:07:32.455,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and for part of that time, he himself was in prison

150
0:07:35.01,000 --> 0:07:37,000
for the crime of disloyalty to the army.

151
0:07:38.491,000 --> 0:07:44,000
A lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story

152
0:07:44.515,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, which I agree with.

153
0:07:49.323,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But personally, for me, the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic

154
0:07:53.998,000 --> 0:07:55,000
actually makes his actions more admirable,

155
0:07:56.607,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because he had the same prejudices, the same reasons to be biased

156
0:07:59.747,000 --> 0:08:,000
as his fellow officers,

157
0:08:01.556,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that.

158
0:08:07.108,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So to me,

159
0:08:08.321,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Picquart is a poster child for what I call "scout mindset."

160
0:08:12.598,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose,

161
0:08:16.698,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but just to see what's really there

162
0:08:18.646,000 --> 0:08:2,000
as honestly and accurately as you can,

163
0:08:21.145,000 --> 0:08:24,000
even if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant.

164
0:08:25.444,000 --> 0:08:28,000
This mindset is what I'm personally passionate about.

165
0:08:28.714,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And I've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out

166
0:08:33.867,000 --> 0:08:34,000
what causes scout mindset.

167
0:08:35.874,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Why are some people, sometimes at least,

168
0:08:39.046,000 --> 0:08:42,000
able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations

169
0:08:42.858,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and just try to see the facts and the evidence

170
0:08:45.177,000 --> 0:08:46,000
as objectively as they can?

171
0:08:47.602,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And the answer is emotional.

172
0:08:51.119,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions

173
0:08:54.91,000 --> 0:08:56,000
like defensiveness or tribalism,

174
0:08:58.615,000 --> 0:08:59,000
scout mindset is, too.

175
0:09:00.005,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's just rooted in different emotions.

176
0:09:02.015,000 --> 0:09:05,000
For example, scouts are curious.

177
0:09:05.458,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They're more likely to say they feel pleasure

178
0:09:09.028,000 --> 0:09:1,000
when they learn new information

179
0:09:10.712,000 --> 0:09:12,000
or an itch to solve a puzzle.

180
0:09:13.544,000 --> 0:09:16,000
They're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something

181
0:09:16.737,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that contradicts their expectations.

182
0:09:19.206,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Scouts also have different values.

183
0:09:21.207,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They're more likely to say they think it's virtuous

184
0:09:24.303,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to test your own beliefs,

185
0:09:25.816,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind

186
0:09:29.546,000 --> 0:09:3,000
seems weak.

187
0:09:30.832,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And above all, scouts are grounded,

188
0:09:32.741,000 --> 0:09:35,000
which means their self-worth as a person

189
0:09:36.67,000 --> 0:09:41,000
isn't tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic.

190
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So they can believe that capital punishment works.

191
0:09:45.438,000 --> 0:09:47,000
If studies come out showing that it doesn't, they can say,

192
0:09:48.275,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong. Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."

193
0:09:53.954,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This cluster of traits is what researchers have found --

194
0:09:58.304,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and I've also found anecdotally --

195
0:10:00.034,000 --> 0:10:01,000
predicts good judgment.

196
0:10:02.386,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits

197
0:10:05.693,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is that they're primarily not about how smart you are

198
0:10:09.354,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or about how much you know.

199
0:10:11.376,000 --> 0:10:13,000
In fact, they don't correlate very much with IQ at all.

200
0:10:14.638,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They're about how you feel.

201
0:10:16.849,000 --> 0:10:2,000
There's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.

202
0:10:20.896,000 --> 0:10:21,000
He's the author of "The Little Prince."

203
0:10:22.861,000 --> 0:10:24,000
He said, "If you want to build a ship,

204
0:10:26.234,000 --> 0:10:3,000
don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders

205
0:10:30.879,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and distribute the work.

206
0:10:32.669,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."

207
0:10:38.252,000 --> 0:10:4,000
In other words, I claim,

208
0:10:40.85,000 --> 0:10:43,000
if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals

209
0:10:44.034,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and as societies,

210
0:10:45.501,000 --> 0:10:48,000
what we need most is not more instruction in logic

211
0:10:49.034,000 --> 0:10:52,000
or rhetoric or probability or economics,

212
0:10:52.606,000 --> 0:10:54,000
even though those things are quite valuable.

213
0:10:54.713,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But what we most need to use those principles well

214
0:10:58.041,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is scout mindset.

215
0:10:59.483,000 --> 0:11:,000
We need to change the way we feel.

216
0:11:01.759,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed

217
0:11:05.593,000 --> 0:11:07,000
when we notice we might have been wrong about something.

218
0:11:08.255,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive

219
0:11:11.407,000 --> 0:11:15,000
when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs.

220
0:11:16.555,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So the question I want to leave you with is:

221
0:11:19.817,000 --> 0:11:21,000
What do you most yearn for?

222
0:11:22.771,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?

223
0:11:26.128,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can?

224
0:11:30.352,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Thank you.

225
0:11:31.527,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

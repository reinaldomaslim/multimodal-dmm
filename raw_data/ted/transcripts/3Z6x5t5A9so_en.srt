0:00:18.463,000 --> 0:00:21,000
One year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem

3
0:00:21.482,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to go find a man I'd never met

4
0:00:23.674,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but who had changed my life.

5
0:00:25.81,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming.

6
0:00:28.555,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I didn't have an exact address,

7
0:00:31.056,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but I knew his name, Abed,

8
0:00:33.671,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara,

9
0:00:38.323,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city,

10
0:00:43.134,000 --> 0:00:45,000
he broke my neck.

11
0:00:45.355,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And so, on an overcast morning in January, I headed north

12
0:00:49.619,000 --> 0:00:53,000
off in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace.

13
0:00:54.325,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The road dropped and I exited Jerusalem.

14
0:00:57.197,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck,

15
0:00:59.837,000 --> 0:01:01,000
heavy with four tons of floor tiles,

16
0:01:02.163,000 --> 0:01:04,000
had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner

17
0:01:04.981,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of the minibus where I sat.

18
0:01:08.119,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I was then 19 years old.

19
0:01:10.773,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I'd grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups

20
0:01:14.1,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in eight months, and the night before the crash,

21
0:01:17.044,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I delighted in my new body,

22
0:01:19.21,000 --> 0:01:21,000
playing basketball with friends

23
0:01:21.351,000 --> 0:01:23,000
into the wee hours of a May morning.

24
0:01:23.457,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I palmed the ball in my large right hand,

25
0:01:26.152,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and when that hand reached the rim, I felt invincible.

26
0:01:30.497,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court.

27
0:01:34.343,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I didn't see Abed coming.

28
0:01:36.891,000 --> 0:01:38,000
From my seat, I was looking up at a stone town

29
0:01:39.263,000 --> 0:01:41,000
on a hilltop, bright in the noontime sun,

30
0:01:42.249,000 --> 0:01:44,000
when from behind there was a great bang,

31
0:01:44.725,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as loud and violent as a bomb.

32
0:01:47.642,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My head snapped back over my red seat.

33
0:01:50.118,000 --> 0:01:53,000
My eardrum blew. My shoes flew off.

34
0:01:53.204,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones,

35
0:01:56.458,000 --> 0:02:,000
and when I landed, I was a quadriplegic.

36
0:02:00.674,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Over the coming months, I learned to breathe on my own,

37
0:02:03.095,000 --> 0:02:06,000
then to sit and to stand and to walk,

38
0:02:06.1,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but my body was now divided vertically.

39
0:02:08.568,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I was a hemiplegic, and back home in New York,

40
0:02:12.029,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I used a wheelchair for four years, all through college.

41
0:02:16.664,000 --> 0:02:19,000
College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year.

42
0:02:20.142,000 --> 0:02:22,000
There I rose from my chair for good,

43
0:02:23.02,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I leaned on my cane, and I looked back,

44
0:02:25.979,000 --> 0:02:27,000
finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus

45
0:02:28.96,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to photographs of the crash,

46
0:02:31.751,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and when I saw this photograph,

47
0:02:36.208,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body.

48
0:02:39.569,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid,

49
0:02:43.316,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and I mourned that it was lost,

50
0:02:45.632,000 --> 0:02:47,000
mourned all I had not yet done,

51
0:02:48.018,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but was now impossible.

52
0:02:55.897,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave

53
0:02:58.274,000 --> 0:03:,000
the morning after the crash,

54
0:03:00.49,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem.

55
0:03:04.372,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Reading his words, I welled with anger.

56
0:03:07.327,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man,

57
0:03:10.827,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and it came from magical thinking.

58
0:03:13.65,000 --> 0:03:15,000
On this xeroxed piece of paper,

59
0:03:15.773,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the crash had not yet happened.

60
0:03:19.326,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Abed could still turn his wheel left

61
0:03:21.415,000 --> 0:03:24,000
so that I would see him whoosh by out my window

62
0:03:24.799,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and I would remain whole.

63
0:03:27.241,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"Be careful, Abed, look out. Slow down."

64
0:03:31.099,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But Abed did not slow,

65
0:03:33.412,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and on that xeroxed piece of paper, my neck again broke,

66
0:03:37.22,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and again, I was left without anger.

67
0:03:41.223,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I decided to find Abed,

68
0:03:43.623,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and when I finally did,

69
0:03:45.363,000 --> 0:03:48,000
he responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance,

70
0:03:48.916,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call.

71
0:03:51.091,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And maybe he had.

72
0:03:53.465,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record --

73
0:03:56.638,000 --> 0:03:59,000
27 violations by the age of 25,

74
0:04:00.419,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the last, his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day —

75
0:04:05.11,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and I didn't mention my prior record --

76
0:04:07.203,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the quadriplegia and the catheters,

77
0:04:08.911,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the insecurity and the loss —

78
0:04:11.432,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash,

79
0:04:14.124,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I didn't say that I knew from the police report

80
0:04:16.484,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that he'd escaped serious injury.

81
0:04:19.187,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I said I wanted to meet.

82
0:04:22.92,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Abed said that I should call back in a few weeks,

83
0:04:25.563,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and when I did, and a recording told me

84
0:04:28.139,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that his number was disconnected,

85
0:04:30.412,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I let Abed and the crash go.

86
0:04:35.388,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Many years passed.

87
0:04:37.618,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack

88
0:04:41.887,000 --> 0:04:43,000
on trips in six continents.

89
0:04:44.557,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I pitched overhand in a weekly softball game

90
0:04:47.996,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that I started in Central Park,

91
0:04:50.224,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and home in New York, I became a journalist and an author,

92
0:04:53.137,000 --> 0:04:57,000
typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger.

93
0:04:57.223,000 --> 0:04:59,000
A friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories

94
0:04:59.73,000 --> 0:05:01,000
mirrored my own, each centering on a life

95
0:05:02.622,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that had changed in an instant,

96
0:05:04.982,000 --> 0:05:06,000
owing, if not to a crash, then to an inheritance,

97
0:05:07.803,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a swing of the bat, a click of the shutter, an arrest.

98
0:05:10.436,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Each of us had a before and an after.

99
0:05:14.41,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I'd been working through my lot after all.

100
0:05:17.513,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Still, Abed was far from my mind, when last year,

101
0:05:21.686,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I returned to Israel to write of the crash,

102
0:05:24.476,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and the book I then wrote, "Half-Life,"

103
0:05:27.108,000 --> 0:05:29,000
was nearly complete when I recognized

104
0:05:30.056,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that I still wanted to meet Abed,

105
0:05:32.493,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and finally I understood why:

106
0:05:35.4,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to hear this man say two words: "I'm sorry."

107
0:05:40.729,000 --> 0:05:42,000
People apologize for less.

108
0:05:43.647,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived

109
0:05:46.459,000 --> 0:05:48,000
somewhere in his same town,

110
0:05:48.676,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat,

111
0:05:51.748,000 --> 0:05:54,000
when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.

112
0:05:55.741,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck?

113
0:05:59.123,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

114
0:06:03.205,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh,

115
0:06:05.351,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and bought a brick of Turkish delight:

116
0:06:07.41,000 --> 0:06:11,000
pistachios glued in rosewater. Better.

117
0:06:11.599,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Back on Highway 1, I envisioned what awaited.

118
0:06:15.012,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me.

119
0:06:19.194,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Abed would say, "I'm sorry."

120
0:06:23.391,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I then began to wonder, as I had many times before,

121
0:06:26.417,000 --> 0:06:27,000
how my life would have been different

122
0:06:27.655,000 --> 0:06:28,000
had this man not injured me,

123
0:06:29.061,000 --> 0:06:32,000
had my genes been fed a different helping of experience.

124
0:06:32.942,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Who was I?

125
0:06:35.155,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Was I who I had been before the crash,

126
0:06:37.972,000 --> 0:06:41,000
before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book?

127
0:06:42.033,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Was I what had been done to me?

128
0:06:44.322,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Were all of us the results of things done to us, done for us,

129
0:06:48.715,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the infidelity of a parent or spouse,

130
0:06:51.055,000 --> 0:06:53,000
money inherited?

131
0:06:53.242,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Were we instead our bodies, their inborn endowments and deficits?

132
0:06:57.38,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience,

133
0:07:00.345,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but how to tease out the one from the other?

134
0:07:03.835,000 --> 0:07:05,000
As Yeats put that same universal question,

135
0:07:06.677,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"O body swayed to music, o brightening glance,

136
0:07:09.871,000 --> 0:07:15,000
how can we know the dancer from the dance?"

137
0:07:16.186,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I'd been driving for an hour

138
0:07:18.445,000 --> 0:07:21,000
when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance.

139
0:07:22.172,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue.

140
0:07:25.981,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me

141
0:07:28.539,000 --> 0:07:31,000
as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake,

142
0:07:31.749,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that had propelled me as a teen

143
0:07:33.389,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane.

144
0:07:37.81,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But I also saw in my reflection

145
0:07:40.4,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that, had Abed not injured me,

146
0:07:42.247,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor

147
0:07:45.234,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and a husband and a father.

148
0:07:48.757,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I would be less mindful of time and of death,

149
0:07:51.235,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and, oh, I would not be disabled,

150
0:07:53.056,000 --> 0:07:56,000
would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune.

151
0:07:56.564,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth

152
0:07:59.219,000 --> 0:08:01,000
come from biting at all the many things

153
0:08:01.565,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a solitary hand cannot open.

154
0:08:04.346,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined.

155
0:08:09.785,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It was approaching 11 when I exited right

156
0:08:11.911,000 --> 0:08:13,000
toward Afula, and passed a large quarry

157
0:08:14.07,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and was soon in Kfar Kara.

158
0:08:16.523,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I felt a pang of nerves.

159
0:08:18.986,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas,

160
0:08:22.789,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and I pulled into a lot by a gas station

161
0:08:25.019,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to listen and to calm.

162
0:08:28.36,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I'd been told that in an Arab town,

163
0:08:30.592,000 --> 0:08:32,000
one need only mention the name of a local

164
0:08:32.797,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and it will be recognized.

165
0:08:35.077,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And I was mentioning Abed and myself,

166
0:08:37.087,000 --> 0:08:39,000
noting deliberately that I was here in peace,

167
0:08:39.445,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to the people in this town,

168
0:08:41.581,000 --> 0:08:44,000
when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon.

169
0:08:44.864,000 --> 0:08:46,000
He listened to me.

170
0:08:47.306,000 --> 0:08:49,000
You know, it was most often when speaking to people

171
0:08:50.13,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that I wondered where I ended and my disability began,

172
0:08:54.07,000 --> 0:08:56,000
for many people told me what they told no one else.

173
0:08:56.948,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Many cried.

174
0:08:59.254,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same

175
0:09:01.898,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and I later asked her why,

176
0:09:03.794,000 --> 0:09:04,000
she told me that, best she could tell, her tears

177
0:09:05.768,000 --> 0:09:08,000
had had something to do with my being happy and strong,

178
0:09:09.044,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but vulnerable too.

179
0:09:11.731,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I listened to her words. I suppose they were true.

180
0:09:14.014,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I was me,

181
0:09:16.276,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but I was now me despite a limp,

182
0:09:18.43,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and that, I suppose, was what now made me, me.

183
0:09:22.592,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Anyway, Mohamed told me

184
0:09:24.394,000 --> 0:09:26,000
what perhaps he would not have told another stranger.

185
0:09:27.175,000 --> 0:09:31,000
He led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off.

186
0:09:31.286,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And as I sat contemplating what to say,

187
0:09:33.984,000 --> 0:09:36,000
a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe.

188
0:09:37.418,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I stepped from my car and said "Shalom,"

189
0:09:39.798,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and identified myself,

190
0:09:41.835,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and she told me that her husband Abed

191
0:09:43.264,000 --> 0:09:45,000
would be home from work in four hours.

192
0:09:46.116,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Her Hebrew was not good, and she later confessed

193
0:09:48.632,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that she thought that I had come to install the Internet.

194
0:09:51.772,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:55.496,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I drove off and returned at 4:30,

196
0:09:58.521,000 --> 0:09:59,000
thankful to the minaret up the road

197
0:09:59.797,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that helped me find my way back.

198
0:10:02.331,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And as I approached the front door,

199
0:10:04.428,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Abed saw me, my jeans and flannel and cane,

200
0:10:07.853,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and I saw Abed, an average-looking man of average size.

201
0:10:12.639,000 --> 0:10:15,000
He wore black and white: slippers over socks,

202
0:10:15.662,000 --> 0:10:17,000
pilling sweatpants, a piebald sweater,

203
0:10:17.761,000 --> 0:10:2,000
a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead.

204
0:10:21.073,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.

205
0:10:23.57,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And so at once, we shook hands, and smiled,

206
0:10:27.853,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and I gave him my gift,

207
0:10:29.94,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and he told me I was a guest in his home,

208
0:10:31.331,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch.

209
0:10:34.744,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It was then that Abed resumed at once

210
0:10:37.505,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the tale of woe he had begun over the phone

211
0:10:39.361,000 --> 0:10:41,000
16 years before.

212
0:10:42.325,000 --> 0:10:45,000
He'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said.

213
0:10:45.63,000 --> 0:10:47,000
He had problems with his side and his legs too,

214
0:10:47.827,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and, oh, he'd lost his teeth in the crash.

215
0:10:50.369,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Did I wish to see him remove them?

216
0:10:53.34,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Abed then rose and turned on the TV

217
0:10:55.87,000 --> 0:10:57,000
so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room,

218
0:10:58.728,000 --> 0:11:,000
and returned with polaroids of the crash

219
0:11:00.967,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and his old driver's license.

220
0:11:03.577,000 --> 0:11:06,000
"I was handsome," he said.

221
0:11:07.384,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We looked down at his laminated mug.

222
0:11:09.562,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Abed had been less handsome than substantial,

223
0:11:12.318,000 --> 0:11:15,000
with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck.

224
0:11:16.11,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It was this youth who on May 16, 1990,

225
0:11:19.047,000 --> 0:11:21,000
had broken two necks including mine,

226
0:11:21.196,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and bruised one brain and taken one life.

227
0:11:25.144,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Twenty-one years later, he was now thinner than his wife,

228
0:11:27.743,000 --> 0:11:28,000
his skin slack on his face,

229
0:11:29.492,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and looking at Abed looking at his young self,

230
0:11:32.223,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self

231
0:11:34.606,000 --> 0:11:38,000
after the crash, and recognized his longing.

232
0:11:38.932,000 --> 0:11:42,000
"The crash changed both of our lives," I said.

233
0:11:43.049,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck,

234
0:11:45.777,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver

235
0:11:48.365,000 --> 0:11:51,000
in the left lane who did not let him pass.

236
0:11:51.538,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I did not want to recap the crash with Abed.

237
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I'd hoped for something simpler:

238
0:11:56.029,000 --> 0:12:,000
to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.

239
0:12:00.834,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony

240
0:12:03.423,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the morning after the crash,

241
0:12:05.469,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Abed did not even mention the bus driver.

242
0:12:07.854,000 --> 0:12:1,000
No, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth.

243
0:12:11.218,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I had come for remorse.

244
0:12:14.226,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And so I now went looking for remorse

245
0:12:16.382,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and threw truth under the bus.

246
0:12:18.667,000 --> 0:12:21,000
"I understand," I said, "that the crash was not your fault,

247
0:12:21.793,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but does it make you sad that others suffered?"

248
0:12:26.182,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Abed spoke three quick words.

249
0:12:28.577,000 --> 0:12:31,000
"Yes, I suffered."

250
0:12:32.369,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Abed then told me why he'd suffered.

251
0:12:35.305,000 --> 0:12:38,000
He'd lived an unholy life before the crash,

252
0:12:38.444,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and so God had ordained the crash,

253
0:12:40.773,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased.

254
0:12:44.596,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It was then that God intervened:

255
0:12:47.737,000 --> 0:12:49,000
news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before

256
0:12:50.511,000 --> 0:12:52,000
had killed three people up north.

257
0:12:53.283,000 --> 0:12:55,000
We looked up at the wreckage.

258
0:12:55.656,000 --> 0:12:58,000
"Strange," I said.

259
0:12:58.677,000 --> 0:13:,000
"Strange," he agreed.

260
0:13:01.462,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I had the thought that there, on Route 804,

261
0:13:04.157,000 --> 0:13:06,000
there were perpetrators and victims,

262
0:13:06.287,000 --> 0:13:07,000
dyads bound by a crash.

263
0:13:08.023,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Some, as had Abed, would forget the date.

264
0:13:10.484,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Some, as had I, would remember.

265
0:13:13.694,000 --> 0:13:16,000
The report finished and Abed spoke.

266
0:13:16.819,000 --> 0:13:18,000
"It is a pity," he said, "that the police

267
0:13:19.192,000 --> 0:13:23,000
in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers."

268
0:13:24.086,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I was baffled.

269
0:13:27.114,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Abed had said something remarkable.

270
0:13:29.893,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash?

271
0:13:33.359,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Was it evidence of guilt, an assertion

272
0:13:35.261,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that he should have been put away longer?

273
0:13:37.644,000 --> 0:13:4,000
He'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade.

274
0:13:41.256,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I forgot my discretion.

275
0:13:43.282,000 --> 0:13:46,000
"Um, Abed," I said,

276
0:13:46.726,000 --> 0:13:5,000
"I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash."

277
0:13:50.957,000 --> 0:13:53,000
"Well," he said, "I once went 60 in a 40."

278
0:13:54.918,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And so 27 violations --

279
0:13:58.319,000 --> 0:14:,000
driving through a red light, driving at excessive speed,

280
0:14:01.024,000 --> 0:14:02,000
driving on the wrong side of a barrier,

281
0:14:03.006,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and finally, riding his brakes down that hill --

282
0:14:05.046,000 --> 0:14:07,000
reduced to one.

283
0:14:07.504,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality,

284
0:14:10.991,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable.

285
0:14:14.106,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim.

286
0:14:18.023,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize.

287
0:14:24.727,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Abed and I sat with our coffee.

288
0:14:28.023,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We'd spent 90 minutes together,

289
0:14:30.815,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and he was now known to me.

290
0:14:33.177,000 --> 0:14:35,000
He was not a particularly bad man

291
0:14:35.545,000 --> 0:14:37,000
or a particularly good man.

292
0:14:37.878,000 --> 0:14:39,000
He was a limited man

293
0:14:40.036,000 --> 0:14:43,000
who'd found it within himself to be kind to me.

294
0:14:43.066,000 --> 0:14:44,000
With a nod to Jewish custom,

295
0:14:44.576,000 --> 0:14:47,000
he told me that I should live to be 120 years old.

296
0:14:48.523,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But it was hard for me to relate to one who had

297
0:14:50.344,000 --> 0:14:53,000
so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing,

298
0:14:53.642,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to one whose life was so unexamined that he said

299
0:14:58.006,000 --> 0:15:02,000
he thought two people had died in the crash.

300
0:15:05.012,000 --> 0:15:08,000
There was much I wished to say to Abed.

301
0:15:08.636,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability,

302
0:15:12.341,000 --> 0:15:14,000
it would be okay,

303
0:15:14.516,000 --> 0:15:15,000
for people are wrong to marvel

304
0:15:16.314,000 --> 0:15:19,000
at those like me who smile as we limp.

305
0:15:19.556,000 --> 0:15:22,000
People don't know that they have lived through worse,

306
0:15:23.492,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck,

307
0:15:27.154,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that problems of the mind are greater still,

308
0:15:29.505,000 --> 0:15:33,000
more injurious, than a hundred broken necks.

309
0:15:33.681,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are

310
0:15:36.531,000 --> 0:15:37,000
most of all

311
0:15:38.032,000 --> 0:15:4,000
is not our minds and not our bodies

312
0:15:40.465,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and not what happens to us,

313
0:15:42.273,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but how we respond to what happens to us.

314
0:15:45.135,000 --> 0:15:47,000
"This," wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl,

315
0:15:47.713,000 --> 0:15:48,000
"is the last of the human freedoms:

316
0:15:49.53,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."

317
0:15:54.43,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers

318
0:15:57.254,000 --> 0:16:,000
and paralyzees must evolve, reconcile to reality,

319
0:16:01.125,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but we all must --

320
0:16:03.102,000 --> 0:16:07,000
the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding

321
0:16:07.988,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and the bankrupt and everyone.

322
0:16:11.833,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I wished to tell him that one does not have to say

323
0:16:14.438,000 --> 0:16:16,000
that a bad thing is good,

324
0:16:16.454,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that a crash is from God and so a crash is good,

325
0:16:19.002,000 --> 0:16:2,000
a broken neck is good.

326
0:16:20.693,000 --> 0:16:23,000
One can say that a bad thing sucks,

327
0:16:23.953,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but that this natural world still has many glories.

328
0:16:28.075,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear:

329
0:16:33.101,000 --> 0:16:36,000
We have to rise above bad fortune.

330
0:16:36.328,000 --> 0:16:39,000
We have to be in the good and enjoy the good,

331
0:16:39.354,000 --> 0:16:44,000
study and work and adventure and friendship -- oh, friendship --

332
0:16:45.238,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and community and love.

333
0:16:49.007,000 --> 0:16:51,000
But most of all, I wished to tell him

334
0:16:51.766,000 --> 0:16:53,000
what Herman Melville wrote,

335
0:16:54.135,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that "truly to enjoy bodily warmth,

336
0:16:57.062,000 --> 0:17:,000
some small part of you must be cold,

337
0:17:00.119,000 --> 0:17:02,000
for there is no quality in this world

338
0:17:02.422,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that is not what it is merely by contrast."

339
0:17:05.714,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Yes, contrast.

340
0:17:08.155,000 --> 0:17:1,000
If you are mindful of what you do not have,

341
0:17:10.494,000 --> 0:17:13,000
you may be truly mindful of what you do have,

342
0:17:13.722,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and if the gods are kind, you may truly enjoy what you have.

343
0:17:17.616,000 --> 0:17:19,000
That is the one singular gift you may receive

344
0:17:20.045,000 --> 0:17:22,000
if you suffer in any existential way.

345
0:17:23.016,000 --> 0:17:25,000
You know death, and so may wake each morning

346
0:17:25.345,000 --> 0:17:27,000
pulsing with ready life.

347
0:17:27.375,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Some part of you is cold,

348
0:17:28.97,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm,

349
0:17:32.469,000 --> 0:17:34,000
or even to be cold.

350
0:17:35.391,000 --> 0:17:37,000
When one morning, years after the crash,

351
0:17:37.415,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot

352
0:17:40.198,000 --> 0:17:43,000
felt the flash of cold, nerves at last awake,

353
0:17:43.661,000 --> 0:17:48,000
it was exhilarating, a gust of snow.

354
0:17:48.948,000 --> 0:17:51,000
But I didn't say these things to Abed.

355
0:17:52.184,000 --> 0:17:56,000
I told him only that he had killed one man, not two.

356
0:17:56.985,000 --> 0:18:,000
I told him the name of that man.

357
0:18:01.459,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And then I said, "Goodbye."

358
0:18:05.272,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Thank you.

359
0:18:07.189,000 --> 0:18:13,000
(Applause)

360
0:18:13.924,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Thanks a lot.

361
0:18:16.66,000 --> 0:18:2,000
(Applause)

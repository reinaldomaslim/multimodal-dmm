1
0:00:13.15,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Menstruation.

2
0:00:14.921,000 --> 0:00:17,000
A simple word describing a natural biological process,

3
0:00:18.902,000 --> 0:00:2,000
weighed down by centuries of stigma,

4
0:00:21.312,000 --> 0:00:24,000
has been transformed into something most of us can only speak about

5
0:00:25.132,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in whispers.

6
0:00:26.568,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But why?

7
0:00:27.751,000 --> 0:00:28,000
As I speak to you right now,

8
0:00:29.392,000 --> 0:00:32,000
more than 800 million women around the world

9
0:00:32.468,000 --> 0:00:33,000
are having a period.

10
0:00:34.231,000 --> 0:00:35,000
None of us would exist without it,

11
0:00:36.252,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and yet it remains an "embarrassing" subject to broach.

12
0:00:40.639,000 --> 0:00:42,000
From my experience and that of the women around me,

13
0:00:43.622,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I can tell you that it's exhausting.

14
0:00:46.193,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad,

15
0:00:50.443,000 --> 0:00:52,000
stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class

16
0:00:53.024,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible.

17
0:00:57.157,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings

18
0:00:59.863,000 --> 0:01:01,000
pretending to be absolutely normal,

19
0:01:02.348,000 --> 0:01:05,000
while internally crying out from intense period cramps.

20
0:01:06.651,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's exhausting to be dismissively told that you’re PMSing

21
0:01:09.993,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or suffering from "that time of the month,"

22
0:01:12.382,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and it's exhausting to continuously fight back against age-old traditions

23
0:01:17.145,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that ask you not to pray,

24
0:01:18.53,000 --> 0:01:22,000
visit temples, cook, touch pickle and the list goes on and on,

25
0:01:22.855,000 --> 0:01:25,000
while you're just trying to bleed and be left in peace.

26
0:01:25.932,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:29.808,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But you know what the worst part is?

28
0:01:32.2,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The worst part is that the things that seem tiring to us

29
0:01:36.12,000 --> 0:01:38,000
are merely the tip of the iceberg,

30
0:01:39.007,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because we in this room are privileged enough

31
0:01:41.652,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to be able to afford sanitary napkins every month,

32
0:01:45.056,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to be able to visit a gynecologist in case of any problem,

33
0:01:48.541,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to be able to tell what's normal and abnormal with our monthly cycle.

34
0:01:52.613,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We have access to water, sanitation and toilets

35
0:01:55.861,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that help us maintain our privacy and hygiene.

36
0:01:59.774,000 --> 0:02:,000
But what about those who don't?

37
0:02:02.117,000 --> 0:02:06,000
What about 335 million girls around the world

38
0:02:06.616,000 --> 0:02:09,000
who go to school without even having access to water and soap

39
0:02:10.224,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to wash their hands?

40
0:02:12.184,000 --> 0:02:15,000
What about 15-year-old schoolgirls in Kenya

41
0:02:15.534,000 --> 0:02:19,000
who have to sell their bodies to be able to buy sanitary napkins?

42
0:02:20.688,000 --> 0:02:24,000
What about two-thirds of rural high school girls in India

43
0:02:24.723,000 --> 0:02:26,000
who don't even understand what their bodies are going through

44
0:02:27.679,000 --> 0:02:28,000
at menarche?

45
0:02:29.411,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And right now, we are all gathered here in the USA.

46
0:02:33.183,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So what about 64 percent of women in St. Louis, Missouri,

47
0:02:37.637,000 --> 0:02:39,000
who weren't able to afford menstrual hygiene supplies

48
0:02:40.652,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in the previous year?

49
0:02:42.907,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What about the struggles of homeless, transgender,

50
0:02:45.774,000 --> 0:02:47,000
intersex and displaced people

51
0:02:48.016,000 --> 0:02:49,000
who menstruate?

52
0:02:49.873,000 --> 0:02:5,000
What about them?

53
0:02:52.802,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The scale of the problem,

54
0:02:54.352,000 --> 0:02:58,000
stemming in part from the deep-rooted stigma attached to menstruation,

55
0:02:58.731,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is unimaginable.

56
0:03:01.339,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And the desire to voice this frustration

57
0:03:03.771,000 --> 0:03:05,000
led me, along with three other teammates,

58
0:03:06.261,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to initiate a campaign that calls for change,

59
0:03:09.384,000 --> 0:03:11,000
questions the taboos surrounding menstruation

60
0:03:12.295,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and spreads period positivity.

61
0:03:15.469,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The name of our campaign, "Pravahkriti,"

62
0:03:18.521,000 --> 0:03:21,000
was born from the message that we want to convey to the world.

63
0:03:22.277,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"Pravah" means "flow,"

64
0:03:24.105,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and "kriti" means "a beautiful creation."

65
0:03:27.278,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Because how could the monthly cycle that ultimately gives rise to all creation

66
0:03:32.074,000 --> 0:03:34,000
be anything less than beautiful?

67
0:03:35.941,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now, as a social issue, menstruation has several facets to it

68
0:03:40.293,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that overlap, reinforce and worsen the situation.

69
0:03:44.173,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So we based our campaign on four fundamental pillars:

70
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
health, hygiene, awareness and spreading positivity.

71
0:03:51.899,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But how did we actually implement this?

72
0:03:55.076,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Well, we started within the walls of our school classroom.

73
0:03:58.803,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Instead of simply explaining menstruation to children

74
0:04:01.833,000 --> 0:04:03,000
from a textbook or biological standpoint,

75
0:04:04.655,000 --> 0:04:06,000
we adopted an innovative approach.

76
0:04:07.855,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We conducted an activity where students strung together a bracelet

77
0:04:12.151,000 --> 0:04:17,000
consisting of 28 beads signifying the length of the menstrual cycle,

78
0:04:17.312,000 --> 0:04:2,000
out of which four to seven beads were of a different color,

79
0:04:20.476,000 --> 0:04:22,000
demonstrating the days a woman bleeds.

80
0:04:23.24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And in this way, we not only explained what periods are

81
0:04:27.393,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in a manner that was educational

82
0:04:29.058,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but also approachable and engaging.

83
0:04:32.683,000 --> 0:04:33,000
To offer another example,

84
0:04:34.063,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we explored various ways of alleviating cramps,

85
0:04:37.307,000 --> 0:04:4,000
including preparing some natural remedies in school itself.

86
0:04:41.421,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And we didn't just stop at involving girls in our campaign.

87
0:04:44.861,000 --> 0:04:46,000
In fact, boys were equally involved,

88
0:04:47.037,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and one of our co-team members,

89
0:04:48.562,000 --> 0:04:49,000
as you saw,

90
0:04:50.663,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is also a boy.

91
0:04:52.894,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Through internal conversations

92
0:04:54.552,000 --> 0:04:57,000
where girls could freely share their personal experiences

93
0:04:57.827,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and boys could just ask questions, no matter how "dumb" they might seem,

94
0:05:02.12,000 --> 0:05:05,000
our male volunteers quickly got over their awkwardness,

95
0:05:05.302,000 --> 0:05:08,000
not just supporting but also leading educational sessions.

96
0:05:09.511,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Clearly, starting an inclusive conversation,

97
0:05:12.301,000 --> 0:05:14,000
including members of all genders

98
0:05:14.333,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and listening to and supporting each other,

99
0:05:16.661,000 --> 0:05:17,000
can go a long way.

100
0:05:19.231,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, to make our campaign successful, we conducted extensive research,

101
0:05:23.225,000 --> 0:05:24,000
interviewed gynecologists,

102
0:05:25.001,000 --> 0:05:28,000
surveyed people to gauge public opinion on periods

103
0:05:28.062,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and conducted a panel discussion with professionals working in this field.

104
0:05:32.631,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And then we undertook the journey to create change.

105
0:05:35.982,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We organized a stall at Shilpotsav, a local fair,

106
0:05:39.416,000 --> 0:05:42,000
where we distributed sanitary napkin-shaped envelopes

107
0:05:42.466,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and bookmarks containing period-positive messages.

108
0:05:45.865,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We donated hundreds of pads that we had collected

109
0:05:48.657,000 --> 0:05:5,000
through a pad donation drive at school.

110
0:05:50.858,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Interacting with young girls in government and charitable schools,

111
0:05:54.537,000 --> 0:05:56,000
we explained periods to them through a game of hopscotch

112
0:05:57.515,000 --> 0:06:,000
and distributed period kits that we had made ourselves

113
0:06:00.726,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that consisted of a pad and other items like a paper soap

114
0:06:04.312,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and sanitizer for maintaining hygiene,

115
0:06:06.78,000 --> 0:06:08,000
a piece of dark chocolate just to lift their mood,

116
0:06:09.748,000 --> 0:06:11,000
a sachet of ginger tea and so on.

117
0:06:12.288,000 --> 0:06:16,000
In whatever we did, we strived to think beyond the norm and break barriers,

118
0:06:16.973,000 --> 0:06:18,000
be it by creating a physical period tracker

119
0:06:19.318,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to help girls without access to the internet

120
0:06:21.773,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to record their monthly cycle,

121
0:06:24.152,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or sensitizing the masses by performing street plays,

122
0:06:28.585,000 --> 0:06:31,000
or even developing a video game called "Crimson Crusade" --

123
0:06:31.944,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:32.981,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that introduces both boys and girls

125
0:06:34.732,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to problems faced by menstruating women globally

126
0:06:37.246,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and players progress in the game

127
0:06:39.232,000 --> 0:06:41,000
by defeating menstrual monsters.

128
0:06:41.556,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:45.014,000 --> 0:06:46,000
To sustain this effort,

130
0:06:46.467,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we've installed 10 sanitary napkin dispensers in several schools.

131
0:06:51.127,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Gradually, people's mindsets are changing.

132
0:06:55.267,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But does change come so easily?

133
0:06:58.932,000 --> 0:06:59,000
At a school for the underprivileged,

134
0:07:00.674,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we encountered a girl who had just got her first period

135
0:07:03.476,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but wasn't wearing anything to absorb the flow.

136
0:07:06.731,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Imagine being her,

137
0:07:08.77,000 --> 0:07:11,000
sitting in class feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable,

138
0:07:12.038,000 --> 0:07:14,000
looking down and seeing red,

139
0:07:14.424,000 --> 0:07:17,000
asking your parents for help, asking what was going on with you

140
0:07:17.655,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and being dismissed.

141
0:07:20.188,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Imagine the shame, fear and embarrassment for being "caught" doing something wrong

142
0:07:26.724,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that forces you into living in ignorance and silence

143
0:07:30.451,000 --> 0:07:32,000
at the cost of your health and dignity.

144
0:07:33.78,000 --> 0:07:36,000
While we do our part, our endeavors will only be successful

145
0:07:37.301,000 --> 0:07:4,000
if each one of you internalizes and spreads onward

146
0:07:40.806,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the idea that menstruation is completely normal,

147
0:07:44.156,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if each one of you conveys this message to every person you know.

148
0:07:48.973,000 --> 0:07:52,000
When we can discuss digestion, blood circulation and respiration --

149
0:07:53.875,000 --> 0:07:56,000
all natural, biological processes --

150
0:07:57.127,000 --> 0:07:59,000
why should menstruation be off-limits?

151
0:08:00.095,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And you, too, can help make it less taboo,

152
0:08:02.54,000 --> 0:08:06,000
simply by being more open with male friends and family members,

153
0:08:07.003,000 --> 0:08:09,000
supporting local and international organizations

154
0:08:09.919,000 --> 0:08:12,000
working to improve menstrual hygiene management,

155
0:08:13.239,000 --> 0:08:16,000
making menstrual bracelets with middle school kids in your area

156
0:08:16.814,000 --> 0:08:18,000
or even by playing Crimson Crusade with your friends.

157
0:08:20.441,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Every small steps counts, because brushing this topic under the carpet

158
0:08:24.944,000 --> 0:08:27,000
perpetuates lack of access to sanitary absorbents,

159
0:08:28.305,000 --> 0:08:3,000
ignorance of menstrual health issues,

160
0:08:30.942,000 --> 0:08:33,000
school absenteeism, infection and so much more.

161
0:08:35.851,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I'd like to end with a few lines a volunteer wrote for us:

162
0:08:39.826,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"Let the crimson tide turn.

163
0:08:41.828,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Let there be waves of positivity,

164
0:08:43.975,000 --> 0:08:44,000
thundering applause,

165
0:08:45.517,000 --> 0:08:48,000
villages full of women who bleed with pride.

166
0:08:48.953,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Let there be a scent of education

167
0:08:51.227,000 --> 0:08:55,000
drifting through the oxygen inhaled by men, women and children.

168
0:08:56.117,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Let all know the marvels of menstruation

169
0:08:59.352,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and celebrate Pravahkriti."

170
0:09:02.194,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Thank you.

171
0:09:03.373,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.926,000 --> 0:00:18,000
One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary

3
0:00:19.531,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is "snollygoster,"

4
0:00:21.398,000 --> 0:00:22,000
just because it sounds so good.

5
0:00:23.068,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And what snollygoster means is "a dishonest politician."

6
0:00:27.376,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor

7
0:00:29.93,000 --> 0:00:31,000
who defined it rather better when he said,

8
0:00:31.987,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office

9
0:00:34.527,000 --> 0:00:37,000
regardless of party, platform or principle,

10
0:00:38.134,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and who, when he wins,

11
0:00:39.666,000 --> 0:00:44,000
gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy."

12
0:00:44.914,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:46.467,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now, I have no idea what "talknophical" is.

14
0:00:48.589,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Something to do with words, I assume.

15
0:00:50.415,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics,

16
0:00:53.714,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and all politicians know they have to try and control language.

17
0:00:56.943,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It wasn't until, for example, 1771

18
0:00:59.995,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report

19
0:01:04.442,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the exact words that were said in the debating chamber.

20
0:01:07.714,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And this was actually all down to the bravery

21
0:01:10.035,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby,

22
0:01:13.368,000 --> 0:01:14,000
who took on Parliament.

23
0:01:15.118,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And he was thrown into the Tower of London

24
0:01:17.22,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and imprisoned,

25
0:01:19.338,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but he was brave enough,

26
0:01:22.171,000 --> 0:01:24,000
he was brave enough to take them on, and in the end,

27
0:01:24.674,000 --> 0:01:26,000
he had such popular support in London that he won.

28
0:01:27.133,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And it was only a few years later

29
0:01:28.92,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that we have the first recorded use of the phrase "as bold as brass."

30
0:01:34.321,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Most people think that's down to the metal.

31
0:01:36.369,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's not; it's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press.

32
0:01:40.811,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But to really show you how words and politics interact,

33
0:01:45.021,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I want to take you back to the United States of America,

34
0:01:47.665,000 --> 0:01:49,000
just after they'd achieved independence.

35
0:01:50.469,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And they had to face the question

36
0:01:52.241,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of what to call George Washington, their leader.

37
0:01:54.97,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They didn't know.

38
0:01:56.25,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What do you call the leader of a republican country?

39
0:01:59.595,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages.

40
0:02:02.486,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table,

41
0:02:05.042,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which might have made it.

42
0:02:06.261,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I mean, some people wanted him to be called

43
0:02:08.522,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"Chief Magistrate Washington,"

44
0:02:10.336,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and other people, "His Highness, George Washington,"

45
0:02:12.849,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and other people,

46
0:02:14.107,000 --> 0:02:16,000
"Protector of the Liberties

47
0:02:16.889,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of the People of the United States of America Washington."

48
0:02:19.964,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Not that catchy.

49
0:02:21.607,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Some people just wanted to call him king --

50
0:02:24.065,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it was tried and tested.

51
0:02:25.595,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They weren't even being monarchical,

52
0:02:27.349,000 --> 0:02:3,000
they had the idea that you could be elected king for a fixed term.

53
0:02:30.587,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And, you know, it could have worked.

54
0:02:32.875,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And everybody got insanely bored,

55
0:02:34.757,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because this debate went on for three weeks.

56
0:02:36.855,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I read a diary of this poor senator who just keeps coming back,

57
0:02:39.869,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"Still on this subject."

58
0:02:41.141,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And the reason for the delay and the boredom

59
0:02:43.694,000 --> 0:02:46,000
was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate.

60
0:02:47.333,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power.

61
0:02:51.574,000 --> 0:02:54,000
They didn't want to call him "king," in case that gave him ideas,

62
0:02:54.685,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or his successor ideas.

63
0:02:56.049,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest,

64
0:02:59.22,000 --> 0:03:01,000
most pathetic title that they could think of.

65
0:03:02.616,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And that title ...

66
0:03:04.704,000 --> 0:03:05,000
was "President."

67
0:03:06.123,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:08.211,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"President." They didn't invent the title.

69
0:03:10.262,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I mean, it existed before,

70
0:03:11.608,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.

71
0:03:14.297,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It was like the foreman of the jury.

72
0:03:16.204,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And it didn't have much more grandeur

73
0:03:18.064,000 --> 0:03:19,000
than the term "foreman" or "overseer."

74
0:03:19.942,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils

75
0:03:22.839,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and bits of government,

76
0:03:24.035,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but it was really a nothing title.

77
0:03:26.25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And that's why the Senate objected to it.

78
0:03:28.284,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They said, "That's ridiculous! You can't call him 'President.'

79
0:03:32.057,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries.

80
0:03:35.5,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title

81
0:03:39.079,000 --> 0:03:41,000
like 'President of the United States of America'?"

82
0:03:41.744,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:42.779,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And after three weeks of debate, in the end,

84
0:03:46.547,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the Senate did not cave in.

85
0:03:50.626,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Instead, they agreed to use the title "President" for now.

86
0:03:56.316,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But they also wanted it absolutely set down

87
0:03:59.124,000 --> 0:04:,000
that they didn't agree with it,

88
0:04:02.229,000 --> 0:04:07,000
from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations,

89
0:04:07.702,000 --> 0:04:1,000
whether under republican or monarchical forms of government,

90
0:04:11.53,000 --> 0:04:13,000
whose custom it is to annex,

91
0:04:13.668,000 --> 0:04:15,000
through the office of the Chief Magistrate,

92
0:04:15.708,000 --> 0:04:17,000
titles of respectability --

93
0:04:18.512,000 --> 0:04:19,000
not bloody "President."

94
0:04:20.642,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And that, in the intercourse with foreign nations,

95
0:04:24.27,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the majesty of the people of the United States

96
0:04:27.541,000 --> 0:04:3,000
may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity --

97
0:04:31.548,000 --> 0:04:33,000
i.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos.

98
0:04:35.745,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, you can learn three interesting things from this.

99
0:04:38.374,000 --> 0:04:4,000
First of all -- and this is my favorite --

100
0:04:40.595,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is that, so far as I've ever been able to find out,

101
0:04:43.055,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President.

102
0:04:48.351,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time,

103
0:04:51.294,000 --> 0:04:54,000
just waiting for the Senate to spring into action.

104
0:04:54.458,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:55.728,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The second thing you can learn

106
0:04:57.204,000 --> 0:05:,000
is that, when a government says that this is a temporary measure --

107
0:05:00.448,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:02.84,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you can still be waiting 223 years later.

109
0:05:08.114,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But the third thing you can learn -- and this is the really important one,

110
0:05:11.654,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the point I want to leave you on --

111
0:05:13.402,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is that the title, "President of the United States of America,"

112
0:05:17.358,000 --> 0:05:2,000
doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?

113
0:05:21.504,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Something to do with the slightly over 5,000

114
0:05:24.727,000 --> 0:05:26,000
nuclear warheads he has at his disposal

115
0:05:27.001,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and the largest economy in the world

116
0:05:29.198,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff.

117
0:05:32.797,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur.

118
0:05:39.751,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And so the Senate won in the end.

119
0:05:41.393,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They got their title of respectability.

120
0:05:43.845,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity --

121
0:05:47.405,000 --> 0:05:49,000
well, it was a singularity back then.

122
0:05:49.553,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But now, do you know how many nations have a president?

123
0:05:52.426,000 --> 0:05:53,000
A hundred and forty-seven.

124
0:05:54.772,000 --> 0:05:56,000
All because they want to sound like the guy

125
0:05:56.807,000 --> 0:05:58,000
who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.

126
0:06:01.415,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And so, in the end, the Senate won

127
0:06:04.318,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and the House of Representatives lost ...

128
0:06:07.823,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because nobody's going to feel that humble

129
0:06:10.363,000 --> 0:06:11,000
when they're told that they are now

130
0:06:12.074,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the President of the United States of America.

131
0:06:16.503,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And that's the important lesson I think you can take away,

132
0:06:19.293,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and the one I want to leave you with.

133
0:06:21.092,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Politicians try to pick and use words to shape and control reality,

134
0:06:24.91,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but in fact,

135
0:06:26.592,000 --> 0:06:31,000
reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality.

136
0:06:32.502,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:13.046,000 --> 0:00:15,000
One billion people in the world today

2
0:00:15.565,000 --> 0:00:17,000
do not have access to all-season roads.

3
0:00:17.845,000 --> 0:00:18,000
One billion people.

4
0:00:19.55,000 --> 0:00:21,000
One seventh of the Earth's population

5
0:00:21.721,000 --> 0:00:24,000
are totally cut off for some part of the year.

6
0:00:25.03,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We cannot get medicine to them reliably,

7
0:00:27.358,000 --> 0:00:29,000
they cannot get critical supplies,

8
0:00:29.704,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and they cannot get their goods to market

9
0:00:31.693,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in order to create a sustainable income.

10
0:00:35.583,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,

11
0:00:37.727,000 --> 0:00:4,000
85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season.

12
0:00:41.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Investments are being made,

13
0:00:43.659,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but at the current level,

14
0:00:45.204,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it's estimated it's going to take them

15
0:00:46.601,000 --> 0:00:49,000
50 years to catch up.

16
0:00:49.707,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million

17
0:00:52.001,000 --> 0:00:55,000
miles of roads, very expensive to build,

18
0:00:55.132,000 --> 0:00:58,000
very expensive to maintain infrastructure,

19
0:00:58.503,000 --> 0:01:,000
with a huge ecological footprint,

20
0:01:00.772,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and yet, very often, congested.

21
0:01:04.444,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So we saw this and we thought,

22
0:01:06.826,000 --> 0:01:07,000
can there be a better way?

23
0:01:08.309,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies

24
0:01:11.764,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog

25
0:01:14.884,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in the same way they've done with mobile telephones

26
0:01:17.239,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in the last 10 years?

27
0:01:19.114,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today

28
0:01:22.059,000 --> 0:01:24,000
without ever putting copper lines in the ground.

29
0:01:25.036,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Could we do the same for transportation?

30
0:01:28.386,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Imagine this scenario.

31
0:01:30.701,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali,

32
0:01:33.859,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.

33
0:01:37.089,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What would you do today?

34
0:01:39.321,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Well, you would place a request via mobile phone,

35
0:01:41.718,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and someone would get the request immediately.

36
0:01:44.582,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That's the part that works.

37
0:01:46.575,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The medication may take days to arrive, though,

38
0:01:48.612,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because of bad roads.

39
0:01:50.022,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That's the part that's broken.

40
0:01:52.378,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We believe we can deliver it within hours

41
0:01:54.895,000 --> 0:01:56,000
with an electric autonomous flying vehicle

42
0:01:57.476,000 --> 0:01:58,000
such as this.

43
0:01:58.881,000 --> 0:02:,000
This can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms,

44
0:02:01.766,000 --> 0:02:03,000
over a short distance, about 10 kilometers,

45
0:02:04.4,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but it's part of a wider network that may cover

46
0:02:06.755,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.

47
0:02:10.715,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.

48
0:02:15.053,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's a network for a transportation of matter.

49
0:02:17.988,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We call it Matternet.

50
0:02:19.765,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We use three key technologies.

51
0:02:21.279,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.

52
0:02:23.914,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The second is automated ground stations

53
0:02:26.625,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that the vehicles fly in and out of

54
0:02:28.604,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to swap batteries and fly farther,

55
0:02:30.862,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or pick up or deliver loads.

56
0:02:32.604,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And the third is the operating system

57
0:02:34.335,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that manages the whole network.

58
0:02:37.078,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Let's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail.

59
0:02:40.417,000 --> 0:02:42,000
First of all, the UAVs.

60
0:02:42.662,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Eventually, we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles

61
0:02:44.746,000 --> 0:02:46,000
for different payload capacities and different ranges.

62
0:02:47.2,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Today, we're using small quads.

63
0:02:49.456,000 --> 0:02:51,000
These are able to transport two kilograms

64
0:02:51.799,000 --> 0:02:53,000
over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.

65
0:02:54.612,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road

66
0:02:57.138,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in the developing world,

67
0:02:58.552,000 --> 0:03:,000
or even being stuck in traffic

68
0:03:00.772,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in a developed world country.

69
0:03:02.817,000 --> 0:03:03,000
These fly autonomously.

70
0:03:04.527,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is the key to the technology.

71
0:03:06.083,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So they use GPS and other sensors on board

72
0:03:08.443,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to navigate between ground stations.

73
0:03:12.137,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic

74
0:03:14.562,000 --> 0:03:17,000
payload and battery exchange mechanism,

75
0:03:17.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations,

76
0:03:20.006,000 --> 0:03:22,000
they dock, swap a battery automatically,

77
0:03:22.122,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and go out again.

78
0:03:23.826,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The ground stations are located on safe locations

79
0:03:26.582,000 --> 0:03:27,000
on the ground.

80
0:03:28.144,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission,

81
0:03:30.143,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which is the landing.

82
0:03:31.997,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They are at known locations on the ground,

83
0:03:34.089,000 --> 0:03:35,000
so the paths between them are also known,

84
0:03:36.009,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which is very important from a reliability perspective

85
0:03:38.747,000 --> 0:03:39,000
from the whole network.

86
0:03:40.298,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles,

87
0:03:43.122,000 --> 0:03:45,000
eventually they're going to be becoming

88
0:03:45.494,000 --> 0:03:47,000
commercial hubs where people can take out loads

89
0:03:48.194,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or put loads into the network.

90
0:03:51.257,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The last component is the operating system

91
0:03:53.48,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that manages the whole network.

92
0:03:55.374,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It monitors weather data from all the ground stations

93
0:03:58.115,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system

94
0:04:01.456,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to avoid adverse weather conditions,

95
0:04:04.047,000 --> 0:04:06,000
avoid other risk factors,

96
0:04:06.05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and optimize the use of the resources

97
0:04:07.77,000 --> 0:04:08,000
throughout the network.

98
0:04:09.668,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I want to show you what one of those flights

99
0:04:11.31,000 --> 0:04:12,000
looks like.

100
0:04:13.078,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Here we are flying in Haiti last summer,

101
0:04:17.02,000 --> 0:04:19,000
where we've done our first field trials.

102
0:04:19.463,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We're modeling here a medical delivery

103
0:04:21.607,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.

104
0:04:26.447,000 --> 0:04:28,000
People there love this.

105
0:04:28.998,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I want to show you

106
0:04:31.127,000 --> 0:04:35,000
what one of those vehicles looks like up close.

107
0:04:36.003,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So this is a $3,000 vehicle.

108
0:04:38.011,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Costs are coming down very rapidly.

109
0:04:42.028,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We use this in all sorts of weather conditions,

110
0:04:45.203,000 --> 0:04:46,000
very hot and very cold climates,

111
0:04:46.998,000 --> 0:04:52,000
very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles.

112
0:04:53.096,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Imagine if your life depended on this package,

113
0:04:57.115,000 --> 0:04:58,000
somewhere in Africa

114
0:04:58.559,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or in New York City, after Sandy.

115
0:05:02.822,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The next big question is, what's the cost?

116
0:05:06.128,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well, it turns out that the cost to transport

117
0:05:09.938,000 --> 0:05:12,000
two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle

118
0:05:13.897,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is just 24 cents.

119
0:05:17.27,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Applause)

120
0:05:22.342,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy

121
0:05:25.086,000 --> 0:05:26,000
expended for the flight is only two cents

122
0:05:27.075,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of a dollar today,

123
0:05:28.413,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we're just at the beginning of this.

124
0:05:30.546,000 --> 0:05:32,000
When we saw this, we felt that this is something

125
0:05:33.148,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that can have significant impact in the world.

126
0:05:36.147,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So we said, okay, how much does it cost

127
0:05:38.565,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to set up a network somewhere in the world?

128
0:05:40.633,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho

129
0:05:42.663,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.

130
0:05:45.704,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The problem there is how do you take them

131
0:05:48.111,000 --> 0:05:5,000
from clinics where they're being collected

132
0:05:50.34,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to hospitals where they're being analyzed?

133
0:05:53.36,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area

134
0:05:55.502,000 --> 0:05:57,000
spanning around 140 square kilometers?

135
0:05:58.159,000 --> 0:06:01,000
That's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan.

136
0:06:01.633,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Well it turns out that the cost to do that there

137
0:06:03.8,000 --> 0:06:05,000
would be less than a million dollars.

138
0:06:06.775,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments.

139
0:06:10.006,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We think this can be -- this is the power

140
0:06:13.163,000 --> 0:06:15,000
of a new paradigm.

141
0:06:15.882,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So here we are: a new idea

142
0:06:18.365,000 --> 0:06:19,000
about a network for transportation

143
0:06:20.235,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that is based on the ideas of the Internet.

144
0:06:22.881,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer,

145
0:06:25.11,000 --> 0:06:27,000
it's bidirectional, highly adaptable,

146
0:06:27.813,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with very low infrastructure investment,

147
0:06:30.323,000 --> 0:06:34,000
very low ecological footprint.

148
0:06:34.456,000 --> 0:06:36,000
If it is a new paradigm, though,

149
0:06:36.74,000 --> 0:06:38,000
there must be other uses for it.

150
0:06:38.886,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.

151
0:06:41.052,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So let's look at the other end of the spectrum:

152
0:06:45.23,000 --> 0:06:47,000
our cities and megacities.

153
0:06:47.235,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today.

154
0:06:50.107,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Half a billion of us live in megacities.

155
0:06:52.827,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.

156
0:06:55.507,000 --> 0:06:56,000
China alone is adding a megacity

157
0:06:57.48,000 --> 0:07:,000
the size of New York City every two years.

158
0:07:00.587,000 --> 0:07:02,000
These are places that do have road infrastructure,

159
0:07:03.24,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but it's very inefficient.

160
0:07:05.554,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Congestion is a huge problem.

161
0:07:07.686,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So we think it makes sense in those places

162
0:07:09.626,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to set up a network of transportation

163
0:07:11.996,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that is a new layer that sits between the road

164
0:07:14.162,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and the Internet,

165
0:07:15.433,000 --> 0:07:17,000
initially for lightweight, urgent stuff,

166
0:07:18.339,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and over time, we would hope to develop this

167
0:07:20.388,000 --> 0:07:21,000
into a new mode of transportation

168
0:07:22.38,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.

169
0:07:25.832,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's ultimately scalable

170
0:07:27.386,000 --> 0:07:29,000
with a very small ecological footprint,

171
0:07:30.244,000 --> 0:07:32,000
operating in the background 24/7,

172
0:07:33.22,000 --> 0:07:35,000
just like the Internet.

173
0:07:35.566,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So when we started this

174
0:07:37.988,000 --> 0:07:4,000
a couple of years ago now,

175
0:07:40.99,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we've had a lot of people come up to us who said,

176
0:07:43.334,000 --> 0:07:45,000
"This is a very interesting but crazy idea,

177
0:07:46.166,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and certainly not something that you should

178
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
engage with anytime soon."

179
0:07:50.714,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And of course, we're talking about drones, right,

180
0:07:52.857,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a technology that's not only unpopular in the West

181
0:07:56.559,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but one that has become a very, very unpleasant

182
0:07:58.507,000 --> 0:08:,000
fact of life for many living in poor countries,

183
0:08:01.372,000 --> 0:08:03,000
especially those engaged in conflict.

184
0:08:04.183,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So why are we doing this?

185
0:08:08.717,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Well, we chose to do this one

186
0:08:11.501,000 --> 0:08:12,000
not because it's easy,

187
0:08:13.287,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but because it can have amazing impact.

188
0:08:16.122,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Imagine one billion people being connected

189
0:08:18.947,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to physical goods in the same way

190
0:08:21.342,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that mobile telecommunications connected them

191
0:08:24.366,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to information.

192
0:08:26.458,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Imagine if the next big network we built in the world

193
0:08:30.198,000 --> 0:08:33,000
was a network for the transportation of matter.

194
0:08:33.961,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In the developing world, we would hope

195
0:08:36.363,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to reach millions of people with better vaccines,

196
0:08:39.068,000 --> 0:08:4,000
reach them with better medication.

197
0:08:40.952,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It would give us an unfair advantage against battling

198
0:08:42.81,000 --> 0:08:45,000
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.

199
0:08:46.802,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Over time, we would hope it would become

200
0:08:48.498,000 --> 0:08:5,000
a new platform for economic transactions,

201
0:08:50.672,000 --> 0:08:52,000
lifting millions of people out of poverty.

202
0:08:53.133,000 --> 0:08:55,000
In the developed world and the emerging world,

203
0:08:55.343,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we would hope it would become a new mode

204
0:08:56.811,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of transportation that could help make our cities

205
0:09:00.532,000 --> 0:09:01,000
more livable.

206
0:09:02.385,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So for those that still believe that this is science fiction,

207
0:09:05.728,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I firmly say to you that it is not.

208
0:09:08.543,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We do need to engage, though,

209
0:09:10.212,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in social fiction to make it happen.

210
0:09:13.28,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Thank you.

211
0:09:15.447,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Applause)

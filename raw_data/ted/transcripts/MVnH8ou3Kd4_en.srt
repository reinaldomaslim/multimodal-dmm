1
0:00:15.32,000 --> 0:00:24,000
our Weiwei is recognized broadly as one

2
0:00:20.49,000 --> 0:00:27,000
of the world's great artists I'm going

3
0:00:24.42,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to show some of his works of art this is

4
0:00:27.84,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the sunflower exhibition currently at

5
0:00:30.029,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the Tate there are more than 100 million

6
0:00:32.279,000 --> 0:00:37,000
seeds there each of them actually its

7
0:00:34.68,000 --> 0:00:4,000
own work of art created by hundreds of

8
0:00:37.38,000 --> 0:00:42,000
artisans over many months and there's

9
0:00:40.68,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the beautiful birds nest stadium there's

10
0:00:43.17,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the centerpiece of the Beijing Olympics

11
0:00:45.899,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in recent years I Weiwei has become

12
0:00:49.46,000 --> 0:00:54,000
increasingly critical of the Chinese

13
0:00:52.469,000 --> 0:00:58,000
government and has faced consequences

14
0:00:55.41,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for that he's had exhibitions canceled

15
0:00:59.359,000 --> 0:01:06,000
he's faced beatings and his beautiful

16
0:01:03.899,000 --> 0:01:08,000
new studio in Shanghai was bulldozed on

17
0:01:07.05,000 --> 0:01:1,000
January 11th we'd invited him to come

18
0:01:09.6,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and speak here but because of his

19
0:01:10.95,000 --> 0:01:16,000
current circumstances he couldn't come

20
0:01:13.85,000 --> 0:01:21,000
however he was able to get to us a

21
0:01:17.13,000 --> 0:01:24,000
secretly recorded talk on video Ted is a

22
0:01:22.35,000 --> 0:01:26,000
nonpartisan organization we have no

23
0:01:24.84,000 --> 0:01:27,000
formal stance for and against the

24
0:01:26.7,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Chinese government and we've had plenty

25
0:01:28.65,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of talks here in the past that have

26
0:01:30.09,000 --> 0:01:35,000
celebrated the astonishing things

27
0:01:32.13,000 --> 0:01:38,000
happening in China including the largest

28
0:01:36.02,000 --> 0:01:4,000
escape from poverty of more people than

29
0:01:38.49,000 --> 0:01:42,000
any other time in human history but we

30
0:01:40.98,000 --> 0:01:46,000
are proud to present the personal

31
0:01:43.2,000 --> 0:01:48,000
statement of a courageous artist my name

32
0:01:47.49,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is AI weiwei

33
0:01:48.45,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm based in Beijing am artist my work

34
0:01:54.12,000 --> 0:02:03,000
relate to art shows communications

35
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:02:09,000
through internet architecture design and

36
0:02:03.74,000 --> 0:02:09,000
documentary films in China most

37
0:02:10.43,000 --> 0:02:18,000
internationally one on internet site

38
0:02:13.2,000 --> 0:02:18,000
being blocked such as Facebook Twitter

39
0:02:19.11,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Google or YouTube in general condition

40
0:02:23.52,000 --> 0:02:31,000
my name cannot even be tapped in in

41
0:02:27.12,000 --> 0:02:34,000
China in the domestic internet sites the

42
0:02:32.31,000 --> 0:02:37,000
line will come out like illegal words

43
0:02:34.98,000 --> 0:02:41,000
being used or the article war just

44
0:02:38.1,000 --> 0:02:47,000
disappear and because I'm the kinda

45
0:02:42.56,000 --> 0:02:51,000
nature of my work which encourages a new

46
0:02:47.22,000 --> 0:02:56,000
generation of people who use Internet to

47
0:02:52.02,000 --> 0:03:,000
be aware of the real situation also we

48
0:02:56.88,000 --> 0:03:02,000
are very much in digging of truth facts

49
0:03:00.66,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which mostly are covered by the

50
0:03:03.66,000 --> 0:03:14,000
government medias so my blog has been

51
0:03:09.32,000 --> 0:03:17,000
censored and also I'm constantly under

52
0:03:14.84,000 --> 0:03:2,000
civilians you know in front of my studio

53
0:03:17.94,000 --> 0:03:23,000
they are surveilling cameras sometimes I

54
0:03:21.209,000 --> 0:03:29,000
even being tailed in a my phone being

55
0:03:24.54,000 --> 0:03:32,000
monitored and you know my internet

56
0:03:29.6,000 --> 0:03:37,000
account always been checking by the

57
0:03:32.959,000 --> 0:03:4,000
unknowns and people I'm living in a

58
0:03:37.68,000 --> 0:03:46,000
society which freedom of speech is not

59
0:03:41.91,000 --> 0:03:5,000
allowed and also it's very hard to find

60
0:03:47.66,000 --> 0:03:57,000
individual expressions through media or

61
0:03:51,000 --> 0:04:01,000
through any public territories so to to

62
0:03:57.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
help the change to help China to become

63
0:04:01.17,000 --> 0:04:09,000
a more democratic society you need

64
0:04:04.19,000 --> 0:04:12,000
people who who can act who can give out

65
0:04:09.48,000 --> 0:04:15,000
their opinions and talk to the young

66
0:04:12.269,000 --> 0:04:19,000
people and trying to find a way to

67
0:04:15.66,000 --> 0:04:22,000
encourage people to to be involved so

68
0:04:19.58,000 --> 0:04:26,000
only when you're doing that you can have

69
0:04:23.07,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a civil society so on

70
0:04:27.51,000 --> 0:04:35,000
what I'm doing is more

71
0:04:29.85,000 --> 0:04:39,000
on 20 involve my art with the reality 20

72
0:04:35.82,000 --> 0:04:41,000
beaut a possible possibility and to

73
0:04:39.93,000 --> 0:04:45,000
connect art under the social change

74
0:04:42.78,000 --> 0:04:51,000
since 2005 I started working on Internet

75
0:04:46.92,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I write blogs and Twitter's and organize

76
0:04:52.23,000 --> 0:05:01,000
activities through the internet we did

77
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the 2007 fairy tale which is art show in

78
0:05:01.89,000 --> 0:05:08,000
castle they organised 1001 Chinese to go

79
0:05:06.57,000 --> 0:05:11,000
over to Germany under the whole

80
0:05:09.06,000 --> 0:05:15,000
organisation and work is through the

81
0:05:12.45,000 --> 0:05:19,000
internet which become a very success and

82
0:05:15.87,000 --> 0:05:24,000
a lot of young people first time earn

83
0:05:20.24,000 --> 0:05:28,000
they realize the power of and of this

84
0:05:25.65,000 --> 0:05:32,000
kind of social media and a social

85
0:05:28.64,000 --> 0:05:37,000
communication and later by 2008 and

86
0:05:33.17,000 --> 0:05:41,000
China had a huge earthquake and which is

87
0:05:37.86,000 --> 0:05:43,000
devastating and after the earthquake the

88
0:05:41.58,000 --> 0:05:47,000
government refused to give out the truth

89
0:05:44.61,000 --> 0:05:5,000
of who is dead and how many of them

90
0:05:47.7,000 --> 0:05:54,000
amount of them there's a lot of students

91
0:05:50.67,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which is crashed by mishandling of the

92
0:05:55.01,000 --> 0:06:02,000
construction work its victimized by the

93
0:05:59.54,000 --> 0:06:06,000
corruptions so through the internet we

94
0:06:02.76,000 --> 0:06:09,000
organized the investigation and we asked

95
0:06:06.9,000 --> 0:06:12,000
him volunteers to join us under 2:00 to

96
0:06:10.53,000 --> 0:06:15,000
go to Sutra in the local area at door

97
0:06:13.77,000 --> 0:06:18,000
backdoor of illegitimate village so

98
0:06:16.08,000 --> 0:06:23,000
after a year of research we find out

99
0:06:18.96,000 --> 0:06:25,000
over 5000 to 119 students their name the

100
0:06:23.97,000 --> 0:06:28,000
first day all the informations which

101
0:06:26.82,000 --> 0:06:32,000
school they were under and their

102
0:06:29.43,000 --> 0:06:36,000
families contact so through doing that

103
0:06:33.41,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we are very encouraged a lot of young

104
0:06:37.08,000 --> 0:06:4,000
young people to be involved and we in

105
0:06:39.24,000 --> 0:06:44,000
trying always trying to

106
0:06:41.06,000 --> 0:06:48,000
remind people on an individual car maker

107
0:06:45.19,000 --> 0:06:53,000
effort and also make an impact

108
0:06:49.01,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I think Internet is a very the most

109
0:06:53.63,000 --> 0:07:,000
valuable and sin happened because that's

110
0:06:57.77,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the only way people can freely associate

111
0:07:00.89,000 --> 0:07:07,000
with others and freely give out

112
0:07:02.87,000 --> 0:07:11,000
information but the internally China has

113
0:07:08.54,000 --> 0:07:16,000
a Great Firewall with forbidden any

114
0:07:12.73,000 --> 0:07:2,000
information decently sensitive so the

115
0:07:16.64,000 --> 0:07:23,000
struggle is always very and very strong

116
0:07:21.08,000 --> 0:07:26,000
there because the government basically

117
0:07:23.96,000 --> 0:07:29,000
censors everything they don't like I

118
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
think in next a few years China is faced

119
0:07:30.11,000 --> 0:07:36,000
in a moment which for the social and the

120
0:07:33.2,000 --> 0:07:39,000
political change and even through the

121
0:07:36.17,000 --> 0:07:42,000
past thirty years China made a great

122
0:07:39.29,000 --> 0:07:45,000
difference economically and to be much

123
0:07:42.23,000 --> 0:07:49,000
more connected under recognized by the

124
0:07:45.92,000 --> 0:07:52,000
international community but still we are

125
0:07:49.43,000 --> 0:07:55,000
still our communist society some basic

126
0:07:53.27,000 --> 0:07:57,000
values such as freedom of speech and the

127
0:07:55.94,000 --> 0:08:,000
human rights which still in poor

128
0:07:58.19,000 --> 0:08:04,000
condition and many people only because

129
0:08:01.85,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it's because speak out their mind it can

130
0:08:04.73,000 --> 0:08:11,000
be put in jail or or it can be putting

131
0:08:07.67,000 --> 0:08:17,000
very difficult situation and by not to

132
0:08:12.5,000 --> 0:08:2,000
let people do to be have a freedom to to

133
0:08:17.78,000 --> 0:08:22,000
get the information and the to to be

134
0:08:20.62,000 --> 0:08:26,000
freely associated with other people

135
0:08:23.36,000 --> 0:08:28,000
under to have a free election so the

136
0:08:26.69,000 --> 0:08:34,000
this whole political situation is still

137
0:08:29.3,000 --> 0:08:38,000
very corrupted and under the society

138
0:08:34.93,000 --> 0:08:42,000
sacrifice its environment and education

139
0:08:38.51,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the moral stands to just to trying

140
0:08:43.22,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to become a rich

141
0:08:44.96,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and that cannot last long and so far we

142
0:08:49.31,000 --> 0:08:56,000
don't see any real consciousness and

143
0:08:53.9,000 --> 0:08:59,000
willing to to to make a difference

144
0:08:56.42,000 --> 0:09:07,000
through the party itself so we can see

145
0:09:00.58,000 --> 0:09:12,000
through the internet people very aware

146
0:09:08.18,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of that and but in the reality and you

147
0:09:12.59,000 --> 0:09:17,000
know even internationally all the

148
0:09:15.62,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Western nations are trying to kind of

149
0:09:18.53,000 --> 0:09:24,000
tolerate what happening in China today I

150
0:09:21.29,000 --> 0:09:29,000
think this is very short-sighted and

151
0:09:24.56,000 --> 0:09:33,000
this will will not help China to become

152
0:09:29.57,000 --> 0:09:38,000
a modern society so I think what we can

153
0:09:34.49,000 --> 0:09:42,000
do as individual is really to use in

154
0:09:38.57,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Internet and using the new technology

155
0:09:43.13,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and to communicate this young people and

156
0:09:46.64,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the tude to have a much broader

157
0:09:49.01,000 --> 0:09:58,000
discussions and to make the change more

158
0:09:54.8,000 --> 0:10:02,000
smoothly and to make the change because

159
0:09:58.7,000 --> 0:10:07,000
it will come and it's not nobody can

160
0:10:02.93,000 --> 0:10:1,000
really avoid that so I think this is a

161
0:10:07.81,000 --> 0:10:13,000
time for people to to be more conscious

162
0:10:11.87,000 --> 0:10:13,000
about that

163
0:10:57.82,000 --> 0:11:05,000
it's the it's up it's the middle of the

164
0:11:03.19,000 --> 0:11:09,000
night in China but I believe I Weiwei is

165

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Music)

2
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Applause)

3
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Thank you for being here.

4
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years.

5
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C.,

6
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.

7
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak.

8
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I said, "Thank you for being here."

9
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My mother, out in the audience, she jumped up,

10
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"Hallelujah, Johnny’s talking!"

11
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

12
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years

13
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and your mother was out in the audience, say.

14
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
My dad said to me, "That’s one" --

15
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I’ll explain that.

16
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But I turned around because I didn’t recognize where my voice was coming from.

17
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I hadn’t heard my voice in 17 years,

18
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so I turned around and I looked and I said,

19
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"God, who's saying what I’m thinking?"

20
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed.

21
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And I could see my father: "Yeah, he really is crazy."

22
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Well, I want to take you on this journey.

23
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys.

24
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Even though this one is kind of unusual,

25
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I want you to think about your own journey.

26
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
My journey began in 1971

27
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate,

28
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay.

29
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It disturbed me so much

30
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles.

31
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That’s a big thing in California.

32
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station

33
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in Inverness, California, because there were only

34
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in '71 now.

35
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And so when I came in and I started walking around, people --

36
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
they just knew what was going on.

37
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And people would drive up next to me

38
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and say, "John, what are you doing?"

39
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And I’d say, "Well, I’m walking for the environment."

40
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And they said, "No, you’re walking to make us look bad, right?

41
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You’re walking to make us feel bad."

42
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And maybe there was some truth to that,

43
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow.

44
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Because of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution.

45
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued.

46
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I called my parents up.

47
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I said, "I’ve given up riding and driving in cars."

48
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
My dad said, "Why didn’t you do that when you were 16?"

49
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

50
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I didn’t know about the environment then.

51
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They’re back in Philadelphia.

52
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
And so I told my mother, "I’m happy though, I’m really happy."

53
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
She said, "If you were happy, son, you wouldn’t have to say it."

54
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Mothers are like that.

55
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much

56
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking

57
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest.

58
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And so I did.

59
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I got up in the morning and I didn’t say a word.

60
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience,

61
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because for the first time, I began listening -- in a long time.

62
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.

63
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Because what I used to do, when I thought I was listening,

64
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say

65
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and think that I could -- I knew what they were going to say,

66
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and so I stopped listening.

67
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
And in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead

68
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and thought of what I was going to say back,

69
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
while they were still finishing up.

70
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And then I would launch in.

71
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Well, that just ended communication.

72
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So on this first day I actually listened.

73
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And it was very sad for me,

74
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.

75
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I was 27. I thought I knew everything.

76
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I didn’t.

77
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And so I decided I’d better do this for another day,

78
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and another day, and another day until finally,

79
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet

80
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more.

81
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So for a year I said I would keep quiet,

82
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned

83
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and maybe I would talk again.

84
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Well, that lasted 17 years.

85
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now during that time -- those 17 years -- I walked and I played the banjo

86
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and I painted and I wrote in my journal, and

87
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I tried to study the environment by reading books.

88
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.

89
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I walked up to Ashland, Oregon,

90
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
where they were offering an environmental studies degree.

91
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It’s only 500 miles.

92
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And I went into the Registrar’s office and --

93
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
"What, what, what?"

94
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I had a newspaper clipping.

95
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?

96
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You don’t …?

97
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We have a special program for you." They did.

98
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And in those two years, I graduated with my first degree -- a bachelor’s degree.

99
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And my father came out, he was so proud.

100
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
He said, "Listen, we’re really proud of you son,

101
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but what are you going to do with a bachelor’s degree?

102
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You don’t ride in cars, you don’t talk --

103
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
you’re going to have to do those things."

104
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

105
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again

106
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and I started walking.

107
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat,

108
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
rode it across Puget Sound

109
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana.

110
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I had written the University of Montana two years earlier

111
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and said I'd like to go to school there.

112
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I said I'd be there in about two years.

113
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Laughter)

114
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I was there. I showed up in two years and they --

115
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I tell this story because they really helped me.

116
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
There are two stories in Montana.

117
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The first story is I didn’t have any money -- that’s a sign I used a lot.

118
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And they said,"Don't worry about that."

119
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The director of the program said, "Come back tomorrow."

120
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
He gave me 150 dollars,

121
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and he said, "Register for one credit.

122
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
You’re going to go to South America, aren’t you?"

123
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And I said --

124
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Rivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America.

125
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So I did that.

126
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
He came back; he said to me,

127
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit,

128
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you can have a key to an office, you can matriculate --

129
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
you’re matriculating, so you can use the library.

130
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And what we’re going to do

131
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is, we’re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class.

132
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
They’re going to save your grade,

133
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money,

134
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
then you can register for that class and they’ll give you the grade."

135
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Wow, they don’t do that in graduate schools, I don’t think.

136
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me.

137
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They saw that I was really interested in the environment,

138
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and they really wanted to help me along the way.

139
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And during that time, I actually taught classes without speaking.

140
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class.

141
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language,

142
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that I was John Francis, I was walking around the world,

143
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I didn’t talk and this was the last time

144
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
this person’s going to be here interpreting for me.

145
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
All the students sat around and they went ...

146
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

147
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I could see they were looking for the schedule,

148
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to see when they could get out.

149
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
They had to take that class with me.

150
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Two weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class.

151
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And I learned in that class -- because I would do things like this ...

152
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and they were all gathered around, going, "What's he trying to say?"

153
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting."

154
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that’s -- he's using a handsaw."

155
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
"Well, you can’t clearcut with a ..."

156
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"Yes, you can clear cut ..."

157
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
"No, I think he’s talking about selective forestry."

158
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.

159
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying.

160
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign

161
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and they said things that I absolutely did not mean,

162
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but I should have.

163
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And so what came to me is, if you were a teacher

164
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and you were teaching, if you weren’t learning

165
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
you probably weren’t teaching very well.

166
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And so I went on.

167
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
My dad came out to see me graduate

168
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and, you know, I did the deal,

169
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and my father said, "We’re really proud of you son, but ... "

170
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
You know what went on,

171
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
he said, "You’ve got to start riding and driving and start talking.

172
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
What are you going to do with a master’s degree?"

173
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack

174
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and I went on to the University of Wisconsin.

175
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I spent two years there writing on oil spills.

176
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
No one was interested in oil spills.

177
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But something happened --

178
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Exxon Valdez.

179
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills.

180
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
My dad came out again.

181
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
He said, "I don't know how you do this, son --

182
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I mean, you don't ride in cars, you don’t talk.

183
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone,

184
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
because you seem to be doing a lot better

185
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
when you’re not saying anything."

186
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

187
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Well, I put on my backpack again.

188
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast,

189
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean --

190
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.

191
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And on Earth Day, 1990 --

192
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- that’s when I began to speak.

193
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And that’s why I said, "Thank you for being here."

194
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling;

195
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound?

196
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And I’m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family

197
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because they had come to hear me speak.

198
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And that’s communication.

199
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And they also taught me about listening -- that they listened to me.

200
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And it’s one of those things that came out of the silence,

201
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the listening to each other.

202
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Really, very important --

203
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we need to listen to each other.

204
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Well, my journey kept going on.

205
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
My dad said, "That’s one,"

206
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and I still didn’t let that go.

207
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I worked for the Coastguard, was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador.

208
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I wrote regulations for the United States --

209
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I mean, I wrote oil spill regulations.

210
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
20 years ago, if someone had said to me,

211
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
"John, do you really want to make a difference?"

212
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
"Yeah, I want to make a difference."

213
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
He said, "You just start walking east;

214
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
get out of your car and just start walking east."

215
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, "Yeah, and shut up, too."

216
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Laughter)

217
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
"You’re going to make a difference, buddy."

218
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
How could that be, how could that be?

219
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking

220
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
make a difference?

221
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Well, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time.

222
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And after that -- I only worked one year --

223
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I said, "That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that."

224
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean,

225
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela.

226
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And you know, I forgot the most important thing,

227
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
which is why I started talking, which I have to tell you.

228
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I started talking because I had studied environment.

229
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I’d studied environment at this formal level,

230
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but there was this informal level.

231
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And the informal level --

232
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I learned about people, and what we do and how we are.

233
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds

234
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and endangered species to being about how we treated each other.

235
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Because if we are the environment,

236
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
then all we need to do is look around us

237
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.

238
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And so that’s the message that I had.

239
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message."

240
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean --

241
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
it wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat --

242
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
got to Venezuela and I started walking.

243
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
This is the last part of this story, because it’s how I got here,

244
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles.

245
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I was walking through El Dorado -- it's a prison town, famous prison,

246
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
or infamous prison -- in Venezuela, and I don’t know what possessed me,

247
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
because this was not like me.

248
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
There I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says,

249
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
"Pasaporte, pasaporte," and with an M16 pointed at me.

250
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And I looked at him and I said, "Passport, huh?

251
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I don't need to show you my passport. It’s in the back of my pack.

252
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world."

253
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And I started walking off.

254
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
What possessed me to say this thing?

255
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
The road turned into the jungle.

256
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I didn’t get shot.

257
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And I got to -- I start saying, "Free at last --

258
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
thank God Almighty, I’m free at last."

259
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
"What was that about," I’m saying. What was that about?

260
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It took me 100 miles to figure out that, in my heart, in me,

261
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I had become a prisoner.

262
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape.

263
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive

264
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
or use motorized vehicles.

265
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Now how could that be?

266
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Because when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me

267
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
not to use motorized vehicles.

268
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
But the thing that was different

269
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
was that every birthday, I asked myself about silence,

270
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.

271
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador.

272
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.

273
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me,

274
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and that I was going to have to change.

275
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
You know, we can do it.

276
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I was going to have to change.

277
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And I was afraid to change,

278
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
because I was so used to the guy who only just walked.

279
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
I was so used to that person that I didn’t want to stop.

280
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I didn’t know who I would be if I changed.

281
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But I know I needed to.

282
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I know I needed to change, because it would be the only way

283
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
that I could be here today.

284
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And I know that a lot of times

285
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we’ve gotten to,

286
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
but there’s another place for us to go.

287
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we’ve become,

288
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and go to the place of who we are becoming.

289
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place,

290
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in,

291
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
as comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now.

292
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
We have to change now.

293
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
As our former Vice President said,

294
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
we have to become activists.

295
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
So if my voice can touch you,

296
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
if my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you,

297
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
please let it be.

298
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
And I know that all of you have touched me

299
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
while I’ve been here.

300
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
So, let’s go out into the world

301
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and take this caring, this love, this respect

302
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
that we’ve shown each other right here at TED,

303
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and take this out into the world.

304
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Because we are the environment,

305
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and how we treat each other

306
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
is really how we’re going to treat the environment.

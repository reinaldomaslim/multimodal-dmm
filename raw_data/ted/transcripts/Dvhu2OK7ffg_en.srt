A few years ago, my obsession with productivity

3
0:00:14.863,000 --> 0:00:17,000
got so bad that I suffered an episode of burnout

4
0:00:18.372,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that scared the hell out of me.

5
0:00:20.282,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm talking insomnia, weight gain, hair loss -- the works.

6
0:00:24.122,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I was so overworked that my brain

7
0:00:26.492,000 --> 0:00:28,000
literally couldn't come up with another idea.

8
0:00:29.142,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity.

[The Way We Work]

10
0:00:37.872,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day?

11
0:00:41.572,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Do you spend hours reading productivity hacks,

12
0:00:43.912,000 --> 0:00:45,000
trying new frameworks and testing new apps

13
0:00:46.182,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to get even more done?

14
0:00:47.522,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I've tried them all -- task apps, calendar apps,

15
0:00:50.287,000 --> 0:00:51,000
time-management apps,

16
0:00:51.51,000 --> 0:00:52,000
things that are meant to manage your day.

17
0:00:53.502,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We've been so obsessed with doing more

18
0:00:55.932,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that we've missed the most important thing.

19
0:00:58.012,000 --> 0:01:,000
Many of these tools aren't helping.

20
0:01:00.252,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They're making things worse.

21
0:01:02.042,000 --> 0:01:04,000
OK, let's talk about productivity for a second.

22
0:01:05.033,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Historically, productivity as we know it today

23
0:01:07.795,000 --> 0:01:09,000
was used during the industrial revolution.

24
0:01:10.032,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It was a system that measured performance based on consistent output.

25
0:01:13.812,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You clocked into your shift

26
0:01:15.213,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and were responsible for creating X number of widgets

27
0:01:17.792,000 --> 0:01:18,000
on the assembly line.

28
0:01:19.212,000 --> 0:01:21,000
At the end of the day, it was pretty easy to see

29
0:01:21.612,000 --> 0:01:23,000
who worked hard and who hadn't.

30
0:01:23.662,000 --> 0:01:25,000
When we shifted to a knowledge economy,

31
0:01:25.882,000 --> 0:01:28,000
people suddenly had tasks that were much more abstract,

32
0:01:29.012,000 --> 0:01:31,000
things like writing, problem-solving or strategizing,

33
0:01:31.572,000 --> 0:01:32,000
tasks that weren't easy to measure.

34
0:01:33.442,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Companies struggled to figure out

35
0:01:35.243,000 --> 0:01:37,000
how to tell who was working and who wasn't,

36
0:01:37.744,000 --> 0:01:4,000
so they just adopted the old systems as best as they could,

37
0:01:41.562,000 --> 0:01:43,000
leading to things like the dreaded time sheet

38
0:01:44.042,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where everyone is under pressure

39
0:01:45.982,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to justify how they spend every second of their day.

40
0:01:49.092,000 --> 0:01:5,000
There's just one problem.

41
0:01:50.362,000 --> 0:01:53,000
These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work.

42
0:01:54.131,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We still think of productivity as an endurance sport.

43
0:01:56.992,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You try to churn out as many blog posts

44
0:01:59.132,000 --> 0:02:01,000
or we cram our day full of meetings.

45
0:02:01.782,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But this model of constant output isn't conducive to creative thought.

46
0:02:05.862,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Today, knowledge workers are facing a big challenge.

47
0:02:09.442,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We're expected to be constantly productive and creative

48
0:02:13.062,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in equal measure.

49
0:02:14.601,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But it's actually almost impossible

50
0:02:16.342,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for our brains to continuously generate new ideas

51
0:02:18.822,000 --> 0:02:19,000
with no rest.

52
0:02:20.102,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In fact, downtime is a necessity for our brain

53
0:02:23.832,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to recover and to operate properly.

54
0:02:26.052,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Consider that according to a team of researchers

55
0:02:28.392,000 --> 0:02:3,000
from the University of Southern California,

56
0:02:30.752,000 --> 0:02:33,000
letting our minds wander is an essential mental state

57
0:02:34.162,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that helps us develop our identity,

58
0:02:36.443,000 --> 0:02:37,000
process social interactions,

59
0:02:38.362,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and it even influences our internal moral compass.

60
0:02:42.002,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling,

61
0:02:46.337,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in other words, the stories that we as a society

62
0:02:49.152,000 --> 0:02:51,000
tell each other about what success looks like

63
0:02:51.542,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and what it takes to get there.

64
0:02:53.052,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Stories like the American Dream,

65
0:02:54.752,000 --> 0:02:56,000
which is one of our most deeply rooted beliefs.

66
0:02:57.672,000 --> 0:03:,000
This tells us that if we work hard, we'll be successful.

67
0:03:00.892,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But there's a flip side.

68
0:03:02.442,000 --> 0:03:03,000
If you aren't successful,

69
0:03:04.352,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it must mean that you're not working hard enough.

70
0:03:07.952,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And if you don't think you're doing enough,

71
0:03:10.242,000 --> 0:03:12,000
of course you're going to stay late, pull all-nighters

72
0:03:12.922,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and push yourself hard even when you know better.

73
0:03:15.602,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Productivity has wrapped itself up in our self-worth,

74
0:03:18.592,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so that it's almost impossible for us to allow ourselves

75
0:03:21.872,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to stop working.

76
0:03:23.104,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The average US employee only takes half of their allocated paid vacation leave,

77
0:03:27.922,000 --> 0:03:29,000
further proving that even if we have the option

78
0:03:30.272,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to take a break, we don't.

79
0:03:32.712,000 --> 0:03:34,000
To be clear, I don't think that productivity

80
0:03:35.202,000 --> 0:03:37,000
or trying to improve our performance is bad.

81
0:03:37.632,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm just saying that the current models we're using to measure our creative work

82
0:03:41.692,000 --> 0:03:42,000
don't make sense.

83
0:03:42.959,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We need systems that work with our creativity

84
0:03:45.332,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and not against it.

85
0:03:46.658,000 --> 0:03:47,000
[SO HOW DO WE FIX IT?]

86
0:03:47.912,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There is no quick fix for this problem.

87
0:03:50.252,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I know, I know, that sucks.

88
0:03:51.982,000 --> 0:03:53,000
No one loves a good framework or a good acronym

89
0:03:54.802,000 --> 0:03:55,000
better than me.

90
0:03:55.985,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But the truth is everyone has their own narratives

91
0:03:59.072,000 --> 0:04:,000
that they have to uncover.

92
0:04:00.442,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It wasn't until I started digging around my own beliefs around work

93
0:04:03.772,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that I began to unravel the root of my own work story,

94
0:04:07.338,000 --> 0:04:09,000
finally being able to let go of destructive behaviors

95
0:04:10.302,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and make positive, long-lasting changes.

96
0:04:12.842,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the only way to do that

97
0:04:14.356,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is by asking yourself some hard questions.

98
0:04:17.472,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Does being busy make you feel valuable?

99
0:04:19.732,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Who do you hold up as an example of success?

100
0:04:22.262,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Where did your ideas of work ethic come from?

101
0:04:24.628,000 --> 0:04:27,000
How much of who you are is linked to what you do?

102
0:04:27.872,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Your creativity, it has its own rhythms.

103
0:04:30.552,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Our energy fluctuates daily, weekly, even seasonally.

104
0:04:34.292,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I know that I'm always more energetic at the beginning of the week

105
0:04:37.472,000 --> 0:04:38,000
than at the end,

106
0:04:38.646,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so I front-load my workweek to account for that fact.

107
0:04:41.312,000 --> 0:04:44,000
As a proud night owl, I free up my afternoons and evenings

108
0:04:44.452,000 --> 0:04:45,000
for creative work.

109
0:04:45.646,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And I know I'll get more writing done

110
0:04:47.511,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in the cozy winter months than during the summer.

111
0:04:50.142,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And that's the secret.

112
0:04:51.452,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Dismantling myths, challenging your old views,

113
0:04:54.412,000 --> 0:04:55,000
identifying your narratives --

114
0:04:55.87,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this is the real work that we need to be doing.

115
0:04:58.762,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We aren't machines,

116
0:05:00.224,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I think it's time that we stopped working like one.

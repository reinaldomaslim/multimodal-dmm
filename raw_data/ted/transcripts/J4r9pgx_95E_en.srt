1
0:00:12.917,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So for the past 12 years,

2
0:00:15.583,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've been obsessed with this idea

3
0:00:17.208,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that climate change is an information issue

4
0:00:20.208,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that computers will help us fight.

5
0:00:22.458,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I went from data science to climate policy research,

6
0:00:25.125,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from tech to public service,

7
0:00:26.542,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in pursuit of better data

8
0:00:28.5,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to avoid the wasted energy, resources, opportunities

9
0:00:31.625,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that lead to runaway carbon emissions.

10
0:00:34.333,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Until one day, running in the streets with a friend, it hit me:

11
0:00:38.792,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the same cars, factories, power plants

12
0:00:41.875,000 --> 0:00:44,000
whose emissions are wrecking our climate over time

13
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
also release harmful, local pollutants

14
0:00:47.875,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that threaten our health right here and right now.

15
0:00:50.292,000 --> 0:00:54,000
All this time I'd focused on the long-term environmental risk

16
0:00:54.542,000 --> 0:00:55,000
when I should have been up in arms

17
0:00:56.458,000 --> 0:00:59,000
about the immediate health impact of pollutants in the air.

18
0:01:00.333,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Air pollution is a burning public health crisis.

19
0:01:02.875,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It kills seven million people every year,

20
0:01:05.5,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it costs five trillion dollars to the world economy

21
0:01:10.167,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and, worst, it robs us of our most precious gift,

22
0:01:14.125,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the years in our lives:

23
0:01:15.917,000 --> 0:01:18,000
six months of life expectancy in my hometown of Paris

24
0:01:19.625,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and up to three, four, five years in parts of India and China.

25
0:01:23.375,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And in the US, more people die from car exhaust than from car accidents.

26
0:01:30.083,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So how do we protect ourselves from pollution?

27
0:01:33.375,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The reason it's difficult is an information gap.

28
0:01:36.625,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We simply lack the data to understand our exposure.

29
0:01:39.917,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And that's because the way we monitor air quality today

30
0:01:43.875,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is designed not to help people breathe but to help governments govern.

31
0:01:47.875,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Most major cities operate networks of air-quality monitoring stations

32
0:01:52.083,000 --> 0:01:53,000
like this one in London,

33
0:01:53.375,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to decide when to cut traffic or when to shut down factories.

34
0:01:56.667,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And these machines are like the computers from the '60s

35
0:01:59.708,000 --> 0:02:,000
that filled entire rooms.

36
0:02:01.042,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They're incredibly precise but incredibly large,

37
0:02:05.25,000 --> 0:02:06,000
heavy, costly --

38
0:02:06.958,000 --> 0:02:08,000
so much that you can only deploy just a few of them,

39
0:02:09.75,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and they cannot move.

40
0:02:11.25,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So to governments, air pollution looks like this.

41
0:02:13.708,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But for the rest of us,

42
0:02:15.208,000 --> 0:02:17,000
air quality looks like this.

43
0:02:17.833,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It changes all the time:

44
0:02:19.167,000 --> 0:02:2,000
hour by hour, street by street,

45
0:02:21.167,000 --> 0:02:23,000
up to eight times within a single city block.

46
0:02:23.875,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And even more from indoor to outdoor.

47
0:02:26.25,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So unless you happen to be walking right next to one of those stations,

48
0:02:29.875,000 --> 0:02:31,000
they just cannot tell you what you breathe.

49
0:02:31.958,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So what would environmental protection look like

50
0:02:34.25,000 --> 0:02:36,000
if it was designed for the age of the smartphone?

51
0:02:37.458,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So for the past three years,

52
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
my team and I have been building a technology

53
0:02:42.583,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that helps you know what you breathe

54
0:02:44.333,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and fits in your hand.

55
0:02:46.5,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Flow is a personal air-quality tracker that you can wear with you

56
0:02:50.75,000 --> 0:02:52,000
on a backpack, a bike, a stroller.

57
0:02:53.583,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's packed with miniature sensors

58
0:02:55.625,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that monitor the most important pollutants in the air around you,

59
0:02:58.708,000 --> 0:02:59,000
like nitrogen oxides,

60
0:03:00.417,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the exhaust gas from cars,

61
0:03:01.792,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or particulate matter that gets into your bloodstream

62
0:03:04.625,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and creates strokes and heart issues.

63
0:03:06.583,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Or volatile organic compounds,

64
0:03:09.125,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the thousands of chemicals in everyday products

65
0:03:11.458,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that we end up breathing.

66
0:03:13.083,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that makes this data actionable

67
0:03:15.167,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and helps you understand what you're breathing

68
0:03:17.375,000 --> 0:03:2,000
by telling you where and when you've been exposed to poor air quality,

69
0:03:21.208,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and that way you can make informed decisions

70
0:03:23.792,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to take action against pollution.

71
0:03:25.417,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You can change the products you use at home,

72
0:03:27.542,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you can find the best route to cycle to work,

73
0:03:29.917,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you can run when pollution is not peaking

74
0:03:32.792,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and you can find the best park to bring your children out.

75
0:03:35.583,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Over time you build better habits to decrease your exposure to pollution,

76
0:03:39.542,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and by tracking air quality around them,

77
0:03:42.958,000 --> 0:03:43,000
cyclists, commuters, parents

78
0:03:44.833,000 --> 0:03:47,000
will also contribute to mapping air quality in their city.

79
0:03:48.125,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So we're building more than a device,

80
0:03:49.958,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but a community.

81
0:03:51.5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And last summer,

82
0:03:52.792,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we sent early prototypes of our technology to 100 volunteers in London,

83
0:03:58.292,000 --> 0:04:,000
and together they mapped air quality

84
0:04:01.292,000 --> 0:04:03,000
across 1,000 miles of sidewalk

85
0:04:04.042,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and 20 percent of all of central London.

86
0:04:06.333,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So our goal now is to scale this work around the world,

87
0:04:09.042,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to crowdsource data so we can map air quality on every street,

88
0:04:12.667,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to build an unprecedented database

89
0:04:14.833,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so scientists can research pollution,

90
0:04:17.25,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and to empower citizens, civic leaders, policy makers

91
0:04:21.458,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to support clean-air policies for change.

92
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Because this can and must change.

93
0:04:28.875,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Remember cigarettes in bars?

94
0:04:31.166,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It took decades of lung cancer research and second-hand smoking studies,

95
0:04:35.625,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but eventually, we reached a tipping point and we passed smoking-ban laws.

96
0:04:39.333,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We must reach the same tipping point for air quality and I believe we will.

97
0:04:43.167,000 --> 0:04:44,000
In the past couple years alone,

98
0:04:44.958,000 --> 0:04:46,000
governments have fined carmakers record amounts

99
0:04:47.625,000 --> 0:04:48,000
for cheating on emission standards.

100
0:04:49.375,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Cities have passed congestion charges or built bike lanes --

101
0:04:52.917,000 --> 0:04:54,000
like Paris that turned this highway,

102
0:04:55.625,000 --> 0:04:57,000
right next to my home, in the middle of the city,

103
0:04:57.958,000 --> 0:04:58,000
into a waterfront park.

104
0:04:59.75,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And now mayors around the world are thinking of banning diesel outright

105
0:05:03.458,000 --> 0:05:06,000
by 2025, 2030, 2035.

106
0:05:07.875,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But how much faster could we go, how many lives could we save?

107
0:05:12.042,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Technology alone will not solve climate change,

108
0:05:15.25,000 --> 0:05:17,000
nor will it make air pollution disappear overnight.

109
0:05:18.208,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But it can make the quality of our air much more transparent,

110
0:05:22.542,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and if we can empower people

111
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to take action to improve their own health,

112
0:05:26.167,000 --> 0:05:29,000
then together we can act to bring an end to our pollution.

113
0:05:30.375,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Thank you very much.

114
0:05:31.667,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Applause)

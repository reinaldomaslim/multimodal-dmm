2
0:00:15.572,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I collaborate with bacteria.

3
0:00:17.71,000 --> 0:00:17,000
And I'm about to show you

4
0:00:18.592,000 --> 0:00:2,000
some stop-motion footage that I made recently

5
0:00:20.772,000 --> 0:00:22,000
where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals

6
0:00:23.006,000 --> 0:00:24,000
from their environment

7
0:00:24.556,000 --> 0:00:25,000
over the period of an hour.

8
0:00:26.49,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So what you're seeing here

9
0:00:27.855,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is the bacteria metabolizing,

10
0:00:30.073,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and as they do so

11
0:00:31.272,000 --> 0:00:32,000
they create an electrical charge.

12
0:00:32.878,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And this attracts metals

13
0:00:35.211,000 --> 0:00:37,000
from their local environment.

14
0:00:37.378,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And these metals accumulate as minerals

15
0:00:40.295,000 --> 0:00:41,000
on the surface of the bacteria.

16
0:00:42.212,000 --> 0:00:44,000
One of the most pervasive problems

17
0:00:44.379,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in the world today for people

18
0:00:46.128,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is inadequate access

19
0:00:47.545,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to clean drinking water.

20
0:00:49.296,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And the desalination process

21
0:00:50.962,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is one where we take out salts.

22
0:00:52.746,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We can use it for drinking and agriculture.

23
0:00:55.261,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Removing the salts from water --

24
0:00:57.346,000 --> 0:00:58,000
particularly seawater --

25
0:00:58.607,000 --> 0:00:59,000
through reverse osmosis

26
0:01:00.211,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is a critical technique

27
0:01:01.529,000 --> 0:01:04,000
for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water

28
0:01:04.761,000 --> 0:01:05,000
around the globe.

29
0:01:05.88,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So seawater reverse osmosis

30
0:01:07.344,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is a membrane-filtration technology.

31
0:01:09.511,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We take the water from the sea

32
0:01:12.081,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and we apply pressure.

33
0:01:13.612,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And this pressure forces the seawater

34
0:01:16.536,000 --> 0:01:17,000
through a membrane.

35
0:01:17.836,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This takes energy,

36
0:01:19.271,000 --> 0:01:21,000
producing clean water.

37
0:01:21.803,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine.

38
0:01:25.504,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But the process is very expensive

39
0:01:26.917,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.

40
0:01:29.551,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And also, the brine that's produced

41
0:01:31.333,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.

42
0:01:34.217,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And this is detrimental to the local ecology

43
0:01:36.765,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of the sea area that it's pumped back out into.

44
0:01:39.2,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So I work in Singapore at the moment,

45
0:01:41.216,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and this is a place that's really a leading place

46
0:01:43.983,000 --> 0:01:45,000
for desalination technology.

47
0:01:45.984,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And Singapore proposes by 2060

48
0:01:48.534,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to produce [900] million liters per day

49
0:01:51.633,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of desalinated water.

50
0:01:53.466,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But this will produce an equally massive amount

51
0:01:56.816,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of desalination brine.

52
0:01:58.569,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.

53
0:02:01.767,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So what we're doing at the moment

54
0:02:03.716,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is we're accumulating metals

55
0:02:06.382,000 --> 0:02:07,000
like calcium, potassium and magnesium

56
0:02:08.366,000 --> 0:02:1,000
from out of desalination brine.

57
0:02:10.6,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And this, in terms of magnesium

58
0:02:12.882,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and the amount of water that I just mentioned,

59
0:02:15.432,000 --> 0:02:17,000
equates to a $4.5 billion

60
0:02:18.382,000 --> 0:02:2,000
mining industry for Singapore --

61
0:02:20.797,000 --> 0:02:22,000
a place that doesn't have any natural resources.

62
0:02:23.331,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So I'd like you to image a mining industry

63
0:02:25.981,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in a way that one hasn't existed before;

64
0:02:28.07,000 --> 0:02:3,000
imagine a mining industry

65
0:02:30.236,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that doesn't mean defiling the Earth;

66
0:02:32.503,000 --> 0:02:34,000
imagine bacteria helping us do this

67
0:02:34.614,000 --> 0:02:37,000
by accumulating and precipitating

68
0:02:38.086,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and sedimenting minerals

69
0:02:40.503,000 --> 0:02:41,000
out of desalination brine.

70
0:02:42.352,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And what you can see here

71
0:02:43.77,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is the beginning of an industry in a test tube,

72
0:02:46.252,000 --> 0:02:49,000
a mining industry that is in harmony with nature.

73
0:02:49.602,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Thank you.

74
0:02:50.953,000 --> 0:02:53,000

0:00:12.939,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was in my 20s,

3
0:00:14.484,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I saw my very first psychotherapy client.

4
0:00:18.484,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.

5
0:00:22.435,000 --> 0:00:25,000
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.

6
0:00:26.284,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,

7
0:00:30.953,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and she dropped onto the couch in my office

8
0:00:33.064,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and kicked off her flats

9
0:00:34.757,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and told me she was there to talk about guy problems.

10
0:00:38.813,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.

11
0:00:43.091,000 --> 0:00:46,000
My classmate got an arsonist for her first client.

12
0:00:46.116,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:47.986,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.

14
0:00:52.494,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This I thought I could handle.

15
0:00:55.328,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But I didn't handle it.

16
0:00:57.536,000 --> 0:00:59,000
With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session,

17
0:01:00.227,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it was easy for me just to nod my head

18
0:01:02.226,000 --> 0:01:04,000
while we kicked the can down the road.

19
0:01:04.416,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,

20
0:01:06.696,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and as far as I could tell, she was right.

21
0:01:09.726,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Work happened later, marriage happened later,

22
0:01:11.976,000 --> 0:01:14,000
kids happened later, even death happened later.

23
0:01:15.847,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.

24
0:01:20.794,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life.

25
0:01:26.414,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I pushed back.

26
0:01:28.186,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I said, "Sure, she's dating down,

27
0:01:30.701,000 --> 0:01:32,000
she's sleeping with a knucklehead,

28
0:01:33.036,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but it's not like she's going to marry the guy."

29
0:01:36.542,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And then my supervisor said,

30
0:01:38.275,000 --> 0:01:41,000
"Not yet, but she might marry the next one.

31
0:01:42.644,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage

32
0:01:46.507,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is before she has one."

33
0:01:50.359,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That's what psychologists call an "Aha!" moment.

34
0:01:53.274,000 --> 0:01:56,000
That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.

35
0:01:56.81,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Yes, people settle down later than they used to,

36
0:01:59.199,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime.

37
0:02:03.598,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot,

38
0:02:07.11,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and we were sitting there, blowing it.

39
0:02:10.507,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect

40
0:02:14.192,000 --> 0:02:17,000
was a real problem, and it had real consequences,

41
0:02:18.189,000 --> 0:02:2,000
not just for Alex and her love life

42
0:02:20.603,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but for the careers and the families and the futures

43
0:02:23.754,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of twentysomethings everywhere.

44
0:02:27.635,000 --> 0:02:3,000
There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now.

45
0:02:31.923,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We're talking about 15 percent of the population,

46
0:02:35.73,000 --> 0:02:37,000
or 100 percent if you consider

47
0:02:38.022,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first.

48
0:02:42.589,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:43.712,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.

50
0:02:45.782,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I really want to see some twentysomethings here.

51
0:02:48.092,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Oh, yay! You are all awesome.

52
0:02:49.621,000 --> 0:02:52,000
If you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething,

53
0:02:53.566,000 --> 0:02:55,000
you're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see —

54
0:02:56.434,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Okay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter.

55
0:03:01.002,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So, I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe

56
0:03:04.613,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings

57
0:03:08.511,000 --> 0:03:11,000
deserves to know what psychologists,

58
0:03:11.74,000 --> 0:03:14,000
sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists

59
0:03:15.46,000 --> 0:03:16,000
already know:

60
0:03:17.278,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest,

61
0:03:20.468,000 --> 0:03:22,000
yet most transformative, things you can do

62
0:03:23.247,000 --> 0:03:25,000
for work, for love, for your happiness,

63
0:03:25.942,000 --> 0:03:26,000
maybe even for the world.

64
0:03:28.618,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is not my opinion.

65
0:03:30.477,000 --> 0:03:31,000
These are the facts.

66
0:03:33.262,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments

67
0:03:36.44,000 --> 0:03:38,000
take place by age 35.

68
0:03:39.813,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That means that eight out of 10

69
0:03:42.039,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of the decisions and experiences and "Aha!" moments

70
0:03:45.358,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that make your life what it is

71
0:03:47.502,000 --> 0:03:49,000
will have happened by your mid-30s.

72
0:03:50.872,000 --> 0:03:51,000
People who are over 40, don't panic.

73
0:03:52.729,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This crowd is going to be fine, I think.

74
0:03:55.799,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We know that the first 10 years of a career

75
0:03:58.164,000 --> 0:04:02,000
has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.

76
0:04:02.796,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We know that more than half of Americans

77
0:04:04.932,000 --> 0:04:08,000
are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30.

78
0:04:09.999,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We know that the brain caps off

79
0:04:11.746,000 --> 0:04:14,000
its second and last growth spurt in your 20s

80
0:04:14.77,000 --> 0:04:16,000
as it rewires itself for adulthood,

81
0:04:17.64,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself,

82
0:04:21.717,000 --> 0:04:23,000
now is the time to change it.

83
0:04:24.536,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We know that personality changes more during your 20s

84
0:04:27.782,000 --> 0:04:29,000
than at any other time in life,

85
0:04:30.488,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28,

86
0:04:34.354,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and things get tricky after age 35.

87
0:04:38.01,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So your 20s are the time to educate yourself

88
0:04:40.862,000 --> 0:04:42,000
about your body and your options.

89
0:04:44.749,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So when we think about child development,

90
0:04:46.726,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we all know that the first five years are a critical period

91
0:04:50.691,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for language and attachment in the brain.

92
0:04:54.292,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life

93
0:04:57.227,000 --> 0:05:,000
has an inordinate impact on who you will become.

94
0:05:02.056,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing

95
0:05:04.795,000 --> 0:05:05,000
as adult development,

96
0:05:05.976,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and our 20s are that critical period of adult development.

97
0:05:11.731,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing.

98
0:05:14.829,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood.

99
0:05:19.131,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.

100
0:05:22.923,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings

101
0:05:25.573,000 --> 0:05:26,000
like "twixters" and "kidults."

102
0:05:28.605,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughing) It's true!

103
0:05:30.805,000 --> 0:05:32,000
As a culture, we have trivialized

104
0:05:33.274,000 --> 0:05:37,000
what is actually the defining decade of adulthood.

105
0:05:39.613,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things,

106
0:05:42.115,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you need a plan and not quite enough time.

107
0:05:46.07,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughing) Isn't that true?

108
0:05:48.327,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So what do you think happens

109
0:05:49.933,000 --> 0:05:51,000
when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say,

110
0:05:52.577,000 --> 0:05:54,000
"You have 10 extra years to start your life"?

111
0:05:56.013,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Nothing happens.

112
0:05:58.07,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition,

113
0:06:01.679,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and absolutely nothing happens.

114
0:06:04.657,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings

115
0:06:08.269,000 --> 0:06:11,000
like you or like your sons and daughters

116
0:06:11.527,000 --> 0:06:14,000
come into my office and say things like this:

117
0:06:16.448,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"I know my boyfriend's no good for me,

118
0:06:18.29,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."

119
0:06:22.854,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Or they say, "Everybody says as long as I get started

120
0:06:25.759,000 --> 0:06:27,000
on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine."

121
0:06:29.438,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But then it starts to sound like this:

122
0:06:32.697,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.

123
0:06:36.578,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college."

124
0:06:41.424,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And then it starts to sound like this:

125
0:06:44.89,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.

126
0:06:46.976,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Everybody was running around and having fun,

127
0:06:49.845,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off

128
0:06:52.725,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and everybody started sitting down.

129
0:06:55.235,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I didn't want to be the only one left standing up,

130
0:06:57.608,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so sometimes I think I married my husband

131
0:06:59.649,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because he was the closest chair to me at 30."

132
0:07:03.381,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Where are the twentysomethings here?

133
0:07:05.198,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Do not do that.

134
0:07:07.565,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:09.418,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Okay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake,

136
0:07:12.542,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the stakes are very high.

137
0:07:15.121,000 --> 0:07:17,000
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,

138
0:07:17.185,000 --> 0:07:19,000
there is enormous thirtysomething pressure

139
0:07:19.512,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up,

140
0:07:23.282,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.

141
0:07:27.658,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Many of these things are incompatible,

142
0:07:29.89,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and as research is just starting to show,

143
0:07:32.463,000 --> 0:07:36,000
simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.

144
0:07:38.828,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car.

145
0:07:43.608,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's realizing you can't have that career you now want.

146
0:07:48.482,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's realizing you can't have that child you now want,

147
0:07:51.673,000 --> 0:07:53,000
or you can't give your child a sibling.

148
0:07:55.339,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings

149
0:07:57.618,000 --> 0:08:01,000
look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room,

150
0:08:01.644,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and say about their 20s,

151
0:08:03.738,000 --> 0:08:06,000
"What was I doing? What was I thinking?"

152
0:08:09.333,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.

153
0:08:13.131,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Here's a story about how that can go.

154
0:08:15.35,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's a story about a woman named Emma.

155
0:08:19.61,000 --> 0:08:21,000
At 25, Emma came to my office

156
0:08:21.898,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.

157
0:08:27.192,000 --> 0:08:3,000
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment,

158
0:08:30.606,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but she hadn't decided yet,

159
0:08:32.191,000 --> 0:08:35,000
so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.

160
0:08:37.118,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend

161
0:08:39.499,000 --> 0:08:42,000
who displayed his temper more than his ambition.

162
0:08:43.537,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And as hard as her 20s were,

163
0:08:45.304,000 --> 0:08:47,000
her early life had been even harder.

164
0:08:48.346,000 --> 0:08:49,000
She often cried in our sessions,

165
0:08:50.236,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but then would collect herself by saying,

166
0:08:52.461,000 --> 0:08:55,000
"You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."

167
0:08:57.145,000 --> 0:09:,000
Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap,

168
0:09:00.414,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and she sobbed for most of the hour.

169
0:09:04.431,000 --> 0:09:05,000
She'd just bought a new address book,

170
0:09:06.281,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts,

171
0:09:09.981,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank

172
0:09:12.615,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that comes after the words

173
0:09:14.329,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"In case of emergency, please call ..."

174
0:09:18.808,000 --> 0:09:2,000
She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said,

175
0:09:21.564,000 --> 0:09:24,000
"Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?

176
0:09:24.864,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer?"

177
0:09:29.118,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now in that moment, it took everything I had

178
0:09:31.647,000 --> 0:09:32,000
not to say, "I will."

179
0:09:34.46,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared.

180
0:09:38.372,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.

181
0:09:43.761,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex

182
0:09:46.657,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to just sit there while Emma's defining decade

183
0:09:50.267,000 --> 0:09:51,000
went parading by.

184
0:09:53.46,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So over the next weeks and months,

185
0:09:55.127,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I told Emma three things

186
0:09:57.674,000 --> 0:10:,000
that every twentysomething, male or female,

187
0:10:00.833,000 --> 0:10:01,000
deserves to hear.

188
0:10:03.984,000 --> 0:10:06,000
First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis

189
0:10:08.006,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and get some identity capital.

190
0:10:11.273,000 --> 0:10:12,000
By "get identity capital,"

191
0:10:12.947,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I mean do something that adds value to who you are.

192
0:10:17.305,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Do something that's an investment

193
0:10:19.104,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in who you might want to be next.

194
0:10:22.555,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I didn't know the future of Emma's career,

195
0:10:24.93,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and no one knows the future of work,

196
0:10:27.191,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but I do know this:

197
0:10:28.884,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Identity capital begets identity capital.

198
0:10:32.632,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So now is the time for that cross-country job,

199
0:10:35.414,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that internship, that startup you want to try.

200
0:10:38.924,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here,

201
0:10:42.377,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count,

202
0:10:47.351,000 --> 0:10:49,000
which, by the way, is not exploration.

203
0:10:49.986,000 --> 0:10:5,000
That's procrastination.

204
0:10:52.66,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I told Emma to explore work and make it count.

205
0:10:58.676,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.

206
0:11:03.915,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport,

207
0:11:06.89,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers

208
0:11:10.668,000 --> 0:11:11,000
limit who they know,

209
0:11:12.173,000 --> 0:11:14,000
what they know, how they think,

210
0:11:14.571,000 --> 0:11:16,000
how they speak, and where they work.

211
0:11:18.181,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That new piece of capital, that new person to date

212
0:11:20.773,000 --> 0:11:23,000
almost always comes from outside the inner circle.

213
0:11:24.476,000 --> 0:11:27,000
New things come from what are called our weak ties,

214
0:11:27.998,000 --> 0:11:29,000
our friends of friends of friends.

215
0:11:30.866,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.

216
0:11:35.731,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But half aren't,

217
0:11:37.071,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.

218
0:11:40.831,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Half of new jobs are never posted,

219
0:11:43.424,000 --> 0:11:47,000
so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job.

220
0:11:48.462,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.

221
0:11:53.433,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Last but not least, Emma believed

222
0:11:55.449,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.

223
0:11:59.338,000 --> 0:12:,000
Now this was true for her growing up,

224
0:12:01.208,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family

225
0:12:04.496,000 --> 0:12:07,000
when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.

226
0:12:09.335,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.

227
0:12:14.404,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down

228
0:12:18.57,000 --> 0:12:21,000
than 20, or even 25,

229
0:12:21.721,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and I agree with you.

230
0:12:23.674,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with

231
0:12:26.627,000 --> 0:12:29,000
when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle

232
0:12:29.738,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is not progress.

233
0:12:32.994,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one,

234
0:12:36.508,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and that means being as intentional with love

235
0:12:39.315,000 --> 0:12:4,000
as you are with work.

236
0:12:41.825,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Picking your family is about consciously choosing

237
0:12:44.376,000 --> 0:12:46,000
who and what you want

238
0:12:46.65,000 --> 0:12:49,000
rather than just making it work or killing time

239
0:12:50.226,000 --> 0:12:52,000
with whoever happens to be choosing you.

240
0:12:53.963,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So what happened to Emma?

241
0:12:56.035,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Well, we went through that address book,

242
0:12:58.249,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and she found an old roommate's cousin

243
0:13:00.166,000 --> 0:13:02,000
who worked at an art museum in another state.

244
0:13:03.671,000 --> 0:13:05,000
That weak tie helped her get a job there.

245
0:13:06.37,000 --> 0:13:09,000
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend.

246
0:13:11.216,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums.

247
0:13:15.022,000 --> 0:13:18,000
She's married to a man she mindfully chose.

248
0:13:18.399,000 --> 0:13:21,000
She loves her new career, she loves her new family,

249
0:13:21.475,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and she sent me a card that said,

250
0:13:23.622,000 --> 0:13:24,000
"Now the emergency contact blanks

251
0:13:25.634,000 --> 0:13:26,000
don't seem big enough."

252
0:13:29.407,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Now Emma's story made that sound easy,

253
0:13:31.702,000 --> 0:13:33,000
but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings.

254
0:13:34.536,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They are so easy to help.

255
0:13:36.923,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX,

256
0:13:40.573,000 --> 0:13:41,000
bound for somewhere west.

257
0:13:43.479,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Right after takeoff, a slight change in course

258
0:13:46.237,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.

259
0:13:51.678,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,

260
0:13:56.895,000 --> 0:13:58,000
one good conversation, one good break,

261
0:13:59.697,000 --> 0:14:02,000
one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect

262
0:14:03.004,000 --> 0:14:06,000
across years and even generations to come.

263
0:14:07.762,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So here's an idea worth spreading

264
0:14:09.612,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to every twentysomething you know.

265
0:14:12.407,000 --> 0:14:14,000
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.

266
0:14:15.062,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It's what I now have the privilege

267
0:14:17.303,000 --> 0:14:2,000
of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day:

268
0:14:22.456,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood,

269
0:14:26.142,000 --> 0:14:29,000
get some identity capital, use your weak ties,

270
0:14:29.739,000 --> 0:14:3,000
pick your family.

271
0:14:32.106,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Don't be defined by what you didn't know

272
0:14:34.533,000 --> 0:14:35,000
or didn't do.

273
0:14:36.102,000 --> 0:14:38,000
You're deciding your life right now.

274
0:14:39.308,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Thank you.

275
0:14:40.342,000 --> 0:14:43,000
(Applause)

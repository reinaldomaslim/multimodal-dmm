1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
On a beautiful day, just a few years ago

2
0:00:15.48,000 --> 0:00:17,000
my wife and I entered a hospital

3
0:00:17.92,000 --> 0:00:18,000
near our home in Oakland, California

4
0:00:19.72,000 --> 0:00:21,000
for the birth of our first daughter, Maya.

5
0:00:22.6,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We had responsibly toured the birthing center in advance

6
0:00:25.28,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and yet we were somehow still startled to find ourselves

7
0:00:28.239,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the place where we would experience

8
0:00:30.12,000 --> 0:00:32,000
one of the most significant moments of our lives.

9
0:00:33.28,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We were stuck in a windowless room

10
0:00:35.8,000 --> 0:00:38,000
with no hint of the bright and sunny day that we had left.

11
0:00:40.72,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead,

12
0:00:44.04,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the paint on the walls was beige

13
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and machines beeped inexplicably

14
0:00:49.44,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as a wall clock indicated day turning to night.

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
That clock was placed above a door

16
0:00:55.52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in direct line of sight

17
0:00:57.52,000 --> 0:01:,000
to where my wife lay as her contractions increased hour after hour.

18
0:01:02.32,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now, I've never given birth --

19
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:05.2,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but she assured me that the last thing that a birthing woman would ever want

21
0:01:10.12,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is to watch the seconds tick by.

22
0:01:12.92,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:15.6,000 --> 0:01:17,000
An architect by training, I've always been fascinated

24
0:01:18.12,000 --> 0:01:21,000
watching people experience design in the world around them.

25
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I believe design functions like the soundtrack

26
0:01:23.68,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that we're not even fully aware is playing.

27
0:01:26.44,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It sends us subconscious messages about how to feel

28
0:01:30.04,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and what to expect.

29
0:01:32.8,000 --> 0:01:36,000
That room that we were in seemed completely misaligned

30
0:01:36.84,000 --> 0:01:38,000
with the moment that we were experiencing --

31
0:01:39.8,000 --> 0:01:4,000
welcoming a human being,

32
0:01:41.72,000 --> 0:01:43,000
our daughter, into this world.

33
0:01:44.48,000 --> 0:01:47,000
At one point a nurse, without any prompt,

34
0:01:47.52,000 --> 0:01:48,000
turned to us and said,

35
0:01:49.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"I always think to myself,

36
0:01:50.92,000 --> 0:01:51,000
'I wish I had become an architect,

37
0:01:52.8,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because I could have designed rooms like this better.'"

38
0:01:55.8,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I said to her,

39
0:01:57.04,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"An architect did design this room."

40
0:01:59.44,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:02.2,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Despite the immense joy of our daughter's birth,

42
0:02:05.88,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the messages of that hospital room stick with she and I to this day.

43
0:02:13.52,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Those messages are,

44
0:02:14.84,000 --> 0:02:15,000
"You are not at home,

45
0:02:16.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
you are in a foreign place."

46
0:02:18.2,000 --> 0:02:19,000
"You are not in control of anything.

47
0:02:20.039,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Not even the lighting."

48
0:02:22.36,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"Your comfort, simply, is secondary."

49
0:02:27.72,000 --> 0:02:28,000
At best,

50
0:02:28.96,000 --> 0:02:29,000
a hospital room like this

51
0:02:30.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
might just be described or dismissed as uninspiring.

52
0:02:33.6,000 --> 0:02:35,000
At worst, it is undignifying.

53
0:02:37.2,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I use it to point out that none of us,

54
0:02:40.04,000 --> 0:02:41,000
anywhere in the world,

55
0:02:41.64,000 --> 0:02:43,000
are immune from bad design.

56
0:02:45.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I went into architecture because I believed

57
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it was about creating spaces for people to live their best lives.

58
0:02:54.48,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And yet what I found is a profession largely disconnected

59
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:03:02,000
from the people most directly impacted by its work.

60
0:03:04.24,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I believe this is because architecture remains

61
0:03:07.76,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a white, male, elitist profession --

62
0:03:11.56,000 --> 0:03:12,000
seemingly unconcerned

63
0:03:13.44,000 --> 0:03:15,000
with some of the greatest needs in the world

64
0:03:16.24,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or even the relatively simple needs of an expectant mother.

65
0:03:22.04,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Students are trained in school

66
0:03:24.12,000 --> 0:03:26,000
using highly theoretical projects,

67
0:03:26.44,000 --> 0:03:29,000
rarely interacting with real people or actual communities.

68
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Graduates are funneled through a long, narrow

69
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
unforgiving path to licensure.

70
0:03:35.32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Meanwhile, the profession holds up a select few

71
0:03:38.2,000 --> 0:03:39,000
through relentless award programs

72
0:03:40.2,000 --> 0:03:43,000
focused almost exclusively on the aesthetics of buildings,

73
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
rather than the societal impact or contributions of them.

74
0:03:48.36,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It only goes to reinforce a warped view

75
0:03:51.04,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of professional responsibility and success

76
0:03:54.2,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and yet this isn't why so many young, hopeful people

77
0:03:58,000 --> 0:03:59,000
go into architecture.

78
0:03:59.72,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's not why I did.

79
0:04:01.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I believed then, though I didn't have a language for it,

80
0:04:05.04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I know now, that design has a unique ability to dignify.

81
0:04:10.52,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It can make people feel valued,

82
0:04:12.84,000 --> 0:04:13,000
respected,

83
0:04:14.12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
honored and seen.

84
0:04:18.36,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now I'd like for you to just think about some of the spaces that you inhabit.

85
0:04:23.52,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And I'd like to have you think about how they make you feel.

86
0:04:28.079,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, there are places that make us feel unhappy,

87
0:04:32.68,000 --> 0:04:33,000
unhealthy

88
0:04:34.28,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or uninspiring.

89
0:04:36.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They may be the places that you work

90
0:04:39.08,000 --> 0:04:4,000
or where you heal

91
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or even where you live.

92
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I ask, how might these places be better designed with you in mind?

93
0:04:48.32,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It's a really simple question

94
0:04:49.76,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and it can somehow, sometimes be very difficult to answer.

95
0:04:53.2,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Because we are conditioned to feel like we don't have much agency

96
0:04:56.32,000 --> 0:04:59,000
over the spaces and places that we live, work and play.

97
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:,000
And in many cases we don't.

98
0:05:01.88,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But we all should.

99
0:05:04.04,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, here's a potentially dumb question for any women watching:

100
0:05:07.96,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Have you ever stood

101
0:05:09.24,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in a disproportionately long bathroom line?

102
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:13.48,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Did you ever think to yourself, "What is wrong with this picture?"

104
0:05:16.92,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Well, what if the real question is,

105
0:05:18.92,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"What is wrong with the men that designed these bathrooms?"

106
0:05:22.4,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Applause)

107
0:05:28.32,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It may seem like a small thing,

108
0:05:29.96,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but it's representative of a much more serious issue.

109
0:05:33.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The contemporary world was literally built by men

110
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
who have rarely taken the time to understand

111
0:05:41.12,000 --> 0:05:43,000
how people unlike them

112
0:05:43.44,000 --> 0:05:45,000
experience their designs.

113
0:05:45.76,000 --> 0:05:48,000
A long bathroom line might seem like a minor indignity.

114
0:05:48.84,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But the opposite can also be true.

115
0:05:50.84,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Thoughtful design can make people feel respected

116
0:05:54.56,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and seen.

117
0:05:56.4,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I've come to believe that dignity is to design

118
0:05:59.92,000 --> 0:06:01,000
what justice is to law

119
0:06:02.12,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and health is to medicine.

120
0:06:04.84,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In the simplest of terms,

121
0:06:06.12,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it's about having the spaces you inhabit reflect back your value.

122
0:06:12.6,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Over the past two years

123
0:06:14.2,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I had the opportunity to interview over 100 people from all walks of life

124
0:06:18.84,000 --> 0:06:2,000
about their experience of design.

125
0:06:21.2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I wanted to test my hunch

126
0:06:23.44,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that dignity and design are uniquely related.

127
0:06:27.24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I listened to Gregory,

128
0:06:28.76,000 --> 0:06:3,000
a resident of this cottage community

129
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:32,000
designed specifically

130
0:06:32.84,000 --> 0:06:35,000
for the 50 most chronically homeless people in Dallas.

131
0:06:36.72,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Gregory had been living on the streets,

132
0:06:39.48,000 --> 0:06:42,000
drifting from town to town for over 30 years.

133
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:45,000
A broad coalition

134
0:06:46.32,000 --> 0:06:47,000
of social service agencies,

135
0:06:48.2,000 --> 0:06:49,000
funders and designers,

136
0:06:49.64,000 --> 0:06:51,000
created this place.

137
0:06:53.2,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Each 400 square foot cottage is designed beautifully

138
0:06:57.36,000 --> 0:06:58,000
as a permanent home.

139
0:06:59.6,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Gregory now has a key

140
0:07:02.04,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to a door

141
0:07:03.52,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to his own house.

142
0:07:04.96,000 --> 0:07:07,000
He describes the sense of security that it brings him.

143
0:07:08.24,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Something he had lived without for three decades.

144
0:07:12.24,000 --> 0:07:15,000
When he arrived with little more than the clothes on his back,

145
0:07:15.72,000 --> 0:07:16,000
he found everything:

146
0:07:17.2,000 --> 0:07:2,000
from a toaster, Crock-Pot and stove

147
0:07:20.8,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to a toothbrush and toothpaste awaiting for him.

148
0:07:25.04,000 --> 0:07:26,000
He describes it simply

149
0:07:27.84,000 --> 0:07:28,000
as heaven.

150
0:07:30.68,000 --> 0:07:31,000
On the other side of the world,

151
0:07:33.36,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I listened to Antoinette,

152
0:07:35.04,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the director of this training and community center

153
0:07:37.88,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for women in rural Rwanda.

154
0:07:40.32,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Hundreds of women come to this place daily --

155
0:07:43.84,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to learn new skills,

156
0:07:45.64,000 --> 0:07:46,000
be in community,

157
0:07:47.04,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and continue rebuilding their lives

158
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:49,000
following the country's civil war.

159
0:07:51.2,000 --> 0:07:53,000
These women literally pressed

160
0:07:54.08,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the 500,000 bricks

161
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
that make up the 17 classroom pavilions like this one.

162
0:08:01.92,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Antoinette told me,

163
0:08:03.4,000 --> 0:08:05,000
"Everyone is so proud of it."

164
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And then back here in the US

165
0:08:09.4,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I listened to Monika,

166
0:08:11.08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the director of a free clinic

167
0:08:13.4,000 --> 0:08:16,000
primarily serving the uninsured in Arkansas.

168
0:08:17.72,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Monika loves telling me that the doctors,

169
0:08:21.12,000 --> 0:08:23,000
who volunteer at her free clinic

170
0:08:23.68,000 --> 0:08:25,000
routinely tell her

171
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that they've never worked in such a beautiful, light-filled place.

172
0:08:31.32,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Monika believes

173
0:08:32.96,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that even people experiencing poverty

174
0:08:35.04,000 --> 0:08:37,000
deserve quality health care.

175
0:08:37.56,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And what's more,

176
0:08:38.88,000 --> 0:08:41,000
she believes they deserve to receive that care

177
0:08:42.32,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in a dignified setting.

178
0:08:44.64,000 --> 0:08:47,000
People like these are invaluable ambassadors for design

179
0:08:48.44,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and yet they are roundly absent from architectural discourse.

180
0:08:53.12,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Similarly, the people who can most benefit from good design

181
0:08:57.28,000 --> 0:08:59,000
often have the least access to it.

182
0:09:00.48,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Your cousin, a homeless veteran;

183
0:09:02.52,000 --> 0:09:03,000
your grandma or grandpa

184
0:09:04.12,000 --> 0:09:07,000
who live in a house with a kitchen that's no longer accessible to them;

185
0:09:07.64,000 --> 0:09:08,000
your wheelchair-bound sister

186
0:09:09.36,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in a suburban area planned without sidewalks.

187
0:09:14.24,000 --> 0:09:17,000
If good design is only for a privileged few,

188
0:09:17.84,000 --> 0:09:18,000
what good is it?

189
0:09:20.32,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's time designers change this

190
0:09:23.8,000 --> 0:09:26,000
by dedicating their practices to the public good

191
0:09:26.96,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the model of firms

192
0:09:28.72,000 --> 0:09:29,000
like Orkidstudio,

193
0:09:30.44,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Studio Gang

194
0:09:31.88,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and MASS Design Group.

195
0:09:33.76,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Their clients

196
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
are orphaned children in Kenya,

197
0:09:37.76,000 --> 0:09:39,000
foster children in Chicago

198
0:09:40.28,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and pregnant women in Malawi.

199
0:09:42.96,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Their practices are premised on the belief

200
0:09:46.52,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that everyone deserves good design.

201
0:09:52.4,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Dedicating more practices to the public good

202
0:09:54.68,000 --> 0:09:57,000
will not only create more design that is dignifying,

203
0:09:58.64,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but it will also dignify the practice of design.

204
0:10:02.72,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It will not only diversify the client base of design,

205
0:10:06.04,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but it will also create new, more diverse forms of design

206
0:10:10.52,000 --> 0:10:11,000
for the world.

207
0:10:13.56,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now, in order to do this,

208
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
my architecture and design friends, especially my fellow white guys,

209
0:10:19.8,000 --> 0:10:24,000
we must simultaneously and significantly diversify our ranks.

210
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
If we want the public to believe that design is for them

211
0:10:28.24,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and for everyone.

212
0:10:29.64,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Today, barely 15 percent

213
0:10:32.52,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of registered architects in the United States are women.

214
0:10:35.2,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And a far smaller percentage are persons of color.

215
0:10:39.76,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Other professions, like law and medicine

216
0:10:41.88,000 --> 0:10:44,000
had made far greater strides in these crucial areas.

217
0:10:45.84,000 --> 0:10:47,000
How might our shared built environment --

218
0:10:47.92,000 --> 0:10:5,000
our homes, our hospitals, our schools, our public spaces --

219
0:10:51.8,000 --> 0:10:52,000
be shaped differently

220
0:10:53.08,000 --> 0:10:54,000
if women and people of color

221
0:10:54.48,000 --> 0:10:56,000
were behind half of the proverbial blueprints?

222
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It is not a question of whether,

223
0:10:59.28,000 --> 0:11:,000
but to what extent

224
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
our buildings, our landscapes,

225
0:11:03.48,000 --> 0:11:05,000
our cities and our rural communities

226
0:11:06.04,000 --> 0:11:09,000
are less beautiful, less functional,

227
0:11:09.2,000 --> 0:11:11,000
less equitable and less dignifying

228
0:11:11.88,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because women and people of color are less likely to be creating them.

229
0:11:16.88,000 --> 0:11:19,000
As Winston Churchill famously noted in 1943

230
0:11:20.08,000 --> 0:11:21,000
when he called for the rebuilding

231
0:11:21.72,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of London's war-damaged parliamentary chambers,

232
0:11:24.44,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"We shape our buildings, and afterward, they shape us."

233
0:11:30.52,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The good news is that we can change how we build

234
0:11:33.96,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and who we build for.

235
0:11:35.68,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Be that a health worker in rural Rwanda,

236
0:11:38.76,000 --> 0:11:41,000
or a birthing mother and nervous new father in the United States.

237
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We can do this by recommitting architecture

238
0:11:45.64,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to the health, safety and welfare of the public.

239
0:11:49.96,000 --> 0:11:5,000
This will pay dividends.

240
0:11:51.88,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Because once you see what design can do,

241
0:11:54.76,000 --> 0:11:55,000
you can't unsee it.

242
0:11:56.72,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And once you experience dignity,

243
0:11:59.08,000 --> 0:12:01,000
you can't accept anything less.

244
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Both become part of your possible.

245
0:12:04.92,000 --> 0:12:07,000
One of my favorite conversation partners is my 90-year-old grandmother,

246
0:12:08.68,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Audrey Gorwitz, from Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

247
0:12:11.6,000 --> 0:12:13,000
After one of our conversations about design,

248
0:12:14.28,000 --> 0:12:15,000
she wrote me a letter.

249
0:12:15.6,000 --> 0:12:16,000
She said, "Dear Johnny,

250
0:12:18.36,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I thought the other day, as I sat in my doctor's office,

251
0:12:21.04,000 --> 0:12:22,000
how depressing it was,

252
0:12:22.32,000 --> 0:12:24,000
from the color on the wall, to the carpet on the floor.

253
0:12:24.96,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:26.12,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Now I will have to call to see

255
0:12:27.92,000 --> 0:12:29,000
who is responsible for the drabness in that place."

256
0:12:30.6,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Laughter)

257
0:12:32.76,000 --> 0:12:33,000
In the same letter, mind you, she said,

258
0:12:34.68,000 --> 0:12:36,000
"I did call, and I got the man in charge,

259
0:12:36.88,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and he said he appreciated someone calling him.

260
0:12:39.52,000 --> 0:12:42,000
My doctor's office is now on the list for an upgrade."

261
0:12:42.92,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Laughter)

262
0:12:44.44,000 --> 0:12:45,000
She signed it by saying,

263
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
"It is always good to express one's opinion

264
0:12:48.08,000 --> 0:12:49,000
if done in a proper manner."

265
0:12:49.48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Laughter)

266
0:12:51.76,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Applause)

267
0:12:55.08,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I love my grandma.

268
0:12:56.48,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

269
0:12:58,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Like my grandma Audrey,

270
0:12:59.8,000 --> 0:13:02,000
you deserve good design.

271
0:13:03.28,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Because well-designed spaces

272
0:13:05.04,000 --> 0:13:08,000
are not just a matter of taste or a questions of aesthetics.

273
0:13:08.56,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They literally shape our ideas about who we are in the world

274
0:13:12.08,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and what we deserve.

275
0:13:14.08,000 --> 0:13:16,000
That is the essence of dignity.

276
0:13:16.52,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And both the opportunity and the responsibility of design

277
0:13:20.64,000 --> 0:13:21,000
for good

278
0:13:21.88,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and for all.

279
0:13:23.52,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Thank you.

280
0:13:24.8,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Applause)

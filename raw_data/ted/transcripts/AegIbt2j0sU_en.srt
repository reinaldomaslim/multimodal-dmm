1
0:00:12.544,000 --> 0:00:15,000
By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child

2
0:00:15.571,000 --> 0:00:17,000
for an American city in crisis.

3
0:00:17.712,000 --> 0:00:18,000
There was a housing collapse,

4
0:00:19.584,000 --> 0:00:2,000
an auto industry collapse,

5
0:00:21.542,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and the population had plummeted by 25 percent

6
0:00:24.094,000 --> 0:00:26,000
between 2000 and 2010,

7
0:00:26.516,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and many people were beginning to write it off,

8
0:00:28.733,000 --> 0:00:31,000
as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.

9
0:00:32.459,000 --> 0:00:34,000
By 2010, I had also been asked by

10
0:00:34.846,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit

11
0:00:37.046,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to join them in leading a citywide planning process

12
0:00:40.3,000 --> 0:00:43,000
for the city to create a shared vision for its future.

13
0:00:43.774,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I come to this work

14
0:00:45.245,000 --> 0:00:46,000
as an architect and an urban planner,

15
0:00:47.062,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I've spent my career working in other contested cities,

16
0:00:49.668,000 --> 0:00:5,000
like Chicago, my hometown;

17
0:00:51.524,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Harlem, which is my current home;

18
0:00:53.53,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.

19
0:00:56.556,000 --> 0:00:58,000
All of these cities, to me, still had a number

20
0:00:58.936,000 --> 0:01:,000
of unresolved issues related to urban justice,

21
0:01:01.772,000 --> 0:01:05,000
issues of equity, inclusion and access.

22
0:01:06.124,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now by 2010, as well,

23
0:01:08.187,000 --> 0:01:1,000
popular design magazines were also beginning

24
0:01:10.202,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to take a closer look at cities like Detroit,

25
0:01:12.915,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city."

26
0:01:16.552,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,

27
0:01:18.928,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to do an interview for the October issue

28
0:01:20.903,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of Architect magazine,

29
0:01:22.554,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and he and I kind of had a good chuckle

30
0:01:24.209,000 --> 0:01:27,000
when we saw the magazine released with the title,

31
0:01:27.425,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"Can This Planner Save Detroit?"

32
0:01:30.311,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So I'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now,

33
0:01:33.186,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because obviously, it's completely absurd

34
0:01:35.593,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that a single person, let alone a planner,

35
0:01:37.565,000 --> 0:01:38,000
could save a city.

36
0:01:39.023,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented

37
0:01:41.524,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a sense of hopefulness that our profession

38
0:01:44.158,000 --> 0:01:46,000
could play a role in helping the city to think about

39
0:01:47.076,000 --> 0:01:51,000
how it would recover from its severe crisis.

40
0:01:51.14,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon

41
0:01:53.412,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and tell you a little bit about our process

42
0:01:55.093,000 --> 0:01:57,000
for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,

43
0:01:57.769,000 --> 0:02:,000
and I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters.

44
0:02:00.883,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So we began our process in September of 2010.

45
0:02:03.951,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's just after a special mayoral election,

46
0:02:06.88,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and word has gotten out that there is going to be

47
0:02:08.921,000 --> 0:02:09,000
this citywide planning process,

48
0:02:10.465,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which brings a lot of anxiety and fears

49
0:02:12.814,000 --> 0:02:13,000
among Detroiters.

50
0:02:14.602,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this

51
0:02:18.842,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to introduce the planning process,

52
0:02:21.226,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and people came out from all over the city,

53
0:02:23.222,000 --> 0:02:25,000
including areas that were stable neighborhoods,

54
0:02:26.073,000 --> 0:02:27,000
as well as areas that were beginning to see

55
0:02:27.849,000 --> 0:02:28,000
a lot of vacancy.

56
0:02:29.843,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And most of our audience was representative

57
0:02:31.941,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of the 82 percent African-American population

58
0:02:34.494,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in the city at that time.

59
0:02:36.759,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So obviously, we have a Q&A portion of our program,

60
0:02:40.247,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and people line up to mics to ask questions.

61
0:02:43.144,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Many of them step very firmly to the mic,

62
0:02:45.903,000 --> 0:02:47,000
put their hands across their chest, and go,

63
0:02:48.751,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?"

64
0:02:52.23,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So that question is really powerful,

65
0:02:54.549,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,

66
0:02:57.762,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when you connect it to the stories

67
0:02:59.871,000 --> 0:03:,000
that some Detroiters had,

68
0:03:01.258,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and actually a lot of African-Americans'

69
0:03:03.464,000 --> 0:03:04,000
families have had

70
0:03:04.921,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.

71
0:03:08.652,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Many of them told us the stories about

72
0:03:10.987,000 --> 0:03:11,000
how they came to own their home

73
0:03:12.447,000 --> 0:03:14,000
through their grandparents or great-grandparents,

74
0:03:14.611,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who were one of 1.6 million people who migrated

75
0:03:17.485,000 --> 0:03:19,000
from the rural South to the industrial North,

76
0:03:20.178,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,

77
0:03:22.526,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"The Great Migration."

78
0:03:24.152,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They came to Detroit for a better way of life.

79
0:03:27.395,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Many found work in the automobile industry,

80
0:03:29.999,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural

81
0:03:32.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.

82
0:03:36.455,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The fruits of their labors would afford them a home,

83
0:03:39.43,000 --> 0:03:41,000
for many the first piece of property that they would ever know,

84
0:03:42.311,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and a community with other first-time

85
0:03:44.174,000 --> 0:03:46,000
African-American home buyers.

86
0:03:46.303,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The first couple of decades of their life in the North

87
0:03:48.683,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is quite well, up until about 1950,

88
0:03:51.727,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which coincides with the city's peak population

89
0:03:54.335,000 --> 0:03:56,000
at 1.8 million people.

90
0:03:56.642,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see

91
0:03:59.02,000 --> 0:04:01,000
a second kind of migration,

92
0:04:01.238,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a migration to the suburbs.

93
0:04:03.571,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Between 1950 and 2000,

94
0:04:06.408,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the region grows by 30 percent.

95
0:04:09.343,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But this time, the migration leaves

96
0:04:11.242,000 --> 0:04:13,000
African-Americans in place,

97
0:04:13.347,000 --> 0:04:15,000
as families and businesses flee the city,

98
0:04:16.293,000 --> 0:04:18,000
leaving the city pretty desolate of people

99
0:04:18.655,000 --> 0:04:19,000
as well as jobs.

100
0:04:20.409,000 --> 0:04:24,000
During that same period, between 1950 and 2000, 2010,

101
0:04:25.209,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the city loses 60 percent of its population,

102
0:04:28.074,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and today it hovers at above 700,000.

103
0:04:31.998,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The audience members who come and talk to us that night

104
0:04:34.484,000 --> 0:04:36,000
tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city

105
0:04:37.269,000 --> 0:04:39,000
with such depleted population.

106
0:04:39.986,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes

107
0:04:42.336,000 --> 0:04:44,000
on their block that are occupied,

108
0:04:44.879,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and that they can see several abandoned homes

109
0:04:47.486,000 --> 0:04:49,000
from where they sit on their porches.

110
0:04:49.733,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.

111
0:04:54.072,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They can also see vacant property.

112
0:04:57.087,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They're beginning to see illegal activities

113
0:04:58.944,000 --> 0:05:,000
on these properties, like illegal dumping,

114
0:05:01.168,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and they know that because the city has lost so much population,

115
0:05:05.473,000 --> 0:05:1,000
their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,

116
0:05:10.64,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because there are not enough people to pay property taxes

117
0:05:13.482,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to help support the services that they need.

118
0:05:16.816,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.

119
0:05:21.073,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,

120
0:05:23.067,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because I know that sounds like a big number,

121
0:05:24.417,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map.

122
0:05:26.955,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So the city is 139 square miles.

123
0:05:29.661,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You can fit Boston, San Francisco,

124
0:05:31.707,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and the island of Manhattan

125
0:05:33.267,000 --> 0:05:34,000
within its footprint.

126
0:05:34.943,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property

127
0:05:37.333,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and we smush it together,

128
0:05:39.529,000 --> 0:05:4,000
it looks like about 20 square miles,

129
0:05:41.365,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and that's roughly equivalent to the size

130
0:05:43.333,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,

131
0:05:45.04,000 --> 0:05:46,000
at 22 square miles.

132
0:05:46.49,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So it's a lot of vacancy.

133
0:05:50.09,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now some of our audience members

134
0:05:52.266,000 --> 0:05:54,000
also tell us about some of the positive things

135
0:05:54.384,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that are happening in their communities,

136
0:05:56.429,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and many of them are banding together

137
0:05:58.016,000 --> 0:06:,000
to take control of some of the vacant lots,

138
0:06:00.122,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and they're starting community gardens,

139
0:06:01.991,000 --> 0:06:03,000
which are creating a great sense of community stewardship,

140
0:06:04.666,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but they're very, very clear to tell us

141
0:06:06.661,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that this is not enough,

142
0:06:08.452,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that they want to see their neighborhoods

143
0:06:09.958,000 --> 0:06:12,000
return to the way that their grandparents had found them.

144
0:06:13.311,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010

145
0:06:15.754,000 --> 0:06:17,000
about what to do with the vacant property,

146
0:06:18.43,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening,

147
0:06:21.15,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or what we call urban agriculture.

148
0:06:23.382,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So many people would say to us,

149
0:06:24.96,000 --> 0:06:26,000
"What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland?

150
0:06:27.668,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It can provide fresh foods,

151
0:06:29.771,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and it can put Detroiters back to work too."

152
0:06:32.476,000 --> 0:06:33,000
When I hear that story,

153
0:06:33.921,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration

154
0:06:36.537,000 --> 0:06:38,000
rolling over in their graves,

155
0:06:38.791,000 --> 0:06:41,000
because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice

156
0:06:42.108,000 --> 0:06:44,000
moving from the South to the North

157
0:06:44.185,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to create a better life for their families,

158
0:06:46.297,000 --> 0:06:5,000
only to see their great-grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle,

159
0:06:50.543,000 --> 0:06:52,000
especially in a city where they came

160
0:06:52.751,000 --> 0:06:54,000
with little less than a high school education

161
0:06:54.805,000 --> 0:06:55,000
or even a grammar school education

162
0:06:56.772,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and were able to afford the basic elements

163
0:06:58.797,000 --> 0:06:59,000
of the American dream:

164
0:07:00.086,000 --> 0:07:04,000
steady work and a home that they owned.

165
0:07:04.121,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, there's a third wave of migration

166
0:07:06.352,000 --> 0:07:07,000
happening in Detroit:

167
0:07:07.912,000 --> 0:07:1,000
a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.

168
0:07:11.056,000 --> 0:07:13,000
These folks see that same vacant land

169
0:07:13.472,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and those same abandoned homes

170
0:07:14.967,000 --> 0:07:15,000
as opportunity for new,

171
0:07:16.362,000 --> 0:07:18,000
entrepreneurial ideas and profit,

172
0:07:19.033,000 --> 0:07:2,000
so much so that former models

173
0:07:21.02,000 --> 0:07:22,000
can move to Detroit,

174
0:07:22.441,000 --> 0:07:24,000
buy property, start successful

175
0:07:24.762,000 --> 0:07:25,000
businesses and restaurants,

176
0:07:26.439,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and become successful community activists in their neighborhood,

177
0:07:29.419,000 --> 0:07:32,000
bringing about very positive change.

178
0:07:32.441,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Similarly, we have small manufacturing companies

179
0:07:35.345,000 --> 0:07:38,000
making conscious decisions to relocate to the city.

180
0:07:38.614,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch

181
0:07:41.399,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and bicycle company,

182
0:07:43.111,000 --> 0:07:44,000
deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,

183
0:07:45.004,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and they quote themselves by saying

184
0:07:47.641,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they were drawn to the global brand of Detroit's innovation.

185
0:07:51.899,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And they also knew that they can tap into a workforce

186
0:07:54.471,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that was still very skilled in how to make things.

187
0:07:57.997,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now we have community stewardship

188
0:08:00.566,000 --> 0:08:01,000
happening in neighborhoods,

189
0:08:02.126,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions

190
0:08:04.925,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to move to the city and create enterprises,

191
0:08:07.973,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and we have businesses relocating,

192
0:08:09.708,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and this is all in the context

193
0:08:11.094,000 --> 0:08:13,000
of what is no secret to us all,

194
0:08:13.366,000 --> 0:08:14,000
a city that's under the control

195
0:08:15.167,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of an emergency manager,

196
0:08:16.789,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.

197
0:08:21.063,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,

198
0:08:24.305,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we released Detroit Future City,

199
0:08:26.389,000 --> 0:08:28,000
which was our strategic plan to guide the city

200
0:08:29.227,000 --> 0:08:3,000
into a better and more prosperous

201
0:08:31.046,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and more sustainable existence --

202
0:08:33.323,000 --> 0:08:36,000
not what it was, but what it could be,

203
0:08:36.988,000 --> 0:08:39,000
looking at new ways of economic growth,

204
0:08:40.303,000 --> 0:08:41,000
new forms of land use,

205
0:08:42.284,000 --> 0:08:45,000
more sustainable and denser neighborhoods,

206
0:08:45.392,000 --> 0:08:48,000
a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system,

207
0:08:48.808,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and a heightened capacity for civic leaders

208
0:08:51.676,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to take action and implement change.

209
0:08:54.938,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Three key imperatives were really important

210
0:08:57.536,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to our work.

211
0:08:58.817,000 --> 0:09:01,000
One was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large,

212
0:09:02.695,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but the economy was too small.

213
0:09:04.383,000 --> 0:09:07,000
There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,

214
0:09:07.643,000 --> 0:09:1,000
very different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia

215
0:09:11.041,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that are anywhere between 35 to 70 jobs per 100 people.

216
0:09:15.961,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Secondly, there had to be an acceptance

217
0:09:18.383,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that we were not going to be able to use

218
0:09:20.339,000 --> 0:09:22,000
all of this vacant land in the way that we had before

219
0:09:23.203,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and maybe for some time to come.

220
0:09:25.212,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It wasn't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods

221
0:09:27.777,000 --> 0:09:28,000
as we had before,

222
0:09:29.394,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and urban agriculture, while a very productive

223
0:09:32.152,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and successful intervention happening in Detroit,

224
0:09:34.844,000 --> 0:09:36,000
was not the only answer,

225
0:09:36.947,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that what we had to do is look at these areas

226
0:09:39.383,000 --> 0:09:4,000
where we had significant vacancy

227
0:09:41.191,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but still had a significant number of population

228
0:09:44.426,000 --> 0:09:46,000
of what could be new, productive, innovative,

229
0:09:47.324,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and entrepreneurial uses

230
0:09:48.858,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that could stabilize those communities,

231
0:09:50.813,000 --> 0:09:53,000
where still nearly 300,000 residents lived.

232
0:09:54.181,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So we came up with one neighborhood typology --

233
0:09:56.997,000 --> 0:09:58,000
there are several -- called a live-make neighborhood,

234
0:09:59.97,000 --> 0:10:,000
where folks could reappropriate

235
0:10:01.929,000 --> 0:10:02,000
abandoned structures

236
0:10:03.667,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,

237
0:10:05.957,000 --> 0:10:08,000
with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,

238
0:10:09.04,000 --> 0:10:12,000
majority 82 percent African-American population.

239
0:10:12.225,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So they, too, could take businesses

240
0:10:14.326,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that they maybe were doing out of their home

241
0:10:16.725,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and grow them to more prosperous industries

242
0:10:19.436,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and actually acquire property so they were actually

243
0:10:22.146,000 --> 0:10:24,000
property owners as well as business owners

244
0:10:24.595,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in the communities with which they resided.

245
0:10:27.121,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Then we also wanted to look at other ways

246
0:10:29.199,000 --> 0:10:32,000
of using land in addition to growing food

247
0:10:32.533,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and transforming landscape into

248
0:10:34.357,000 --> 0:10:35,000
much more productive uses,

249
0:10:36.217,000 --> 0:10:39,000
so that it could be used for storm water management, for example,

250
0:10:39.507,000 --> 0:10:42,000
by using surface lakes and retention ponds,

251
0:10:42.523,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that created neighborhood amenities,

252
0:10:44.283,000 --> 0:10:45,000
places of recreation,

253
0:10:45.975,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and actually helped to elevate

254
0:10:47.792,000 --> 0:10:48,000
adjacent property levels.

255
0:10:49.479,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Or we could use it as research plots,

256
0:10:51.339,000 --> 0:10:54,000
where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,

257
0:10:54.647,000 --> 0:10:57,000
or we could use it to generate energy.

258
0:10:58.613,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So the descendants of the Great Migration

259
0:11:01.811,000 --> 0:11:04,000
could either become precision watchmakers at Shinola,

260
0:11:05.055,000 --> 0:11:08,000
like Willie H., who was featured in one of their ads last year,

261
0:11:08.366,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or they can actually grow a business

262
0:11:10.758,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that would service companies like Shinola.

263
0:11:13.483,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The good news is, there is a future

264
0:11:15.485,000 --> 0:11:17,000
for the next generation of Detroiters,

265
0:11:18.044,000 --> 0:11:21,000
both those there now and those that want to come.

266
0:11:21.208,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So no thank you, Mayor Menino,

267
0:11:23.339,000 --> 0:11:24,000
who recently was quoted as saying,

268
0:11:24.982,000 --> 0:11:26,000
"I'd blow up the place and start over."

269
0:11:27.597,000 --> 0:11:29,000
There are very important people,

270
0:11:29.948,000 --> 0:11:31,000
business and land assets in Detroit,

271
0:11:32.349,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and there are real opportunities there.

272
0:11:34.145,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So while Detroit might not be what it was,

273
0:11:36.768,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Detroit will not die.

274
0:11:38.387,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Thank you.

275
0:11:40.41,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I moved to Harare in 1985,

2
0:00:16.12,000 --> 0:00:2,000
social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.

3
0:00:20.92,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The new government emerged from a long war of independence

4
0:00:24.64,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda:

5
0:00:27.48,000 --> 0:00:3,000
health care services, primary education

6
0:00:30.88,000 --> 0:00:31,000
became essentially free.

7
0:00:32.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
A massive expansion of rural health centers

8
0:00:36.64,000 --> 0:00:38,000
placed roughly 80 percent of the population

9
0:00:39.36,000 --> 0:00:42,000
less than a two-hour walk from these facilities,

10
0:00:42.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a truly remarkable accomplishment.

11
0:00:45.36,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In 1980, the year of independence,

12
0:00:48.04,000 --> 0:00:52,000
25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized.

13
0:00:52.24,000 --> 0:00:55,000
By 1990, a mere decade later,

14
0:00:55.56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
this proportion stood at 80 percent.

15
0:00:58.92,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation,

16
0:01:04.12,000 --> 0:01:05,000
a revolution.

17
0:01:05.6,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable.

18
0:01:10.12,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans --

19
0:01:13.48,000 --> 0:01:15,000
scientists, doctors, activists --

20
0:01:16.44,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I felt connected not only to an African independence movement,

21
0:01:21.44,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but to a global progressive public health movement.

22
0:01:26.68,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But there were daunting challenges.

23
0:01:30.04,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived.

24
0:01:35.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s,

25
0:01:39.44,000 --> 0:01:42,000
when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but --

26
0:01:44.88,000 --> 0:01:47,000
we had no idea what lay in store for Africa.

27
0:01:49.6,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there.

28
0:01:53.36,000 --> 0:01:54,000
These would soar

29
0:01:55.2,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to one out of every four adults

30
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:01,000
by the time I left Harare 17 years later.

31
0:02:02.56,000 --> 0:02:03,000
By the mid-1990s,

32
0:02:04.24,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life

33
0:02:08.4,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that they were HIV-positive.

34
0:02:10.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I saw colleagues and friends die,

35
0:02:13.76,000 --> 0:02:17,000
my students, hospital patients, die.

36
0:02:18.72,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.

37
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We did condom demonstrations.

38
0:02:24.72,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We launched school education and workplace interventions.

39
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men

40
0:02:34.76,000 --> 0:02:35,000
about how to protect themselves.

41
0:02:36.4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best.

42
0:02:41.96,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I was providing excellent treatment,

43
0:02:44.08,000 --> 0:02:45,000
such as it was.

44
0:02:45.84,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But I was not talking about structural change.

45
0:02:51.24,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly

46
0:02:55.4,000 --> 0:02:57,000
about his personal failure

47
0:02:57.48,000 --> 0:02:58,000
leading to the Rwandan genocide.

48
0:02:59.36,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department.

49
0:03:03.44,000 --> 0:03:05,000
At a 10-year memorial for the genocide,

50
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:1,000
he reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best,

51
0:03:10.08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but I realized after the genocide

52
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that there was more I could and should have done

53
0:03:16.76,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to sound the alarm and rally support."

54
0:03:22.4,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared,

55
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and today, when the World Health Organization estimates

56
0:03:30.52,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease,

57
0:03:35.88,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret

58
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
at not having done more earlier.

59
0:03:43.96,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But while living in Zimbabwe,

60
0:03:46.04,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one.

61
0:03:50.76,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I was there for my technical skills,

62
0:03:52.72,000 --> 0:03:56,000
both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills.

63
0:03:57.2,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients

64
0:04:02.2,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission,

65
0:04:07.36,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus.

66
0:04:11.52,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk

67
0:04:16.72,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of getting and dying of AIDS.

68
0:04:18.76,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And on the sugar plantations,

69
0:04:20.84,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms

70
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:25,000
than any modern enterprise,

71
0:04:26.64,000 --> 0:04:28,000
60 percent of pregnant women

72
0:04:29.32,000 --> 0:04:31,000
tested HIV-positive.

73
0:04:32.279,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure

74
0:04:36.2,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but instead related to a culture of male superiority,

75
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to forced migrant labor and to colonialism.

76
0:04:43.56,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Whites were largely unscathed.

77
0:04:46.96,000 --> 0:04:47,000
As health professionals,

78
0:04:48.92,000 --> 0:04:51,000
our tools were pitifully weak:

79
0:04:52.2,000 --> 0:04:55,000
imploring people to change their individual behaviors,

80
0:04:56.08,000 --> 0:04:58,000
use condoms, reduce number of partners.

81
0:04:58.96,000 --> 0:05:,000
Infection rates climbed,

82
0:05:02.24,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and when treatment became available in the West,

83
0:05:06.2,000 --> 0:05:08,000
treatment that remains our most potent weapon

84
0:05:08.64,000 --> 0:05:09,000
against this virus,

85
0:05:10.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa.

86
0:05:14.76,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I didn't speak out

87
0:05:16.52,000 --> 0:05:2,000
about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs

88
0:05:21.2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
or about the underlying economic and political systems

89
0:05:24.88,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that were driving infection rates

90
0:05:27.76,000 --> 0:05:31,000
in such huge swaths of the population.

91
0:05:33.4,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I rationalized my silence

92
0:05:35.96,000 --> 0:05:37,000
by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country,

93
0:05:38.92,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out,

94
0:05:41.88,000 --> 0:05:42,000
keep me from doing good work,

95
0:05:43.56,000 --> 0:05:44,000
taking care of my patients,

96
0:05:45.08,000 --> 0:05:47,000
doing much-needed research.

97
0:05:48.52,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So I didn't speak out

98
0:05:49.92,000 --> 0:05:52,000
about the government's early stance on AIDS.

99
0:05:53.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.

100
0:05:57.64,000 --> 0:06:,000
Many doctors, health professionals,

101
0:06:00.84,000 --> 0:06:01,000
may think I did nothing wrong.

102
0:06:03.52,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Our pact with our patients,

103
0:06:05.56,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the Hippocratic Oath and its variants,

104
0:06:08.32,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.

105
0:06:13.84,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I did everything I could

106
0:06:17.36,000 --> 0:06:2,000
for each and every patient of mine.

107
0:06:22.68,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But I knew

108
0:06:24.4,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society,

109
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
reflecting not only biology,

110
0:06:30.2,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion,

111
0:06:35.84,000 --> 0:06:4,000
discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more.

112
0:06:42.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It was true of AIDS.

113
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It was true just recently of Ebola.

114
0:06:48.88,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer,

115
0:06:51.44,000 --> 0:06:52,000
who worked on AIDS in Haiti,

116
0:06:53.4,000 --> 0:06:55,000
call this structural violence:

117
0:06:56.44,000 --> 0:07:,000
structural because inequities are embedded

118
0:07:00.56,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in the political and economic organization of our social world,

119
0:07:05.56,000 --> 0:07:1,000
often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power;

120
0:07:11.4,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and violence because its impact --

121
0:07:14.52,000 --> 0:07:19,000
premature deaths, suffering, illness -- is violent.

122
0:07:21.24,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We do little for our patients

123
0:07:24.04,000 --> 0:07:26,000
if we fail to recognize

124
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
these social injustices.

125
0:07:28.88,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right,

126
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and it's how we may rally support

127
0:07:38.32,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to break through and create real change together.

128
0:07:43.44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So these days, I'm not staying quiet.

129
0:07:46.84,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I'm speaking up about a lot of things,

130
0:07:50.04,000 --> 0:07:53,000
even when it makes listeners uncomfortable,

131
0:07:53.72,000 --> 0:07:55,000
even when it makes me uncomfortable.

132
0:07:57.36,000 --> 0:08:,000
And a lot of this is about racial disparities

133
0:08:00.48,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and institutionalized racism,

134
0:08:03.04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore,

135
0:08:06.8,000 --> 0:08:09,000
certainly not in the practice of medicine

136
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
or public health.

137
0:08:11.4,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But we have them,

138
0:08:13.28,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and we pay for them in lives cut short.

139
0:08:18.32,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That's why sounding the alarm

140
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:25,000
about the impact of racism on health in the United States,

141
0:08:25.8,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence

142
0:08:30.12,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that people of color face,

143
0:08:32.12,000 --> 0:08:36,000
compounded by our tragic legacy

144
0:08:36.48,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of 250 years of slavery,

145
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
90 years of Jim Crow

146
0:08:42.8,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and 60 years of imperfect equality,

147
0:08:46.72,000 --> 0:08:48,000
sounding the alarm about this

148
0:08:49.12,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is central to doing my job right

149
0:08:52.48,000 --> 0:08:54,000
as New York City's Health Commissioner.

150
0:08:55.76,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In New York City, premature mortality -- that's death before the age of 65 --

151
0:09:00.4,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones.

152
0:09:04.2,000 --> 0:09:06,000
A black woman in 2012

153
0:09:07.04,000 --> 0:09:11,000
faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth

154
0:09:11.8,000 --> 0:09:12,000
as a white woman.

155
0:09:13.88,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And though we've made enormous strides

156
0:09:16.92,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in reducing infant mortality rates,

157
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
a black baby still faces

158
0:09:22.56,000 --> 0:09:26,000
nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life

159
0:09:27.8,000 --> 0:09:28,000
as compared to a white baby.

160
0:09:31.2,000 --> 0:09:32,000
New York City's not exceptional.

161
0:09:33.28,000 --> 0:09:36,000
These statistics are paralleled

162
0:09:37.12,000 --> 0:09:41,000
by statistics found across the United States.

163
0:09:42.24,000 --> 0:09:45,000
A recent New York Times analysis

164
0:09:45.52,000 --> 0:09:51,000
reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country.

165
0:09:53.64,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They noted that more than one

166
0:09:56.6,000 --> 0:09:58,000
out of every six black men

167
0:09:58.92,000 --> 0:10:03,000
who today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years

168
0:10:04.24,000 --> 0:10:06,000
have disappeared from daily life,

169
0:10:07.84,000 --> 0:10:1,000
lost either to prison or premature death.

170
0:10:12.96,000 --> 0:10:14,000
There is great injustice

171
0:10:15.4,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men,

172
0:10:19.4,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.

173
0:10:25.12,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But we have to remember

174
0:10:26.76,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that enduring and disparate rates

175
0:10:30.2,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions --

176
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV --

177
0:10:37.32,000 --> 0:10:41,000
diseases that may kill slowly and quietly

178
0:10:41.6,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and take even more black lives prematurely.

179
0:10:46.88,000 --> 0:10:49,000
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded,

180
0:10:50.76,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I felt frustrated and angry

181
0:10:54.32,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that the medical community

182
0:10:55.64,000 --> 0:10:59,000
has been reluctant to even use the word "racism"

183
0:11:00.12,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in our research and our work.

184
0:11:02.84,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You've probably felt something every time I've said it.

185
0:11:06.52,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Our medical students held die-ins in their white coats,

186
0:11:09.8,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but the medical community has largely stood by passively

187
0:11:13.84,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as ongoing discrimination continues to affect

188
0:11:17.28,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the disease profile and mortality.

189
0:11:20.12,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And I worry

190
0:11:21.92,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine,

191
0:11:26.48,000 --> 0:11:31,000
looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment,

192
0:11:31.68,000 --> 0:11:36,000
may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture,

193
0:11:36.72,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that it is the daily context,

194
0:11:39.24,000 --> 0:11:42,000
where a person lives, grows,

195
0:11:42.96,000 --> 0:11:44,000
works, loves,

196
0:11:45.44,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that most importantly determines population health,

197
0:11:50.36,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and for too many of us, poor health.

198
0:11:54.36,000 --> 0:11:56,000
As health professionals in our daily work,

199
0:11:58.04,000 --> 0:12:01,000
whether in the clinic or doing research,

200
0:12:01.76,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we are witness to great injustice:

201
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice

202
0:12:08.96,000 --> 0:12:1,000
because he has more pressing priorities;

203
0:12:11.4,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide

204
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because our society is just so harsh;

205
0:12:18.8,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible

206
0:12:23.88,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for the poor health of her child.

207
0:12:26.96,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Our role as health professionals

208
0:12:29.4,000 --> 0:12:32,000
is not just to treat our patients

209
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
but to sound the alarm

210
0:12:35.36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and advocate for change.

211
0:12:39.88,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Rightfully or not,

212
0:12:41.6,000 --> 0:12:44,000
our societal position gives our voices great credibility,

213
0:12:45.6,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and we shouldn't waste that.

214
0:12:48.28,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe,

215
0:12:52.68,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and I've promised myself

216
0:12:54.96,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that as New York City's Health Commissioner,

217
0:12:57.6,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I will use every opportunity I have

218
0:13:01.92,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to sound the alarm

219
0:13:03.8,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and rally support for health equity.

220
0:13:06.28,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I will speak out against racism,

221
0:13:09.08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and I hope you will join me,

222
0:13:11.24,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and I will join you when you speak out against sexism

223
0:13:14.6,000 --> 0:13:17,000
or any other form of inequality.

224
0:13:17.88,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It's time for us to rise up

225
0:13:21.32,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and collectively speak up

226
0:13:24.04,000 --> 0:13:26,000
about structural inequality.

227
0:13:27.64,000 --> 0:13:3,000
We don't have to have all the answers

228
0:13:30.96,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to call for change.

229
0:13:33.12,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We just need courage.

230
0:13:36.32,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The health of our patients,

231
0:13:39.48,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the health of us all, depends on it.

232
0:13:43.6,000 --> 0:13:47,000
(Applause)

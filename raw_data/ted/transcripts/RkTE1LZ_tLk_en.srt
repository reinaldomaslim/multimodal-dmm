2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.

3
0:00:18.931,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It has generated considerable insight in physics,

4
0:00:21.243,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in biology and economics,

5
0:00:23.343,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but not that much in the humanities and in history.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I think there's a belief that it's just impossible,

7
0:00:28.443,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind,

8
0:00:31.089,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that you cannot measure history.

9
0:00:33.608,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But I don't think that's right.

10
0:00:35.135,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I want to show you a couple of examples why.

11
0:00:37.177,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact:

12
0:00:40.135,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that two kings separated by centuries

13
0:00:42.864,000 --> 0:00:43,000
will speak a very different language.

14
0:00:44.631,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That's a powerful historical force.

15
0:00:46.935,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So the king of England, Alfred the Great,

16
0:00:48.708,000 --> 0:00:49,000
will use a vocabulary and grammar

17
0:00:50.348,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that is quite different from the king of hip hop, Jay-Z.

18
0:00:54.048,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:55.714,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now it's just the way it is.

20
0:00:57.885,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Language changes over time, and it's a powerful force.

21
0:01:00.177,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So Erez and I wanted to know more about that.

22
0:01:02.464,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule, past-tense conjugation.

23
0:01:06.121,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past.

24
0:01:09.385,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"Today I walk. Yesterday I walked."

25
0:01:11.312,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But some verbs are irregular.

26
0:01:12.656,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Yesterday I thought."

27
0:01:14.052,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now what's interesting about that

28
0:01:15.718,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay-Z have become more regular.

29
0:01:19.548,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Like the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular.

30
0:01:22.283,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So Erez and I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs

31
0:01:26.305,000 --> 0:01:27,000
through 12 centuries of English language,

32
0:01:28.224,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern

33
0:01:31.135,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that captures this complex historical change,

34
0:01:33.677,000 --> 0:01:36,000
namely, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another,

35
0:01:37.337,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it regularizes 10 times slower.

36
0:01:40.002,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That's a piece of history, but it comes in a mathematical wrapping.

37
0:01:43.937,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now in some cases math can even help explain,

38
0:01:47.591,000 --> 0:01:49,000
or propose explanations for, historical forces.

39
0:01:50.47,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So here Steve Pinker and I

40
0:01:52.302,000 --> 0:01:55,000
were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries.

41
0:01:56.154,000 --> 0:01:58,000
There's actually a well-known regularity to them

42
0:01:58.649,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier

43
0:02:02.071,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is 10 times smaller.

44
0:02:04.023,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War,

45
0:02:07.367,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier --

46
0:02:10.187,000 --> 0:02:11,000
like World War I.

47
0:02:12.164,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that?

48
0:02:15.087,000 --> 0:02:17,000
What's the origin of this?

49
0:02:17.087,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So Steve and I, through mathematical analysis,

50
0:02:19.352,000 --> 0:02:23,000
propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this,

51
0:02:23.593,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which lies in our brains.

52
0:02:25.283,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This is a very well-known feature

53
0:02:27.302,000 --> 0:02:29,000
in which we perceive quantities in relative ways --

54
0:02:30.277,000 --> 0:02:33,000
quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound.

55
0:02:33.993,000 --> 0:02:38,000
For instance, committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot.

56
0:02:39.302,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously.

57
0:02:42.746,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But it doesn't sound so much,

58
0:02:44.573,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference

59
0:02:47.593,000 --> 0:02:49,000
if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously.

60
0:02:50.545,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities,

61
0:02:54.158,000 --> 0:02:55,000
as the war drags on,

62
0:02:55.925,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties

63
0:02:59.01,000 --> 0:03:,000
will increase not linearly --

64
0:03:00.693,000 --> 0:03:01,000
like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 --

65
0:03:02.581,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000.

66
0:03:06.856,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before.

67
0:03:09.941,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind

68
0:03:15.439,000 --> 0:03:17,000
with a long-term historical pattern

69
0:03:18.428,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that unfolds over centuries and across continents.

70
0:03:21.285,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So these types of examples, today there are just a few of them,

71
0:03:25.302,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace.

72
0:03:27.991,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The reason for that is that the historical record

73
0:03:30.383,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is becoming digitized at a very fast pace.

74
0:03:32.843,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So there's about 130 million books

75
0:03:35.453,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that have been written since the dawn of time.

76
0:03:37.764,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Companies like Google have digitized many of them --

77
0:03:40.218,000 --> 0:03:41,000
above 20 million actually.

78
0:03:41.802,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And when the stuff of history is available in digital form,

79
0:03:45.38,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis

80
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to very quickly and very conveniently

81
0:03:50.135,000 --> 0:03:52,000
review trends in our history and our culture.

82
0:03:52.86,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So I think in the next decade,

83
0:03:55.581,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the sciences and the humanities will come closer together

84
0:03:58.331,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to be able to answer deep questions about mankind.

85
0:04:01.66,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.

86
0:04:05.781,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It will be able to reveal new trends in our history,

87
0:04:08.927,000 --> 0:04:09,000
sometimes to explain them,

88
0:04:10.677,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.

89
0:04:13.983,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Thank you very much.

90
0:04:15.474,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Applause)

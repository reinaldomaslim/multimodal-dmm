1
0:00:13.64,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Fifteen years ago,

2
0:00:14.92,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I thought that the diversity stuff was not something I had to worry about.

3
0:00:20.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It was something an older generation had to fight for.

4
0:00:24.96,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In my university, we were 50-50, male-female,

5
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and we women often had better grades.

6
0:00:31.48,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So while not everything was perfect,

7
0:00:34.88,000 --> 0:00:36,000
diversity and leadership decisions

8
0:00:36.92,000 --> 0:00:4,000
was something that would happen naturally over time, right?

9
0:00:42.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Well, not quite.

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
While moving up the ladder working as a management consultant

11
0:00:48.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
across Europe and the US,

12
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I started to realize how often I was the only woman in the room

13
0:00:54.76,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and how homogenous leadership still is.

14
0:00:59.52,000 --> 0:01:,000
Many leaders I met

15
0:01:01.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
saw diversity as something to comply with out of political correctness,

16
0:01:06.2,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or, best case, the right thing to do,

17
0:01:09.68,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but not as a business priority.

18
0:01:12.32,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They just did not have a reason to believe

19
0:01:14.68,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that diversity would help them achieve their most immediate, pressing goals:

20
0:01:19.68,000 --> 0:01:22,000
hitting the numbers, delivering the new product,

21
0:01:22.76,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the real goals they are measured by.

22
0:01:26.44,000 --> 0:01:29,000
My personal experience working with diverse teams

23
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:33,000
had been that while they require a little bit more effort at the beginning,

24
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they did bring fresher, more creative ideas.

25
0:01:37.88,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I wanted to know:

26
0:01:40.04,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Are diverse organizations really more innovative,

27
0:01:43.88,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and can diversity be more than something to comply with?

28
0:01:48.32,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Can it be a real competitive advantage?

29
0:01:52.36,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So to find out, we set up a study with the Technical University of Munich.

30
0:01:57.4,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We surveyed 171 companies in Germany, Austria and Switzerland,

31
0:02:02.6,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and as we speak, we're expanding the study

32
0:02:05.56,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to 1,600 companies

33
0:02:08.4,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in five additional countries around the world.

34
0:02:11.76,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We asked those companies basically two things:

35
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
how innovative they are and how diverse they are.

36
0:02:18.84,000 --> 0:02:19,000
To measure the first one,

37
0:02:20.36,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we asked them about innovation revenue.

38
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Innovation revenue is the share of revenues they've made

39
0:02:26.68,000 --> 0:02:29,000
from new products and services in the last three years,

40
0:02:29.72,000 --> 0:02:32,000
meaning we did not ask them how many creative ideas they have,

41
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but rather if these ideas translate into products and services

42
0:02:36.84,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that really make the company more successful today and tomorrow.

43
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:45,000
To measure diversity, we looked at six different factors:

44
0:02:46.32,000 --> 0:02:49,000
country of origin, age and gender, amongst others.

45
0:02:51.32,000 --> 0:02:53,000
While preparing to go in the field with those questions,

46
0:02:54.28,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I sat down with my team

47
0:02:56.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we discussed what we would expect as a result.

48
0:03:01.64,000 --> 0:03:03,000
To put it mildly, we were not optimistic.

49
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The most skeptical person on the team thought, or saw a real possibility,

50
0:03:08.56,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that we would find nothing at all.

51
0:03:12.36,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Most of the team was rather on the cautious side,

52
0:03:14.68,000 --> 0:03:17,000
so we landed all together at "only if,"

53
0:03:18.6,000 --> 0:03:2,000
meaning that we might find some kind of link

54
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:22,000
between innovation and diversity,

55
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but not across the board --

56
0:03:24.96,000 --> 0:03:26,000
rather only if certain criteria are met,

57
0:03:27.88,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for example leadership style, very open leadership style

58
0:03:31.96,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that allowed people to speak up freely and safely and contribute.

59
0:03:38.24,000 --> 0:03:4,000
A couple of months later, the data came in,

60
0:03:41.52,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and the results convinced the most skeptical amongst us.

61
0:03:46.56,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The answer was a clear yes,

62
0:03:48.44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
no ifs, no buts.

63
0:03:50.84,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The data in our sample showed

64
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that more diverse companies are simply more innovative, period.

65
0:03:59.12,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, a fair question to ask is the chicken or the egg question,

66
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
meaning, are companies really more innovative

67
0:04:07.6,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because they have a more diverse leadership,

68
0:04:10.28,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or the other way around?

69
0:04:11.56,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Which way is it?

70
0:04:13.28,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now, we do not know how much is correlation versus causation,

71
0:04:17.88,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but what we do know is that clearly,

72
0:04:20.88,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in our sample, companies that are more diverse

73
0:04:24.08,000 --> 0:04:25,000
are more innovative,

74
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and that companies that are more innovative

75
0:04:27.92,000 --> 0:04:28,000
have more diverse leadership, too.

76
0:04:30.279,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So it's fair to assume that it works both ways,

77
0:04:33.04,000 --> 0:04:36,000
diversity driving innovation and innovation driving diversity.

78
0:04:39.36,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, once we published the results,

79
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we were surprised about the reactions in the media.

80
0:04:46.76,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We got quite some attention.

81
0:04:49.68,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And it went from quite factual,

82
0:04:52.2,000 --> 0:04:56,000
like "Higher Female Share Boosts Innovation"

83
0:04:56.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to a little bit more sensationalist.

84
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

85
0:05:01.96,000 --> 0:05:02,000
As you can see,

86
0:05:03.2,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"Stay-at-home Women Cost Trillions,"

87
0:05:06.32,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and, my personal favorite,

88
0:05:08.28,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"Housewives Kill Innovation."

89
0:05:10.68,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Well, there's no such thing as bad publicity, right?

90
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:16.08,000 --> 0:05:17,000
On the back of that coverage,

92
0:05:18.08,000 --> 0:05:21,000
we started to get calls from senior executives

93
0:05:21.56,000 --> 0:05:22,000
wanting to understand more,

94
0:05:23.28,000 --> 0:05:26,000
especially -- surprise, surprise -- about gender diversity.

95
0:05:27.68,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I tend to open up those discussions by asking,

96
0:05:31.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
"Well, what do you think of the situation in your organization today?"

97
0:05:35.96,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And a frequent reaction to that is,

98
0:05:39.48,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"Well, we're not yet there, but we're not that bad."

99
0:05:43.24,000 --> 0:05:45,000
One executive told me, for example,

100
0:05:45.44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
"Oh, we're not that bad.

101
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We have one member in our board who is a woman."

102
0:05:49.76,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:51.12,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And you laugh --

104
0:05:52.36,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Applause)

105
0:05:58.76,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now, you laugh, but he had a point in being proud about it,

106
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because in Germany,

107
0:06:03.52,000 --> 0:06:05,000
if you have a company

108
0:06:06.52,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and it has one member on the board who is a woman,

109
0:06:09.12,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you are part of a select group of 30

110
0:06:11.56,000 --> 0:06:14,000
out of the 100 largest publicly listed companies.

111
0:06:15.24,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The other 70 companies have an all-male board,

112
0:06:20.48,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and not even one of these hundred largest publicly listed companies

113
0:06:24.32,000 --> 0:06:27,000
have, as of today, a female CEO.

114
0:06:29.08,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But here's the critically important insight.

115
0:06:32.24,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Those few female board members alone,

116
0:06:36.24,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they won't make a difference.

117
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Our data shows that for gender diversity to have an impact on innovation,

118
0:06:43.2,000 --> 0:06:46,000
you need to have more than 20 percent women in leadership.

119
0:06:47.48,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Let's have a look at the numbers.

120
0:06:50.6,000 --> 0:06:53,000
As you can see, we divided the sample into three groups,

121
0:06:54.32,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the results are quite dramatic.

122
0:06:57.24,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Only in the group where you have more than 20 percent women in leadership,

123
0:07:01.96,000 --> 0:07:04,000
only then you see a clear jump in innovation revenue

124
0:07:06.84,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to above-average levels.

125
0:07:08.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So experience and data shows that you do need critical mass

126
0:07:13.52,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to move the needle,

127
0:07:15.04,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and companies like Alibaba, JP Morgan or Apple

128
0:07:18.4,000 --> 0:07:21,000
have as of today already achieved that threshold.

129
0:07:24.48,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Another reaction I got quite a lot was,

130
0:07:28.52,000 --> 0:07:3,000
"Well, it will get solved over time."

131
0:07:32.2,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And I have all the sympathy in the world for that point of view,

132
0:07:35.48,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because I used to think like that, too.

133
0:07:38.6,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now, let's have a look here again and look at the numbers,

134
0:07:41.92,000 --> 0:07:43,000
taking Germany as an example.

135
0:07:44.08,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Let me first give you the good news.

136
0:07:46.32,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So the share of women who are college graduates

137
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and have at least 10 years of professional experience

138
0:07:52.6,000 --> 0:07:55,000
has grown nicely over the last 20 years,

139
0:07:55.92,000 --> 0:07:58,000
which means the pool in which to fish for female leaders

140
0:07:59.72,000 --> 0:08:01,000
has increased over time,

141
0:08:01.88,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and that's great.

142
0:08:03.6,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now, according to my old theory,

143
0:08:06.88,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the share of women in leadership

144
0:08:08.48,000 --> 0:08:1,000
would have grown more or less in parallel, right?

145
0:08:11.84,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now, let's have a look at what happened in reality.

146
0:08:15.48,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's not even close,

147
0:08:19.36,000 --> 0:08:22,000
which means I was so wrong

148
0:08:22.6,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and which means that my generation,

149
0:08:25.4,000 --> 0:08:26,000
your generation,

150
0:08:27.68,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the best-educated female generation in history,

151
0:08:32.52,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we have just not made it.

152
0:08:33.96,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We have failed to achieve leadership in significant numbers.

153
0:08:38.48,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Education just did not translate into leadership.

154
0:08:42.72,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now, that was a painful realization for me

155
0:08:45.84,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and made me realize,

156
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
if we want to change this,

157
0:08:50.32,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we need to engage, and we need to do better.

158
0:08:54.2,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now, what to do?

159
0:08:57.32,000 --> 0:09:,000
Achieving more than 20 percent women in leadership

160
0:09:00.88,000 --> 0:09:02,000
seems like a daunting task to many,

161
0:09:03.28,000 --> 0:09:05,000
understandably, given the track record.

162
0:09:07.08,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But it's doable,

163
0:09:08.32,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and there are many companies today that are making progress there

164
0:09:11.6,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and doing it successfully.

165
0:09:13.24,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Let's take SAP, the software company, as an example.

166
0:09:16.72,000 --> 0:09:2,000
They had, in 2011, 19 percent women in leadership,

167
0:09:21.4,000 --> 0:09:22,000
yet they decided to do better,

168
0:09:23.28,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and they did what you do in any other area of business

169
0:09:26.48,000 --> 0:09:27,000
where you want to improve.

170
0:09:28.04,000 --> 0:09:3,000
They set themselves a measurable target.

171
0:09:31.44,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So they set themselves a target of 25 percent for 2017,

172
0:09:36.36,000 --> 0:09:37,000
which they have just achieved.

173
0:09:39.12,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The goals made them think more creatively about developing leaders

174
0:09:42.56,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and tapping new recruiting pools.

175
0:09:45.04,000 --> 0:09:49,000
They now even set a target of 30 percent women in leadership for 2022.

176
0:09:50.48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So experience shows it's doable,

177
0:09:52.96,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and at the end of the day,

178
0:09:54.96,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it all boils down to two decisions that are taken every day

179
0:09:59.12,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in every organization by many of us:

180
0:10:03.64,000 --> 0:10:06,000
who to hire and who to develop and promote.

181
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now, nothing against women's programs,

182
0:10:10.6,000 --> 0:10:12,000
networks, mentoring, trainings.

183
0:10:12.96,000 --> 0:10:13,000
All is good.

184
0:10:15.32,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But it is these two decisions

185
0:10:17.28,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that at the end of the day send the most powerful change signal

186
0:10:21.32,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in any organization.

187
0:10:25.04,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now, I never set out to be a diversity advocate.

188
0:10:28.12,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I am a business advisor.

189
0:10:30.72,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But now my goal is to change the face of leadership,

190
0:10:35.72,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to make it more diverse --

191
0:10:38.08,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and not so that leaders can check a box

192
0:10:40.6,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and feel like they have complied with something

193
0:10:43.6,000 --> 0:10:45,000
or they have been politically correct.

194
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But because they understand,

195
0:10:47.88,000 --> 0:10:5,000
they understand that diversity is making their organization

196
0:10:51.4,000 --> 0:10:52,000
more innovative, better.

197
0:10:53.68,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And by embracing diversity, by embracing diverse talent,

198
0:10:57.56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
we are providing true opportunity for everyone.

199
0:11:00.52,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Thank you. Thank you so much.

200
0:11:02.2,000 --> 0:11:04,000

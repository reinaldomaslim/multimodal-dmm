1
0:00:12.68,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Imagine you're walking through a forest.

2
0:00:15.96,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm guessing you're thinking of a collection of trees,

3
0:00:19.12,000 --> 0:00:21,000
what we foresters call a stand,

4
0:00:21.88,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns.

5
0:00:25.36,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Yes, trees are the foundation of forests,

6
0:00:28.48,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but a forest is much more than what you see,

7
0:00:31.56,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and today I want to change the way you think about forests.

8
0:00:35.88,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You see, underground there is this other world,

9
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:42,000
a world of infinite biological pathways

10
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that connect trees and allow them to communicate

11
0:00:45.8,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and allow the forest to behave as though it's a single organism.

12
0:00:50.04,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It might remind you of a sort of intelligence.

13
0:00:53.6,000 --> 0:00:54,000
How do I know this?

14
0:00:55.28,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Here's my story.

15
0:00:57.56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia.

16
0:01:01.08,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns.

17
0:01:04.28,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They were giants.

18
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
My grandfather was a giant, too.

19
0:01:07.92,000 --> 0:01:08,000
He was a horse logger,

20
0:01:09.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and he used to selectively cut cedar poles from the inland rainforest.

21
0:01:13.76,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods,

22
0:01:17.76,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and how my family was knit into it.

23
0:01:21.08,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps.

24
0:01:23.24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
He and I had this curiosity about forests,

25
0:01:26.8,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and my first big "aha" moment

26
0:01:28.96,000 --> 0:01:29,000
was at the outhouse by our lake.

27
0:01:31.64,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Our poor dog Jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit.

28
0:01:36.08,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog.

29
0:01:39.24,000 --> 0:01:41,000
He was down there, swimming in the muck.

30
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But as grandpa dug through that forest floor,

31
0:01:45.72,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I became fascinated with the roots,

32
0:01:48.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and under that, what I learned later was the white mycelium

33
0:01:51.48,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and under that the red and yellow mineral horizons.

34
0:01:55.24,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Eventually, grandpa and I rescued the poor dog,

35
0:01:58.44,000 --> 0:02:,000
but it was at that moment that I realized

36
0:02:00.8,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that that palette of roots and soil

37
0:02:03.4,000 --> 0:02:05,000
was really the foundation of the forest.

38
0:02:06.64,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I wanted to know more.

39
0:02:08.68,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So I studied forestry.

40
0:02:11.44,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But soon I found myself working alongside the powerful people

41
0:02:15.08,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in charge of the commercial harvest.

42
0:02:17.96,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The extent of the clear-cutting

43
0:02:20.56,000 --> 0:02:21,000
was alarming,

44
0:02:21.84,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and I soon found myself conflicted by my part in it.

45
0:02:25.6,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Not only that, the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches

46
0:02:30.72,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs

47
0:02:35.04,000 --> 0:02:36,000
was astounding.

48
0:02:37.04,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine.

49
0:02:41.64,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So I went back to school,

50
0:02:44.36,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and I studied my other world.

51
0:02:47.48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You see, scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vitro

52
0:02:51.76,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that one pine seedling root

53
0:02:53.92,000 --> 0:02:56,000
could transmit carbon to another pine seedling root.

54
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But this was in the laboratory,

55
0:02:59.96,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I wondered, could this happen in real forests?

56
0:03:03.04,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I thought yes.

57
0:03:05.12,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Trees in real forests might also share information below ground.

58
0:03:10.12,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But this was really controversial,

59
0:03:11.92,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and some people thought I was crazy,

60
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I had a really hard time getting research funding.

61
0:03:17.64,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But I persevered,

62
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest,

63
0:03:24.08,000 --> 0:03:25,000
25 years ago.

64
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I grew 80 replicates of three species:

65
0:03:29.04,000 --> 0:03:32,000
paper birch, Douglas fir, and western red cedar.

66
0:03:32.24,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I figured the birch and the fir would be connected in a belowground web,

67
0:03:36.32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but not the cedar.

68
0:03:37.6,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It was in its own other world.

69
0:03:40.44,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I gathered my apparatus,

70
0:03:42.32,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I had no money, so I had to do it on the cheap.

71
0:03:45.52,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So I went to Canadian Tire --

72
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:48.6,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and I bought some plastic bags and duct tape and shade cloth,

74
0:03:52.04,000 --> 0:03:55,000
a timer, a paper suit, a respirator.

75
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And then I borrowed some high-tech stuff from my university:

76
0:03:59.36,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter, a mass spectrometer, microscopes.

77
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And then I got some really dangerous stuff:

78
0:04:06.48,000 --> 0:04:1,000
syringes full of radioactive carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas

79
0:04:11.28,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and some high pressure bottles

80
0:04:13.32,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

81
0:04:17.56,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But I was legally permitted.

82
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:20.88,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Oh, and I forgot some stuff,

84
0:04:23.08,000 --> 0:04:24,000
important stuff: the bug spray,

85
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the bear spray, the filters for my respirator.

86
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Oh well.

87
0:04:31.56,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The first day of the experiment, we got out to our plot

88
0:04:34.36,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and a grizzly bear and her cub chased us off.

89
0:04:37.92,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I had no bear spray.

90
0:04:41.12,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But you know, this is how forest research in Canada goes.

91
0:04:44.32,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:45.8,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So I came back the next day,

93
0:04:47.36,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and mama grizzly and her cub were gone.

94
0:04:49.64,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So this time, we really got started,

95
0:04:51.68,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and I pulled on my white paper suit,

96
0:04:54.48,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I put on my respirator,

97
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and then

98
0:04:59.4,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I put the plastic bags over my trees.

99
0:05:03.08,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I got my giant syringes,

100
0:05:05.2,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I injected the bags

101
0:05:06.88,000 --> 0:05:09,000
with my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases,

102
0:05:10.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
first the birch.

103
0:05:11.56,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,

104
0:05:14.56,000 --> 0:05:15,000
into the bag of birch.

105
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And then for fir,

106
0:05:17.44,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I injected the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

107
0:05:21.28,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I used two isotopes,

108
0:05:23.04,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because I was wondering

109
0:05:24.32,000 --> 0:05:27,000
whether there was two-way communication going on between these species.

110
0:05:29.64,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I got to the final bag,

111
0:05:32.24,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the 80th replicate,

112
0:05:33.76,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and all of a sudden mama grizzly showed up again.

113
0:05:36.2,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And she started to chase me,

114
0:05:37.64,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I had my syringes above my head,

115
0:05:40.08,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and I was swatting the mosquitos, and I jumped into the truck,

116
0:05:43.04,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I thought,

117
0:05:44.28,000 --> 0:05:45,000
"This is why people do lab studies."

118
0:05:46.04,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I waited an hour.

120
0:05:50.64,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I figured it would take this long

121
0:05:52.28,000 --> 0:05:54,000
for the trees to suck up the CO2 through photosynthesis,

122
0:05:55.08,000 --> 0:05:58,000
turn it into sugars, send it down into their roots,

123
0:05:58.24,000 --> 0:06:,000
and maybe, I hypothesized,

124
0:06:00.96,000 --> 0:06:02,000
shuttle that carbon belowground to their neighbors.

125
0:06:04.92,000 --> 0:06:05,000
After the hour was up,

126
0:06:06.8,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I rolled down my window,

127
0:06:08.4,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and I checked for mama grizzly.

128
0:06:10.6,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Oh good, she's over there eating her huckleberries.

129
0:06:13.72,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So I got out of the truck and I got to work.

130
0:06:16.36,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I went to my first bag with the birch. I pulled the bag off.

131
0:06:20.28,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.

132
0:06:23.28,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Kkhh!

133
0:06:25.4,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Perfect.

134
0:06:26.64,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The birch had taken up the radioactive gas.

135
0:06:29.6,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Then the moment of truth.

136
0:06:31.2,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I went over to the fir tree.

137
0:06:33.32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I pulled off its bag.

138
0:06:35.12,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I ran the Geiger counter up its needles,

139
0:06:37.48,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and I heard the most beautiful sound.

140
0:06:40.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Kkhh!

141
0:06:42.76,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It was the sound of birch talking to fir,

142
0:06:45.52,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and birch was saying, "Hey, can I help you?"

143
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And fir was saying, "Yeah, can you send me some of your carbon?

144
0:06:52.64,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Because somebody threw a shade cloth over me."

145
0:06:56.36,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I went up to cedar, and I ran the Geiger counter over its leaves,

146
0:07:00.08,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and as I suspected,

147
0:07:02.52,000 --> 0:07:03,000
silence.

148
0:07:04.56,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Cedar was in its own world.

149
0:07:06.8,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir.

150
0:07:11.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I was so excited,

151
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I ran from plot to plot and I checked all 80 replicates.

152
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The evidence was clear.

153
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The C-13 and C-14 was showing me

154
0:07:23.12,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that paper birch and Douglas fir were in a lively two-way conversation.

155
0:07:27.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It turns out at that time of the year,

156
0:07:29.84,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in the summer,

157
0:07:31.08,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch,

158
0:07:34.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
especially when the fir was shaded.

159
0:07:37.08,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And then in later experiments, we found the opposite,

160
0:07:40.08,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that fir was sending more carbon to birch than birch was sending to fir,

161
0:07:43.64,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless.

162
0:07:47.88,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So it turns out the two species were interdependent,

163
0:07:50.56,000 --> 0:07:51,000
like yin and yang.

164
0:07:52.96,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And at that moment, everything came into focus for me.

165
0:07:55.96,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I knew I had found something big,

166
0:07:58.24,000 --> 0:08:02,000
something that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests,

167
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
from not just competitors

168
0:08:05.04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but to cooperators.

169
0:08:07.8,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And I had found solid evidence

170
0:08:10.28,000 --> 0:08:13,000
of this massive belowground communications network,

171
0:08:13.68,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the other world.

172
0:08:15.96,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Now, I truly hoped and believed

173
0:08:17.88,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that my discovery would change how we practice forestry,

174
0:08:21.52,000 --> 0:08:22,000
from clear-cutting and herbiciding

175
0:08:23.32,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to more holistic and sustainable methods,

176
0:08:26.28,000 --> 0:08:29,000
methods that were less expensive and more practical.

177
0:08:29.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
What was I thinking?

178
0:08:31.92,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I'll come back to that.

179
0:08:35.76,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So how do we do science in complex systems like forests?

180
0:08:40.72,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Well, as forest scientists, we have to do our research in the forests,

181
0:08:44.08,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and that's really tough, as I've shown you.

182
0:08:46.12,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And we have to be really good at running from bears.

183
0:08:50.76,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But mostly, we have to persevere

184
0:08:52.36,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in spite of all the stuff stacked against us.

185
0:08:55.28,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And we have to follow our intuition and our experiences

186
0:08:57.92,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and ask really good questions.

187
0:09:00.08,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And then we've got to gather our data and then go verify.

188
0:09:03.28,000 --> 0:09:08,000
For me, I've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest.

189
0:09:09.08,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Some of my oldest experimental plantations are now over 30 years old.

190
0:09:14.04,000 --> 0:09:15,000
You can check them out.

191
0:09:15.48,000 --> 0:09:16,000
That's how forest science works.

192
0:09:18.2,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So now I want to talk about the science.

193
0:09:20.56,000 --> 0:09:23,000
How were paper birch and Douglas fir communicating?

194
0:09:23.64,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Well, it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon

195
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but also nitrogen and phosphorus

196
0:09:31.2,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones --

197
0:09:35.96,000 --> 0:09:36,000
information.

198
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And you know, I have to tell you, before me, scientists had thought

199
0:09:41.36,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza

200
0:09:44.96,000 --> 0:09:45,000
was involved.

201
0:09:46.48,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root."

202
0:09:50.36,000 --> 0:09:53,000
You see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest.

203
0:09:54.28,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They're the mushrooms.

204
0:09:56.12,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The mushrooms, though, are just the tip of the iceberg,

205
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium,

206
0:10:03.44,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and that mycelium infects and colonizes the roots

207
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of all the trees and plants.

208
0:10:08.32,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And where the fungal cells interact with the root cells,

209
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,

210
0:10:13.8,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil

211
0:10:16.88,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and coating every soil particle.

212
0:10:19.84,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium

213
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
under a single footstep.

214
0:10:26.72,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And not only that, that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest,

215
0:10:32.32,000 --> 0:10:37,000
individuals not only of the same species but between species, like birch and fir,

216
0:10:37.96,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and it works kind of like the Internet.

217
0:10:41.76,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You see, like all networks,

218
0:10:43.68,000 --> 0:10:45,000
mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.

219
0:10:46.52,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We made this map by examining the short sequences of DNA

220
0:10:50.6,000 --> 0:10:55,000
of every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of Douglas fir forest.

221
0:10:56.12,000 --> 0:10:59,000
In this picture, the circles represent the Douglas fir, or the nodes,

222
0:10:59.96,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways, or the links.

223
0:11:05.12,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The biggest, darkest nodes are the busiest nodes.

224
0:11:09.48,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We call those hub trees,

225
0:11:11.44,000 --> 0:11:13,000
or more fondly, mother trees,

226
0:11:13.88,000 --> 0:11:17,000
because it turns out that those hub trees nurture their young,

227
0:11:18.52,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the ones growing in the understory.

228
0:11:21.08,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And if you can see those yellow dots,

229
0:11:23.24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
those are the young seedlings that have established within the network

230
0:11:26.56,000 --> 0:11:27,000
of the old mother trees.

231
0:11:28.4,000 --> 0:11:32,000
In a single forest, a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees.

232
0:11:33.8,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And using our isotope tracers,

233
0:11:36.12,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we have found that mother trees

234
0:11:37.64,000 --> 0:11:39,000
will send their excess carbon through the mycorrhizal network

235
0:11:40.6,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to the understory seedlings,

236
0:11:42.56,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and we've associated this with increased seedling survival

237
0:11:45.72,000 --> 0:11:46,000
by four times.

238
0:11:47.88,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now, we know we all favor our own children,

239
0:11:51.12,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and I wondered, could Douglas fir recognize its own kin,

240
0:11:55.76,000 --> 0:11:57,000
like mama grizzly and her cub?

241
0:11:58.56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So we set about an experiment,

242
0:12:00.4,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and we grew mother trees with kin and stranger's seedlings.

243
0:12:04.32,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And it turns out they do recognize their kin.

244
0:12:07.24,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Mother trees colonize their kin with bigger mycorrhizal networks.

245
0:12:12.24,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They send them more carbon below ground.

246
0:12:14.68,000 --> 0:12:16,000
They even reduce their own root competition

247
0:12:17.28,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to make elbow room for their kids.

248
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
When mother trees are injured or dying,

249
0:12:23.84,000 --> 0:12:27,000
they also send messages of wisdom on to the next generation of seedlings.

250
0:12:29.12,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So we've used isotope tracing

251
0:12:30.68,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree

252
0:12:33.28,000 --> 0:12:35,000
down her trunk into the mycorrhizal network

253
0:12:35.64,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and into her neighboring seedlings,

254
0:12:38.64,000 --> 0:12:4,000
not only carbon but also defense signals.

255
0:12:41.44,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And these two compounds

256
0:12:43.28,000 --> 0:12:47,000
have increased the resistance of those seedlings to future stresses.

257
0:12:47.4,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So trees talk.

258
0:12:50.56,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Applause)

259
0:12:52.6,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Thank you.

260
0:12:57.44,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Through back and forth conversations,

261
0:12:59.76,000 --> 0:13:01,000
they increase the resilience of the whole community.

262
0:13:03.36,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It probably reminds you of our own social communities,

263
0:13:06.28,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and our families,

264
0:13:07.88,000 --> 0:13:08,000
well, at least some families.

265
0:13:09.285,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Laughter)

266
0:13:11.52,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So let's come back to the initial point.

267
0:13:14.48,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Forests aren't simply collections of trees,

268
0:13:16.96,000 --> 0:13:19,000
they're complex systems with hubs and networks

269
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate,

270
0:13:24.04,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and they provide avenues for feedbacks and adaptation,

271
0:13:27.84,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and this makes the forest resilient.

272
0:13:30.28,000 --> 0:13:34,000
That's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks.

273
0:13:34.68,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But they're also vulnerable,

274
0:13:36.68,000 --> 0:13:38,000
vulnerable not only to natural disturbances

275
0:13:40.2,000 --> 0:13:43,000
like bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees

276
0:13:43.92,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but high-grade logging and clear-cut logging.

277
0:13:47.24,000 --> 0:13:49,000
You see, you can take out one or two hub trees,

278
0:13:50.08,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but there comes a tipping point,

279
0:13:52.92,000 --> 0:13:54,000
because hub trees are not unlike rivets in an airplane.

280
0:13:55.88,000 --> 0:13:58,000
You can take out one or two and the plane still flies,

281
0:13:59.44,000 --> 0:14:,000
but you take out one too many,

282
0:14:01.04,000 --> 0:14:03,000
or maybe that one holding on the wings,

283
0:14:03.68,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and the whole system collapses.

284
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So now how are you thinking about forests? Differently?

285
0:14:09.92,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Audience) Yes.

286
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Cool.

287
0:14:13.04,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I'm glad.

288
0:14:14.92,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So, remember I said earlier that I hoped that my research,

289
0:14:18.8,000 --> 0:14:21,000
my discoveries would change the way we practice forestry.

290
0:14:22.2,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Well, I want to take a check on that 30 years later here in western Canada.

291
0:14:34.84,000 --> 0:14:36,000
This is about 100 kilometers to the west of us,

292
0:14:37.4,000 --> 0:14:39,000
just on the border of Banff National Park.

293
0:14:41.12,000 --> 0:14:42,000
That's a lot of clear-cuts.

294
0:14:43.02,000 --> 0:14:44,000
It's not so pristine.

295
0:14:45.98,000 --> 0:14:5,000
In 2014, the World Resources Institute reported that Canada in the past decade

296
0:14:51.06,000 --> 0:14:54,000
has had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide,

297
0:14:55.62,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and I bet you thought it was Brazil.

298
0:14:59.14,000 --> 0:15:02,000
In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.

299
0:15:02.7,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Now, by my estimation, that's about four times the rate that is sustainable.

300
0:15:09.1,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Now, massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles,

301
0:15:13.46,000 --> 0:15:14,000
degrade wildlife habitat,

302
0:15:15.46,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere,

303
0:15:18.38,000 --> 0:15:2,000
which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks.

304
0:15:23.3,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Not only that, we're continuing to plant one or two species

305
0:15:26.3,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and weed out the aspens and birches.

306
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
These simplified forests lack complexity,

307
0:15:31.86,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and they're really vulnerable to infections and bugs.

308
0:15:35.3,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And as climate changes,

309
0:15:37.22,000 --> 0:15:39,000
this is creating a perfect storm

310
0:15:41.42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
for extreme events, like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak

311
0:15:45.02,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that just swept across North America,

312
0:15:47.82,000 --> 0:15:5,000
or that megafire in the last couple months in Alberta.

313
0:15:52.98,000 --> 0:15:54,000
So I want to come back to my final question:

314
0:15:56.98,000 --> 0:15:57,000
instead of weakening our forests,

315
0:15:58.78,000 --> 0:16:01,000
how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change?

316
0:16:03.7,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Well, you know, the great thing about forests as complex systems

317
0:16:07.74,000 --> 0:16:1,000
is they have enormous capacity to self-heal.

318
0:16:11.7,000 --> 0:16:12,000
In our recent experiments,

319
0:16:13.14,000 --> 0:16:16,000
we found with patch-cutting and retention of hub trees

320
0:16:16.62,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes

321
0:16:20.78,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that these mycorrhizal networks, they recover really rapidly.

322
0:16:25.94,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So with this in mind, I want to leave you with four simple solutions.

323
0:16:30.3,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And we can't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on.

324
0:16:35.18,000 --> 0:16:38,000
First, we all need to get out in the forest.

325
0:16:39.5,000 --> 0:16:43,000
We need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests.

326
0:16:44.06,000 --> 0:16:45,000
You see, most of our forests now

327
0:16:45.7,000 --> 0:16:48,000
are managed using a one-size-fits-all approach,

328
0:16:48.94,000 --> 0:16:52,000
but good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions.

329
0:16:54.42,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Second, we need to save our old-growth forests.

330
0:16:59.02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
These are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.

331
0:17:06.62,000 --> 0:17:08,000
So this means less cutting.

332
0:17:08.9,000 --> 0:17:1,000
I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.

333
0:17:11.98,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And third, when we do cut,

334
0:17:14.66,000 --> 0:17:15,000
we need to save the legacies,

335
0:17:17.18,000 --> 0:17:18,000
the mother trees and networks,

336
0:17:18.74,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and the wood, the genes,

337
0:17:20.9,000 --> 0:17:23,000
so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees

338
0:17:24.819,000 --> 0:17:27,000
so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road.

339
0:17:28.62,000 --> 0:17:3,000
We need to be conservationists.

340
0:17:31.819,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And finally, fourthly and finally,

341
0:17:35.34,000 --> 0:17:38,000
we need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species

342
0:17:38.82,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and genotypes and structures

343
0:17:41.06,000 --> 0:17:43,000
by planting and allowing natural regeneration.

344
0:17:44.62,000 --> 0:17:46,000
We have to give Mother Nature the tools she needs

345
0:17:47.54,000 --> 0:17:49,000
to use her intelligence to self-heal.

346
0:17:51.18,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And we need to remember that forests aren't just a bunch of trees

347
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
competing with each other,

348
0:17:55.54,000 --> 0:17:56,000
they're supercooperators.

349
0:17:58.7,000 --> 0:17:59,000
So back to Jigs.

350
0:18:00.38,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Jigs's fall into the outhouse showed me this other world,

351
0:18:04.86,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and it changed my view of forests.

352
0:18:07.58,000 --> 0:18:1,000
I hope today to have changed how you think about forests.

353
0:18:10.94,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Thank you.

354
0:18:12.22,000 --> 0:18:17,000

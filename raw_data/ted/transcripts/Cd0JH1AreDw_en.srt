1
0:00:12.133,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a teacher and a practitioner

2
0:00:14.014,000 --> 0:00:16,000
of civics in America.

3
0:00:16.499,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now, I will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep

4
0:00:19.571,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to please wake up. (Laughter)

5
0:00:21.683,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Why is it that the very word "civics"

6
0:00:23.974,000 --> 0:00:25,000
has such a soporific, even a narcoleptic effect

7
0:00:26.865,000 --> 0:00:27,000
on us?

8
0:00:28.171,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I think it's because the very word signifies something

9
0:00:32.312,000 --> 0:00:35,000
exceedingly virtuous, exceedingly important,

10
0:00:35.42,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and exceedingly boring.

11
0:00:37.83,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Well, I think it's the responsibility of people like us,

12
0:00:40.883,000 --> 0:00:41,000
people who show up for gatherings like this

13
0:00:42.637,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in person or online, in any way we can,

14
0:00:45.384,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to make civics sexy again,

15
0:00:48.285,000 --> 0:00:5,000
as sexy as it was during the American Revolution,

16
0:00:51.111,000 --> 0:00:54,000
as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement.

17
0:00:54.554,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And I believe the way we make civics sexy again

18
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is to make explicitly about the teaching of power.

19
0:01:02.11,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The way we do that, I believe,

20
0:01:04.603,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is at the level of the city.

21
0:01:06.997,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This is what I want to talk about today,

22
0:01:08.796,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and I want to start by defining some terms

23
0:01:11.108,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and then I want to describe the scale

24
0:01:13.183,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of the problem I think we face

25
0:01:15.046,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and then suggest the ways that I believe cities

26
0:01:17.472,000 --> 0:01:19,000
can be the seat of the solution.

27
0:01:19.992,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So let me start with some definitions.

28
0:01:23.78,000 --> 0:01:24,000
By civics, I simply mean the art

29
0:01:25.557,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor

30
0:01:28.808,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in a self-governing community.

31
0:01:30.935,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Civics is the art of citizenship,

32
0:01:33.364,000 --> 0:01:35,000
what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply

33
0:01:35.479,000 --> 0:01:37,000
showing up for life,

34
0:01:37.571,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and it encompasses three things:

35
0:01:39.956,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a foundation of values,

36
0:01:43.5,000 --> 0:01:46,000
an understanding of the systems that make the world go round,

37
0:01:47.266,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and a set of skills

38
0:01:49.62,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that allow you to pursue goals

39
0:01:51.104,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and to have others join in that pursuit.

40
0:01:54.777,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And that brings me to my definition of power,

41
0:01:57.036,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which is simply this:

42
0:01:59.204,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the capacity to make others do

43
0:02:01.87,000 --> 0:02:03,000
what you would have them do.

44
0:02:04.631,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It sounds menacing, doesn't it?

45
0:02:07.312,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We don't like to talk about power.

46
0:02:09.653,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We find it scary. We find it somehow evil.

47
0:02:15.347,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We feel uncomfortable naming it.

48
0:02:17.129,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In the culture and mythology of democracy,

49
0:02:19.542,000 --> 0:02:2,000
power resides with the people.

50
0:02:21.285,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Period. End of story.

51
0:02:23.078,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Any further inquiry not necessary

52
0:02:24.653,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and not really that welcome.

53
0:02:26.633,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Power has a negative moral valence.

54
0:02:30.691,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It sounds Machiavellian inherently.

55
0:02:33.473,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It seems inherently evil.

56
0:02:36.107,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil

57
0:02:39.912,000 --> 0:02:42,000
than fire or physics.

58
0:02:43.03,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It just is.

59
0:02:45.14,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And power governs

60
0:02:46.346,000 --> 0:02:47,000
how any form of government operates,

61
0:02:47.947,000 --> 0:02:5,000
whether a democracy or a dictatorship.

62
0:02:51.427,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And the problem we face today, here in America in particular,

63
0:02:54.668,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but all around the world,

64
0:02:56.198,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is that far too many people are profoundly illiterate

65
0:02:59.483,000 --> 0:03:,000
in power —

66
0:03:01.463,000 --> 0:03:03,000
what it is, who has it,

67
0:03:03.533,000 --> 0:03:05,000
how it operates, how it flows,

68
0:03:05.996,000 --> 0:03:07,000
what part of it is visible, what part of it is not,

69
0:03:08.516,000 --> 0:03:11,000
why some people have it, why that's compounded.

70
0:03:12.128,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And as a result of this illiteracy,

71
0:03:15.617,000 --> 0:03:17,000
those few who do understand

72
0:03:18.483,000 --> 0:03:2,000
how power operates in civic life,

73
0:03:20.973,000 --> 0:03:21,000
those who understand

74
0:03:22.311,000 --> 0:03:23,000
how a bill becomes a law, yes,

75
0:03:24.134,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but also how a friendship becomes a subsidy,

76
0:03:28.289,000 --> 0:03:31,000
or how a bias becomes a policy,

77
0:03:31.694,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or how a slogan becomes a movement,

78
0:03:34.629,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the people who understand those things

79
0:03:36.609,000 --> 0:03:37,000
wield disproportionate influence,

80
0:03:38.18,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and they're perfectly happy

81
0:03:39.66,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance

82
0:03:42.74,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of the great majority.

83
0:03:47.124,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is why it is so fundamental for us right now

84
0:03:50.543,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to grab hold of this idea of power

85
0:03:54.999,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and to democratize it.

86
0:03:56.755,000 --> 0:04:,000
One of the things that is so profoundly exciting

87
0:04:01.299,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and challenging about this moment

88
0:04:03.282,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is that as a result of this power illiteracy

89
0:04:06.484,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that is so pervasive,

90
0:04:09.151,000 --> 0:04:12,000
there is a concentration

91
0:04:12.24,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of knowledge, of understanding, of clout.

92
0:04:16.491,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I mean, think about it:

93
0:04:18.578,000 --> 0:04:21,000
How does a friendship become a subsidy?

94
0:04:21.993,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Seamlessly,

95
0:04:23.27,000 --> 0:04:25,000
when a senior government official decides

96
0:04:25.905,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to leave government and become a lobbyist

97
0:04:28.402,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for a private interest

98
0:04:30.316,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and convert his or her relationships into capital

99
0:04:33.018,000 --> 0:04:35,000
for their new masters.

100
0:04:35.325,000 --> 0:04:37,000
How does a bias become a policy?

101
0:04:37.75,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Insidiously, just the way that

102
0:04:41.35,000 --> 0:04:43,000
stop-and-frisk, for instance,

103
0:04:43.51,000 --> 0:04:46,000
became over time a bureaucratic numbers game.

104
0:04:47.166,000 --> 0:04:5,000
How does a slogan become a movement?

105
0:04:50.271,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Virally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,

106
0:04:53.252,000 --> 0:04:56,000
was able to take the "Don't Tread on Me" flag

107
0:04:56.718,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from the American Revolution,

108
0:04:58.465,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or how, on the other side,

109
0:05:00.315,000 --> 0:05:02,000
a band of activists could take a magazine headline,

110
0:05:03.279,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Occupy Wall Street,"

111
0:05:05.216,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and turn that into a global meme and movement.

112
0:05:08.132,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The thing is, though, most people

113
0:05:10.638,000 --> 0:05:13,000
aren't looking for and don't want to see these realities.

114
0:05:13.89,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy,

115
0:05:17.325,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is willful.

116
0:05:19.122,000 --> 0:05:2,000
There are some millennials, for instance,

117
0:05:20.97,000 --> 0:05:22,000
who think the whole business is just sordid.

118
0:05:23.636,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They don't want to have anything to do with politics.

119
0:05:25.312,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They'd rather just opt out

120
0:05:26.391,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and engage in volunteerism.

121
0:05:29.179,000 --> 0:05:31,000
There are some techies out there

122
0:05:31.372,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who believe that the cure-all

123
0:05:32.668,000 --> 0:05:34,000
for any power imbalance or power abuse

124
0:05:35.216,000 --> 0:05:37,000
is simply more data,

125
0:05:37.61,000 --> 0:05:39,000
more transparency.

126
0:05:40.093,000 --> 0:05:42,000
There are some on the left who think power resides

127
0:05:42.308,000 --> 0:05:43,000
only with corporations,

128
0:05:44.167,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and some on the right who think power

129
0:05:46.09,000 --> 0:05:47,000
resides only with government,

130
0:05:47.603,000 --> 0:05:51,000
each side blinded by their selective outrage.

131
0:05:51.964,000 --> 0:05:53,000
There are the naive who believe that

132
0:05:54.008,000 --> 0:05:55,000
good things just happen

133
0:05:55.315,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen,

134
0:05:58.665,000 --> 0:06:,000
the fortunate and unfortunate alike

135
0:06:01.017,000 --> 0:06:04,000
who think that their lot is simply what they deserve

136
0:06:04.54,000 --> 0:06:07,000
rather than the eminently alterable result

137
0:06:08.501,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation,

138
0:06:11.783,000 --> 0:06:14,000
of power.

139
0:06:15.446,000 --> 0:06:18,000
As a result of all of this creeping fatalism in public life,

140
0:06:19.122,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we here, particularly in America today,

141
0:06:21.259,000 --> 0:06:22,000
have depressingly low levels

142
0:06:23.141,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of civic knowledge, civic engagement, participation,

143
0:06:26.199,000 --> 0:06:29,000
awareness.

144
0:06:29.38,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The whole business of politics has been

145
0:06:31.258,000 --> 0:06:34,000
effectively subcontracted out to a band of professionals,

146
0:06:34.95,000 --> 0:06:35,000
money people, outreach people,

147
0:06:36.761,000 --> 0:06:38,000
message people, research people.

148
0:06:38.851,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs

149
0:06:41.922,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in the sense of suckers.

150
0:06:44.088,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We become demotivated to learn more

151
0:06:46.614,000 --> 0:06:47,000
about how things work.

152
0:06:47.996,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We begin to opt out.

153
0:06:53.59,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Well, this problem, this challenge,

154
0:06:57.221,000 --> 0:06:59,000
is a thing that we must now confront,

155
0:06:59.91,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and I believe that when you have

156
0:07:00.901,000 --> 0:07:02,000
this kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance,

157
0:07:03.88,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it becomes both a cause and a consequence

158
0:07:07.359,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of this concentration of opportunity

159
0:07:10.235,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of wealth and clout that I was describing a moment ago,

160
0:07:12.596,000 --> 0:07:15,000
this profound civic inequality.

161
0:07:16.334,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is why it is so important in our time right now

162
0:07:19.475,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to reimagine civics as the teaching of power.

163
0:07:22.922,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Perhaps it's never been more important

164
0:07:25.566,000 --> 0:07:3,000
at any time in our lifetimes.

165
0:07:30.955,000 --> 0:07:31,000
If people don't learn power,

166
0:07:32.89,000 --> 0:07:33,000
people don't wake up,

167
0:07:34.458,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and if they don't wake up,

168
0:07:36.213,000 --> 0:07:38,000
they get left out.

169
0:07:38.98,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Now, part of the art of practicing power

170
0:07:43.452,000 --> 0:07:45,000
means being awake and having a voice,

171
0:07:45.512,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but it also is about having an arena

172
0:07:47.897,000 --> 0:07:51,000
where you can plausibly practice deciding.

173
0:07:51.959,000 --> 0:07:53,000
All of civics boils down to the simple question

174
0:07:54.141,000 --> 0:07:55,000
of who decides,

175
0:07:55.899,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and you have to play that out

176
0:07:57.661,000 --> 0:07:59,000
in a place, in an arena.

177
0:07:59.694,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And this brings me to the third point that I want to make today,

178
0:08:02.622,000 --> 0:08:05,000
which is simply that there is no better arena

179
0:08:06.233,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in our time for the practicing of power

180
0:08:09.282,000 --> 0:08:11,000
than the city.

181
0:08:12.174,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Think about the city where you live,

182
0:08:14.028,000 --> 0:08:15,000
where you're from.

183
0:08:15.885,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Think about a problem in the common life of your city.

184
0:08:19.136,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It can be something small,

185
0:08:20.169,000 --> 0:08:22,000
like where a street lamp should go,

186
0:08:22.676,000 --> 0:08:23,000
or something medium like

187
0:08:24.297,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which library should have its hours extended or cut,

188
0:08:28.234,000 --> 0:08:29,000
or maybe something bigger,

189
0:08:29.804,000 --> 0:08:31,000
like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be

190
0:08:32.502,000 --> 0:08:34,000
turned into a highway or a greenway,

191
0:08:35.437,000 --> 0:08:36,000
or whether all the businesses in your town

192
0:08:37.135,000 --> 0:08:41,000
should be required to pay a living wage.

193
0:08:41.185,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Think about the change that you want in your city,

194
0:08:43.536,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and then think about how you would get it,

195
0:08:47.248,000 --> 0:08:5,000
how you would make it happen.

196
0:08:50.88,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Take an inventory of all the forms of power

197
0:08:53.21,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that are at play in your city's situation:

198
0:08:56.354,000 --> 0:09:,000
money, of course, people, yes,

199
0:09:00.693,000 --> 0:09:04,000
ideas, information, misinformation,

200
0:09:05.603,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the threat of force, the force of norms.

201
0:09:09.227,000 --> 0:09:1,000
All of these form of power are at play.

202
0:09:11.138,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Now think about how you would activate

203
0:09:12.68,000 --> 0:09:16,000
or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power.

204
0:09:17.483,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is not some Game of Thrones

205
0:09:20.689,000 --> 0:09:22,000
empire-level set of questions.

206
0:09:23.025,000 --> 0:09:24,000
These are questions that play out

207
0:09:24.918,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in every single place on the planet.

208
0:09:27.664,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I'll just tell you quickly about two stories

209
0:09:29.823,000 --> 0:09:31,000
drawn from recent headlines.

210
0:09:31.859,000 --> 0:09:32,000
In Boulder, Colorado,

211
0:09:33.301,000 --> 0:09:36,000
voters not too long ago approved a process

212
0:09:37.29,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to replace the private power company,

213
0:09:40.182,000 --> 0:09:42,000
literally the power company, the electric company Xcel,

214
0:09:42.494,000 --> 0:09:44,000
with a publicly owned utility

215
0:09:44.79,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that would forego profits

216
0:09:46.136,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and attend far more to climate change.

217
0:09:49.845,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Well, Xcel fought back,

218
0:09:51.97,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure

219
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that would undermine or undo

220
0:09:56.226,000 --> 0:09:57,000
this municipalization.

221
0:09:58.022,000 --> 0:10:,000
And so the citizen activists in Boulder who have been pushing this

222
0:10:00.636,000 --> 0:10:02,000
now literally have to fight the power

223
0:10:03.37,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in order to fight for power.

224
0:10:05.969,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,

225
0:10:10.342,000 --> 0:10:11,000
there's an organization on campus

226
0:10:12.278,000 --> 0:10:15,000
called, kind of menacingly, the Machine,

227
0:10:16.151,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and it draws from largely white sororities

228
0:10:19.522,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and fraternities on campus,

229
0:10:20.962,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and for decades, the Machine has dominated

230
0:10:23.381,000 --> 0:10:24,000
student government elections.

231
0:10:25.234,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Well now, recently, the Machine

232
0:10:27.63,000 --> 0:10:28,000
has started to get involved

233
0:10:28.927,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in actual city politics,

234
0:10:30.61,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and they've engineered the election

235
0:10:32.268,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of a former Machine member,

236
0:10:33.64,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a young, pro-business recent graduate

237
0:10:36.346,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to the Tuscaloosa city school board.

238
0:10:39.86,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now, as I say, these are just two examples

239
0:10:42.696,000 --> 0:10:44,000
drawn almost at random from the headlines.

240
0:10:45.4,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Every day, there are thousands more like them.

241
0:10:48.6,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And you may like or dislike

242
0:10:50.364,000 --> 0:10:51,000
the efforts I'm describing here

243
0:10:52.269,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,

244
0:10:53.598,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but you cannot help but admire

245
0:10:56.24,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the power literacy of the players involved,

246
0:10:59.311,000 --> 0:11:,000
their skill.

247
0:11:00.486,000 --> 0:11:02,000
You cannot help but reckon with and recognize

248
0:11:03.462,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the command they have

249
0:11:05.073,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of the elemental questions

250
0:11:07.608,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of civic power —

251
0:11:09.484,000 --> 0:11:13,000
what objective, what strategy, what tactics,

252
0:11:13.522,000 --> 0:11:15,000
what is the terrain, who are your enemies,

253
0:11:16.5,000 --> 0:11:18,000
who are your allies?

254
0:11:18.65,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now I want you to return

255
0:11:20.395,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to thinking about that problem or that opportunity

256
0:11:23.79,000 --> 0:11:25,000
or that challenge in your city,

257
0:11:25.951,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and the thing it was that you want to fix

258
0:11:27.824,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or create in your city,

259
0:11:29.635,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and ask yourself,

260
0:11:31.95,000 --> 0:11:34,000
do you have command of these elemental questions of power?

261
0:11:35.6,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Could you put into practice effectively

262
0:11:38.65,000 --> 0:11:41,000
what it is that you know?

263
0:11:41.664,000 --> 0:11:45,000
This is the challenge and the opportunity for us.

264
0:11:46.061,000 --> 0:11:48,000
We live in a time right now

265
0:11:48.577,000 --> 0:11:5,000
where in spite of globalization

266
0:11:51.564,000 --> 0:11:53,000
or perhaps because of globalization,

267
0:11:53.724,000 --> 0:11:55,000
all citizenship is ever more resonantly,

268
0:11:55.76,000 --> 0:11:56,000
powerfully local.

269
0:11:57.54,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Indeed, power in our time is flowing

270
0:12:00.248,000 --> 0:12:02,000
ever faster to the city.

271
0:12:02.61,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Here in the United States, the national government

272
0:12:04.258,000 --> 0:12:07,000
has tied itself up in partisan knots.

273
0:12:07.259,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Civic imagination and innovation and creativity

274
0:12:10.181,000 --> 0:12:12,000
are emerging from local ecosystems now

275
0:12:12.798,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and radiating outward,

276
0:12:14.688,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and this great innovation,

277
0:12:18.128,000 --> 0:12:2,000
this great wave

278
0:12:21.055,000 --> 0:12:24,000
of localism that's now arriving,

279
0:12:24.981,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and you see it in how people eat

280
0:12:26.646,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and work and share and buy and move

281
0:12:29.294,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and live their everyday lives,

282
0:12:30.989,000 --> 0:12:33,000
this isn't some precious parochialism,

283
0:12:34.142,000 --> 0:12:37,000
this isn't some retreat into insularity, no.

284
0:12:37.456,000 --> 0:12:39,000
This is emergent.

285
0:12:39.819,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The localism of our time is networked powerfully.

286
0:12:43.61,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And so, for instance,

287
0:12:44.873,000 --> 0:12:46,000
consider the ways that strategies

288
0:12:47.036,000 --> 0:12:49,000
for making cities more bike-friendly

289
0:12:49.47,000 --> 0:12:51,000
have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen

290
0:12:52.016,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.

291
0:12:57.138,000 --> 0:13:,000
Think about how experiments in participatory budgeting,

292
0:13:00.702,000 --> 0:13:01,000
where everyday citizens get a chance

293
0:13:02.175,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to allocate and decide upon

294
0:13:04.976,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the allocation of city funds.

295
0:13:07.91,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Those experiments have spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil

296
0:13:11.49,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to here in New York City, to the wards of Chicago.

297
0:13:15.853,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles

298
0:13:17.991,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and many cities between

299
0:13:20.341,000 --> 0:13:22,000
are now organizing to stage strikes

300
0:13:22.624,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to remind the people who live in their cities

301
0:13:24.694,000 --> 0:13:27,000
what a day without immigrants would look like.

302
0:13:27.98,000 --> 0:13:29,000
In China, all across that country,

303
0:13:30.438,000 --> 0:13:32,000
members of the New Citizens' Movement

304
0:13:32.646,000 --> 0:13:33,000
are beginning to activate and organize

305
0:13:34.232,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to fight official corruption and graft,

306
0:13:36.886,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and they're drawing the ire of officials there,

307
0:13:38.99,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but they're also drawing the attention

308
0:13:40.733,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of anti-corruption activists all around the world.

309
0:13:44.288,000 --> 0:13:45,000
In Seattle, where I'm from,

310
0:13:46.223,000 --> 0:13:48,000
we've become part of a great global array of cities

311
0:13:48.669,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that are now working together

312
0:13:50.228,000 --> 0:13:51,000
bypassing government altogether,

313
0:13:51.758,000 --> 0:13:53,000
national government altogether,

314
0:13:54.138,000 --> 0:13:56,000
in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals

315
0:13:56.487,000 --> 0:13:58,000
of the Kyoto Protocol.

316
0:13:58.627,000 --> 0:14:01,000
All of these citizens, united,

317
0:14:01.67,000 --> 0:14:02,000
are forming a web,

318
0:14:03.345,000 --> 0:14:05,000
a great archipelago of power

319
0:14:05.358,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that allows us to bypass

320
0:14:07.765,000 --> 0:14:1,000
brokenness and monopolies of control.

321
0:14:11.669,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And our task now is to accelerate this work.

322
0:14:14.55,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Our task now is to bring more and more people

323
0:14:16.664,000 --> 0:14:18,000
into the fold of this work.

324
0:14:18.695,000 --> 0:14:2,000
That's why my organization, Citizen University,

325
0:14:21.444,000 --> 0:14:23,000
has undertaken a project now

326
0:14:23.448,000 --> 0:14:25,000
to create an everyman's curriculum

327
0:14:26.293,000 --> 0:14:28,000
in civic power.

328
0:14:28.61,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And this curriculum starts with this triad

329
0:14:30.815,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that I described earlier of values,

330
0:14:32.83,000 --> 0:14:35,000
systems and skills.

331
0:14:35.956,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you

332
0:14:38.808,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to help create this curriculum

333
0:14:41.458,000 --> 0:14:43,000
with the stories and the experiences

334
0:14:43.885,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and the challenges that each of you lives and faces,

335
0:14:47.142,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to create something powerfully collective.

336
0:14:50.146,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And I want to invite you in particular to try

337
0:14:52.557,000 --> 0:14:54,000
a simple exercise drawn

338
0:14:54.656,000 --> 0:14:56,000
from the early frameworks of this curriculum.

339
0:14:57.199,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I want you to write a narrative,

340
0:14:59.63,000 --> 0:15:02,000
a narrative from the future of your city,

341
0:15:02.68,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and you can date it, set it out one year from now,

342
0:15:06.221,000 --> 0:15:07,000
five years from now, a decade from now,

343
0:15:07.965,000 --> 0:15:08,000
a generation from now,

344
0:15:09.766,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and write it as a case study looking back,

345
0:15:13.611,000 --> 0:15:14,000
looking back at the change

346
0:15:15.256,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that you wanted in your city,

347
0:15:17.352,000 --> 0:15:19,000
looking back at the cause that you were championing,

348
0:15:20.091,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and describing the ways that that change

349
0:15:22.825,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and that cause came, in fact, to succeed.

350
0:15:27.036,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Describe the values

351
0:15:28.948,000 --> 0:15:3,000
of your fellow citizens that you activated,

352
0:15:31.333,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir.

353
0:15:34.94,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Recount all the different ways

354
0:15:36.602,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that you engaged the systems of government,

355
0:15:39.23,000 --> 0:15:4,000
of the marketplace,

356
0:15:40.741,000 --> 0:15:42,000
of social institutions, of faith organizations,

357
0:15:42.946,000 --> 0:15:45,000
of the media.

358
0:15:46.148,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Catalog all the skills you had to deploy,

359
0:15:50.113,000 --> 0:15:52,000
how to negotiate, how to advocate,

360
0:15:52.527,000 --> 0:15:53,000
how to frame issues,

361
0:15:53.922,000 --> 0:15:55,000
how to navigate diversity in conflict,

362
0:15:56.463,000 --> 0:15:57,000
all those skills that enabled you

363
0:15:58.282,000 --> 0:16:,000
to bring folks on board

364
0:16:00.353,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and to overcome resistance.

365
0:16:03.05,000 --> 0:16:06,000
What you'll be doing when you write that narrative

366
0:16:06.422,000 --> 0:16:1,000
is you'll be discovering how to read power,

367
0:16:10.501,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and in the process, how to write power.

368
0:16:15.698,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So share what you write,

369
0:16:17.903,000 --> 0:16:18,000
do you what you write,

370
0:16:19.241,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and then share what you do.

371
0:16:23.058,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I invite you to literally share

372
0:16:25.052,000 --> 0:16:26,000
the narratives that you create

373
0:16:26.946,000 --> 0:16:28,000
on our Facebook page for Citizen University.

374
0:16:29.89,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But even beyond that, it's in the conversations

375
0:16:32.572,000 --> 0:16:33,000
that we have today

376
0:16:34.128,000 --> 0:16:36,000
all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings

377
0:16:36.389,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that are happening on this topic at this moment,

378
0:16:39.239,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and to think about how we can become

379
0:16:40.99,000 --> 0:16:43,000
one another's teachers and students in power.

380
0:16:44.59,000 --> 0:16:46,000
If we do that, then together

381
0:16:46.863,000 --> 0:16:48,000
we can make civics sexy again.

382
0:16:49.276,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Together, we can democratize democracy

383
0:16:51.678,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and make it safe again for amateurs.

384
0:16:54.888,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Together, we can create a great network of city

385
0:16:59.237,000 --> 0:17:01,000
that will be the most powerful collective laboratory

386
0:17:01.769,000 --> 0:17:04,000
for self-government this planet has ever seen.

387
0:17:05.235,000 --> 0:17:07,000
We have the power to do that.

388
0:17:08.221,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Thank you very much.

389
0:17:10.69,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Applause)

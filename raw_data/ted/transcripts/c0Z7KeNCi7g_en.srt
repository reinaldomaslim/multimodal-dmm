1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Good morning.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Happy to see so many fine folks out here

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and so many smiling faces.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I have a very peculiar

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
background, attitude and approach

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to the real world

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because I am a conjurer.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now, I prefer that term over magician,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because if I were a magician, that would mean

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that I use spells and incantations

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and weird gestures

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in order to accomplish real magic.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who is someone who pretends to be

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a real magician. (Laughter)

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We depend on the fact

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that audiences, such as yourselves,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
will make assumptions.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
For example, when I walked up here

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I took the microphone from the stand

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and switched it on,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
As a matter of fact, this is something

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's a beard trimmer, you see?

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And it makes a very bad microphone;

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I've tried it many times. (Laughter)

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The other assumption that you made --

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and this little lesson is to show you

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that you will make assumptions.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Not only that you can, but that you will

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when they are properly suggested to you.

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You believe I'm looking at you.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I know you're there because I can hear you,

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
These are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Quite empty frames.

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now why would a grown man appear before you

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
wearing empty frames on his face?

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
To fool you, ladies and gentlemen,

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to deceive you, to show that you, too,

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
can make assumptions.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Don't you ever forget that.

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, I have to do something -- first of all, switch to real glasses

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so I can actually see you,

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which would probably be a convenience. I don't know.

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience.

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I have to do something now, which seems

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
a little bit strange for a magician.

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But I'm going to take some medication.

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is a full bottle of

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Calms Forte.

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I'll explain that in just a moment.

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Ignore the instructions,

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that's what the government has to put in there

61
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to confuse you, I'm sure.

62
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I will take enough of these. Mm.

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Indeed, the whole container.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now that I've done that -- I'll explain it in a moment --

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I must tell you that

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I am an actor.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I'm an actor who plays a specific part.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I play the part of a magician,

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and actually claim to be

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
you would be insulted

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and rightly so.

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Why would a man assume that you would believe

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
something bizarre like this?

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But there exists out there

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a very large population

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of people who will tell you

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that they have psychic, magical powers

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that they can predict the future,

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that they can make contact with the deceased.

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Oh, they also say

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
they will sell you astrology

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or other fortunetelling methods.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And they also say

89
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that they can give you perpetual motion machines

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and free energy systems.

91
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They claim to be psychics,

92
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
or sensitives, whatever they can.

93
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But the one thing that has made a big comeback

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
just recently

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is this business of

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
speaking with the dead.

97
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, to my innocent mind,

98
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
dead implies

99
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
incapable of communicating. (Laughter)

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You might agree with me on that.

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But these people, they tend to tell you that

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
not only can they communicate with the dead --

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"Hi, there" --

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but they can hear the dead as well,

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they can relay this information back to the living.

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I wonder if that's true.

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I don't think so, because

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
this subculture of people

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,

110
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
exactly the same --

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the same physical methods, the same psychological methods --

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and they effectively and profoundly

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
deceive millions of people around the earth,

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to their detriment.

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They deceive these people,

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
costs them a lot of money,

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
cost them a lot of emotional anguish.

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Billions of dollars are spent

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
every year, all over the globe,

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
on these charlatans.

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now, I have two questions

122
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I would like to ask these people

123
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
if I had the opportunity to do so.

124
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
First question: If I want to ask them to call up --

125
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because they do hear them through the ear.

126
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They listen to the spirits like this --

127
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
because, when she died, she had the family will,

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is,

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"

131
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and my family

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And I love you, and I'll always be with you.

136
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Good bye."

137
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And she didn't answer the damn question!

138
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Where is the will?

139
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now, she could easily have said,

140
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,"

141
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.

142
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
She doesn't bring any useful information to us.

143
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We paid a lot of money for that information,

144
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
be we didn't get it.

145
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The second question that I'd like to ask, rather simple:

146
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Suppose I ask them to contact

147
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Why do they insist on saying --

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
remember, they speak into this ear --

150
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
why do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"

151
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Is this a hunting game?

152
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Hunting and fishing? What is it?

153
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Is it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions.

154
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But it is a cruel, vicious,

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
absolutely conscienceless --

156
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) --

157
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
game that these people play.

158
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,

159
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the grieving, the needy people out there.

160
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now, this is a process

161
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that is called cold reading.

162
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
There's one fellow out there,

163
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.

164
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.

165
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
John Edward, Sylvia Browne

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,

168
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
James Van Praagh is very big.

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And what does he do? He likes to tell you

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
how the deceased got deceased,

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the people he's talking to through his ear, you see?

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,

173
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that he had trouble breathing."

175
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Folks, that's what dying is all about!

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You stop breathing, and then you're dead.

178
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's that simple.

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I don't think so.

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like,

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
"Why am I getting electricity?

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
He's saying to me, 'Electricity.'

184
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Was he an electrician?" "No."

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It was a game of hunting questions like this.

187
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
This is what they go through.

188
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now, folks often ask us

189
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
at the James Randi Educational Foundation,

190
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?

191
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Isn't it just a lot of fun?"

192
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.

193
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,

194
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but that comfort lasts

195
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
only about 20 minutes or so.

196
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And then the people look in the mirror, and they say,

197
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I just paid a lot of money for that reading.

198
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And what did she say to me? 'I love you!'"

199
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
They always say that.

200
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
They don't get any information,

201
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they don't get any value for what they spend.

202
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.

203
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We call her "The Talons."

204
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Sylvia Browne -- thank you --

205
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Sylvia Browne is the big operator

206
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
in this field at this very moment.

207
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you --

208
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
she actually gets 700 dollars

209
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
for a 20 minute reading over the telephone,

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
she doesn't even go there in person,

211
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and you have to wait up to two years because

212
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
she's booked ahead that amount of time.

213
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
You pay by credit card or whatever,

214
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and then she will call you

215
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
sometime in the next two years.

216
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
You can tell it's her. "Hello, this is Sylvia Browne."

217
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
That's her, you can tell right away.

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.

219
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
We all know who he is on television.

220
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
He's well educated, he's smart,

221
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing

222
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but he doesn't give a damn.

223
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
He just doesn't care.

224
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,

225
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and he will expose her

226
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to television publicity all the time.

227
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Now, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?

228
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
She gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.

229
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter)

230
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
She gives you the names of previous lives,

231
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
who you were in previous lives.

232
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Duh.

233
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It turns out that the women

234
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that she gives readings for

235
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
were all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.

236
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And the men were all Grecian warriors

237
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
fighting with Agamemnon.

238
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Nothing is ever said about

239
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London

240
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
who died of consumption.

241
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.

242
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And the strange thing -- folks, you may have noticed this too.

243
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
You see these folks on television --

244
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
they never call anybody back from hell. (Laughter)

245
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.

246
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
If they call back any of my friends,

247
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they're not going to... Well, you see the story.

248
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

249
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, Sylvia Browne is an exception,

250
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
an exception in one way,

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
because the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation,

252
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.

253
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Very simply won.

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
All you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult

255
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
or supernatural event or power of any kind

256
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
under proper observing conditions.

257
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It's very easy, win the million dollars.

258
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that

259
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
she's the only professional psychic

260
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
in the whole world

261
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that has accepted our challenge.

262
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN

263
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
six and a half years ago.

264
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And we haven't heard from her since. Strange.

265
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
She said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.

266
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Duh.

267
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
A professional psychic who speaks to dead people,

268
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
she can't reach me?

269
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

270
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I'm alive, you may have noticed.

271
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Well, pretty well anyway.

272
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me

273
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
because I'm a godless person.

274
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
All the more reason to take the million dollars,

275
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
wouldn't you think, Sylvia?

276
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Now these people need to be stopped, seriously now.

277
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.

278
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We get people coming to the foundation all the time.

279
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They're ruined financially and emotionally

280
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because they've given their money and their faith

281
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to these people.

282
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now, I popped some pills earlier.

283
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I have to explain that to you.

284
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.

285
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Hmm. You've heard of it.

286
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It's an alternative form of healing, right?

287
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Homeopathy actually consists -- and that's what this is.

288
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This is Calms Forte,

289
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.

290
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I just ingested

291
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.

292
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Laughter)

293
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.

294
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It says right on the back here,

295
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
"In case of overdose,

296
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
contact your poison control center immediately,"

297
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and it gives an 800 number.

298
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay.

299
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I don't really need it

300
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because I've been doing this stunt

301
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
for audiences all over the world

302
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for the last eight or 10 years,

303
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.

304
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Why don't they affect me?

305
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Laughter)

306
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

307
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The answer may surprise you.

308
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
What is homeopathy?

309
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It's taking a medicine that really works

310
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and diluting it down

311
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
well beyond Avogadro's limit.

312
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Diluting it down to the point

313
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
where there's none of it left. (Laughter)

314
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Now folks, this is not

315
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.

316
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It's exactly equivalent to taking

317
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
one 325 milligram aspirin tablet,

318
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,

319
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,

320
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and waiting two years or so

321
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
until the solution is homogeneous.

322
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Then, when you get a headache,

323
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
you take a sip of this water, and -- voila! -- it is gone.

324
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

325
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.

326
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one --

327
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the more dilute the medicine is, they say,

328
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the more powerful it is.

329
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.

330
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.

331
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
He died of an overdose.

332
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
He forgot to take his pill.

333
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Laughter)

334
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Work on it. Work on it.

335
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.

336
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I don't know what we're doing,

337
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
believing in all this nonsense over all these years.

338
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Now, let me tell you,

339
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The James Randi Educational Foundation

340
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is waving this very big carrot,

341
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
but I must say, the fact that nobody

342
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
has taken us up on this offer

343
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
doesn't mean that the powers don't exist.

344
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
They might, some place out there.

345
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy.

346
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.

347
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
You know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading

348
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
over the telephone --

349
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that's more than lawyers make!

350
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I mean that's a fabulous amount of money.

351
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
These people don't need the million dollars perhaps,

352
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it

353
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
just to make me look silly?

354
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Just to get rid of this godless person out there

355
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time?

356
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I think that something needs to be done about this.

357
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We really would love to have suggestions from you folks

358
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
on how to contact federal, state

359
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and local authorities

360
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to get them to do something.

361
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
If you find out -- now I understand.

362
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We've seen people, even today, speaking to us

363
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
about AIDS epidemics

364
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and starving kids around the world

365
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.

366
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Those are very important,

367
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
critically important to us.

368
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And we must do something about those problems.

369
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
But at the same time,

370
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
as Arthur C. Clarke said,

371
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The rotting of the human mind,

372
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult

373
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and the supernatural --

374
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
all of this total nonsense,

375
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
this medieval thinking --

376
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I think something should be done about that,

377
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and it all lies in education.

378
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Largely, it's the media

379
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
who are to blame for this sort of thing.

380
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
They shamelessly promote

381
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
all kinds of nonsense of this sort

382
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
because it pleases the sponsors.

383
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
It's the bottom line, the dollar line.

384
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
That's what they're looking at.

385
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We really must do something about this.

386
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I'm willing to take your suggestions,

387
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and I'm willing to have you

388
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
tune in to our webpage.

389
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
It's www.randi.org.

390
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Go in there and look at the archives,

391
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and you will begin to understand much more

392
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
of what I've been talking about today.

393
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
You will see the records that we have.

394
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
There's nothing like sitting in that library

395
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and having a family appear there

396
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.

397
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
She cashed in the CDs,

398
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
she gave away the stocks and the certificates.

399
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
That's really sad to hear,

400
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and it hasn't helped them one bit,

401
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
hasn't solved any of their problems.

402
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Yes, there could be a rotting of the American mind,

403
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and of the minds all the way around the earth,

404
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
if we don't start to think sensibly about these things.

405
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Now, we've offered this carrot,

406
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
as I say, we've dangled the carrot.

407
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.

408
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Oh, we get lots of them,

409
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
hundreds of them every year come by.

410
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
These are dowsers and people

411
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
who think that they can talk to the dead as well,

412
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
but they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate

413
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
their own so-called powers.

414
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
The professionals never come near us,

415
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
except in that case of Sylvia Browne

416
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
that I told you about a moment ago.

417
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
She did accept and then backed away.

418
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

419
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I'm James Randi,

420
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and I'm waiting.

421
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Thank you.

422
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
(Applause)

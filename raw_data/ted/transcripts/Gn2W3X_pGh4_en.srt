2
0:00:15.702,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name

3
0:00:19.602,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to say, "I exist."

4
0:00:21.441,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street

5
0:00:26.434,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to say, "They exist."

6
0:00:28.791,000 --> 0:00:32,000
From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine,

7
0:00:33.306,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the rooftops of Kenya

8
0:00:35.716,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to the favelas of Rio,

9
0:00:37.604,000 --> 0:00:4,000
paper and glue -- as easy as that.

10
0:00:41.347,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I asked a question last year:

11
0:00:43.566,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Can art change the world?

12
0:00:45.841,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well let me tell you,

13
0:00:47.843,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year,

14
0:00:51.583,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because the Arab Spring is still spreading,

15
0:00:54.777,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?

16
0:00:58.087,000 --> 0:01:,000
The Occupy movement found a voice,

17
0:01:01.08,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I still have to speak English constantly.

18
0:01:03.552,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So there has been a lot of change.

19
0:01:06.385,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So when I had my TED wish last year,

20
0:01:08.52,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.

21
0:01:11.683,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You are going to take the photos.

22
0:01:14.351,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You're going to send them to me.

23
0:01:16.931,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I'm going to print them and send them back to you.

24
0:01:20.148,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense

25
0:01:22.645,000 --> 0:01:23,000
for you to place your own statement.

26
0:01:24.52,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This is Inside Out.

27
0:01:26.989,000 --> 0:01:3,000
One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.

28
0:01:31.172,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Those are the kind of posters, let me show you.

29
0:01:35.172,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And we keep sending more every day.

30
0:01:37.427,000 --> 0:01:38,000
This is the size.

31
0:01:38.871,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it.

32
0:01:42.793,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This one was from Haiti.

33
0:01:46.308,000 --> 0:01:48,000
When I launched my wish last year,

34
0:01:48.76,000 --> 0:01:52,000
hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.

35
0:01:53.185,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But I say it has to be

36
0:01:55.402,000 --> 0:01:58,000
under the conditions I've always worked:

37
0:01:58.856,000 --> 0:02:02,000
no credit, no logos, no sponsoring.

38
0:02:03.118,000 --> 0:02:07,000
A week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock

39
0:02:07.468,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and empower the people on the ground

40
0:02:09.922,000 --> 0:02:1,000
who wanted to change the world.

41
0:02:11.468,000 --> 0:02:15,000
These are the people I want to talk about to you today.

42
0:02:16.28,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Two weeks after my speech, in Tunisia,

43
0:02:22.054,000 --> 0:02:25,000
hundreds of portraits were made.

44
0:02:25.805,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator

45
0:02:30.052,000 --> 0:02:31,000
[with] their own photos.

46
0:02:31.552,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Boom! This is what happened.

47
0:02:34.385,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Slim and his friends went through the country

48
0:02:36.135,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere

49
0:02:38.51,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to show the diversity in the country.

50
0:02:41.673,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They really make Inside Out their own project.

51
0:02:45.756,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station,

52
0:02:49.302,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and what you see on the ground

53
0:02:50.806,000 --> 0:02:56,000
are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police.

54
0:02:56.967,000 --> 0:03:,000
Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia.

55
0:03:01.677,000 --> 0:03:05,000
He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe

56
0:03:06.2,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and stood there with the photos

57
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to say, "We have rights."

58
0:03:10.02,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They used Inside Out as a platform for protest.

59
0:03:14.551,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Karachi, Pakistan.

60
0:03:16.468,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Sharmeen is actually here.

61
0:03:18.268,000 --> 0:03:21,000
She organized a TEDx action out there

62
0:03:21.633,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and made all the unseen faces of the city

63
0:03:24.664,000 --> 0:03:26,000
on the walls in her town.

64
0:03:26.927,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I want to thank her today.

65
0:03:29.258,000 --> 0:03:32,000
North Dakota. Standing Rock Nation,

66
0:03:33.033,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in this Turtle Island, [unclear name] from the Dakota Lakota tribe

67
0:03:38.768,000 --> 0:03:41,000
wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here.

68
0:03:42.125,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights.

69
0:03:45.76,000 --> 0:03:47,000
He pasted up portraits all over his reservation.

70
0:03:48.735,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And he's here also today.

71
0:03:50.602,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Each time I get a wall in New York,

72
0:03:54.102,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I use his photos to continue spreading the project.

73
0:03:59.123,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Juarez: You've heard of the border --

74
0:04:02.177,000 --> 0:04:04,000
one of the most dangerous borders in the world.

75
0:04:05.01,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers

76
0:04:09.783,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and covered the entire border.

77
0:04:12.568,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Do you know what it takes to do this?

78
0:04:14.593,000 --> 0:04:18,000
People, energy, make the glue, organize the team.

79
0:04:18.695,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It was amazing.

80
0:04:20.814,000 --> 0:04:22,000
While in Iran at the same time

81
0:04:23.614,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Abololo -- of course a nickname --

82
0:04:25.977,000 --> 0:04:27,000
has pasted one single face of a woman

83
0:04:28.922,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to show his resistance against the government.

84
0:04:32.521,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action.

85
0:04:37.231,000 --> 0:04:39,000
There are tons of school projects.

86
0:04:39.833,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.

87
0:04:43.483,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Education is so essential.

88
0:04:45.383,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them,

89
0:04:48.718,000 --> 0:04:49,000
they paste them on the school.

90
0:04:50.393,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Here they even got the help of the firemen.

91
0:04:52.385,000 --> 0:04:55,000
There should be even more schools doing this kind of project.

92
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.

93
0:05:01.995,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck.

94
0:05:05.03,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo,

95
0:05:07.241,000 --> 0:05:11,000
30 seconds later take it from the side, you're ready to rock.

96
0:05:11.364,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Thousands of people use them

97
0:05:14.326,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution

98
0:05:18.497,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and then walk in the street.

99
0:05:20.427,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This is march, the 450,000 march -- beginning of September.

100
0:05:24.504,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They were all holding their photo as a statement.

101
0:05:26.814,000 --> 0:05:3,000
On the other side, people were wrapping up streets, buildings.

102
0:05:30.843,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It's everywhere.

103
0:05:32.345,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Come on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there.

104
0:05:35.364,000 --> 0:05:39,000
These projects took thousands of actions in one year,

105
0:05:40.052,000 --> 0:05:43,000
making hundreds of thousands of people participating,

106
0:05:43.218,000 --> 0:05:46,000
creating millions of views.

107
0:05:46.893,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on.

108
0:05:53.998,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So back to the question, "Can art change the world?"

109
0:05:57.86,000 --> 0:06:,000
Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning.

110
0:06:01.716,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But maybe we should change the question.

111
0:06:04.446,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Can art change people's lives?

112
0:06:06.985,000 --> 0:06:09,000
From what I've seen this year, yes.

113
0:06:10.86,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And you know what? It's just the beginning.

114
0:06:13.543,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Let's turn the world inside out together.

115
0:06:16.331,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Thank you.

116
0:06:17.724,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.904,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So it's 1969, New York City,

2
0:00:18.577,000 --> 0:00:21,000
third grade music class,

3
0:00:22.141,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and our teacher brings us into a room with nothing but a piano and chairs.

4
0:00:28.541,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And one by one, he calls us up,

5
0:00:31.279,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and he plays middle C, and he asks us to sing it.

6
0:00:34.787,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Singing)

7
0:00:37.333,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And you're either instructed to go to the right of the room

8
0:00:40.191,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or the left side of the room.

9
0:00:41.699,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:45.139,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And when all 35 kids are done,

11
0:00:48.916,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the left side of the room, which I was a part of,

12
0:00:52.013,000 --> 0:00:55,000
was told to stand up and go back to home room.

13
0:00:56.237,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:58.798,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And none of us ever received another music class again

15
0:01:04.18,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in elementary school.

16
0:01:06.313,000 --> 0:01:09,000
An in club and an out club was established,

17
0:01:10.195,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I didn't even know what the gating test was in the moment.

18
0:01:17.061,000 --> 0:01:2,000
A few years later, English class ...

19
0:01:20.569,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:22.356,000 --> 0:01:26,000
first paper of a new semester,

21
0:01:27.141,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and I get the paper back,

22
0:01:29.188,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and it's C+,

23
0:01:31.746,000 --> 0:01:34,000
with the comment, "Good as can be expected."

24
0:01:35.061,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:38.584,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now, honestly, I didn't mind a C+.

26
0:01:41.606,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was just happy it wasn't a C- or a D.

27
0:01:45.72,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But the "good as can be expected" comment ...

28
0:01:48.979,000 --> 0:01:5,000
even at that young age, it didn't seem right.

29
0:01:52.667,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It seemed somehow limiting.

30
0:01:57.6,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now, how many people here have had an experience similar to that,

31
0:02:02.544,000 --> 0:02:04,000
either at school or the workplace?

32
0:02:07.52,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We're not alone.

33
0:02:11.003,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So I guess it might be ironic

34
0:02:14.847,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that my life path would lead me to a career

35
0:02:18.798,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of making music and writing for Blue Man Group

36
0:02:23.007,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:24.546,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and starting a school.

38
0:02:26.147,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:28.892,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But school was torture for me.

40
0:02:32.047,000 --> 0:02:35,000
As someone who didn't have a natural proclivity for academics,

41
0:02:36.052,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and my teachers never seemed to understand me,

42
0:02:39.738,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I didn't know how to navigate schools

43
0:02:41.545,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and schools didn't know what to do with me.

44
0:02:45.212,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So I started to ask the question, even back then,

45
0:02:49.531,000 --> 0:02:52,000
if these environments didn't know what to do

46
0:02:52.794,000 --> 0:02:55,000
with people who didn't fit a standard mold,

47
0:02:56.802,000 --> 0:02:59,000
why weren't we reshaping the environments

48
0:03:00.441,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to take advantage of people's strengths?

49
0:03:05.402,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What I've come to believe

50
0:03:08.059,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is that we need to cultivate safe and conducive conditions

51
0:03:13.293,000 --> 0:03:17,000
for new and innovative ideas to evolve and thrive.

52
0:03:19.956,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We know that humans are innately innovative,

53
0:03:23.315,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because if we weren't,

54
0:03:24.697,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we'd all be using the same arrowheads that we were using 10,000 years ago.

55
0:03:30.152,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So one of the things that I started to question is,

56
0:03:33.842,000 --> 0:03:37,000
are there ways to make innovation easier

57
0:03:38.121,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and happen more frequently?

58
0:03:41.523,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Is there a way to take those aha moments,

59
0:03:44.404,000 --> 0:03:49,000
those breakthroughs that seem to happen randomly and occasionally,

60
0:03:50.397,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and have them happen intentionally and frequently?

61
0:03:55.316,000 --> 0:03:57,000
When we started Blue Man Group in 1988,

62
0:03:58.205,000 --> 0:04:,000
we had never done an off-Broadway show before.

63
0:04:01.553,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We'd actually done almost no theater.

64
0:04:05.086,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But we knew what we were passionate about,

65
0:04:08.194,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it was a whole series of things that we had never seen onstage before,

66
0:04:12.158,000 --> 0:04:16,000
things like art and pop culture and technology and sociology

67
0:04:16.382,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and anthropology and percussion and comedy and following your bliss.

68
0:04:23.698,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We established a rule

69
0:04:25.586,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that nothing made it onstage if we had seen it before,

70
0:04:30.888,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we wanted to inspire creativity and connectedness

71
0:04:34.071,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in ourselves and our audiences;

72
0:04:37.016,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we wanted to do a little bit of social good,

73
0:04:39.879,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and we wanted to have fun doing it.

74
0:04:42.456,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And in the office,

75
0:04:43.87,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we wanted to create an environment where people treated each other

76
0:04:47.156,000 --> 0:04:49,000
just a little bit better,

77
0:04:49.331,000 --> 0:04:52,000
just a little bit more respect and consideration

78
0:04:53.021,000 --> 0:04:54,000
than in the outside world.

79
0:04:56.74,000 --> 0:05:,000
And we continued to iterate and collaborate and find solutions

80
0:05:01.669,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to create things that hadn't been seen.

81
0:05:06.53,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Over time, I've come to identify the optimal conditions

82
0:05:12.09,000 --> 0:05:16,000
for these types of creative and innovative environments

83
0:05:16.352,000 --> 0:05:2,000
are clear intent, purpose and passion:

84
0:05:20.38,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this is working on something bigger than ourselves.

85
0:05:24.73,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Personal integrity:

86
0:05:26.651,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it's doing what we say we're going to do.

87
0:05:29.037,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's being our authentic self in all interactions.

88
0:05:32.904,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Direct communication and clear expectations,

89
0:05:36.151,000 --> 0:05:38,000
even when the subject matter is difficult.

90
0:05:39.222,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Grit and perseverance:

91
0:05:41.191,000 --> 0:05:44,000
iteration, iteration, iteration.

92
0:05:46.136,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Establish collaborative teams.

93
0:05:49.129,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Instill deep trust and mutual respect.

94
0:05:52.686,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Everyone on your team is in.

95
0:05:54.844,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There is no out club.

96
0:05:57.192,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We rise as a team, we fall as a team,

97
0:06:00.146,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and decisions are decisions until they're not.

98
0:06:03.996,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Embrace multiple perspectives.

99
0:06:06.488,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This means all voices matter, all emotions matter.

100
0:06:10.385,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Address disagreements head-on.

101
0:06:12.579,000 --> 0:06:14,000
People should feel seen and heard.

102
0:06:15.509,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Take risks and celebrate mistakes.

103
0:06:18.735,000 --> 0:06:2,000
A commitment to being a learning organization,

104
0:06:21.581,000 --> 0:06:26,000
always trying to spiral upwards the innovation and learning curves.

105
0:06:28.389,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And speak in one voice.

106
0:06:30.738,000 --> 0:06:34,000
This is perhaps the glue that holds all these conditions together.

107
0:06:35.669,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The concept is that we speak in the exact same manner

108
0:06:39.836,000 --> 0:06:41,000
about someone who's not in the room

109
0:06:42.598,000 --> 0:06:43,000
as if they are in the room.

110
0:06:45.224,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now this seems basic, but it's an aspirational practice

111
0:06:50.589,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that helps deal with difficult situations in a more respectful way.

112
0:06:57.521,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Sewing this practice in can have a profound effect on raising the bar,

113
0:07:02.784,000 --> 0:07:04,000
on mutual respect, trust,

114
0:07:04.919,000 --> 0:07:09,000
reducing gossip and politics in the office and the classroom,

115
0:07:10.475,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and thus reducing the noise that gets in the way of the innovative process.

116
0:07:16.412,000 --> 0:07:2,000
At Blue Man Group, iteration was essential for our creative process.

117
0:07:20.841,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We were writing a piece

118
0:07:22.431,000 --> 0:07:27,000
where we were trying to illustrate the consumption / waste loop

119
0:07:28.075,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in a funny and creative and surprising way for our audiences.

120
0:07:34.667,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, if you have yourselves thought about trying to do the same endeavor,

121
0:07:41.033,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I can save you a lot of time right here and now.

122
0:07:44.864,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I can definitively tell you

123
0:07:47.767,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that oatmeal, Jell-O, Cream of Wheat,

124
0:07:52.56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Gak, pudding, clay, tapioca, Silly Putty and tomato paste

125
0:07:58.752,000 --> 0:08:04,000
do not slide through a tube that's coiled up under your costumes

126
0:08:05.205,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that's meant to come out an orifice in your chest

127
0:08:08.864,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and spray towards the audience.

128
0:08:11.841,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It won't happen.

129
0:08:13.024,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Laughter)

130
0:08:15.348,000 --> 0:08:21,000
After months of iteration, we finally happened upon bananas.

131
0:08:21.88,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

132
0:08:23.39,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Who knew that bananas would have the exact right properties

133
0:08:27.454,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to stay solid even when pushed through a tube with forced air,

134
0:08:32.076,000 --> 0:08:38,000
yet slippery enough to have the dramatic oozing effect

135
0:08:38.827,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that we were looking for.

136
0:08:40.494,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Laughter)

137
0:08:41.836,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This piece became a signature of the Blue Man show.

138
0:08:47.41,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But we didn't throw out all the rules of theater altogether.

139
0:08:51.331,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We had set designs. We had lighting designs.

140
0:08:54.624,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We had a stage manager calling the shows.

141
0:08:57.601,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But I'm fairly sure we were one of the very first shows

142
0:09:02.395,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that was connecting with our audience in a respectful way,

143
0:09:06.483,000 --> 0:09:07,000
by hanging them upside down,

144
0:09:08.456,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

145
0:09:10.954,000 --> 0:09:12,000
dipping them in paint,

146
0:09:13.17,000 --> 0:09:15,000
slamming them against a canvas,

147
0:09:15.377,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

148
0:09:16.566,000 --> 0:09:2,000
putting their heads in 70 pounds of Jell-O,

149
0:09:20.733,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and then making them one of the heroes of the show.

150
0:09:26.699,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

151
0:09:29.803,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Besides that, we didn't reinvent what didn't need to be reinvented.

152
0:09:34.336,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

153
0:09:41.025,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Years later, we took all this learning and we created a school --

154
0:09:48.693,000 --> 0:09:53,000
a school for our children that we wish we had gone to,

155
0:09:54.385,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a school where it was just as important

156
0:09:58.084,000 --> 0:10:01,000
what happened in the hallways between classes

157
0:10:01.314,000 --> 0:10:03,000
as what happened in the classes;

158
0:10:04.87,000 --> 0:10:09,000
a place where you got music class even when you couldn't sing middle C.

159
0:10:12.577,000 --> 0:10:14,000
At Blue School, teachers and parents and students

160
0:10:15.221,000 --> 0:10:17,000
are equal collaborators at the table,

161
0:10:17.903,000 --> 0:10:19,000
intentionally creating a safe space

162
0:10:20.673,000 --> 0:10:24,000
where they can develop a lifelong, joyful passion for learning.

163
0:10:25.705,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Again, we didn't try to reinvent the wheel when it didn't need to be reinvented.

164
0:10:29.721,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We don't shy away from the more traditional methods

165
0:10:33.015,000 --> 0:10:36,000
like direct instruction, when it's the best way into a lesson.

166
0:10:37.006,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But we balance it with an integrated learning across all subjects approach,

167
0:10:43.777,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and balance is the key.

168
0:10:46.013,000 --> 0:10:49,000
In fact, Blue School was founded

169
0:10:49.302,000 --> 0:10:54,000
on a balance between academic mastery, creative thinking,

170
0:10:55.223,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and self and social intelligence.

171
0:10:58.955,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I realize that this might sound like common sense,

172
0:11:02.224,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but in some circles, this is radical.

173
0:11:05.824,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

174
0:11:08.439,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And these qualities have brought a lot of attention to Blue School

175
0:11:12.95,000 --> 0:11:14,000
as a truly innovative school.

176
0:11:17.756,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Nearly 10 years in,

177
0:11:20.971,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we announced the expansion of the middle school.

178
0:11:23.947,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Our faculty asked our sixth graders

179
0:11:26.813,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to participate in the development of middle school values.

180
0:11:30.527,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Their process began with a question:

181
0:11:33.36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
What do you need from our community to be happy and productive at school?

182
0:11:40.741,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Students moved through a six-week process of individual work, collaborative work,

183
0:11:45.924,000 --> 0:11:47,000
refinement, and consensus,

184
0:11:48.313,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and the list they came up with is really extraordinary.

185
0:11:55.6,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Be engaged and present with each other.

186
0:12:01.442,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Respect and support what others need in order to learn.

187
0:12:08.804,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Be inclusive of our diversity --

188
0:12:12.027,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the way we look, think and act.

189
0:12:17.614,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Cultivate the practice of self-awareness and awareness of others.

190
0:12:23.623,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Honor and make time for fun and joy.

191
0:12:28.147,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And challenge ourselves,

192
0:12:30.545,000 --> 0:12:32,000
practice being OK,

193
0:12:32.806,000 --> 0:12:33,000
making mistakes,

194
0:12:34.767,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and support each other through them.

195
0:12:39.273,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Remember, these kids were 11 years old when they came up with this.

196
0:12:45.146,000 --> 0:12:5,000
They articulated what took us 20 years to identify.

197
0:12:53.943,000 --> 0:12:59,000
One of the great by-products of creating these vibrant communities

198
0:13:00.278,000 --> 0:13:06,000
is that we become attractors for people who want to prioritize these values.

199
0:13:09.996,000 --> 0:13:14,000
They want to prioritize it above things like money and prestige and tradition.

200
0:13:16.475,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We can all be on this road together,

201
0:13:19.865,000 --> 0:13:22,000
you at your own values in your own companies,

202
0:13:23.08,000 --> 0:13:25,000
in your own communities and families.

203
0:13:26.47,000 --> 0:13:31,000
For us, for me, it was about prioritizing children's voices

204
0:13:32.153,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to give them the tools to help build a harmonious and sustainable world.

205
0:13:39.052,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I invite you to be on this exciting,

206
0:13:44.065,000 --> 0:13:47,000
passionate, joyful journey together.

207
0:13:48.855,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And together, good as can be expected

208
0:13:52.602,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is limitless when the expectation

209
0:13:56.945,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is that by reshaping our environments,

210
0:14:00.834,000 --> 0:14:01,000
we can change the world.

211
0:14:04.04,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Thank you.

212
0:14:05.215,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Applause)

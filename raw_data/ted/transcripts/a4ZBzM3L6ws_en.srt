1
0:00:13.081,000 --> 0:00:15,000
According to the UN,

2
0:00:15.111,000 --> 0:00:18,000
billions of people still live without an address.

3
0:00:19.154,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The economist Hernando de Soto said,

4
0:00:21.459,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"Without an address,

5
0:00:22.841,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you live outside the law.

6
0:00:24.767,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You might as well not exist."

7
0:00:27.679,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm here to tell you how my team and I are trying to change that.

8
0:00:31.986,000 --> 0:00:34,000
If you go to an online map and look at a favela in Brazil

9
0:00:35.226,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or a township in South Africa,

10
0:00:37.074,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you'll see a few streets but a lot of empty space.

11
0:00:40.678,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But if you flip to satellite view,

12
0:00:42.845,000 --> 0:00:45,000
there are thousands of people, homes and businesses

13
0:00:45.983,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in this vast, unmapped and unaddressed spaces.

14
0:00:49.551,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In Ghana's capital, Accra,

15
0:00:51.435,000 --> 0:00:55,000
there are numbers and letters scrawled onto the sides of walls,

16
0:00:55.548,000 --> 0:00:58,000
where they piloted address systems but not finished them.

17
0:01:00.163,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But these places, these unaddressed places,

18
0:01:03.323,000 --> 0:01:04,000
hold huge economic potential.

19
0:01:07.201,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Here's why the issue of addressing stuck with me.

20
0:01:10.453,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I worked in the music business for 10 years,

21
0:01:12.529,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and what you may not know about the music world

22
0:01:14.931,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is that every day, people struggle with the problems of addressing.

23
0:01:18.368,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So from the musicians who have to find the gigs

24
0:01:21.221,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to the production companies who bring the equipment,

25
0:01:23.674,000 --> 0:01:25,000
everyone somehow always gets lost.

26
0:01:25.76,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We even had to add someone to our schedules

27
0:01:27.925,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who was the person you called when you thought you'd arrived

28
0:01:30.768,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but then realized you hadn't.

29
0:01:32.176,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And we had some pretty bad days,

30
0:01:34.523,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like in Italy, where a truck driver unloaded all the equipment

31
0:01:37.732,000 --> 0:01:39,000
an hour north of Rome, not an hour south of Rome,

32
0:01:40.339,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and a slightly worse day

33
0:01:41.572,000 --> 0:01:43,000
where a keyboard player called me and said,

34
0:01:43.671,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"Chris, don't panic, but we may have just sound-checked

35
0:01:46.609,000 --> 0:01:47,000
at the wrong people's wedding."

36
0:01:48.196,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:49.795,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So not long after the fated Rome event,

38
0:01:52.457,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I chatted this through with a friend of mine

39
0:01:54.59,000 --> 0:01:55,000
who is a mathematician,

40
0:01:55.778,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and we thought it was a problem we could do something about.

41
0:01:58.612,000 --> 0:02:,000
We thought, well, we could make a new system,

42
0:02:00.973,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but it shouldn't look like the old system.

43
0:02:03.628,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We agreed that addresses were bad.

44
0:02:06.474,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We knew we wanted something very precise,

45
0:02:08.524,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but GPS coordinates, latitude and longitude,

46
0:02:10.903,000 --> 0:02:11,000
were just too complicated.

47
0:02:13.256,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So we divided the world into three-meter squares.

48
0:02:16.583,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The world divides into around 57 trillion three-meter squares,

49
0:02:20.7,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we found that there are enough combinations

50
0:02:22.915,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of three dictionary words

51
0:02:24.749,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that we could name every three-meter square in the world uniquely

52
0:02:28.365,000 --> 0:02:29,000
with just three words.

53
0:02:30.546,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We used 40,000 words,

54
0:02:32.141,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so that's 40,000 cubed,

55
0:02:33.758,000 --> 0:02:36,000
64 trillion combinations of three words,

56
0:02:37.015,000 --> 0:02:4,000
which is more than enough for the 57-trillion-odd three-meter squares,

57
0:02:40.927,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with a few spare.

58
0:02:43.044,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So that's exactly what we did.

59
0:02:45.017,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We divided the world into three-meter squares,

60
0:02:48.115,000 --> 0:02:5,000
gave each one a unique, three-word identifier --

61
0:02:50.98,000 --> 0:02:51,000
what we call a three-word address.

62
0:02:53.385,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So for example, right here,

63
0:02:56.481,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I'm standing at mustards.coupons.pinup,

64
0:02:58.858,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:00.032,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but over here ...

66
0:03:02.753,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I'm standing at pinched. singularly.tutorial.

67
0:03:09.133,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But we haven't just done this in English.

68
0:03:11.128,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We thought it was essential that people should be able to use this system

69
0:03:14.581,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in their own language.

70
0:03:15.867,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So far, we've built it into 14 languages,

71
0:03:18.124,000 --> 0:03:2,000
including French, Swahili and Arabic,

72
0:03:20.591,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and we're working on more now, like Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi.

73
0:03:25.157,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But this idea can do a lot more

74
0:03:27.028,000 --> 0:03:29,000
than just get my musicians to their gigs on time.

75
0:03:29.752,000 --> 0:03:33,000
If the 75 percent of countries that struggle with reliable addressing

76
0:03:33.953,000 --> 0:03:34,000
started using three-word addresses,

77
0:03:35.681,000 --> 0:03:37,000
there's a stack of far more important applications.

78
0:03:40.033,000 --> 0:03:42,000
In Durban, South Africa,

79
0:03:42.487,000 --> 0:03:43,000
an NGO called Gateway Health

80
0:03:44.168,000 --> 0:03:46,000
have distributed 11,000 three-word address signs

81
0:03:47.142,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to their community,

82
0:03:48.555,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so the pregnant mothers, when they go into labor,

83
0:03:50.958,000 --> 0:03:51,000
can call the emergency services

84
0:03:52.79,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and tell them exactly where to pick them up from,

85
0:03:55.165,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because otherwise, the ambulances have often taken hours to find them.

86
0:03:58.964,000 --> 0:04:01,000
In Mongolia, the National Post Service have adopted the system

87
0:04:02.265,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and are now doing deliveries to many people's houses

88
0:04:04.727,000 --> 0:04:05,000
for the first time.

89
0:04:06.152,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The UN are using it to geotag photos in disaster zones

90
0:04:09.859,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so they can deliver aid to exactly the right place.

91
0:04:12.555,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Even Domino's Pizza are using it in the Caribbean,

92
0:04:15.249,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because they haven't been able to find customers' homes,

93
0:04:17.974,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but they really want to get their pizza to them while its still hot.

94
0:04:21.729,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Shortly, you'll be able to get into a car,

95
0:04:24.274,000 --> 0:04:25,000
speak the three words,

96
0:04:26.034,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and the car will navigate you to that exact spot.

97
0:04:29.888,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In Africa, the continent has leapfrogged phone lines

98
0:04:33.437,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to go to mobile phones,

99
0:04:34.854,000 --> 0:04:37,000
bypassed traditional banks to go straight to mobile payments.

100
0:04:39.298,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We're really proud that the post services of three African countries --

101
0:04:43.276,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Nigeria, Djibouti and Côte d'Ivoire,

102
0:04:45.896,000 --> 0:04:47,000
have gone straight to adopting three-word addresses,

103
0:04:48.572,000 --> 0:04:5,000
which means that people in those countries

104
0:04:50.669,000 --> 0:04:53,000
have a really simple way to explain where they live, today.

105
0:04:55.167,000 --> 0:04:58,000
For me, poor addressing was an annoying frustration,

106
0:04:58.87,000 --> 0:05:,000
but for billions of people,

107
0:05:01.398,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it's a huge business inefficiency,

108
0:05:03.835,000 --> 0:05:05,000
severely hampers their infrastructure growth,

109
0:05:06.54,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and can cost lives.

110
0:05:08.837,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We're on a mission to change that,

111
0:05:10.489,000 --> 0:05:11,000
three words at a time.

112
0:05:11.726,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Thank you.

113
0:05:12.901,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Applause)

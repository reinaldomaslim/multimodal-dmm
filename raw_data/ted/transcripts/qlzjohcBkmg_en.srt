1
0:00:13.359,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There is a narrative,

2
0:00:15.12,000 --> 0:00:21,000
an idea that with resilience, grit and personal responsibility

3
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:24,000
people can pull themselves up and achieve economic success.

4
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In the United States we call it the American dream.

5
0:00:29.24,000 --> 0:00:32,000
A similar narrative exists all over the world.

6
0:00:33.36,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But the truth is that the challenges of making this happen

7
0:00:36.44,000 --> 0:00:39,000
have less to do with what we do

8
0:00:39.56,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and more to do with the wealth position in which we are born.

9
0:00:42.76,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So I'm going to make the case that the United States government,

10
0:00:46.12,000 --> 0:00:47,000
actually that any government,

11
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
should create a trust account for every newborn

12
0:00:51.4,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of up to 60,000 dollars,

13
0:00:53.96,000 --> 0:00:56,000
calibrated to the wealth of the family in which they are born.

14
0:00:58.2,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'm talking about an endowment.

15
0:01:00.52,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Personal seed capital, a publicly established baby trust,

16
0:01:05.08,000 --> 0:01:09,000
what my colleague William Darity at Duke University and I

17
0:01:09.56,000 --> 0:01:11,000
have referred to as baby bonds,

18
0:01:11.76,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a term that was coined by the late historian from Columbia University,

19
0:01:16.8,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Manning Marable.

20
0:01:18.52,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The reason why we should create these trusts is simple.

21
0:01:21.88,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Wealth is the paramount indicator of economic security and well-being.

22
0:01:27.24,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It provides financial agency, economic security to take risk

23
0:01:31.28,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and shield against loss.

24
0:01:33.44,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Without capital, inequality is locked in.

25
0:01:36.68,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We use words like choice, freedom to describe the benefits of the market,

26
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but it is literally wealth that gives us choice, freedom and optionality.

27
0:01:49.76,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Wealthier families are better positioned to finance an elite, independent school

28
0:01:54.2,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and college education,

29
0:01:55.96,000 --> 0:01:57,000
access capital to start a business,

30
0:01:58.52,000 --> 0:02:01,000
finance expensive medical procedures,

31
0:02:01.6,000 --> 0:02:04,000
reside in neighborhoods with higher amenities,

32
0:02:04.72,000 --> 0:02:07,000
exert political influence through campaign finance,

33
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
purchase better legal counsel

34
0:02:10.72,000 --> 0:02:13,000
if confronted with an expensive criminal justice system,

35
0:02:14.2,000 --> 0:02:15,000
leave a bequest

36
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and/or withstand financial hardship resulting from any number of emergencies.

37
0:02:21.88,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Basically, when it comes to economic security,

38
0:02:25.4,000 --> 0:02:27,000
wealth is both the beginning and the end.

39
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I will frame this conversation in the context of the United States,

40
0:02:32.64,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but this discussion applies virtually to any country

41
0:02:36.04,000 --> 0:02:38,000
facing increasing inequality.

42
0:02:40.32,000 --> 0:02:42,000
In the US, the top 10 percent of households

43
0:02:42.96,000 --> 0:02:44,000
hold about 80 percent of the nation's wealth

44
0:02:45.76,000 --> 0:02:49,000
while the bottom 60 percent owns only about one percent.

45
0:02:51.32,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But when it comes to wealth,

46
0:02:52.92,000 --> 0:02:55,000
race is an even stronger predictor than class itself.

47
0:02:56.76,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Blacks and Latinos collectively make up 30 percent

48
0:03:00.24,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of the United States population,

49
0:03:02.44,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but collectively own about seven percent of the nation's wealth.

50
0:03:07.48,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The 2016 survey of consumer finance

51
0:03:11.28,000 --> 0:03:16,000
indicates that the typical black family has about 17,000 dollars in wealth,

52
0:03:16.8,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and that's inclusive of home equity,

53
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
while the typical white family has about 170,000.

54
0:03:22.96,000 --> 0:03:25,000
That is indicative of an absolute racial wealth gap

55
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
where the typical black household has about 10 cents for every dollar

56
0:03:30.24,000 --> 0:03:32,000
held by the typical white family.

57
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But regardless of race,

58
0:03:34.8,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the market alone has been inadequate to address these inequalities.

59
0:03:41.56,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Even in times of economic expansion, inequality grows.

60
0:03:45.32,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Over the last 45 years,

61
0:03:47.32,000 --> 0:03:49,000
wealth disparity has increased dramatically,

62
0:03:49.96,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and essentially, all the economic gains from America's increase in productivity

63
0:03:54.84,000 --> 0:03:56,000
have gone to the elite or the upper middle class.

64
0:03:59.68,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Yet, much of the framing around economic disparity

65
0:04:03.24,000 --> 0:04:05,000
focuses on the poor choices

66
0:04:05.6,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of black, Latino and poor borrowers.

67
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This framing is wrong.

68
0:04:12.04,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The directional emphasis is wrong.

69
0:04:14.04,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It is more likely that meager economic circumstance,

70
0:04:17.28,000 --> 0:04:19,000
not poor decision making or deficient knowledge,

71
0:04:20.2,000 --> 0:04:24,000
constrains choice itself and leaves people with no options

72
0:04:25.12,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but to turn to predatory finance.

73
0:04:27.68,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In essence, education is not the magic antidote

74
0:04:32.88,000 --> 0:04:34,000
for the enormous inherited disparities

75
0:04:35.88,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that result from laws, policies and economic arrangement.

76
0:04:40.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This does not diminish the value of education.

77
0:04:43.76,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Indeed, I'm a university professor.

78
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
There are clear intrinsic values to education,

79
0:04:49.2,000 --> 0:04:51,000
along with a public responsibility

80
0:04:51.64,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to expose everyone to a high-quality education,

81
0:04:54.8,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from grade school all the way through college.

82
0:04:58.24,000 --> 0:05:,000
But education is not the panacea.

83
0:05:00.4,000 --> 0:05:03,000
In fact, blacks who live in families where the head graduated from college

84
0:05:04.32,000 --> 0:05:05,000
typically have less wealth

85
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:08,000
than white families where the head dropped out of high school.

86
0:05:09.84,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Perhaps we overstate the functional role of education

87
0:05:14.76,000 --> 0:05:18,000
at the detriment of understanding the functional role of wealth.

88
0:05:19.24,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Basically, it is wealth that begets more wealth.

89
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
That's why we advocate for baby trust.

90
0:05:26.48,000 --> 0:05:28,000
An economic birthright to capital for everyone.

91
0:05:29.48,000 --> 0:05:31,000
These accounts would be held in public trust

92
0:05:32.04,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to be used as a foundation to an economically secure life.

93
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The concept of economic rights is not new nor is it radical.

94
0:05:42.2,000 --> 0:05:45,000
In 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt

95
0:05:45.56,000 --> 0:05:48,000
introduced the idea of an economic Bill of Rights.

96
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Roosevelt called for physical security,

97
0:05:52.48,000 --> 0:05:56,000
economic security, social security and moral security.

98
0:05:57.64,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Unfortunately, since the Nixon administration,

99
0:06:00.56,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the political sentiment regarding social mobility

100
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:08,000
has radically shifted away from government mandates to economic security

101
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to a neoliberal approach

102
0:06:10.72,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in which the market is presumed to be the solution for all our problems,

103
0:06:15.52,000 --> 0:06:16,000
economic or otherwise.

104
0:06:18.88,000 --> 0:06:22,000
As a result, the onus of social mobility has shifted on to the individual.

105
0:06:23.8,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The pervasive narrative is that even if your lot in life is subpar,

106
0:06:29.08,000 --> 0:06:33,000
with perseverance and hard work and the virtues of the free market,

107
0:06:33.6,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you can turn your proverbial rags into riches.

108
0:06:38.64,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Of course, the flip side is that the virtues of the market

109
0:06:41.68,000 --> 0:06:45,000
will likewise sanction those that are not astute,

110
0:06:46.64,000 --> 0:06:49,000
those that lack motivation or those that are simply lazy.

111
0:06:50.48,000 --> 0:06:54,000
In other words, the deserving poor will receive their just rewards.

112
0:06:56.96,000 --> 0:06:58,000
What is glaringly missing from this narrative

113
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is the role of power and capital,

114
0:07:02.4,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and how that power and capital

115
0:07:04.76,000 --> 0:07:08,000
can be used to alter the rules and structure of transactions and markets

116
0:07:09.4,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in the first place.

117
0:07:10.84,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Power and capital become self-reinforcing.

118
0:07:14.32,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And without government intervention,

119
0:07:16.28,000 --> 0:07:21,000
they generate an iterative cycle of both stratification and inequality.

120
0:07:21.6,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The capital finance provided by baby trust

121
0:07:24.6,000 --> 0:07:28,000
is intended to deliver a more egalitarian and an authentic pathway

122
0:07:29.2,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to economic security,

123
0:07:30.76,000 --> 0:07:32,000
independent of the family financial position

124
0:07:33.72,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in which individuals are born.

125
0:07:35.88,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The program would complement the economic rights to old-age pensions

126
0:07:40.4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and provide a more comprehensive social security program,

127
0:07:44.28,000 --> 0:07:48,000
designed to provide capital finance from cradle all the way through grave.

128
0:07:49.12,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We envision endowing American newborns with an average account of 25,000 dollars

129
0:07:54.68,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that gradually rises upwards to 60,000 dollars

130
0:07:59.32,000 --> 0:08:01,000
for babies born into the poorest families.

131
0:08:01.72,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Babies born into the wealthiest families

132
0:08:04.08,000 --> 0:08:06,000
would be included as well in the social contract,

133
0:08:06.88,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but they would receive a more nominal account of about 500 dollars.

134
0:08:12.12,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The accounts would be federally managed,

135
0:08:14.08,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and they would grow at a guaranteed annual interest rate

136
0:08:16.84,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of about two percent per year in order to curtail inflation cost,

137
0:08:21.12,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and be used when the child reaches adulthood

138
0:08:24.2,000 --> 0:08:26,000
for some asset-enhancing activity,

139
0:08:26.72,000 --> 0:08:29,000
like financing a debt-free university education,

140
0:08:30.32,000 --> 0:08:32,000
a down payment to purchase a home,

141
0:08:32.68,000 --> 0:08:35,000
or some seed capital to start a business.

142
0:08:36.6,000 --> 0:08:4,000
With approximately four million babies born each year in the US,

143
0:08:40.84,000 --> 0:08:44,000
if the average endowment of a baby trust is set at 25,000 dollars,

144
0:08:45.6,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the program would crudely cost about 100 billion dollars a year.

145
0:08:49.52,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This would constitute

146
0:08:51.12,000 --> 0:08:54,000
only about two percent of current federal expenditures

147
0:08:54.64,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and be far less than the 500-plus billion dollars

148
0:08:58.6,000 --> 0:09:,000
that's already being spent by the federal government

149
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:05,000
on asset promotion through tax credits and subsidies.

150
0:09:05.6,000 --> 0:09:07,000
At issue is not the amount of that allocation

151
0:09:08.52,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but to whom it's distributed.

152
0:09:10.32,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Currently, the top one percent of households,

153
0:09:13.64,000 --> 0:09:16,000
those earning above 100 million dollars,

154
0:09:16.8,000 --> 0:09:19,000
receive only about one third of this entire allocation,

155
0:09:20.36,000 --> 0:09:24,000
while the bottom 60 percent receive only five percent.

156
0:09:25.84,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If the federal asset-promoting budget

157
0:09:27.92,000 --> 0:09:29,000
were allocated in a more progressive manner,

158
0:09:30.56,000 --> 0:09:34,000
federal policies could be transformative for all Americans.

159
0:09:36.28,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is a work in progress.

160
0:09:38.44,000 --> 0:09:41,000
There are obviously many details to be worked out,

161
0:09:41.8,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but it is a policy proposal grounded in the functional roles

162
0:09:46.44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and the inherited advantages of wealth

163
0:09:48.88,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that moves us away from the reinforcing status quo

164
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
behavioral explanations for inequality

165
0:09:55.6,000 --> 0:09:57,000
towards more structural solutions.

166
0:09:58.68,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Our existing tax policy that privileges existing wealth

167
0:10:02.72,000 --> 0:10:05,000
rather than establishing new wealth is a choice.

168
0:10:06.8,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The extent of our dramatic inequality is at least as much a problem of politics

169
0:10:12.12,000 --> 0:10:13,000
as it is a problem of economics.

170
0:10:14.96,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It is time to get beyond the false narratives

171
0:10:18.68,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that attribute inequality to individual personal deficits

172
0:10:22.8,000 --> 0:10:24,000
while largely ignoring the advantages of wealth.

173
0:10:26.96,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Instead, public provisions of a baby trust

174
0:10:30.92,000 --> 0:10:33,000
could go a long way towards eliminating

175
0:10:34.6,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the transmission of economic advantage or disadvantage across generations

176
0:10:39.64,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and establishing a more moral and decent economy

177
0:10:43.32,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that facilitates assets, economic security

178
0:10:47.36,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and social mobility for all its citizens.

179
0:10:51.08,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Regardless of the race

180
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and the family positions in which they are born.

181
0:10:56.2,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Thank you very much.

182
0:10:57.56,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

183
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Chris Anderson: Darrick.

184
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I mean, there's so much to like in this idea.

185
0:11:09.48,000 --> 0:11:13,000
There's one piece of branding around it that I worry about,

186
0:11:14.28,000 --> 0:11:18,000
which is just that right now, trust-fund kids have a really bad rap.

187
0:11:18.88,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You know, they're the sort of eyeball-rolling poster children

188
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
for how money, kind of, takes away motivation.

189
0:11:26.32,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So, these trusts are different.

190
0:11:28.72,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So how do you show people in this proposal that it's not going to do that?

191
0:11:34.24,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Darrick Hamilton: If you know you have limited resources

192
0:11:36.92,000 --> 0:11:37,000
or you're going to face discrimination,

193
0:11:38.802,000 --> 0:11:39,000
there's a narrative that, well,

194
0:11:40.44,000 --> 0:11:42,000
the economic returns to investing in myself

195
0:11:42.72,000 --> 0:11:43,000
are lower than that of someone else,

196
0:11:44.52,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so I might as well enjoy my leisure.

197
0:11:47.28,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Of course, there's another narrative as well,

198
0:11:49.44,000 --> 0:11:51,000
so we shouldn't get caught up on that,

199
0:11:51.6,000 --> 0:11:54,000
you know, somebody who's poor and going to face discrimination,

200
0:11:55.44,000 --> 0:11:57,000
they also might pursue a resume-building strategy.

201
0:11:58.28,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The old adage, "I have to be twice as good as someone else."

202
0:12:01.84,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Now, when we say that, we never ask at what cost,

203
0:12:04.32,000 --> 0:12:06,000
are there health costs associated with that.

204
0:12:06.68,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I haven't answered your question, but coming back to you question,

205
0:12:09.84,000 --> 0:12:13,000
if you know you're going to receive a transfer at a later point in life,

206
0:12:14.08,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that only increases the incentive for you to invest in yourself

207
0:12:18.2,000 --> 0:12:19,000
so that you can better use that trust.

208
0:12:20.76,000 --> 0:12:22,000
CA: You're giving people possibilities of life

209
0:12:23.44,000 --> 0:12:25,000
they currently cannot imagine having.

210
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And therefore the motivation to do that.

211
0:12:27.96,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I could talk with you for hours about this.

212
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I'm really glad you're working on this.

213
0:12:31.92,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Thank you.

214
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

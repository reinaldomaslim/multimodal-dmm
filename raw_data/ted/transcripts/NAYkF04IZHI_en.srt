How many people are bored at their desk

3
0:00:14.501,000 --> 0:00:15,000
for how many hours every day

4
0:00:16.043,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and how many days a week and how many weeks a year

5
0:00:18.417,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for how many years in their life?

[Daniel Engber on the Progress Bar]

8
0:00:25.165,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The progress bar is just an indicator on a computer

9
0:00:27.881,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that something's happening inside the device.

10
0:00:31.579,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The classic one that's been used for years is a horizontal bar.

11
0:00:36.135,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I mean, this goes back to pre-computer versions of this

12
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
on ledgers, where people would fill in a horizontal bar from left to right

13
0:00:44.338,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to show how much of a task they had completed at a factory.

14
0:00:47.978,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This is just the same thing on a screen.

15
0:00:50.497,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Something happened in the 70s

16
0:00:52.009,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that is sometimes referred to as "the software crisis,"

17
0:00:54.797,000 --> 0:00:56,000
where suddenly, computers were getting more complicated

18
0:00:57.729,000 --> 0:01:,000
more quickly than anyone had been prepared for,

19
0:01:01.031,000 --> 0:01:02,000
from a design perspective.

20
0:01:02.841,000 --> 0:01:06,000
People were using percent-done indicators in different ways.

21
0:01:07.174,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So you might have a graphical countdown clock,

22
0:01:09.843,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or they would have a line of asterisks

23
0:01:12.662,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that would fill out from left to right on a screen.

24
0:01:15.081,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But no one had done a systematic survey of these things

25
0:01:18.698,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and tried to figure out:

26
0:01:19.905,000 --> 0:01:22,000
How do they actually affect the user's experience

27
0:01:23.04,000 --> 0:01:24,000
of sitting at the computer?

28
0:01:24.391,000 --> 0:01:25,000
This graduate student named Brad Myers,

29
0:01:26.365,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in 1985, decided he would study this.

30
0:01:29.623,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He found that it didn't really matter

31
0:01:31.7,000 --> 0:01:36,000
if the percent-done indicator was giving you the accurate percent done.

32
0:01:36.83,000 --> 0:01:38,000
What mattered was that it was there at all.

33
0:01:39.584,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Just seeing it there made people feel better,

34
0:01:42.212,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and that was the most surprising thing.

35
0:01:44.925,000 --> 0:01:46,000
He has all these ideas about what this thing could do.

36
0:01:47.868,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Maybe it could make people relax effectively.

37
0:01:51.978,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Maybe it would allow people to turn away from their machine

38
0:01:56.672,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and do something else of exactly the right duration.

39
0:01:59.759,000 --> 0:02:01,000
They would look and say, "Oh, the progress bar is half done.

40
0:02:02.664,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That took five minutes.

41
0:02:03.839,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So now I have five minutes to send this fax,"

42
0:02:07.76,000 --> 0:02:09,000
or whatever people were doing in 1985.

43
0:02:10.148,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Both of those things are wrong.

44
0:02:11.976,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Like, when you see that progress bar,

45
0:02:13.866,000 --> 0:02:15,000
it sort of locks your attention in a tractor beam,

46
0:02:16.857,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and it turns the experience of waiting

47
0:02:18.897,000 --> 0:02:23,000
into this exciting narrative that you're seeing unfold in front of you:

48
0:02:24.003,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that somehow, this time you've spent waiting in frustration

49
0:02:27.876,000 --> 0:02:28,000
for the computer to do something,

50
0:02:29.535,000 --> 0:02:3,000
has been reconceptualized as:

51
0:02:31.535,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"Progress! Oh! Great stuff is happening!"

52
0:02:33.853,000 --> 0:02:35,000
[Progress...]

53
0:02:36.015,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But once you start thinking about the progress bar

54
0:02:39.254,000 --> 0:02:42,000
as something that's more about dulling the pain of waiting,

55
0:02:42.623,000 --> 0:02:45,000
well, then you can start fiddling around with the psychology.

56
0:02:46.53,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So if you have a progress bar that just moves at a constant rate --

57
0:02:50.602,000 --> 0:02:52,000
let's say, that's really what's happening in the computer --

58
0:02:53.602,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that will feel to people like it's slowing down.

59
0:02:57.668,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We get bored.

60
0:03:00.002,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Well, now you can start trying to enhance it

61
0:03:02.133,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and make it appear to move more quickly than it really is,

62
0:03:04.919,000 --> 0:03:07,000
make it move faster at the beginning, like a burst of speed.

63
0:03:08.65,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That's exciting, people feel like, "Oh! Something's really happening!"

64
0:03:12.018,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Then you can move back into a more naturalistic growth of the progress bar

65
0:03:16.071,000 --> 0:03:17,000
as you go along.

66
0:03:17.406,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You're assuming that people are focusing on the passage of time --

67
0:03:20.624,000 --> 0:03:21,000
they're trying to watch grass grow,

68
0:03:22.351,000 --> 0:03:24,000
they're trying to watch a pot of water, waiting for it to boil,

69
0:03:25.355,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and you're just trying to make that less boring,

70
0:03:27.771,000 --> 0:03:29,000
less painful and less frustrating

71
0:03:30.021,000 --> 0:03:31,000
than it was before.

72
0:03:31.371,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So the progress bar at least gives you

73
0:03:34.396,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the vision of a beginning and an end,

74
0:03:36.881,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and you're working towards a goal.

75
0:03:38.599,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I think in some ways, it mitigates the fear of death.

76
0:03:44.079,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Too much?

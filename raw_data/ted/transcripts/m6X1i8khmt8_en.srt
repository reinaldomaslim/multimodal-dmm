1
0:00:12.825,000 --> 0:00:16,000
A lot of people call me a "justice architect."

2
0:00:18.865,000 --> 0:00:19,000
But I don't design prisons.

3
0:00:21.786,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I don't design jails.

4
0:00:23.96,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I don't design detention centers, and I don't even design courthouses.

5
0:00:28.872,000 --> 0:00:31,000
All the same, I get a call every week,

6
0:00:32.823,000 --> 0:00:36,000
saying, "OK, but you design better prisons, right?

7
0:00:37.196,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You know, like those pretty ones they're building in Europe."

8
0:00:40.45,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I always pause.

9
0:00:43.466,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I invite them,

10
0:00:45.586,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I invite you today,

11
0:00:47.617,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to imagine a world without prisons.

12
0:00:51.101,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What does that justice feel and look like?

13
0:00:55.751,000 --> 0:00:57,000
What do we need to build to get there?

14
0:00:59.673,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'd like to show you some ideas today of things that we're building.

15
0:01:03.419,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I'm going to start with an early prototype.

16
0:01:06.395,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This I built when I was five.

17
0:01:08.577,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I call it "the healing hut."

18
0:01:11.212,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I built it after I got sent home from school

19
0:01:14.343,000 --> 0:01:17,000
for punching this kid in the face because he called me the N-word.

20
0:01:18.037,000 --> 0:01:19,000
OK, he deserved it.

21
0:01:20.427,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It happened a lot, though,

22
0:01:22.291,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because my family had desegregated a white community in rural Virginia.

23
0:01:28.093,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I was really scared.

24
0:01:30.893,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I was afraid.

25
0:01:32.498,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was angry.

26
0:01:34.325,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And so I would run into the forest, and I would build these little huts.

27
0:01:37.768,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They were made out of twigs and leaves and blankets I had taken from my mom.

28
0:01:42.776,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And as the light would stream into my refuge,

29
0:01:47.284,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I would feel at peace.

30
0:01:51.006,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Despite my efforts to comfort myself,

31
0:01:53.528,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I still left my community as soon as I could,

32
0:01:56.641,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and I went to architecture school

33
0:01:58.688,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and then into a professional career designing shopping centers,

34
0:02:02.382,000 --> 0:02:03,000
homes for the wealthy

35
0:02:03.807,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and office buildings,

36
0:02:06.454,000 --> 0:02:09,000
until I stepped into a prison for the first time.

37
0:02:10.193,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It was the Chester State Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania.

38
0:02:14.265,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And my friend, she invited me there

39
0:02:16.355,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to work with some of her incarcerated students

40
0:02:18.538,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and teach them about the positive power of design.

41
0:02:22.704,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The irony is so obvious, right?

42
0:02:24.796,000 --> 0:02:27,000
As I approached this concrete building, these tiny little windows,

43
0:02:28.276,000 --> 0:02:31,000
barbed wire, high walls, observation towers,

44
0:02:32.149,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and on the inside, these cold, hard spaces,

45
0:02:36.45,000 --> 0:02:37,000
little light or air,

46
0:02:38.324,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the guards are screaming, the doors are clanking,

47
0:02:41.204,000 --> 0:02:46,000
there's a wall of cells filled with so many black and brown bodies.

48
0:02:47.257,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And I realized that what I was seeing

49
0:02:50.138,000 --> 0:02:54,000
was the end result of our racist policies that had caused mass incarceration.

50
0:02:55.641,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But as an architect, what I was seeing

51
0:02:58.339,000 --> 0:03:01,000
was how a prison is the worst building type we could have created

52
0:03:02.196,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to address the harm that we're doing to one another.

53
0:03:06.085,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I thought, "Well, could I design an alternative to this,

54
0:03:08.742,000 --> 0:03:1,000
other than building a prettier prison?"

55
0:03:10.767,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It didn't feel good to me; it still doesn't feel good.

56
0:03:14.395,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But back then, I just didn't know what to do.

57
0:03:17.315,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What do we build instead of this?

58
0:03:20.348,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And then I heard about restorative justice.

59
0:03:23.84,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I felt at peace again,

60
0:03:26.632,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because here was an alternative system

61
0:03:29.482,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that says when a crime is committed, it is a breach of relationship,

62
0:03:34.68,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that the needs of those who have been harmed

63
0:03:37.085,000 --> 0:03:38,000
must be addressed first;

64
0:03:39.657,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that those who have committed the offense

65
0:03:42.268,000 --> 0:03:44,000
have an obligation to make amends.

66
0:03:45.085,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And what they are are really intense dialogues,

67
0:03:47.512,000 --> 0:03:52,000
where all stakeholders come together to find a way to repair the breach.

68
0:03:53.695,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Early data shows that restorative justice builds empathy;

69
0:03:57.56,000 --> 0:04:,000
that it reduces violent reoffending by up to 75 percent;

70
0:04:02.02,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that it eases PTSD in survivors of the most severe violence.

71
0:04:06.877,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And because of these reasons,

72
0:04:08.83,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we see prosecutors and judges and district attorneys

73
0:04:11.68,000 --> 0:04:14,000
starting to divert cases out of court and into restorative justice

74
0:04:15.276,000 --> 0:04:18,000
so that some people never touch the system altogether.

75
0:04:19.141,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And so I thought, "Well, damn -- why aren't we designing for this system?"

76
0:04:22.737,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Applause)

77
0:04:24.023,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Instead of building prisons,

78
0:04:26.546,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we should be building spaces to amplify restorative justice.

79
0:04:30.87,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And so I started in schools,

80
0:04:33.791,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because suspensions and expulsions

81
0:04:37.053,000 --> 0:04:4,000
have been fueling the pathway to prison for decades.

82
0:04:40.953,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And many school districts -- probably some of your own --

83
0:04:43.864,000 --> 0:04:46,000
are turning to restorative justice as an alternative.

84
0:04:48.125,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So, my first project -- I just turned this dirty little storage room

85
0:04:51.625,000 --> 0:04:54,000
into a peacemaking room for a program in a high school

86
0:04:55.403,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in my hometown of Oakland.

87
0:04:57.86,000 --> 0:05:,000
And after we were done, the director said

88
0:05:01.082,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that the circles she was holding in this space

89
0:05:03.694,000 --> 0:05:05,000
were more powerful in bringing the community together

90
0:05:06.717,000 --> 0:05:09,000
after fighting at school and gun violence in the community,

91
0:05:10.673,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and that students and teachers started to come here

92
0:05:13.76,000 --> 0:05:15,000
just because they saw it as a space of refuge.

93
0:05:17.434,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So what was happening is that the space was amplifying the effects of the process.

94
0:05:24.29,000 --> 0:05:28,000
OK, then I did something that architects always do, y'all.

95
0:05:29.323,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I was like, I'm going to build something massive now, right?

96
0:05:32.895,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I'm going to build the world's first restorative justice center all by myself.

97
0:05:38.173,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And it's going to be a beautiful figure on the skyline,

98
0:05:41.212,000 --> 0:05:42,000
like a beacon in the night.

99
0:05:43.061,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Thousands of people will come here instead of going to court.

100
0:05:46.958,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I will single-handedly end mass incarceration

101
0:05:49.728,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and win lots of design awards.

102
0:05:51.979,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:54.776,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And then I checked myself --

104
0:05:56.353,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:57.839,000 --> 0:05:58,000
because here's the deal:

106
0:06:00.014,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we are incarcerating more of our citizens per capita

107
0:06:03.547,000 --> 0:06:04,000
than any country in the world.

108
0:06:05.18,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And the fastest-growing population there are black women.

109
0:06:08.966,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Ninety-five percent of all these folks are coming home.

110
0:06:13.53,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And most of them are survivors of severe sexual, physical and emotional abuse.

111
0:06:20.323,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They have literally been on both sides of the harm.

112
0:06:23.577,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So I thought, uh, maybe I should ask them

113
0:06:25.974,000 --> 0:06:27,000
what we should build instead of prisons.

114
0:06:29.317,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So I returned with a restorative justice expert,

115
0:06:33.539,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and we started to run the country's first design studios

116
0:06:36.667,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with incarcerated men and women

117
0:06:38.561,000 --> 0:06:41,000
around the intersection of restorative justice and design.

118
0:06:42.069,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And it was transformative for me.

119
0:06:43.673,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I saw all these people behind walls in a totally different way.

120
0:06:48.998,000 --> 0:06:51,000
These were souls deeply committed to their personal transformation

121
0:06:52.808,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and being accountable.

122
0:06:54.602,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They were creative, they were visionary.

123
0:06:58.49,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Danny is one of those souls.

124
0:07:01.039,000 --> 0:07:05,000
He's been incarcerated at San Quentin for 27 years

125
0:07:05.895,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for taking a life at the age of 21.

126
0:07:09.474,000 --> 0:07:1,000
From the very beginning,

127
0:07:11.117,000 --> 0:07:13,000
he's been focused on being accountable for that act

128
0:07:14.109,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and doing his best to make amends from behind bars.

129
0:07:18.458,000 --> 0:07:23,000
He brought that work into a design for a community center

130
0:07:24.403,000 --> 0:07:26,000
for reconciliation and wellness.

131
0:07:27.449,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It was a beautiful design, right?

132
0:07:29.149,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So it's this green campus filled with these circular structures

133
0:07:32.601,000 --> 0:07:33,000
for victim and offender dialogue.

134
0:07:35.149,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And when he presented the project to me,

135
0:07:37.688,000 --> 0:07:38,000
he started crying.

136
0:07:40.133,000 --> 0:07:45,000
He said, "After being in the brutality of San Quentin for so long,

137
0:07:45.596,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we don't think reconciliation will happen.

138
0:07:49.611,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This design is for a place that fulfills the promise of restorative justice.

139
0:07:55.331,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And it feels closer now."

140
0:07:58.72,000 --> 0:08:,000
I know for a fact

141
0:08:01.68,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that just the visualization of spaces for restorative justice and healing

142
0:08:05.974,000 --> 0:08:06,000
are transformative.

143
0:08:07.157,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I've seen it in our workshops over and over again.

144
0:08:09.704,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But I think we know that just visualizing these spaces is not enough.

145
0:08:13.482,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We have to build them.

146
0:08:16.188,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And so I started to look for justice innovators.

147
0:08:20.131,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They are not easy to find.

148
0:08:22.732,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But I found one.

149
0:08:24.544,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I found the Center for Court Innovation.

150
0:08:27.641,000 --> 0:08:29,000
They were bringing Native American peacemaking practices

151
0:08:30.618,000 --> 0:08:31,000
into a non-Native community

152
0:08:32.395,000 --> 0:08:34,000
for the very first time in the United States.

153
0:08:35.022,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And I approached them, and I said,

154
0:08:37.085,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"OK, well, as you set up your process,

155
0:08:40.069,000 --> 0:08:43,000
could I work with the community to design a peacemaking center?"

156
0:08:45.179,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And they said yes.

157
0:08:47.03,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Thank God, because I had no backup to these guys.

158
0:08:51.466,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And so, in the Near Westside of Syracuse, New York,

159
0:08:55.188,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we started to run design workshops with the community

160
0:08:58.903,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to both locate and reenvision an old drug house

161
0:09:02.228,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to be a peacemaking center.

162
0:09:04.537,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The Near Westside Peacemaking Project is complete.

163
0:09:07.776,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And they are already running over 80 circles a year,

164
0:09:10.244,000 --> 0:09:12,000
with a very interesting outcome,

165
0:09:12.449,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and that it is the space itself

166
0:09:14.142,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that's convincing people to engage in peacemaking

167
0:09:16.571,000 --> 0:09:18,000
for the very first time in their lives.

168
0:09:19.807,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Isabel and her daughter are some of those community members.

169
0:09:22.942,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And they had been referred to peacemaking

170
0:09:25.633,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to heal their relationship after a history of family abuse,

171
0:09:29.307,000 --> 0:09:3,000
sexual abuse

172
0:09:30.69,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and other issues that they'd been having in their own family

173
0:09:33.54,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and the community.

174
0:09:35.133,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And, you know, Isabel didn't want to do peacemaking.

175
0:09:37.784,000 --> 0:09:39,000
She was like, "This is just like going to court.

176
0:09:40.093,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What is this peacemaking stuff?"

177
0:09:41.68,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But when she showed up,

178
0:09:43.8,000 --> 0:09:45,000
she was stressed, she was anxious.

179
0:09:46.093,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But when she got in, she kind of looked around,

180
0:09:48.705,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and she settled in.

181
0:09:50.639,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And she turned to the coordinator and said,

182
0:09:53.446,000 --> 0:09:55,000
"I feel comfortable here -- at ease.

183
0:09:57.41,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's homey."

184
0:10:00.72,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Isabel and her daughter made a decision that day

185
0:10:02.991,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to engage and complete the peacemaking process.

186
0:10:05.807,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And today, their relationship is transformed;

187
0:10:08.839,000 --> 0:10:1,000
they're doing really well and they're healing.

188
0:10:12.955,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So after this project, I didn't go into a thing

189
0:10:15.354,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where I'm going to make a huge peacemaking center.

190
0:10:17.725,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I did want to have peacemaking centers in every community.

191
0:10:22.847,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But then a new idea emerged.

192
0:10:25.744,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I was doing a workshop in Santa Rita Jail in California,

193
0:10:30.221,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and one of our incarcerated designers, Doug, said,

194
0:10:33.99,000 --> 0:10:36,000
"Yeah, you know, repairing the harm, getting back on my feet, healing --

195
0:10:37.435,000 --> 0:10:38,000
really important.

196
0:10:38.775,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But the reality is, Deanna, when I get home,

197
0:10:41.243,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I don't have anywhere to go.

198
0:10:43.688,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I have no job -- who's going to hire me?

199
0:10:45.942,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I'm just going to end up back here."

200
0:10:47.71,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And you know what, he's right,

201
0:10:49.434,000 --> 0:10:53,000
because 60 to 75 percent of those returning to their communities

202
0:10:53.68,000 --> 0:10:56,000
will be unemployed a year after their release.

203
0:10:57.315,000 --> 0:11:,000
We also know, if you can't meet your basic economic needs,

204
0:11:00.966,000 --> 0:11:01,000
you're going to commit crime --

205
0:11:02.487,000 --> 0:11:03,000
any of us would do that.

206
0:11:05.173,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So instead of building prisons,

207
0:11:08.863,000 --> 0:11:12,000
what we could build are spaces for job training and entrepreneurship.

208
0:11:13.498,000 --> 0:11:16,000
These are spaces for what we call "restorative economics."

209
0:11:17.387,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Located in East Oakland, California,

210
0:11:20.276,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"Restore Oakland" will be the country’s first center

211
0:11:23.07,000 --> 0:11:25,000
for restorative justice and restorative economics.

212
0:11:25.688,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Applause)

213
0:11:31.752,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So here's what we're going to do.

214
0:11:33.379,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We're going to gut this building and turn it into three things.

215
0:11:36.609,000 --> 0:11:38,000
First, a restaurant called "Colors,"

216
0:11:38.911,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that will break the racial divide in the restaurant industry

217
0:11:41.784,000 --> 0:11:43,000
by training low-wage restaurant workers

218
0:11:43.808,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to get living-wage jobs in fine dining.

219
0:11:45.776,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It does not matter if you have a criminal record or not.

220
0:11:48.839,000 --> 0:11:51,000
On the second floor, we have bright, open, airy spaces

221
0:11:52.538,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to support a constellation of activist organizations

222
0:11:55.729,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to amplify their cry of "Healthcare Not Handcuffs,"

223
0:11:59.188,000 --> 0:12:,000
and "Housing as a human right."

224
0:12:01.276,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And third, the county's first dedicated space for restorative justice,

225
0:12:06.792,000 --> 0:12:09,000
filled with nature, color, texture and spaces of refuge

226
0:12:10.403,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to support the dialogues here.

227
0:12:12.804,000 --> 0:12:14,000
This project breaks ground in just two months.

228
0:12:15.82,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And we have plans to replicate it

229
0:12:17.446,000 --> 0:12:2,000
in Washington D.C., Detroit, New York and New Orleans.

230
0:12:20.986,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

231
0:12:30.609,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So you've seen two things we can build instead of prisons.

232
0:12:33.704,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And look, the price point is better.

233
0:12:36.252,000 --> 0:12:4,000
For one jail, we can build 30 restorative justice centers.

234
0:12:40.876,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Applause)

235
0:12:42.38,000 --> 0:12:44,000
That is a better use of your tax dollars.

236
0:12:45.982,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So I want to build all of these.

237
0:12:48.712,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But building buildings is a really heavy lift.

238
0:12:51.155,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It takes time.

239
0:12:53.188,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And what was happening in the communities that I was serving

240
0:12:56.085,000 --> 0:13:,000
is we were losing people every week to gun violence and mass incarceration.

241
0:13:01.521,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We needed to serve more people and faster and keep them out of the system.

242
0:13:06.72,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And a new idea emerged from the community,

243
0:13:09.331,000 --> 0:13:11,000
one that was a lot lighter on its feet.

244
0:13:12.918,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Instead of building prisons, we could build villages on wheels.

245
0:13:18.64,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It's called the Pop-Up Resource Village,

246
0:13:21.243,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and it brings an entire constellation of resources

247
0:13:24.14,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to isolated communities in the greater San Francisco area,

248
0:13:27.371,000 --> 0:13:3,000
including mobile medical, social services and pop-up shops.

249
0:13:32.022,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And so what we're doing now

250
0:13:33.402,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is we're building this whole village with the community,

251
0:13:36.188,000 --> 0:13:4,000
starting with transforming municipal buses into classrooms on wheels

252
0:13:41.077,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that bring GED and high school education across turf lines.

253
0:13:45.006,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

254
0:13:46.181,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We will serve thousands of more students with this.

255
0:13:49.581,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We're creating mobile spaces of refuge

256
0:13:51.816,000 --> 0:13:53,000
for women released from jail in the middle of the night,

257
0:13:54.483,000 --> 0:13:55,000
at their most vulnerable.

258
0:13:56.246,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Next summer, the village will launch, and it pops up every single week,

259
0:14:00.133,000 --> 0:14:03,000
expanding to more and more communities as it goes.

260
0:14:04.077,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So look out for it.

261
0:14:05.379,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Applause)

262
0:14:10.411,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So what do we build instead of prisons?

263
0:14:13.807,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We've looked at three things:

264
0:14:15.363,000 --> 0:14:16,000
peacemaking centers,

265
0:14:16.807,000 --> 0:14:19,000
centers for restorative justice and restorative economics

266
0:14:20.236,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and pop-up villages.

267
0:14:23.038,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But I'm telling you, I have a list a mile long.

268
0:14:27.403,000 --> 0:14:3,000
This is customized housing for youth transitioning out of foster care.

269
0:14:31.014,000 --> 0:14:34,000
These are reentry centers for women to reunite with their children.

270
0:14:34.315,000 --> 0:14:36,000
These are spaces for survivors of violence.

271
0:14:37.807,000 --> 0:14:4,000
These are spaces that address the root causes

272
0:14:40.958,000 --> 0:14:41,000
of mass incarceration.

273
0:14:42.593,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And not a single one of them is a jail or a prison.

274
0:14:48.3,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Activist, philosopher, writer Cornel West says

275
0:14:53.363,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that "Justice is what love looks like in public."

276
0:14:56.871,000 --> 0:15:,000
So with this in mind, I ask you one more time

277
0:15:01.315,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to imagine a world without prisons,

278
0:15:05.038,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and join me in creating all the things that we could build instead.

279
0:15:09.545,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Thank you.

280
0:15:10.72,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

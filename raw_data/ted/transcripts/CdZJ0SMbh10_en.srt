1
0:00:12.345,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I am an engineering professor,

2
0:00:14.009,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and for the past 14 years

3
0:00:17.125,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've been teaching crap.

4
0:00:18.933,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:20.238,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Not that I'm a bad teacher,

6
0:00:22.255,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but I've been studying and teaching

7
0:00:24.373,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about human waste

8
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and how waste is conveyed

9
0:00:27.891,000 --> 0:00:29,000
through these wastewater treatment plants,

10
0:00:30.774,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and how we engineer and design

11
0:00:32.349,000 --> 0:00:33,000
these treatment plants so that we can protect

12
0:00:34.339,000 --> 0:00:36,000
surface water like rivers.

13
0:00:36.421,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I've based my scientific career

14
0:00:39.071,000 --> 0:00:42,000
on using leading-edge molecular techniques,

15
0:00:42.508,000 --> 0:00:44,000
DNA- and RNA-based methods

16
0:00:45.12,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to look at microbial populations in biological reactors,

17
0:00:48.559,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and again to optimize these systems.

18
0:00:50.922,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And over the years,

19
0:00:52.171,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,

20
0:00:56.423,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I've been known to sneak into toilets

21
0:00:59.415,000 --> 0:01:,000
and take my camera phone

22
0:01:01.218,000 --> 0:01:03,000
all over the world.

23
0:01:03.566,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But along the way, I've learned

24
0:01:05.79,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that it's not just the technical side,

25
0:01:08.332,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but there's also this thing called the culture of crap.

26
0:01:12.51,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So for example,

27
0:01:13.979,000 --> 0:01:15,000
how many of you are washers

28
0:01:16.286,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and how many of you are wipers?

29
0:01:18.738,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:22.945,000 --> 0:01:25,000
If, well, I guess you know what I mean.

31
0:01:26.882,000 --> 0:01:28,000
If you're a washer, then you use water

32
0:01:29.121,000 --> 0:01:31,000
for anal cleansing. That's the technical term.

33
0:01:31.933,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And if you're a wiper,

34
0:01:34.791,000 --> 0:01:36,000
then you use toilet paper

35
0:01:36.883,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or, in some regions of the world

36
0:01:38.638,000 --> 0:01:41,000
where it's not available, newspaper

37
0:01:42.272,000 --> 0:01:45,000
or rags or corncobs.

38
0:01:45.792,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And this is not just a piece of trivia,

39
0:01:48.29,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but it's really important to understand

40
0:01:50.146,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and solve the sanitation problem.

41
0:01:52.339,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And it is a big problem:

42
0:01:54.623,000 --> 0:01:56,000
There are 2.5 billion people in the world

43
0:01:56.668,000 --> 0:01:59,000
who don't have access to adequate sanitation.

44
0:01:59.829,000 --> 0:02:01,000
For them, there's no modern toilet.

45
0:02:01.932,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And there are 1.1 billion people

46
0:02:05.843,000 --> 0:02:07,000
whose toilets are the streets

47
0:02:08.237,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or river banks or open spaces,

48
0:02:11.163,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and again, the technical term for that is

49
0:02:13.142,000 --> 0:02:15,000
open defecation,

50
0:02:15.179,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but that is really simply

51
0:02:18.283,000 --> 0:02:2,000
shitting in the open.

52
0:02:20.342,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And if you're living in fecal material

53
0:02:22.245,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.

54
0:02:24.58,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's going to get into your drinking water,

55
0:02:26.086,000 --> 0:02:28,000
into your food, into your immediate surroundings.

56
0:02:28.502,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So the United Nations estimates

57
0:02:30.947,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that every year, there are 1.5 million child deaths

58
0:02:35.059,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because of inadequate sanitation.

59
0:02:37.768,000 --> 0:02:41,000
That's one preventable death every 20 seconds,

60
0:02:41.817,000 --> 0:02:43,000
171 every hour,

61
0:02:44.427,000 --> 0:02:47,000
4,100 every day.

62
0:02:47.645,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And so, to avoid open defecation,

63
0:02:49.737,000 --> 0:02:51,000
municipalities and cities

64
0:02:51.912,000 --> 0:02:55,000
build infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines,

65
0:02:56.104,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in peri-urban and rural areas.

66
0:02:58.026,000 --> 0:03:01,000
For example, in KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa,

67
0:03:01.333,000 --> 0:03:04,000
they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines.

68
0:03:04.667,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But there's a problem when you scale up

69
0:03:06.86,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to tens of thousands, and the problem is,

70
0:03:09.11,000 --> 0:03:1,000
what happens when the pits are full?

71
0:03:10.912,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This is what happens.

72
0:03:13.497,000 --> 0:03:15,000
People defecate around the toilet.

73
0:03:15.871,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In schools, children defecate on the floors

74
0:03:18.976,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and then leave a trail outside the building

75
0:03:21.147,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and start defecating around the building,

76
0:03:23.93,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and these pits have to be cleaned

77
0:03:26.164,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and manually emptied.

78
0:03:28.695,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And who does the emptying?

79
0:03:30.043,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You've got these workers

80
0:03:32.565,000 --> 0:03:34,000
who have to sometimes go down into the pits

81
0:03:35.299,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and manually remove the contents.

82
0:03:37.7,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's a dirty and dangerous business.

83
0:03:41.547,000 --> 0:03:43,000
As you can see, there's no protective equipment,

84
0:03:43.865,000 --> 0:03:44,000
no protective clothing.

85
0:03:45.454,000 --> 0:03:46,000
There's one worker down there.

86
0:03:46.46,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I hope you can see him.

87
0:03:48.098,000 --> 0:03:5,000
He's got a face mask on, but no shirt.

88
0:03:50.954,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And in some countries, like India,

89
0:03:53.385,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the lower castes are condemned

90
0:03:55.859,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to empty the pits,

91
0:03:58.233,000 --> 0:04:,000
and they're further condemned by society.

92
0:04:00.809,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So you ask yourself, how can we solve this

93
0:04:03.756,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets

94
0:04:06.591,000 --> 0:04:08,000
for these two and a half billion?

95
0:04:09.112,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And the answer is, it's just not possible.

96
0:04:11.417,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In some of these areas, there's not enough water,

97
0:04:14.275,000 --> 0:04:15,000
there's no energy,

98
0:04:15.648,000 --> 0:04:17,000
it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars

99
0:04:17.683,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to lay out the sewer lines

100
0:04:19.258,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and to build the facilities

101
0:04:20.129,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and to operate and maintain these systems,

102
0:04:22.523,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and if you don't build it right,

103
0:04:24.095,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you're going to have flush toilets

104
0:04:25.996,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that basically go straight into the river,

105
0:04:28.404,000 --> 0:04:3,000
just like what's happening in many cities

106
0:04:30.879,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in the developing world.

107
0:04:32.272,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And is this really the solution?

108
0:04:34.321,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Because essentially, what you're doing is

109
0:04:36.211,000 --> 0:04:38,000
you're using clean water

110
0:04:38.596,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and you're using it to flush your toilet,

111
0:04:40.661,000 --> 0:04:42,000
convey it to a wastewater treatment plant

112
0:04:43.147,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which then discharges to a river,

113
0:04:44.891,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and that river, again, is a drinking water source.

114
0:04:47.647,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So we've got to rethink sanitation,

115
0:04:49.942,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure,

116
0:04:54.507,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and I'm going to argue that to do this,

117
0:04:56.408,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you have to employ systems thinking.

118
0:04:58.725,000 --> 0:05:,000
We have to look at the whole sanitation chain.

119
0:05:01.695,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We start with a human interface,

120
0:05:03.968,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and then we have to think about how feces

121
0:05:05.869,000 --> 0:05:07,000
are collected and stored,

122
0:05:08.253,000 --> 0:05:1,000
transported, treated and reused —

123
0:05:10.975,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and not just disposal but reuse.

124
0:05:13.14,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So let's start with the human user interface.

125
0:05:15.633,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I say, it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper,

126
0:05:19.457,000 --> 0:05:21,000
a sitter or a squatter,

127
0:05:21.46,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the human user interface should be clean

128
0:05:23.552,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and easy to use, because after all,

129
0:05:26.353,000 --> 0:05:28,000
taking a dump should be pleasurable.

130
0:05:28.727,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter)

131
0:05:31.348,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And when we open the possibilities

132
0:05:34.205,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to understanding this sanitation chain,

133
0:05:36.916,000 --> 0:05:38,000
then the back-end technology,

134
0:05:38.986,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the collection to the reuse, should not really matter,

135
0:05:42.676,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and then we can apply

136
0:05:43.969,000 --> 0:05:46,000
locally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions.

137
0:05:47.806,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So we can open ourselves to possibilities like,

138
0:05:50.506,000 --> 0:05:52,000
for example, this urine-diverting toilet,

139
0:05:53.401,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and there's two holes in this toilet.

140
0:05:55.233,000 --> 0:05:56,000
There's the front and the back,

141
0:05:56.415,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and the front collects the urine,

142
0:05:58.489,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and the back collects the fecal material.

143
0:06:00.393,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And so what you're doing is you're separating the urine,

144
0:06:02.239,000 --> 0:06:04,000
which has 80 percent of the nitrogen

145
0:06:04.308,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and 50 percent of the phosphorus,

146
0:06:06.558,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and then that can then be treated

147
0:06:08.639,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and precipitated to form things like struvite,

148
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which is a high-value fertilizer,

149
0:06:13.229,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and then the fecal material can then be disinfected

150
0:06:15.727,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and again converted to high-value end products.

151
0:06:19.416,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Or, for example, in some of our research,

152
0:06:21.621,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you can reuse the water by treating it

153
0:06:24.264,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in on-site sanitation systems

154
0:06:26.402,000 --> 0:06:28,000
like planter boxes or constructed wetlands.

155
0:06:29.163,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So we can open up all these possibilities

156
0:06:31.846,000 --> 0:06:34,000
if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets

157
0:06:35.334,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and treatment plants.

158
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So you might be asking, who's going to pay?

159
0:06:40.418,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Well, I'm going to argue that governments

160
0:06:42.376,000 --> 0:06:45,000
should fund sanitation infrastructure.

161
0:06:45.807,000 --> 0:06:47,000
NGOs and donor organizations,

162
0:06:48.338,000 --> 0:06:51,000
they can do their best, but it's not going to be enough.

163
0:06:51.758,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Governments should fund sanitation

164
0:06:53.423,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the same way they fund roads

165
0:06:55.178,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and schools and hospitals

166
0:06:58.638,000 --> 0:07:,000
and other infrastructure like bridges,

167
0:07:00.79,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because we know, and the WHO has done this study,

168
0:07:03.893,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that for every dollar that we invest

169
0:07:05.727,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in sanitation infrastructure,

170
0:07:07.616,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we get something like three to 34 dollars back.

171
0:07:11.126,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying.

172
0:07:13.578,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So at North Carolina State University,

173
0:07:15.073,000 --> 0:07:18,000
we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution,

174
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and this is what they came up with:

175
0:07:19.744,000 --> 0:07:21,000
a simple, modified screw auger

176
0:07:22.387,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that can move the waste up

177
0:07:24.321,000 --> 0:07:26,000
from the pit and into a collecting drum,

178
0:07:26.84,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and now the pit worker

179
0:07:28.336,000 --> 0:07:3,000
doesn't have to go down into the pit.

180
0:07:30.441,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We tested it in South Africa, and it works.

181
0:07:32.347,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We need to make it more robust,

182
0:07:34.075,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and we're going to do more testing

183
0:07:35.368,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in Malawi and South Africa this coming year.

184
0:07:37.934,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And our idea is to make this

185
0:07:39.553,000 --> 0:07:41,000
a professionalized pit-emptying service

186
0:07:42.06,000 --> 0:07:44,000
so that we can create a small business out of it,

187
0:07:44.638,000 --> 0:07:45,000
create profits and jobs,

188
0:07:46.471,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and the hope is that,

189
0:07:47.855,000 --> 0:07:48,000
as we are rethinking sanitation,

190
0:07:49.646,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we are extending the life of these pits

191
0:07:53.024,000 --> 0:07:55,000
so that we don't have to resort

192
0:07:55.172,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to quick solutions

193
0:07:56.977,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that don't really make sense.

194
0:07:58.941,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I believe that access to adequate sanitation

195
0:08:02.569,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is a basic human right.

196
0:08:04.493,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We need to stop the practice

197
0:08:06.11,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of lower castes and lower-status people

198
0:08:08.9,000 --> 0:08:11,000
going down and being condemned to empty pits.

199
0:08:12.442,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It is our moral, it is our social

200
0:08:14.422,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and our environmental obligation.

201
0:08:16.571,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Thank you.

202
0:08:18.64,000 --> 0:08:19,000

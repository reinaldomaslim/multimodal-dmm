1
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
What's in the box?

2
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Whatever it is must be pretty important,

3
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because I've traveled with it, moved it,

4
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
from apartment to apartment to apartment.

5
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Sound familiar?

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Did you know that we Americans

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
have about three times the amount of space

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we did 50 years ago?

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Three times.

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So you'd think, with all this extra space,

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff.

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Nope.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There's a new industry in town,

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry:

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that of personal storage.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So we've got triple the space,

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but we've become such good shoppers

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that we need even more space.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So where does this lead?

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Lots of credit card debt,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
huge environmental footprints,

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and perhaps not coincidentally,

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years.

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way,

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that less might actually equal more.

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I bet most of us have experienced at some point

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the joys of less:

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
college -- in your dorm,

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
traveling -- in a hotel room,

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
camping -- rig up basically nothing,

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
maybe a boat.

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Whatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things,

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
this gave you a little more freedom,

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a little more time.

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I'm going to suggest

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that less stuff and less space

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
are going to equal a smaller footprint.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It's actually a great way to save you some money.

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life.

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to further this conversation

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and to find some great solutions in this area.

45
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
First up: crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I wanted it all --

48
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
home office, sit down dinner for 10,

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
room for guests,

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and all my kite surfing gear.

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
With over 300 entries from around the world,

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I got it, my own little jewel box.

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft.

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
instead of 600,

55
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
immediately I'm saving 200 grand.

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities --

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
save some more money there,

58
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but also a smaller footprint.

59
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And because it's really designed

60
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff --

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and really designed for me,

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I'm really excited to be there.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So how can you live little?

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Three main approaches.

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.

66
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years?

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's time for me to let it go.

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives,

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and we've got to learn to stem the inflow.

71
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We need to think before we buy.

72
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Ask ourselves,

73
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?"

74
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
By all means,

75
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we should buy and own some great stuff.

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But we want stuff that we're going to love for years,

77
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
not just stuff.

78
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Secondly, our new mantra:

79
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
small is sexy.

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We want space efficiency.

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We want things that are designed

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for how they're used the vast majority of the time,

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
not that rare event.

84
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Why have a six burner stove

85
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
when you rarely use three?

86
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So we want things that nest,

87
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
we want things that stack, and we want it digitized.

88
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You can take paperwork,

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
books, movies,

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and you can make it disappear -- it's magic.

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares --

92
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
a sink combined with a toilet,

93
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
a dining table becomes a bed --

94
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
same space,

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a little side table

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
stretches out to seat 10.

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here,

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture

99
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to get a lot out of the space.

100
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Look at the coffee table --

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it grows in height and width

102
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to seat 10.

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
My office folds away,

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
easily hidden.

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.

106
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Guests? Move the moving wall,

107
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
have some fold-down guest beds.

108
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And of course, my own movie theater.

109
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So I'm not saying that we all need to live

110
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in 420 sq. ft.

111
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But consider the benefits of an edited life.

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Go from 3,000 to 2,000,

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
from 1,500 to 1,000.

114
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Most of us, maybe all of us,

115
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
are here pretty happily for a bunch of days

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
with a couple of bags,

117
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
maybe a small space, a hotel room.

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So when you go home and you walk through your front door,

119
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
take a second and ask yourselves,

120
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"Could I do with a little life editing?

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Would that give me a little more freedom?

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Maybe a little more time?"

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
What's in the box?

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It doesn't really matter.

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I know I don't need it.

126
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What's in yours?

127
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Maybe, just maybe,

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
less might equal more.

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So let's make room

130
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for the good stuff.

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Thank you.

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Applause)

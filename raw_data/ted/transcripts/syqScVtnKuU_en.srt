1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
College presidents are not the first people who come to mind

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here.

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The story begins in the late '90s.

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I was invited to meet with leading educators

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Since education under the Soviet Union

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
was essentially propaganda

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
serving the purposes of a state ideology,

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations

12
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
if they were to provide an education

13
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
worthy of free men and women.

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Given this rare opportunity

15
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to start fresh,

16
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
they chose liberal arts

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as the most compelling model

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because of its historic commitment

19
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to furthering its students' broadest intellectual,

20
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and deepest ethical potential.

21
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Having made that decision

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
they came to the United States,

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
home of liberal arts education,

24
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to talk with some of us

25
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
most closely identified

26
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with that kind of education.

27
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They spoke with a passion, an urgency,

28
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
an intellectual conviction

29
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades,

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a dream long forgotten.

31
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
For, in truth, we had moved light years

32
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
from the passions that animated them.

33
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But for me, unlike them,

34
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in my world, the slate was not clean,

35
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and what was written on it was not encouraging.

36
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
In truth, liberal arts education

37
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
no longer exists --

38
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country.

39
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We have professionalized liberal arts to the point

40
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
where they no longer provide the breadth of application

41
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement

42
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that is their signature.

43
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Over the past century

44
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the expert has dethroned the educated generalist

45
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to become the sole model

46
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
of intellectual accomplishment. (Applause)

47
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Expertise has for sure had its moments.

48
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But the price of its dominance is enormous.

49
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Subject matters are broken up

50
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
into smaller and smaller pieces,

51
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.

52
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.

53
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You may think you know what is going on

54
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in that Jane Austen novel --

55
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that is, until your first encounter

56
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with postmodern deconstructionism.

57
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The progression of today's college student

58
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is to jettison every interest except one.

59
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And within that one, to continually narrow the focus,

60
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
learning more and more about less and less;

61
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
this, despite the evidence all around us

62
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of the interconnectedness of things.

63
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Lest you think I exaggerate,

64
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
here are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.

65
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
As one moves up the ladder,

66
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
values other than technical competence

67
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
are viewed with increasing suspicion.

68
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Questions such as,

69
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"What kind of a world are we making?

70
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
What kind of a world should we be making?

71
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
What kind of a world can we be making?"

72
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
are treated with more and more skepticism,

73
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and move off the table.

74
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In so doing, the guardians of secular democracy

75
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in effect yield the connection

76
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
between education and values

77
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to fundamentalists,

78
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who, you can be sure,

79
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
have no compunctions about using education

80
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to further their values:

81
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the absolutes of a theocracy.

82
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Meanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.

83
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Either we have lost touch with those values

84
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
or, no better,

85
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
believe they need not

86
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or cannot be taught.

87
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This aversion to social values

88
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
may seem at odds with the explosion

89
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of community service programs.

90
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But despite the attention paid to these efforts,

91
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
they remain emphatically extracurricular.

92
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In effect, civic-mindedness is treated

93
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
as outside the realm of what purports to be

94
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
serious thinking and adult purposes.

95
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world,

96
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the academy is more likely to engender

97
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
a learned helplessness

98
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
than to create a sense of empowerment.

99
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This brew -- oversimplification of civic engagement,

100
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
idealization of the expert,

101
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
fragmentation of knowledge,

102
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
emphasis on technical mastery,

103
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
neutrality as a condition of academic integrity --

104
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections

105
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
between education and the public good,

106
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
between intellectual integrity

107
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and human freedom,

108
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which were at the heart --

109
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause) -- of the challenge posed to and by

110
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
my European colleagues.

111
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
When the astronomical distance

112
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
between the realities of the academy

113
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and the visionary intensity of this challenge

114
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
were more than enough, I can assure you,

115
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
to give one pause,

116
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
what was happening outside higher education

117
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
made backing off unthinkable.

118
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Whether it was threats to the environment,

119
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
inequities in the distribution of wealth,

120
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy

121
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with respect to the continuing uses of energy,

122
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we were in desperate straits.

123
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And that was only the beginning.

124
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The corrupting of our political life

125
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
had become a living nightmare;

126
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
nothing was exempt --

127
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
separation of powers, civil liberties,

128
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the rule of law,

129
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the relationship of church and state.

130
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Accompanied by a squandering

131
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of the nation's material wealth

132
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that defied credulity.

133
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
A harrowing predilection for the uses of force

134
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
had become commonplace,

135
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with an equal distaste

136
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
for the alternative forms of influence.

137
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
At the same time, all of our firepower was impotent

138
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
when it came to halting or even stemming

139
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar.

140
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Our public education, once a model for the world,

141
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
has become most noteworthy

142
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
for its failures.

143
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy

144
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
eludes vast numbers of our students.

145
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Despite having a research establishment

146
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that is the envy of the world,

147
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
more than half of the American public

148
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
don't believe in evolution.

149
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And don't press your luck

150
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
about how much those who do believe in it

151
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
actually understand it.

152
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Incredibly, this nation,

153
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
with all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources,

154
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
seems utterly helpless

155
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to reverse the freefall in any of these areas.

156
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Equally startling, from my point of view,

157
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
is the fact that no one

158
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
was drawing any connections

159
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
between what is happening to the body politic,

160
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and what is happening in our leading educational institutions.

161
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We may be at the top of the list

162
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.

163
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We are not even on the list

164
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
when it comes to our responsibility

165
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
for the health of this democracy.

166
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We are playing with fire.

167
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You can be sure Jefferson knew

168
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
what he was talking about when he said,

169
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free

170
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in a state of civilization,

171
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it expects what never was,

172
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and never will be."

173
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

174
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
On a more personal note,

175
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
this betrayal of our principles,

176
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
our decency, our hope,

177
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
made it impossible for me

178
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to avoid the question,

179
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
"What will I say, years from now,

180
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
when people ask, 'Where were you?'"

181
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
As president of a leading liberal arts college,

182
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
famous for its innovative history,

183
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
there were no excuses.

184
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So the conversation began at Bennington.

185
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Knowing that if we were to regain

186
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the integrity of liberal education,

187
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
it would take radical rethinking

188
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of basic assumptions,

189
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
beginning with our priorities.

190
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.

191
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The accomplishment of civic virtue

192
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination

193
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
at their most challenging.

194
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Our ways of approaching agency and authority

195
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
turn inside out to reflect the reality

196
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that no one has the answers

197
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to the challenges facing citizens in this century,

198
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and everyone has the responsibility

199
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
for trying and participating in finding them.

200
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences

201
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences

202
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in personal and professional objectives.

203
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But the balances redressed,

204
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
our shared purposes assume an equal

205
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
if not greater importance.

206
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.

207
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves --

208
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
from health and education

209
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to the uses of force --

210
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the organizers of the curriculum.

211
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.

212
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But structures designed to connect, rather than divide

213
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
mutually dependent circles,

214
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
rather than isolating triangles.

215
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And the point is not to treat these topics

216
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
as topics of study,

217
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
but as frameworks of action.

218
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The challenge: to figure out what it will take

219
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to actually do something

220
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that makes a significant and sustainable difference.

221
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
Contrary to widely held assumptions,

222
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.

223
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The importance of coming to grips with values like justice,

224
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
equity, truth,

225
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
becomes increasingly evident

226
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
as students discover that interest alone

227
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
cannot tell them what they need to know

228
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
when the issue is rethinking education,

229
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
our approach to health,

230
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or strategies for achieving

231
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
an economics of equity.

232
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The value of the past also comes alive;

233
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
it provides a lot of company.

234
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
You are not the first to try to figure this out,

235
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
just as you are unlikely to be the last.

236
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Even more valuable,

237
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
history provides a laboratory

238
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in which we see played out

239
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
the actual, as well as the intended

240
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
consequences of ideas.

241
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
In the language of my students,

242
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"Deep thought matters

243
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
when you're contemplating what to do

244
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
about things that matter."

245
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
A new liberal arts that can support this

246
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
action-oriented curriculum

247
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
has begun to emerge.

248
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Rhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words

249
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to maximum effect.

250
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Design, the art of organizing the world of things.

251
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Mediation and improvisation

252
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
also assume a special place in this new pantheon.

253
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position

254
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
at the heart of what it takes to manage change

255
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
where measurement is crucial.

256
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
As is a capacity to discriminate

257
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
systematically between what is at the core

258
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and what is at the periphery.

259
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And when making connections is of the essence,

260
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the power of technology emerges with special intensity.

261
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But so does the importance of content.

262
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The more powerful our reach,

263
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the more important the question "About what?"

264
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
When improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key,

265
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
artists, at long last,

266
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
take their place at the table,

267
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
when strategies of action are in the process of being designed.

268
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
In this dramatically expanded ideal

269
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
of a liberal arts education

270
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood,

271
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
knowledge honed outside the academy

272
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
becomes essential.

273
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Social activists, business leaders,

274
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
lawyers, politicians, professionals

275
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants

276
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.

277
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Students, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom

278
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to engage the world directly.

279
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And of course, this new wine

280
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
needs new bottles

281
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism

282
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
of this idea.

283
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
The most important discovery we made

284
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
in our focus on public action

285
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
was to appreciate that the hard choices

286
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
are not between good and evil,

287
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but between competing goods.

288
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
This discovery is transforming.

289
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It undercuts self-righteousness,

290
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
radically alters the tone and character of controversy,

291
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and enriches dramatically

292
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the possibilities for finding common ground.

293
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Ideology, zealotry,

294
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do.

295
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
This is a political education, to be sure.

296
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
But it is a politics of principle,

297
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
not of partisanship.

298
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.

299
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
On the cover of Bennington's 2008 holiday card

300
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
is the architect's sketch of a building

301
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
opening in 2010

302
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
that is to be a center for the advancement

303
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
of public action.

304
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.

305
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Think of it as a kind of secular church.

306
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The words on the card describe what will happen inside.

307
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We intend to turn the intellectual

308
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and imaginative power, passion and boldness

309
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
of our students, faculty and staff

310
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to developing strategies

311
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
for acting on the critical challenges of our time.

312
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So we are doing our job.

313
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
While these past weeks have been a time

314
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of national exhilaration in this country,

315
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
it would be tragic if you thought this meant

316
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
your job was done.

317
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The glacial silence we have experienced

318
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
in the face of the shredding of the constitution,

319
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
the unraveling of our public institutions,

320
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the deterioration of our infrastructure

321
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
is not limited to the universities.

322
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
We the people

323
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
have become inured to our own irrelevance

324
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
when it comes to doing anything significant

325
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
about anything that matters

326
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
concerning governance,

327
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
beyond waiting another four years.

328
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We persist also

329
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
in being sidelined by the idea of the expert

330
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
as the only one capable of coming up with answers,

331
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

332
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
The problem is there is no such thing

333
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
as a viable democracy made up of experts,

334
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
zealots, politicians and spectators.

335
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
(Applause)

336
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
People will continue and should continue

337
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
to learn everything there is to know about something or other.

338
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We actually do it all the time.

339
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And there will be and should be

340
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
those who spend a lifetime

341
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry.

342
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
But this single-mindedness will not yield

343
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
the flexibilities of mind,

344
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
the multiplicity of perspectives,

345
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the capacities for collaboration and innovation

346
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
this country needs.

347
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
That is where you come in.

348
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
What is certain is that the individual talent

349
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
exhibited in such abundance here,

350
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
needs to turn its attention

351
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
to that collaborative, messy, frustrating,

352
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
contentious and impossible world

353
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
of politics and public policy.

354
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
President Obama and his team

355
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
simply cannot do it alone.

356
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
If the question of where to start seems overwhelming

357
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
you are at the beginning, not the end of this adventure.

358
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Being overwhelmed is the first step

359
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter,

360
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
on a scale that makes a difference.

361
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?

362
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Well, you have two things.

363
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
You have a mind. And you have other people.

364
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Start with those, and change the world.

365
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
(Applause)

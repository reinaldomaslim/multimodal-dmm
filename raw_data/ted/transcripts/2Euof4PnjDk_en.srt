1
0:00:15.317,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Interpreter: Piano, "p," is my favorite musical symbol.

2
0:00:19.504,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It means to play softly.

3
0:00:22.007,000 --> 0:00:26,000
If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a "p" in the score,

4
0:00:26.194,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you need to play softer.

5
0:00:28.12,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Two p's -- even softer.

6
0:00:30.804,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Four p's -- extremely soft.

7
0:00:38.353,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This is my drawing of a p-tree,

8
0:00:41.78,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which demonstrates

9
0:00:43.114,000 --> 0:00:47,000
no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be,

10
0:00:47.627,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you'll never reach complete silence.

11
0:00:50.477,000 --> 0:00:52,000
That's my current definition of silence:

12
0:00:53.279,000 --> 0:00:54,000
a very obscure sound.

13
0:00:56.976,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I'd like to share a little bit

14
0:00:58.483,000 --> 0:01:01,000
about the history of American Sign Language, ASL,

15
0:01:01.673,000 --> 0:01:02,000
plus a bit of my own background.

16
0:01:05.851,000 --> 0:01:1,000
French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s,

17
0:01:11.091,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and as time went by, mixed with local signs,

18
0:01:15.19,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it evolved into the language we know today as ASL.

19
0:01:19.168,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So it has a history of about 200 years.

20
0:01:23.8,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I was born deaf,

21
0:01:27.244,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.

22
0:01:32.662,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I believed it to be true.

23
0:01:37.318,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all.

24
0:01:41.272,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Sound was very much a part of my life,

25
0:01:44.081,000 --> 0:01:45,000
really, on my mind every day.

26
0:01:50.483,000 --> 0:01:53,000
As a Deaf person living in a world of sound,

27
0:01:54.494,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it's as if I was living in a foreign country,

28
0:01:57.438,000 --> 0:02:01,000
blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms

29
0:02:01.704,000 --> 0:02:02,000
without ever questioning them.

30
0:02:13.46,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So how is it that I understand sound?

31
0:02:18.282,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound.

32
0:02:22.654,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound.

33
0:02:26.3,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I learn and mirror that behavior.

34
0:02:28.782,000 --> 0:02:3,000
At the same time, I've learned that I create sound,

35
0:02:31.757,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and I've seen how people respond to me.

36
0:02:34.6,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Thus I've learned, for example ...

37
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Don't slam the door!"

38
0:02:40.35,000 --> 0:02:43,000
"Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"

39
0:02:43.771,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:44.795,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"Don't burp,

41
0:02:46.087,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and when you're eating,

42
0:02:47.292,000 --> 0:02:49,000
make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate."

43
0:02:50.158,000 --> 0:02:52,000
All of these things I term "sound etiquette."

44
0:02:55.927,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Maybe I think about sound etiquette

45
0:02:58.382,000 --> 0:03:,000
more than the average hearing person does.

46
0:03:01.963,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.

47
0:03:07.463,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation

48
0:03:11.353,000 --> 0:03:13,000
around sound, about what's to come next.

49
0:03:13.459,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Hence, this drawing.

50
0:03:16.28,000 --> 0:03:18,000
TBD, to be decided.

51
0:03:19.724,000 --> 0:03:21,000
TBC, to be continued.

52
0:03:22.819,000 --> 0:03:23,000
TBA, to be announced.

53
0:03:28.793,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And you notice the staff --

54
0:03:30.683,000 --> 0:03:32,000
there are no notes contained in the lines.

55
0:03:32.898,000 --> 0:03:35,000
That's because the lines already contain sound

56
0:03:36.57,000 --> 0:03:38,000
through the subtle smudges and smears.

57
0:03:40.863,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.

58
0:03:49.617,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.

59
0:03:52.325,000 --> 0:03:54,000
A typical staff contains five lines.

60
0:03:55.904,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Yet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that

61
0:03:58.702,000 --> 0:03:59,000
doesn't feel natural.

62
0:04:00.053,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.

63
0:04:05.199,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany,

64
0:04:09.212,000 --> 0:04:1,000
for an artist residency there.

65
0:04:12.041,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Prior to this time, I had been working as a painter.

66
0:04:17.02,000 --> 0:04:21,000
During this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces,

67
0:04:21.099,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and as I went from one place to the next,

68
0:04:23.105,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I noticed there was no visual art there.

69
0:04:26.618,000 --> 0:04:31,000
At that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ...

70
0:04:31.909,000 --> 0:04:32,000
there was no visual art,

71
0:04:33.911,000 --> 0:04:34,000
everything was auditory.

72
0:04:37.482,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now sound has come into my art territory.

73
0:04:41.168,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Is it going to further distance me from art?

74
0:04:45.8,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all.

75
0:04:48.52,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I actually know sound.

76
0:04:49.695,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I know it so well

77
0:04:52.361,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears.

78
0:04:55.723,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It could be felt tactually,

79
0:04:58.732,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or experienced as a visual,

80
0:05:00.639,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or even as an idea.

81
0:05:05.048,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound

82
0:05:08.333,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and to put it into my art practice.

83
0:05:13.016,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And everything that I had been taught regarding sound,

84
0:05:16.619,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I decided to do away with and unlearn.

85
0:05:21.099,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I started creating a new body of work.

86
0:05:24.961,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And when I presented this to the art community,

87
0:05:27.539,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received.

88
0:05:32.676,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I realized:

89
0:05:35.669,000 --> 0:05:38,000
sound is like money,

90
0:05:39.179,000 --> 0:05:42,000
power, control --

91
0:05:42.375,000 --> 0:05:43,000
social currency.

92
0:05:47.782,000 --> 0:05:5,000
In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing,

93
0:05:51.67,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a hearing person's thing.

94
0:05:56.014,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And sound is so powerful

95
0:05:58.513,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that it could either disempower me and my artwork,

96
0:06:02.293,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or it could empower me.

97
0:06:05.138,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I chose to be empowered.

98
0:06:08.969,000 --> 0:06:11,000
There's a massive culture around spoken language.

99
0:06:13.233,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate,

100
0:06:18.524,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all.

101
0:06:24.945,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal

102
0:06:28.887,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and become my voice.

103
0:06:32.523,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.

104
0:06:36.789,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So at school, at work and institutions,

105
0:06:39.235,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I work with many different ASL interpreters.

106
0:06:43.254,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.

107
0:06:48.365,000 --> 0:06:49,000
They help me to be heard.

108
0:06:54.38,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And their voices hold value and currency.

109
0:07:04.178,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,

110
0:07:06.54,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency,

111
0:07:10.385,000 --> 0:07:12,000
kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate.

112
0:07:18.052,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If I didn't continue this practice,

113
0:07:20.173,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion

114
0:07:23.03,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and not maintain any form of social currency.

115
0:07:29.488,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So with sound as my new art medium,

116
0:07:32.167,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I delved into the world of music.

117
0:07:35.089,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL.

118
0:07:41.186,000 --> 0:07:42,000
For example,

119
0:07:42.727,000 --> 0:07:44,000
a musical note

120
0:07:45.103,000 --> 0:07:48,000
cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper.

121
0:07:48.783,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the same holds true for a concept in ASL.

122
0:07:53.61,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They're both highly spatial and highly inflected --

123
0:08:02.213,000 --> 0:08:04,000
meaning that subtle changes

124
0:08:04.394,000 --> 0:08:06,000
can affect the entire meaning

125
0:08:06.927,000 --> 0:08:07,000
of both signs and sounds.

126
0:08:11.898,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor,

127
0:08:14.144,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works.

128
0:08:17.153,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So, envision a piano.

129
0:08:20.299,000 --> 0:08:23,000
ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters.

130
0:08:24.771,000 --> 0:08:28,000
If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano --

131
0:08:28.855,000 --> 0:08:33,000
such as facial expression, body movement,

132
0:08:33.884,000 --> 0:08:36,000
speed, hand shape and so on,

133
0:08:37.68,000 --> 0:08:39,000
as you play the piano --

134
0:08:39.912,000 --> 0:08:4,000
English is a linear language,

135
0:08:41.773,000 --> 0:08:43,000
as if one key is being pressed at a time.

136
0:08:44.602,000 --> 0:08:47,000
However, ASL is more like a chord --

137
0:08:48.274,000 --> 0:08:51,000
all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously

138
0:08:51.682,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.

139
0:08:57.548,000 --> 0:09:01,000
If just one of those keys were to change the chord,

140
0:09:01.598,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it would create a completely different meaning.

141
0:09:04.152,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume.

142
0:09:12.518,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters,

143
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
you can express different ideas.

144
0:09:17.837,000 --> 0:09:18,000
For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

145
0:09:20.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

146
0:09:24.699,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I'm looking at you.

147
0:09:28.056,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Staring at you.

148
0:09:29.38,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

149
0:09:33.103,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

150
0:09:35.733,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Oh -- busted.

151
0:09:38.423,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Laughter)

152
0:09:41.608,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Uh-oh.

153
0:09:45.521,000 --> 0:09:46,000
What are you looking at?

154
0:09:49.41,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Aw, stop.

155
0:09:50.762,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Laughter)

156
0:09:52.455,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I then started thinking,

157
0:09:53.663,000 --> 0:09:55,000
"What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?"

158
0:09:57.011,000 --> 0:10:,000
If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over,

159
0:10:00.242,000 --> 0:10:02,000
it could become like a piece of visual music.

160
0:10:04.016,000 --> 0:10:07,000
For example, this is the sign for "day,"

161
0:10:07.676,000 --> 0:10:09,000
as the sun rises and sets.

162
0:10:11.789,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This is "all day."

163
0:10:16.416,000 --> 0:10:19,000
If I was to repeat it and slow it down,

164
0:10:19.641,000 --> 0:10:21,000
visually it looks like a piece of music.

165
0:10:24.023,000 --> 0:10:26,000
All ... day.

166
0:10:27.186,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I feel the same holds true for "all night."

167
0:10:33.776,000 --> 0:10:34,000
"All night."

168
0:10:35.89,000 --> 0:10:38,000
This is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing.

169
0:10:42.501,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights:

170
0:10:49.827,000 --> 0:10:5,000
"last night,"

171
0:10:52.747,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"overnight,"

172
0:10:57.549,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Sings) "all night long."

173
0:11:00.327,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Laughter)

174
0:11:07.861,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.

175
0:11:11.23,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Laughter)

176
0:11:13.413,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This represents how time is expressed in ASL

177
0:11:16.472,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time.

178
0:11:20.955,000 --> 0:11:21,000
For example,

179
0:11:22.618,000 --> 0:11:25,000
1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,

180
0:11:25.781,000 --> 0:11:28,000
present tense happens closest and in front of the body,

181
0:11:29.035,000 --> 0:11:32,000
future is in front of the body and the past is to your back.

182
0:11:36.209,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So, the first example is "a long time ago."

183
0:11:40.209,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Then "past,"

184
0:11:44.538,000 --> 0:11:45,000
"used to"

185
0:11:46.255,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and the last one, which is my favorite,

186
0:11:48.314,000 --> 0:11:5,000
with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it,

187
0:11:50.964,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"once upon a time."

188
0:11:52.577,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

189
0:11:57.962,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"Common time"

190
0:12:00.703,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is a musical term

191
0:12:02.495,000 --> 0:12:05,000
with a specific time signature of four beats per measure.

192
0:12:07.614,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Yet when I see the word "common time,"

193
0:12:09.45,000 --> 0:12:12,000
what automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time."

194
0:12:13.645,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.

195
0:12:17.578,000 --> 0:12:19,000
We have the staff across the head and the chest.

196
0:12:20.221,000 --> 0:12:21,000
[Head: RH, Flash claw]

197
0:12:21.427,000 --> 0:12:22,000
[Common time]

198
0:12:22.701,000 --> 0:12:23,000
[Chest: LH, Flash claw]

199
0:12:25.712,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "flash claw."

200
0:12:30.722,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Can you please follow along with me?

201
0:12:33.723,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Everybody, hands up.

202
0:12:38.776,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest,

203
0:12:41.498,000 --> 0:12:43,000
kind of like "common time" or at the same time.

204
0:12:47.595,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Yes, got it.

205
0:12:49.329,000 --> 0:12:51,000
That means "to fall in love" in International [Sign].

206
0:12:52.168,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Laughter)

207
0:12:54.069,000 --> 0:12:55,000
International [Sign], as a note,

208
0:12:55.996,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is a visual tool to help communicate

209
0:12:58.765,000 --> 0:13:,000
across cultures and sign languages around the world.

210
0:13:01.997,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this --

211
0:13:04.307,000 --> 0:13:05,000
please follow along with me again.

212
0:13:10.891,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And now this.

213
0:13:17.358,000 --> 0:13:19,000
This is "colonization" in ASL.

214
0:13:20.082,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Laughter)

215
0:13:23.407,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Now the third --

216
0:13:24.702,000 --> 0:13:25,000
please follow along again.

217
0:13:31.072,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And again.

218
0:13:36.97,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This is "enlightenment" in ASL.

219
0:13:39.502,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So let's do all three together.

220
0:13:43.732,000 --> 0:13:44,000
"Fall in love,"

221
0:13:45.897,000 --> 0:13:46,000
"colonization"

222
0:13:47.845,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and "enlightenment."

223
0:13:50.767,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Good job, everyone.

224
0:13:51.941,000 --> 0:13:52,000
(Laughter)

225
0:13:53.183,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Notice how all three signs are very similar,

226
0:13:55.445,000 --> 0:13:57,000
they all happen at the head and the chest,

227
0:13:57.566,000 --> 0:13:59,000
but they convey quite different meanings.

228
0:13:59.812,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving,

229
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
just like music is.

230
0:14:06.152,000 --> 0:14:08,000
However, in this day and age,

231
0:14:09.002,000 --> 0:14:11,000
we live in a very audio-centric world.

232
0:14:11.628,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And just because ASL has no sound to it,

233
0:14:15.033,000 --> 0:14:17,000
it automatically holds no social currency.

234
0:14:19.271,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency

235
0:14:24.033,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency --

236
0:14:27.899,000 --> 0:14:28,000
without sound.

237
0:14:30.262,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society.

238
0:14:38.291,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And maybe people will understand

239
0:14:40.447,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL,

240
0:14:44.007,000 --> 0:14:46,000
nor do you have to be hearing to learn music.

241
0:14:48.891,000 --> 0:14:5,000
ASL is such a rich treasure

242
0:14:51.61,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that I'd like you to have the same experience.

243
0:14:54.419,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And I'd like to invite you to open your ears,

244
0:14:57.219,000 --> 0:14:58,000
to open your eyes,

245
0:14:59.134,000 --> 0:15:,000
take part in our culture

246
0:15:00.869,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and experience our visual language.

247
0:15:03.412,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And you never know,

248
0:15:04.871,000 --> 0:15:05,000
you might just fall in love with us.

249
0:15:06.635,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Applause)

250
0:15:08.717,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Thank you.

251
0:15:10.508,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.

252
0:15:12.433,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Applause)

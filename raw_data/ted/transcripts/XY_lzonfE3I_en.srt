1
0:00:13.087,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Four hundred parts per million:

2
0:00:15.445,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that's the approximate concentration of CO2 in the air today.

3
0:00:20.257,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What does this even mean?

4
0:00:22.083,000 --> 0:00:25,000
For every 400 molecules of carbon dioxide,

5
0:00:25.531,000 --> 0:00:29,000
we have another million molecules of oxygen and nitrogen.

6
0:00:30.068,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In this room today, there are about 1,800 of us.

7
0:00:33.993,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Imagine just one of us was wearing a green shirt,

8
0:00:37.85,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and you're asked to find that single person.

9
0:00:41.224,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That's the challenge we're facing when capturing CO2

10
0:00:44.967,000 --> 0:00:45,000
directly out of the air.

11
0:00:47.357,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Sounds pretty easy,

12
0:00:48.807,000 --> 0:00:5,000
pulling CO2 out of the air.

13
0:00:51.223,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's actually really difficult.

14
0:00:52.79,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But I'll tell you what is easy:

15
0:00:54.634,000 --> 0:00:57,000
avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.

16
0:00:58.701,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But we're not doing that.

17
0:01:01.289,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So now what we have to think about is going back;

18
0:01:05.314,000 --> 0:01:07,000
pulling CO2 back out of the air.

19
0:01:08.663,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Even though it's difficult, it's actually possible to do this.

20
0:01:12.983,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And I'm going to share with you today where this technology is at

21
0:01:16.576,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and where it just may be heading in the near future.

22
0:01:20.106,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now, the earth naturally removes CO2 from the air

23
0:01:24.96,000 --> 0:01:28,000
by seawater, soils, plants and even rocks.

24
0:01:29.637,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And although engineers and scientists are doing the invaluable work

25
0:01:34.379,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to accelerate these natural processes,

26
0:01:37.655,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it simply won't be enough.

27
0:01:39.719,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The good news is, we have more.

28
0:01:42.097,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Thanks to human ingenuity, we have the technology today

29
0:01:45.935,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to remove CO2 out of the air

30
0:01:49.247,000 --> 0:01:51,000
using a chemically manufactured approach.

31
0:01:51.876,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I like to think of this as a synthetic forest.

32
0:01:55.165,000 --> 0:02:,000
There are two basic approaches to growing or building such a forest.

33
0:02:00.509,000 --> 0:02:05,000
One is using CO2-grabbing chemicals dissolved in water.

34
0:02:05.637,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Another is using solid materials with CO2-grabbing chemicals.

35
0:02:09.515,000 --> 0:02:12,000
No matter which approach you choose, they basically look the same.

36
0:02:13.799,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So what I'm showing you here is what a system might look like

37
0:02:17.616,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to do just this.

38
0:02:19.101,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is called an air contactor.

39
0:02:21.362,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You can see it has to be really, really wide

40
0:02:23.672,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in order to have a high enough surface area

41
0:02:25.854,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to process all of the air required,

42
0:02:28.594,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because remember,

43
0:02:29.77,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we're trying to capture just 400 molecules out of a million.

44
0:02:34.293,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Using the liquid-based approach to do this,

45
0:02:37.288,000 --> 0:02:39,000
you take this high surface area packing material,

46
0:02:39.678,000 --> 0:02:41,000
you fill the contactor with the packing material,

47
0:02:42.523,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you use pumps to distribute liquid across the packing material,

48
0:02:47.219,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and you can use fans, as you can see in the front,

49
0:02:50.154,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to bubble the air through the liquid.

50
0:02:53.173,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The CO2 in the air is separated [by] the liquid

51
0:02:57.009,000 --> 0:03:03,000
by reacting with the really strong-binding CO2 molecules in solution.

52
0:03:03.692,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And in order to capture a lot of CO2,

53
0:03:06.378,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you have to make this contactor deeper.

54
0:03:09.42,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But there's an optimization,

55
0:03:10.825,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because the deeper you make that contactor,

56
0:03:12.895,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the more energy you're spending on bubbling all that air through.

57
0:03:17.055,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So air contactors for direct air capture have this unique characteristic design,

58
0:03:21.433,000 --> 0:03:25,000
where they have this huge surface area, but a relatively thin thickness.

59
0:03:26.178,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And now once you've captured the CO2,

60
0:03:29.527,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you have to be able to recycle that material that you used to capture it,

61
0:03:33.432,000 --> 0:03:34,000
over and over again.

62
0:03:34.995,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The scale of carbon capture is so enormous

63
0:03:38.006,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that the capture process must be sustainable,

64
0:03:40.238,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and you can't use a material just once.

65
0:03:42.758,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And so recycling the material requires an enormous amount of heat,

66
0:03:47.005,000 --> 0:03:5,000
because think about it: CO2 is so dilute in the air,

67
0:03:50.285,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that material is binding it really strong,

68
0:03:53.159,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and so you need a lot of heat in order to recycle the material.

69
0:03:57.407,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And to recycle the material with that heat,

70
0:04:00.094,000 --> 0:04:05,000
what happens is that concentrated CO2 that you got from dilute CO2 in the air

71
0:04:05.911,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is now released,

72
0:04:07.528,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and you produce high-purity CO2.

73
0:04:10.417,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And that's really important,

74
0:04:12.164,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because high-purity CO2 is easier to liquify,

75
0:04:16.39,000 --> 0:04:19,000
easier to transport, whether it's in a pipeline or a truck,

76
0:04:19.578,000 --> 0:04:21,000
or even easier to use directly,

77
0:04:21.823,000 --> 0:04:23,000
say, as a fuel or a chemical.

78
0:04:25.033,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So I want to talk a little bit more about that energy.

79
0:04:28.835,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The heat required to regenerate or recycle these materials

80
0:04:33.072,000 --> 0:04:39,000
absolutely dictates the energy and the subsequent cost of doing this.

81
0:04:40.834,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I ask a question:

82
0:04:42.786,000 --> 0:04:44,000
How much energy do you think it takes

83
0:04:45.668,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to remove a million tons of CO2 from the air

84
0:04:49.433,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in a given year?

85
0:04:51.343,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The answer is: a power plant.

86
0:04:53.178,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It takes a power plant to capture CO2 directly from the air.

87
0:04:56.871,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Depending on which approach you choose,

88
0:04:58.779,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the power plant could be on the order of 300 to 500 megawatts.

89
0:05:03.847,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And you have to be careful about what kind of power plant you choose.

90
0:05:07.68,000 --> 0:05:08,000
If you choose coal,

91
0:05:09.381,000 --> 0:05:12,000
you end up emitting more CO2 than you capture.

92
0:05:13.509,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now let's talk about costs.

93
0:05:15.356,000 --> 0:05:18,000
An energy-intensive version of this technology

94
0:05:18.854,000 --> 0:05:21,000
could cost you as much as $1,000 a ton

95
0:05:21.969,000 --> 0:05:22,000
just to capture it.

96
0:05:24.183,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Let's translate that.

97
0:05:26.128,000 --> 0:05:3,000
If you were to take that very expensive CO2 and convert it to a liquid fuel,

98
0:05:30.167,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that comes out to 50 dollars a gallon.

99
0:05:33.179,000 --> 0:05:35,000
That's way too expensive; it's not feasible.

100
0:05:35.737,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So how could we bring these costs down?

101
0:05:38.172,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That's, in part, the work that I do.

102
0:05:41.771,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There's a company today, a commercial-scale company,

103
0:05:44.514,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that can do this as low as 600 dollars a ton.

104
0:05:47.227,000 --> 0:05:5,000
There are several other companies that are developing technologies

105
0:05:51.032,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that can do this even cheaper than that.

106
0:05:53.583,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

107
0:05:55.376,000 --> 0:05:56,000
about a few of these different companies.

108
0:05:57.373,000 --> 0:05:58,000
One is called Carbon Engineering.

109
0:05:59.065,000 --> 0:06:,000
They're based out of Canada.

110
0:06:00.557,000 --> 0:06:02,000
They use a liquid-based approach for separation

111
0:06:03.474,000 --> 0:06:07,000
combined with burning super-abundant, cheap natural gas

112
0:06:07.763,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to supply the heat required.

113
0:06:10.122,000 --> 0:06:11,000
They have a clever approach

114
0:06:11.83,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that allows them to co-capture the CO2 from the air

115
0:06:16.144,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and the CO2 that they generate from burning the natural gas.

116
0:06:20.127,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And so by doing this,

117
0:06:21.953,000 --> 0:06:24,000
they offset excess pollution and they reduce costs.

118
0:06:26.006,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Switzerland-based Climeworks and US-based Global Thermostat

119
0:06:30.076,000 --> 0:06:31,000
use a different approach.

120
0:06:31.703,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They use solid materials for capture.

121
0:06:34.336,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Climeworks uses heat from the earth,

122
0:06:37.143,000 --> 0:06:38,000
or geothermal,

123
0:06:38.58,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or even excess steam from other industrial processes

124
0:06:41.716,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to cut down on pollution and costs.

125
0:06:44.759,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Global Thermostat takes a different approach.

126
0:06:46.983,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They focus on the heat required

127
0:06:49.854,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and the speed in which it moves through the material

128
0:06:53.551,000 --> 0:06:57,000
so that they're able to release and produce that CO2

129
0:06:58.254,000 --> 0:06:59,000
at a really fast rate,

130
0:07:00.053,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which allows them to have a more compact design

131
0:07:03.432,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and overall cheaper costs.

132
0:07:06.806,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And there's more still.

133
0:07:08.724,000 --> 0:07:13,000
A synthetic forest has a significant advantage over a real forest: size.

134
0:07:14.899,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This next image that I'm showing you is a map of the Amazon rainforest.

135
0:07:18.732,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The Amazon is capable of capturing 1.6 billion tons of CO2 each year.

136
0:07:24.835,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This is the equivalent of roughly 25 percent

137
0:07:28.238,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of our annual emissions in the US.

138
0:07:31.007,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The land area required for a synthetic forest

139
0:07:33.966,000 --> 0:07:35,000
or a manufactured direct air capture plant

140
0:07:36.287,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to capture the same

141
0:07:37.743,000 --> 0:07:39,000
is 500 times smaller.

142
0:07:41.18,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In addition, for a synthetic forest,

143
0:07:44.251,000 --> 0:07:46,000
you don't have to build it on arable land,

144
0:07:47.14,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so there's no competition with farmland or food,

145
0:07:51.435,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and there's also no reason to have to cut down any real trees

146
0:07:56.453,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to do this.

147
0:07:58.57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I want to step back,

148
0:08:00.374,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and I want to bring up the concept of negative emissions again.

149
0:08:04.394,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Negative emissions require that the CO2 separated

150
0:08:07.987,000 --> 0:08:11,000
be permanently removed from the atmosphere forever,

151
0:08:12.398,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which means putting it back underground,

152
0:08:15.144,000 --> 0:08:17,000
where it came from in the first place.

153
0:08:17.537,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But let's face it, nobody gets paid to do that today --

154
0:08:21.1,000 --> 0:08:22,000
at least not enough.

155
0:08:23.009,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So the companies that are developing these technologies

156
0:08:26.521,000 --> 0:08:28,000
are actually interested in taking the CO2

157
0:08:29.022,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and making something useful out of it, a marketable product.

158
0:08:32.193,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It could be liquid fuels, plastics

159
0:08:35.797,000 --> 0:08:36,000
or even synthetic gravel.

160
0:08:38.043,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And don't get me wrong -- these carbon markets are great.

161
0:08:42.55,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But I also don't want you to be disillusioned.

162
0:08:45.292,000 --> 0:08:48,000
These are not large enough to solve our climate crisis,

163
0:08:49.045,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and so what we need to do is we need to actually think about

164
0:08:52.902,000 --> 0:08:53,000
what it could take.

165
0:08:54.403,000 --> 0:08:57,000
One thing I'll absolutely say is positive about the carbon markets

166
0:08:58.406,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is that they allow for new capture plants to be built,

167
0:09:03.022,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and with every capture plant built,

168
0:09:04.949,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we learn more.

169
0:09:06.425,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And when we learn more,

170
0:09:07.96,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we have an opportunity to bring costs down.

171
0:09:11.914,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But we also need to be willing to invest

172
0:09:15.465,000 --> 0:09:16,000
as a global society.

173
0:09:18.534,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We could have all of the clever thinking and technology in the world,

174
0:09:21.932,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but it's not going to be enough

175
0:09:23.591,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in order for this technology to have a significant impact on climate.

176
0:09:28.494,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We really need regulation,

177
0:09:30.7,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we need subsidies,

178
0:09:32.257,000 --> 0:09:34,000
taxes on carbon.

179
0:09:34.474,000 --> 0:09:38,000
There are a few of us that would absolutely be willing to pay more,

180
0:09:39.308,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but what will be required

181
0:09:41.726,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is for carbon-neutral, carbon-negative paths

182
0:09:44.443,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to be affordable for the majority of society

183
0:09:47.156,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in order to impact climate.

184
0:09:49.403,000 --> 0:09:51,000
In addition to those kinds of investments,

185
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
we also need investments in research and development.

186
0:09:55.632,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So what might that look like?

187
0:09:57.865,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In 1966, the US invested about a half a percent of gross domestic product

188
0:10:04.169,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in the Apollo program.

189
0:10:06.568,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It got people safely to the moon

190
0:10:09.444,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and back to the earth.

191
0:10:11.464,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Half a percent of GDP today is about 100 billion dollars.

192
0:10:15.522,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So knowing that direct air capture

193
0:10:18.275,000 --> 0:10:21,000
is one front in our fight against climate change,

194
0:10:21.502,000 --> 0:10:24,000
imagine that we could invest 20 percent, 20 billion dollars.

195
0:10:25.848,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Further, let's imagine that we could get the costs down

196
0:10:28.753,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to a 100 dollars a ton.

197
0:10:31.274,000 --> 0:10:34,000
That's going to be hard, but it's part of what makes my job fun.

198
0:10:35.897,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And so what does that look like,

199
0:10:37.462,000 --> 0:10:39,000
20 billion dollars,100 dollars a ton?

200
0:10:39.807,000 --> 0:10:42,000
That requires us to build 200 synthetic forests,

201
0:10:42.955,000 --> 0:10:47,000
each capable of capturing a million tons of CO2 per year.

202
0:10:48.665,000 --> 0:10:52,000
That adds up to about five percent of US annual emissions.

203
0:10:53.235,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It doesn't sound like much.

204
0:10:55.226,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Turns out, it's actually significant.

205
0:10:57.364,000 --> 0:11:,000
If you look at the emissions associated with long-haul trucking

206
0:11:00.842,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and commercial aircraft,

207
0:11:02.598,000 --> 0:11:04,000
they add up to about five percent.

208
0:11:05.458,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Our dependence on liquid fuels makes these emissions

209
0:11:09.147,000 --> 0:11:11,000
really difficult to avoid.

210
0:11:11.744,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So this investment could absolutely be significant.

211
0:11:17.496,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Now, what would it take in terms of land area to do this,

212
0:11:20.623,000 --> 0:11:21,000
200 plants?

213
0:11:22.406,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It turns out that they would take up about half the land area of Vancouver.

214
0:11:26.741,000 --> 0:11:28,000
That's if they were fueled by natural gas.

215
0:11:28.861,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But remember the downside of natural gas -- it also emits CO2.

216
0:11:33.557,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So if you use natural gas to do direct air capture,

217
0:11:36.478,000 --> 0:11:39,000
you only end up capturing about a third of what's intended,

218
0:11:40.263,000 --> 0:11:42,000
unless you have that clever approach of co-capture

219
0:11:42.85,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that Carbon Engineering does.

220
0:11:45.253,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And so if we had an alternative approach

221
0:11:47.456,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and used wind or solar to do this,

222
0:11:50.311,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the land area would be about 15 times larger,

223
0:11:53.923,000 --> 0:11:55,000
looking at the state of New Jersey now.

224
0:11:56.36,000 --> 0:11:59,000
One of the things that I think about in my work and my research

225
0:11:59.916,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is optimizing and figuring out where we should put these plants

226
0:12:03.865,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and think about the local resources available --

227
0:12:06.542,000 --> 0:12:09,000
whether it's land, water, cheap and clean electricity --

228
0:12:10.241,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because, for instance, you can use clean electricity

229
0:12:12.967,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to split water to produce hydrogen,

230
0:12:15.176,000 --> 0:12:18,000
which is an excellent, carbon-free replacement for natural gas,

231
0:12:19.081,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to supply the heat required.

232
0:12:22.212,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But I want us to reflect a little bit again on negative emissions.

233
0:12:26.42,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Negative emissions should not be considered a silver bullet,

234
0:12:29.997,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but they may help us if we continue to stall

235
0:12:32.524,000 --> 0:12:35,000
at cutting down on CO2 pollution worldwide.

236
0:12:36.441,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But that's also why we have to be careful.

237
0:12:39.499,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This approach is so alluring that it can even be risky,

238
0:12:42.5,000 --> 0:12:46,000
as some may cling onto it as some kind of total solution to our climate crisis.

239
0:12:47.982,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It may tempt people to continue to burn fossil fuels 24 hours a day,

240
0:12:53.461,000 --> 0:12:55,000
365 days a year.

241
0:12:55.659,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I argue that we should not see negative emissions

242
0:12:58.889,000 --> 0:12:59,000
as a replacement for stopping pollution,

243
0:13:00.841,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but rather, as an addition to an existing portfolio that includes everything,

244
0:13:06.636,000 --> 0:13:07,000
from increased energy efficiency

245
0:13:08.435,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to low-energy carbon

246
0:13:10.173,000 --> 0:13:11,000
to improved farming --

247
0:13:11.83,000 --> 0:13:16,000
will all collectively get us on a path to net-zero emissions one day.

248
0:13:17.909,000 --> 0:13:18,000
A little bit of self-reflection:

249
0:13:20.481,000 --> 0:13:22,000
my husband is an emergency physician.

250
0:13:23.727,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And I find myself amazed by the lifesaving work

251
0:13:27.296,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that he and his colleagues do each and every day.

252
0:13:31.235,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Yet when I talk to them about my work on carbon capture,

253
0:13:35.192,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I find that they're equally amazed,

254
0:13:37.896,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and that's because combatting climate change by capturing carbon

255
0:13:42.693,000 --> 0:13:44,000
isn't just about saving a polar bear

256
0:13:44.775,000 --> 0:13:45,000
or a glacier.

257
0:13:45.965,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It's about saving human lives.

258
0:13:49.905,000 --> 0:13:54,000
A synthetic forest may not ever be as pretty as a real one,

259
0:13:54.946,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but it could just enable us to preserve not only the Amazon,

260
0:13:58.589,000 --> 0:13:59,000
but all of the people

261
0:14:00.073,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that we love and cherish,

262
0:14:02.467,000 --> 0:14:06,000
as well as all of our future generations

263
0:14:07.153,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and modern civilization.

264
0:14:08.839,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Thank you.

265
0:14:10.016,000 --> 0:14:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.82,000 --> 0:00:15,000
An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine

2
0:00:17.06,000 --> 0:00:19,000
told the story of Clyde Murphy,

3
0:00:19.66,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a black man who was a member of the Class of 1970.

4
0:00:24.78,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Clyde was a success story.

5
0:00:28.14,000 --> 0:00:31,000
After Yale and a law degree from Columbia,

6
0:00:31.98,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Clyde spent the next 30 years

7
0:00:34.22,000 --> 0:00:37,000
as one of America's top civil rights lawyers.

8
0:00:38.1,000 --> 0:00:4,000
He was also a great husband and father.

9
0:00:41.9,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But despite his success,

10
0:00:44.66,000 --> 0:00:46,000
personally and professionally,

11
0:00:47.9,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Clyde's story had a sad ending.

12
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In 2010,

13
0:00:53.54,000 --> 0:00:54,000
at the age of 62,

14
0:00:56.46,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung.

15
0:01:01.94,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Clyde's experience was not unique.

16
0:01:06.54,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Many of his black classmates from Yale

17
0:01:09.42,000 --> 0:01:1,000
also died young.

18
0:01:11.9,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In fact, the magazine article indicated

19
0:01:16.139,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that 41 years after graduation from Yale,

20
0:01:19.86,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the black members of the Class of 1970

21
0:01:23.06,000 --> 0:01:26,000
had a death rate that was three times higher

22
0:01:26.34,000 --> 0:01:28,000
than that of the average class member.

23
0:01:30.5,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's stunning.

24
0:01:33.06,000 --> 0:01:35,000
America has recently awakened

25
0:01:36.5,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to a steady drumbeat

26
0:01:38.7,000 --> 0:01:41,000
of unarmed black men being shot by the police.

27
0:01:43.78,000 --> 0:01:46,000
What is even a bigger story

28
0:01:48.38,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is that every seven minutes,

29
0:01:51.5,000 --> 0:01:55,000
a black person dies prematurely in the United States.

30
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
That is over 200 black people

31
0:02:00.1,000 --> 0:02:02,000
die every single day

32
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who would not die if the health of blacks and whites were equal.

33
0:02:10.06,000 --> 0:02:11,000
For the last 25 years,

34
0:02:12.74,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I have been on a mission

35
0:02:14.7,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to understand why does race

36
0:02:17.5,000 --> 0:02:19,000
matter so profoundly for health.

37
0:02:21.579,000 --> 0:02:22,000
When I started my career,

38
0:02:23.38,000 --> 0:02:27,000
many believed that it was simply about racial differences

39
0:02:27.78,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in income and education.

40
0:02:30.3,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I discovered that while economic status matters for health,

41
0:02:36.02,000 --> 0:02:37,000
there is more to the story.

42
0:02:37.94,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So for example, if we look at life expectancy at age 25,

43
0:02:43.78,000 --> 0:02:48,000
at age 25 there's a five-year gap between blacks and whites.

44
0:02:48.9,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And the gap by education for both whites and blacks

45
0:02:52.86,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is even larger than the racial gap.

46
0:02:56.78,000 --> 0:03:,000
At the same time, at every level of education,

47
0:03:01.42,000 --> 0:03:03,000
whites live longer than blacks.

48
0:03:04.38,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So whites who are high school dropouts

49
0:03:06.7,000 --> 0:03:09,000
live 3.4 years longer than their black counterparts,

50
0:03:10.42,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and the gap is even larger

51
0:03:13.34,000 --> 0:03:14,000
among college graduates.

52
0:03:16.02,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Most surprising of all,

53
0:03:19.06,000 --> 0:03:22,000
whites who have graduated from high school

54
0:03:22.46,000 --> 0:03:25,000
live longer than blacks with a college degree

55
0:03:26.18,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or more education.

56
0:03:28.42,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So why does race matter so profoundly for health?

57
0:03:32.34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
What else is it beyond education and income

58
0:03:37.22,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that might matter?

59
0:03:39.86,000 --> 0:03:4,000
In the early 1990s,

60
0:03:42.34,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I was asked to review a new book

61
0:03:45.42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
on the health of black America.

62
0:03:48.02,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I was struck that almost every single one

63
0:03:51.14,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of its 25 chapters

64
0:03:53.42,000 --> 0:03:54,000
said that racism

65
0:03:55.22,000 --> 0:03:58,000
was a factor that was hurting the health of blacks.

66
0:03:59.18,000 --> 0:04:,000
All of these researchers

67
0:04:01.94,000 --> 0:04:05,000
were stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting blacks,

68
0:04:07.9,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but they provided no evidence.

69
0:04:10.38,000 --> 0:04:12,000
For me, that was not good enough.

70
0:04:13.78,000 --> 0:04:14,000
A few months later,

71
0:04:15.46,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I was speaking at a conference in Washington, DC,

72
0:04:18.42,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and I said that one of the priorities for research

73
0:04:21.62,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was to document the ways in which racism affected health.

74
0:04:26.7,000 --> 0:04:28,000
A white gentleman stood in the audience

75
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and said that while he agreed with me that racism was important,

76
0:04:34.06,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we could never measure racism.

77
0:04:36.7,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"We measure self-esteem," I said.

78
0:04:40.02,000 --> 0:04:41,000
"There's no reason

79
0:04:41.46,000 --> 0:04:44,000
why we can't measure racism if we put our minds to it."

80
0:04:45.54,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And so I put my mind to it

81
0:04:48.06,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and developed three scales.

82
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The first one captured major experiences of discrimination,

83
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
like being unfairly fired or being unfairly stopped by the police.

84
0:04:58.54,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But discrimination also occurs in more minor and subtle experiences,

85
0:05:03.86,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and so my second scale, called the Everyday Discrimination Scale,

86
0:05:07.82,000 --> 0:05:08,000
captures nine items

87
0:05:09.58,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that captures experiences

88
0:05:10.94,000 --> 0:05:13,000
like you're treated with less courtesy than others,

89
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you receive poorer service than others in restaurants or stores,

90
0:05:17.86,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or people act as if they're afraid of you.

91
0:05:21.06,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This scale captures

92
0:05:23.9,000 --> 0:05:26,000
ways in which the dignity and the respect

93
0:05:27.5,000 --> 0:05:29,000
of people who society does not value

94
0:05:30.46,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is chipped away on a daily basis.

95
0:05:33.78,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Research has found

96
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that higher levels of discrimination

97
0:05:40.14,000 --> 0:05:45,000
are associated with an elevated risk of a broad range of diseases

98
0:05:45.7,000 --> 0:05:48,000
from blood pressure to abdominal obesity

99
0:05:48.98,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to breast cancer to heart disease

100
0:05:51.66,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and even premature mortality.

101
0:05:55.34,000 --> 0:06:,000
Strikingly, some of the effects are observed at a very young age.

102
0:06:00.46,000 --> 0:06:04,000
For example, a study of black teens

103
0:06:05.94,000 --> 0:06:1,000
found that those who reported higher levels of discrimination as teenagers

104
0:06:12.94,000 --> 0:06:14,000
had higher levels of stress hormones,

105
0:06:17.34,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of blood pressure

106
0:06:19.3,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and of weight at age 20.

107
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
However,

108
0:06:27.74,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the stress of discrimination

109
0:06:30.3,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is only one aspect.

110
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Discrimination and racism

111
0:06:34.78,000 --> 0:06:38,000
also matters in other profound ways for health.

112
0:06:39.1,000 --> 0:06:42,000
For example, there's discrimination in medical care.

113
0:06:42.9,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine

114
0:06:47.22,000 --> 0:06:48,000
asked me to serve on a committee

115
0:06:49.18,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that found, concluded based on the scientific evidence,

116
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that blacks and other minorities

117
0:06:56.78,000 --> 0:06:58,000
receive poorer quality care than whites.

118
0:07:00.3,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This was true for all kinds of medical treatment,

119
0:07:04.18,000 --> 0:07:05,000
from the most simple

120
0:07:06.54,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to the most technologically sophisticated.

121
0:07:10.62,000 --> 0:07:13,000
One explanation for this pattern

122
0:07:13.66,000 --> 0:07:16,000
was a phenomenon that's called "implicit bias"

123
0:07:17.62,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or "unconscious discrimination."

124
0:07:19.94,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Research for decades by social psychologists

125
0:07:22.78,000 --> 0:07:25,000
indicates that if you hold a negative stereotype

126
0:07:26.3,000 --> 0:07:29,000
about a group in your subconscious mind

127
0:07:29.38,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and you meet someone from that group,

128
0:07:32.1,000 --> 0:07:34,000
you will discriminate against that person.

129
0:07:34.42,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You will treat them differently.

130
0:07:36.1,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's an unconscious process. It's an automatic process.

131
0:07:40.74,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It is a subtle process, but it's normal

132
0:07:43.94,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and it occurs even among the most well-intentioned individuals.

133
0:07:51.1,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But the deeper that I delved

134
0:07:54.14,000 --> 0:07:56,000
into the health impact of racism,

135
0:07:57.18,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the more insidious the effects became.

136
0:08:00.98,000 --> 0:08:02,000
There is institutional discrimination,

137
0:08:04.42,000 --> 0:08:06,000
which refers to discrimination

138
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that exists in the processes of social institutions.

139
0:08:12.22,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Residential segregation by race,

140
0:08:14.58,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which has led to blacks and whites living in very different neighborhood contexts,

141
0:08:19.58,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is a classic example of institutional racism.

142
0:08:24.94,000 --> 0:08:27,000
One of America's best-kept secrets

143
0:08:28.9,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is how residential segregation

144
0:08:31.1,000 --> 0:08:33,000
is the secret source

145
0:08:33.46,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that creates racial inequality in the United States.

146
0:08:38.62,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In America, where you live

147
0:08:41.58,000 --> 0:08:44,000
determines your access to opportunities

148
0:08:44.739,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in education, in employment,

149
0:08:48.06,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in housing and even in access to medical care.

150
0:08:53.46,000 --> 0:08:59,000
One study of the 171 largest cities in the United States

151
0:08:59.9,000 --> 0:09:02,000
concluded that there is not even one city

152
0:09:03.22,000 --> 0:09:06,000
where whites live under equal conditions to blacks,

153
0:09:06.58,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and that the worst urban contexts in which whites reside

154
0:09:10.54,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is considerably better than the average context of black communities.

155
0:09:15.74,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Another study found

156
0:09:17.46,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that if you could eliminate statistically

157
0:09:20.5,000 --> 0:09:21,000
residential segregation,

158
0:09:22.18,000 --> 0:09:26,000
you would completely erase black-white differences in income,

159
0:09:26.34,000 --> 0:09:28,000
education and unemployment,

160
0:09:28.86,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and reduce black-white differences in single motherhood

161
0:09:32.18,000 --> 0:09:33,000
by two thirds,

162
0:09:33.42,000 --> 0:09:35,000
all of that driven by segregation.

163
0:09:36.78,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I have also learned

164
0:09:38.86,000 --> 0:09:4,000
how the negative stereotypes

165
0:09:41.66,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and images of blacks in our culture

166
0:09:44.66,000 --> 0:09:47,000
literally create and sustain

167
0:09:47.7,000 --> 0:09:5,000
both institutional and individual discrimination.

168
0:09:52.46,000 --> 0:09:54,000
A group of researchers have put together a database

169
0:09:56.3,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that contains the books,

170
0:09:58.54,000 --> 0:10:01,000
magazines and articles

171
0:10:01.58,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that an average college-educated American would read over their lifetime.

172
0:10:06.3,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It allows us to look within this database

173
0:10:09.14,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and see how Americans have seen words paired together

174
0:10:14.5,000 --> 0:10:16,000
as they grow up in their society.

175
0:10:17.02,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So when the word "black" appears in American culture,

176
0:10:21.02,000 --> 0:10:23,000
what co-occurs with it?

177
0:10:23.1,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"Poor,"

178
0:10:24.54,000 --> 0:10:25,000
"violent,"

179
0:10:25.78,000 --> 0:10:26,000
"religious,"

180
0:10:27.14,000 --> 0:10:28,000
"lazy,"

181
0:10:28.38,000 --> 0:10:29,000
"cheerful,"

182
0:10:29.62,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"dangerous."

183
0:10:31.38,000 --> 0:10:32,000
When "white" occurs,

184
0:10:32.9,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the frequently co-occurring words

185
0:10:35.18,000 --> 0:10:36,000
are "wealthy,"

186
0:10:36.54,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"progressive,"

187
0:10:37.82,000 --> 0:10:38,000
"conventional,"

188
0:10:39.94,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"stubborn,"

189
0:10:41.18,000 --> 0:10:42,000
"successful,"

190
0:10:42.42,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"educated."

191
0:10:44.1,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So when a police officer

192
0:10:47.42,000 --> 0:10:51,000
overreacts when he sees an unarmed black male

193
0:10:53.06,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and perceives him to be violent and dangerous,

194
0:10:57.78,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we are not necessarily dealing with an inherently bad cop.

195
0:11:03.1,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We may be simply viewing

196
0:11:05.66,000 --> 0:11:07,000
a normal American

197
0:11:07.7,000 --> 0:11:1,000
who is reflecting what he has been exposed to

198
0:11:11.5,000 --> 0:11:13,000
as a result of being raised

199
0:11:13.94,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in this society.

200
0:11:15.9,000 --> 0:11:17,000
From my own experience,

201
0:11:19.66,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I believe that your race

202
0:11:22.3,000 --> 0:11:25,000
does not have to be a determinant of your destiny.

203
0:11:26.54,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I migrated to the United States

204
0:11:29.1,000 --> 0:11:31,000
from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia

205
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
in the late 1970s

206
0:11:34.66,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in pursuit of higher education,

207
0:11:37.82,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and in the last 40 years,

208
0:11:40.22,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I have done well.

209
0:11:42.1,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I have had a supportive family,

210
0:11:44.74,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I have worked hard,

211
0:11:47.06,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I have done well.

212
0:11:48.94,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But it took more for me to be successful.

213
0:11:52.42,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I received a minority fellowship from the University of Michigan.

214
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Yes. I am an affirmative action baby.

215
0:12:02.38,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Without affirmative action,

216
0:12:05.18,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I would not be here.

217
0:12:08.82,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But in the last 40 years,

218
0:12:11.38,000 --> 0:12:14,000
black America has been less successful than I have.

219
0:12:16.54,000 --> 0:12:21,000
In 1978, black households in the United States

220
0:12:21.86,000 --> 0:12:25,000
earned 59 cents for every dollar of income whites earned.

221
0:12:26.86,000 --> 0:12:28,000
In 2015,

222
0:12:29.14,000 --> 0:12:33,000
black families still earn 59 cents

223
0:12:34.02,000 --> 0:12:37,000
for every dollar of income that white families receive,

224
0:12:37.86,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and the racial gaps in wealth are even more stunning.

225
0:12:42.42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
For every dollar of wealth that whites have,

226
0:12:45.7,000 --> 0:12:48,000
black families have six pennies and Latinos have seven pennies.

227
0:12:50.62,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The fact is,

228
0:12:52.1,000 --> 0:12:53,000
racism

229
0:12:54.06,000 --> 0:12:58,000
is producing a truly rigged system

230
0:12:58.42,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that is systematically disadvantaging some racial groups in the United States.

231
0:13:04.7,000 --> 0:13:06,000
To paraphrase Plato,

232
0:13:06.9,000 --> 0:13:08,000
there is nothing so unfair

233
0:13:10.7,000 --> 0:13:13,000
as the equal treatment of unequal people.

234
0:13:15.34,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And that's why I am committed

235
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to working to dismantle racism.

236
0:13:21.78,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I deeply appreciate the fact

237
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that I am standing on the shoulders

238
0:13:27.54,000 --> 0:13:31,000
of those who have sacrificed even their lives to open the doors

239
0:13:31.9,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that I have walked through.

240
0:13:34.1,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I want to ensure that those doors remain open

241
0:13:38.02,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and that everyone can walk through those doors.

242
0:13:44.14,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Robert Kennedy said,

243
0:13:46.5,000 --> 0:13:49,000
"Each time a man" -- or woman, I would add --

244
0:13:50.06,000 --> 0:13:52,000
"stands up for an ideal

245
0:13:52.18,000 --> 0:13:54,000
or acts to improve the lot of others

246
0:13:54.78,000 --> 0:13:56,000
or strikes out against injustice,

247
0:13:57.38,000 --> 0:14:,000
he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope,

248
0:14:00.94,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and those ripples can build a current

249
0:14:04.06,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."

250
0:14:09.86,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I am optimistic today

251
0:14:11.94,000 --> 0:14:13,000
because all across America,

252
0:14:14.54,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I have seen ripples of hope.

253
0:14:17.54,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The Boston Medical Center

254
0:14:19.46,000 --> 0:14:21,000
has added lawyers to the medical team

255
0:14:22.98,000 --> 0:14:26,000
so that physicians can improve the health of their patients

256
0:14:27.06,000 --> 0:14:31,000
because the lawyers are addressing the nonmedical needs their patients have.

257
0:14:32.3,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Loma Linda University has built a gateway college

258
0:14:36.14,000 --> 0:14:37,000
in nearby San Bernardino

259
0:14:37.98,000 --> 0:14:4,000
so that in addition to delivering medical care,

260
0:14:41.3,000 --> 0:14:43,000
they can provide job skills

261
0:14:44.14,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and job training

262
0:14:45.82,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to a predominantly minority, low-income community members

263
0:14:50.62,000 --> 0:14:53,000
so that they will have the skills they need to get a decent job.

264
0:14:56.78,000 --> 0:14:58,000
In Chapel Hill, North Carolina,

265
0:14:59.18,000 --> 0:15:02,000
the Abecedarian Project has figured out

266
0:15:02.9,000 --> 0:15:07,000
how to ensure that they have lowered the risks for heart disease

267
0:15:08.22,000 --> 0:15:11,000
for blacks in their mid-30s

268
0:15:11.3,000 --> 0:15:14,000
by providing high-quality day care

269
0:15:14.34,000 --> 0:15:16,000
from birth to age five.

270
0:15:17.06,000 --> 0:15:2,000
In after-school centers across the United States,

271
0:15:20.38,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy

272
0:15:23.06,000 --> 0:15:25,000
is breaking the cycle of incarceration

273
0:15:25.86,000 --> 0:15:29,000
by providing high-quality academic enrichment and mentoring

274
0:15:30.3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to the children of prisoners

275
0:15:33.02,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and children who have fallen behind in school.

276
0:15:36.42,000 --> 0:15:37,000
In Huntsville, Alabama,

277
0:15:38.14,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Oakwood University,

278
0:15:39.58,000 --> 0:15:41,000
a historically black institution,

279
0:15:41.94,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is showing how we can improve the health of black adults

280
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
by including a health evaluation

281
0:15:49.3,000 --> 0:15:52,000
as a part of freshman orientation

282
0:15:52.46,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and giving those students the tools they need

283
0:15:55.46,000 --> 0:15:56,000
to make healthy choices

284
0:15:57.14,000 --> 0:16:,000
and providing them annually a health transcript

285
0:16:00.54,000 --> 0:16:01,000
so they can monitor their progress.

286
0:16:03.34,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And in Atlanta, Georgia,

287
0:16:05.1,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Purpose Built Communities has dismantled the negative effects of segregation

288
0:16:11.06,000 --> 0:16:13,000
by transforming a crime-ridden,

289
0:16:13.74,000 --> 0:16:15,000
drug-infested public housing project

290
0:16:16.7,000 --> 0:16:19,000
into an oasis of mixed-income housing,

291
0:16:20.42,000 --> 0:16:22,000
of academic performance,

292
0:16:22.62,000 --> 0:16:24,000
of great community wellness

293
0:16:25.5,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and of full employment.

294
0:16:27.98,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And finally,

295
0:16:29.7,000 --> 0:16:31,000
there is the Devine solution.

296
0:16:32.5,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Professor Patricia Devine

297
0:16:36.22,000 --> 0:16:38,000
of the University of Wisconsin

298
0:16:38.82,000 --> 0:16:41,000
has shown us how we can attack

299
0:16:42.54,000 --> 0:16:44,000
our hidden biases head on

300
0:16:45.54,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and effectively reduce them.

301
0:16:48.5,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Each one of us

302
0:16:50.3,000 --> 0:16:52,000
can be a ripple of hope.

303
0:16:53.02,000 --> 0:16:56,000
This work will not always be easy,

304
0:16:56.54,000 --> 0:16:58,000
but former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall

305
0:17:00.5,000 --> 0:17:02,000
has told us, "We must dissent.

306
0:17:03.42,000 --> 0:17:05,000
We must dissent from the indifference.

307
0:17:05.86,000 --> 0:17:07,000
We must dissent from the apathy.

308
0:17:07.94,000 --> 0:17:1,000
We must dissent from the hatred and from the mistrust.

309
0:17:11.42,000 --> 0:17:12,000
We must dissent

310
0:17:13.1,000 --> 0:17:16,000
because America can do better,

311
0:17:16.38,000 --> 0:17:2,000
because America has no choice but to do better."

312
0:17:21.22,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Thank you.

313
0:17:22.46,000 --> 0:17:25,000
(Applause)

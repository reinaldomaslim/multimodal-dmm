0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Let's imagine a sculptor building a statue,

3
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:17,000
just chipping away with his chisel.

4
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Michelangelo had this elegant way of describing it when he said,

5
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"Every block of stone has a statue inside of it,

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and it's the task of the sculptor to discover it."

7
0:00:27.28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But what if he worked in the opposite direction?

8
0:00:29.72,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Not from a solid block of stone,

9
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but from a pile of dust,

10
0:00:33.32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
somehow gluing millions of these particles together to form a statue.

11
0:00:37.72,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I know that's an absurd notion.

12
0:00:39.24,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's probably impossible.

13
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The only way you get a statue from a pile of dust

14
0:00:43.96,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is if the statue built itself --

15
0:00:46.32,000 --> 0:00:5,000
if somehow we could compel millions of these particles to come together

16
0:00:50.48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to form the statue.

17
0:00:52.32,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, as odd as that sounds,

18
0:00:53.88,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that is almost exactly the problem I work on in my lab.

19
0:00:58.04,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I don't build with stone,

20
0:00:59.48,000 --> 0:01:,000
I build with nanomaterials.

21
0:01:00.88,000 --> 0:01:04,000
They're these just impossibly small, fascinating little objects.

22
0:01:05.28,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They're so small that if this controller was a nanoparticle,

23
0:01:08.6,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a human hair would be the size of this entire room.

24
0:01:11.56,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And they're at the heart of a field we call nanotechnology,

25
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:15,000
which I'm sure we've all heard about,

26
0:01:16.239,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and we've all heard how it is going to change everything.

27
0:01:19.72,000 --> 0:01:2,000
When I was a graduate student,

28
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology.

29
0:01:24.6,000 --> 0:01:27,000
There were scientific breakthroughs happening all the time.

30
0:01:27.84,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The conferences were buzzing,

31
0:01:29.28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
there was tons of money pouring in from funding agencies.

32
0:01:32.76,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And the reason is

33
0:01:34.04,000 --> 0:01:35,000
when objects get really small,

34
0:01:35.88,000 --> 0:01:38,000
they're governed by a different set of physics that govern ordinary objects,

35
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:4,000
like the ones we interact with.

36
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We call this physics quantum mechanics.

37
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And what it tells you is that you can precisely tune their behavior

38
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:48,000
just by making seemingly small changes to them,

39
0:01:48.52,000 --> 0:01:5,000
like adding or removing a handful of atoms,

40
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
or twisting the material.

41
0:01:52.88,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's like this ultimate toolkit.

42
0:01:54.68,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You really felt empowered; you felt like you could make anything.

43
0:01:57.8,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And we were doing it --

44
0:01:59.08,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and by we I mean my whole generation of graduate students.

45
0:02:02.2,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We were trying to make blazing fast computers using nanomaterials.

46
0:02:05.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We were constructing quantum dots

47
0:02:07.36,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that could one day go in your body and find and fight disease.

48
0:02:10.76,000 --> 0:02:13,000
There were even groups trying to make an elevator to space

49
0:02:13.8,000 --> 0:02:14,000
using carbon nanotubes.

50
0:02:15.6,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You can look that up, that's true.

51
0:02:18.776,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Anyways, we thought it was going to affect

52
0:02:20.8,000 --> 0:02:23,000
all parts of science and technology, from computing to medicine.

53
0:02:23.92,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I have to admit,

54
0:02:25.2,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I drank all of the Kool-Aid.

55
0:02:27.2,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I mean, every last drop.

56
0:02:30.52,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But that was 15 years ago,

57
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and --

58
0:02:34.4,000 --> 0:02:36,000
fantastic science was done, really important work.

59
0:02:36.8,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We've learned a lot.

60
0:02:38.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We were never able to translate that science into new technologies --

61
0:02:42.48,000 --> 0:02:44,000
into technologies that could actually impact people.

62
0:02:45.28,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And the reason is, these nanomaterials --

63
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:48,000
they're like a double-edged sword.

64
0:02:49.2,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The same thing that makes them so interesting --

65
0:02:51.48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
their small size --

66
0:02:52.8,000 --> 0:02:54,000
also makes them impossible to work with.

67
0:02:55.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's literally like trying to build a statue out of a pile of dust.

68
0:02:58.88,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And we just don't have the tools that are small enough to work with them.

69
0:03:02.6,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But even if we did, it wouldn't really matter,

70
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because we couldn't one by one place millions of particles together

71
0:03:08.84,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to build a technology.

72
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So because of that,

73
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
all of the promise and all of the excitement

74
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
has remained just that: promise and excitement.

75
0:03:16.92,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We don't have any disease-fighting nanobots,

76
0:03:19.32,000 --> 0:03:21,000
there's no elevators to space,

77
0:03:21.4,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and the thing that I'm most interested in, no new types of computing.

78
0:03:25.12,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now that last one, that's a really important one.

79
0:03:27.68,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We just have come to expect

80
0:03:29.04,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the pace of computing advancements to go on indefinitely.

81
0:03:32.84,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We've built entire economies on this idea.

82
0:03:35.44,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And this pace exists

83
0:03:37.2,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because of our ability to pack more and more devices

84
0:03:39.68,000 --> 0:03:4,000
onto a computer chip.

85
0:03:41.4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And as those devices get smaller,

86
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:45,000
they get faster, they consume less power

87
0:03:45.52,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and they get cheaper.

88
0:03:46.96,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And it's this convergence that gives us this incredible pace.

89
0:03:51.56,000 --> 0:03:52,000
As an example:

90
0:03:52.8,000 --> 0:03:57,000
if I took the room-sized computer that sent three men to the moon and back

91
0:03:58.24,000 --> 0:04:,000
and somehow compressed it --

92
0:04:00.4,000 --> 0:04:03,000
compressed the world's greatest computer of its day,

93
0:04:03.68,000 --> 0:04:05,000
so it was the same size as your smartphone --

94
0:04:06.28,000 --> 0:04:07,000
your actual smartphone,

95
0:04:07.56,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that thing you spent 300 bucks on and just toss out every two years,

96
0:04:10.96,000 --> 0:04:12,000
would blow this thing away.

97
0:04:13.44,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You would not be impressed.

98
0:04:14.8,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It couldn't do anything that your smartphone does.

99
0:04:17.32,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It would be slow,

100
0:04:18.84,000 --> 0:04:2,000
you couldn't put any of your stuff on it,

101
0:04:21.04,000 --> 0:04:23,000
you could possibly get through the first two minutes

102
0:04:23.52,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of a "Walking Dead" episode if you're lucky --

103
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:26.76,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The point is the progress -- it's not gradual.

105
0:04:28.959,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The progress is relentless.

106
0:04:30.68,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's exponential.

107
0:04:31.959,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It compounds on itself year after year,

108
0:04:34.32,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to the point where if you compare a technology

109
0:04:36.52,000 --> 0:04:37,000
from one generation to the next,

110
0:04:38.24,000 --> 0:04:39,000
they're almost unrecognizable.

111
0:04:40.24,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we owe it to ourselves to keep this progress going.

112
0:04:42.88,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We want to say the same thing 10, 20, 30 years from now:

113
0:04:46.52,000 --> 0:04:48,000
look what we've done over the last 30 years.

114
0:04:49.2,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Yet we know this progress may not last forever.

115
0:04:51.96,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In fact, the party's kind of winding down.

116
0:04:54.04,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's like "last call for alcohol," right?

117
0:04:56.4,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If you look under the covers,

118
0:04:58.08,000 --> 0:05:,000
by many metrics like speed and performance,

119
0:05:00.68,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the progress has already slowed to a halt.

120
0:05:03.76,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So if we want to keep this party going,

121
0:05:05.92,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we have to do what we've always been able to do,

122
0:05:08.2,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and that is to innovate.

123
0:05:09.68,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So our group's role and our group's mission

124
0:05:12.28,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is to innovate by employing carbon nanotubes,

125
0:05:14.72,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because we think that they can provide a path to continue this pace.

126
0:05:18.8,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They are just like they sound.

127
0:05:20.28,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They're tiny, hollow tubes of carbon atoms,

128
0:05:22.76,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and their nanoscale size, that small size,

129
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:28,000
gives rise to these just outstanding electronic properties.

130
0:05:29.4,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And the science tells us if we could employ them in computing,

131
0:05:33.08,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we could see up to a ten times improvement in performance.

132
0:05:35.84,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's like skipping through several technology generations in just one step.

133
0:05:40.84,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So there we have it.

134
0:05:42.12,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We have this really important problem

135
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and we have what is basically the ideal solution.

136
0:05:46.56,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The science is screaming at us,

137
0:05:48.24,000 --> 0:05:5,000
"This is what you should be doing to solve your problem."

138
0:05:53.48,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So, all right, let's get started,

139
0:05:55.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
let's do this.

140
0:05:56.4,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But you just run right back into that double-edged sword.

141
0:05:59.12,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This "ideal solution" contains a material that's impossible to work with.

142
0:06:02.72,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I'd have to arrange billions of them just to make one single computer chip.

143
0:06:07.04,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It's that same conundrum, it's like this undying problem.

144
0:06:11.36,000 --> 0:06:12,000
At this point, we said, "Let's just stop.

145
0:06:13.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Let's not go down that same road.

146
0:06:15.32,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Let's just figure out what's missing.

147
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:18,000
What are we not dealing with?

148
0:06:19.32,000 --> 0:06:21,000
What are we not doing that needs to be done?"

149
0:06:21.48,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's like in "The Godfather," right?

150
0:06:23.28,000 --> 0:06:25,000
When Fredo betrays his brother Michael,

151
0:06:25.6,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we all know what needs to be done.

152
0:06:27.28,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Fredo's got to go.

153
0:06:28.64,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:29.68,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But Michael -- he puts it off.

155
0:06:31.64,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Fine, I get it.

156
0:06:32.88,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Their mother's still alive, it would make her upset.

157
0:06:35.36,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We just said,

158
0:06:36.8,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"What's the Fredo in our problem?"

159
0:06:39.12,000 --> 0:06:4,000
What are we not dealing with?

160
0:06:40.56,000 --> 0:06:41,000
What are we not doing,

161
0:06:42.12,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but needs to be done to make this a success?"

162
0:06:45.2,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And the answer is that the statue has to build itself.

163
0:06:49.28,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We have to find a way, somehow,

164
0:06:51.24,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to compel, to convince billions of these particles

165
0:06:55.36,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to assemble themselves into the technology.

166
0:06:58.36,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We can't do it for them. They have to do it for themselves.

167
0:07:01.56,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And it's the hard way, and this is not trivial,

168
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but in this case, it's the only way.

169
0:07:07.6,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, as it turns out, this is not that alien of a problem.

170
0:07:11.52,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We just don't build anything this way.

171
0:07:13.4,000 --> 0:07:15,000
People don't build anything this way.

172
0:07:15.44,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But if you look around -- and there's examples everywhere --

173
0:07:18.64,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Mother Nature builds everything this way.

174
0:07:21.56,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Everything is built from the bottom up.

175
0:07:24.24,000 --> 0:07:25,000
You can go to the beach,

176
0:07:25.52,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you'll find these simple organisms that use proteins --

177
0:07:28.72,000 --> 0:07:29,000
basically molecules --

178
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to template what is essentially sand,

179
0:07:32.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
just plucking it from the sea

180
0:07:33.52,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and building these extraordinary architectures with extreme diversity.

181
0:07:36.92,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And nature's not crude like us, just hacking away.

182
0:07:39.56,000 --> 0:07:4,000
She's elegant and smart,

183
0:07:41.28,000 --> 0:07:43,000
building with what's available, molecule by molecule,

184
0:07:44.04,000 --> 0:07:46,000
making structures with a complexity

185
0:07:46.2,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and a diversity that we can't even approach.

186
0:07:49.32,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And she's already at the nano.

187
0:07:51.04,000 --> 0:07:53,000
She's been there for hundreds of millions of years.

188
0:07:53.56,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We're the ones that are late to the party.

189
0:07:56.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
So we decided that we're going to use the same tool that nature uses,

190
0:08:00.32,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and that's chemistry.

191
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Chemistry is the missing tool.

192
0:08:03.48,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And chemistry works in this case

193
0:08:05.56,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because these nanoscale objects are about the same size as molecules,

194
0:08:09.4,000 --> 0:08:11,000
so we can use them to steer these objects around,

195
0:08:12.04,000 --> 0:08:13,000
much like a tool.

196
0:08:13.76,000 --> 0:08:15,000
That's exactly what we've done in our lab.

197
0:08:15.84,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We've developed chemistry that goes into the pile of dust,

198
0:08:19.04,000 --> 0:08:2,000
into the pile of nanoparticles,

199
0:08:20.56,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and pulls out exactly the ones we need.

200
0:08:22.96,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Then we can use chemistry to arrange literally billions of these particles

201
0:08:26.6,000 --> 0:08:28,000
into the pattern we need to build circuits.

202
0:08:29.48,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And because we can do that,

203
0:08:30.84,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we can build circuits that are many times faster

204
0:08:33.24,000 --> 0:08:36,000
than what anyone's been able to make using nanomaterials before.

205
0:08:36.48,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Chemistry's the missing tool,

206
0:08:37.92,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and every day our tool gets sharper and gets more precise.

207
0:08:41.56,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And eventually --

208
0:08:42.8,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and we hope this is within a handful of years --

209
0:08:45.44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we can deliver on one of those original promises.

210
0:08:48.84,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now, computing is just one example.

211
0:08:50.919,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's the one that I'm interested in, that my group is really invested in,

212
0:08:54.48,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but there are others in renewable energy, in medicine,

213
0:08:58.32,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in structural materials,

214
0:09:00.08,000 --> 0:09:03,000
where the science is going to tell you to move towards the nano.

215
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
That's where the biggest benefit is.

216
0:09:05.92,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But if we're going to do that,

217
0:09:07.4,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the scientists of today and tomorrow are going to need new tools --

218
0:09:10.6,000 --> 0:09:12,000
tools just like the ones I described.

219
0:09:12.76,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And they will need chemistry. That's the point.

220
0:09:16.64,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The beauty of science is that once you develop these new tools,

221
0:09:20.32,000 --> 0:09:21,000
they're out there.

222
0:09:21.6,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They're out there forever,

223
0:09:22.88,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and anyone anywhere can pick them up and use them,

224
0:09:25.76,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and help to deliver on the promise of nanotechnology.

225
0:09:29.32,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.

226
0:09:32.04,000 --> 0:09:34,000

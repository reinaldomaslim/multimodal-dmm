0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
starts with a conversation.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I would like to share with you

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
with too much time on my hands.

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me.

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there.

11
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that I built in my bedroom,

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
much to the dismay of my mother.

15
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
YB: To the dismay of my mother,

16
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.

17
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
FN: And I brought this all together,

19
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia --

20
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
also the U.S. and Japan.

21
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
YB: So, wind power, solar power -- we had a lot to talk about.

22
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We had a lot that got us excited.

23
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So we decided to do a special project together.

24
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
To combine engineering and design and ...

25
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful.

26
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
YB: And we made a baby.

27
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
FN: Can you bring out our baby?

29
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Applause)

30
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This baby is fully electric.

31
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It goes 150 miles an hour.

32
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.

33
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle

34
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.

35
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It's got an amazing user experience.

36
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.

37
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
He came up with our name and logo. We're Mission Motors.

38
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And we've only got three minutes,

39
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but we could talk about it for hours.

40
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
YB: Thank you.

41
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
FN: Thank you TED. And thank you Chris, for having us.

42
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Applause)

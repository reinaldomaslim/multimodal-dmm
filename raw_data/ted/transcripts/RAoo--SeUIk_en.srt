2
0:00:12.982,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is where I live. I live in Kenya,

3
0:00:15.756,000 --> 0:00:18,000
at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.

4
0:00:18.823,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Those are my dad's cows at the back,

5
0:00:20.811,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and behind the cows,

6
0:00:22.791,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that's the Nairobi National Park.

7
0:00:25.095,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,

8
0:00:28.6,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which means wild animals like zebras

9
0:00:32.062,000 --> 0:00:35,000
migrate out of the park freely.

10
0:00:35.983,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So predators like lions follow them,

11
0:00:39.996,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and this is what they do.

12
0:00:42.791,000 --> 0:00:45,000
They kill our livestock.

13
0:00:45.792,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This is one of the cows which was killed at night,

14
0:00:48.239,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,

15
0:00:52.279,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I felt so bad,

16
0:00:54.705,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because it was the only bull we had.

17
0:00:59.192,000 --> 0:01:01,000
My community, the Maasai, we believe that

18
0:01:01.979,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land

19
0:01:08.036,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for herding them, and that's why we value them so much.

20
0:01:11.811,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So I grew up hating lions so much.

21
0:01:15.57,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The morans are the warriors

22
0:01:18.623,000 --> 0:01:21,000
who protect our community and the livestock,

23
0:01:21.94,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and they're also upset about this problem.

24
0:01:25.019,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So they kill the lions.

25
0:01:28.024,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi.

26
0:01:31.938,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few.

27
0:01:36.477,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community

28
0:01:41.438,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is responsible for his dad's cows,

29
0:01:44.312,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and that's the same thing which happened to me.

30
0:01:47.442,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So I had to find a way of solving this problem.

31
0:01:50.857,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And the first idea I got was to use fire,

32
0:01:55.671,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because I thought lions were scared of fire.

33
0:01:59.464,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But I came to realize that that didn't really help,

34
0:02:04.183,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because it was even helping the lions

35
0:02:06.792,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to see through the cowshed.

36
0:02:10.303,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So I didn't give up. I continued.

37
0:02:13.632,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And a second idea I got was

38
0:02:16.272,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to use a scarecrow.

39
0:02:18.339,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I was trying to trick the lions

40
0:02:19.953,000 --> 0:02:21,000
[into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.

41
0:02:22.86,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But lions are very clever. (Laughter)

42
0:02:26.936,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,

43
0:02:31.382,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but the second day, they'll come and they say,

44
0:02:34.656,000 --> 0:02:37,000
this thing is not moving here, it's always here. (Laughter)

45
0:02:37.766,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So he jumps in and kills the animals.

46
0:02:41.003,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,

47
0:02:44.956,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and that day, the lions didn't come.

48
0:02:48.799,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.

49
0:02:53.357,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So I had an idea.

50
0:02:55.93,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Since I was a small boy,

51
0:02:58.24,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I used to work in my room for the whole day,

52
0:03:01.498,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I even took apart my mom's new radio,

53
0:03:04.604,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and that day she almost killed me,

54
0:03:06.422,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but I learned a lot about electronics. (Laughter)

55
0:03:12.676,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So I got an old car battery,

56
0:03:16.036,000 --> 0:03:19,000
an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,

57
0:03:19.826,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks.

58
0:03:24.877,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.

59
0:03:29.431,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight.

60
0:03:34.259,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So I set up everything.

61
0:03:37.14,000 --> 0:03:4,000
As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,

62
0:03:40.364,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and the battery supplies the power

63
0:03:42.485,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.

64
0:03:45.54,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And the indicator box makes the lights flash.

65
0:03:50.261,000 --> 0:03:53,000
As you can see, the bulbs face outside,

66
0:03:54.012,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because that's where the lions come from.

67
0:03:56.5,000 --> 0:04:,000
And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.

68
0:04:00.564,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The lights flash and trick

69
0:04:03.292,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,

70
0:04:05.234,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but I was sleeping in my bed.

71
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:09.9,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Applause)

73
0:04:11.569,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Thanks.

74
0:04:17.164,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So I set it up in my home two years ago,

75
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.

76
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea.

77
0:04:28.772,000 --> 0:04:3,000
One of them was this grandmother.

78
0:04:31.236,000 --> 0:04:35,000
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,

79
0:04:35.512,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and she asked me if I could put the lights for her.

80
0:04:37.646,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I said, "Yes."

81
0:04:38.924,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.

82
0:04:43.524,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community,

83
0:04:46.94,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they're really working.

84
0:04:49.165,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya

85
0:04:54.345,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,

86
0:04:59.458,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and it's also being used

87
0:05:01.693,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to scare elephants away from people's farms.

88
0:05:05.738,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship

89
0:05:08.778,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in one of the best schools in Kenya,

90
0:05:11.428,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Brookhouse International School,

91
0:05:13.335,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and I'm really excited about this.

92
0:05:16.262,000 --> 0:05:19,000
My new school now is coming in and helping

93
0:05:20.112,000 --> 0:05:24,000
by fundraising and creating an awareness.

94
0:05:24.644,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I even took my friends back to my community,

95
0:05:29.927,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and we're installing the lights to the homes

96
0:05:33.124,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them.

97
0:05:37.773,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland

98
0:05:41.67,000 --> 0:05:42,000
herding my father's cows,

99
0:05:43.344,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I used to see planes flying over,

100
0:05:46.298,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.

101
0:05:50.509,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And here I am today.

102
0:05:53.597,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.

103
0:05:59.533,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.

104
0:06:04.969,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I used to hate lions, but now because my invention

105
0:06:08.663,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is saving my father's cows and the lions,

106
0:06:11.981,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.

107
0:06:15.681,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much.

108
0:06:18.901,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Applause)

109
0:06:33.381,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is

110
0:06:35.682,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to hear a story like yours.

111
0:06:37.793,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep.

112
0:06:39.829,000 --> 0:06:41,000
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.

113
0:06:42.406,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What's the next one on your list?

114
0:06:44.264,000 --> 0:06:46,000
RT: My next invention is,

115
0:06:46.938,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?

116
0:06:49.52,000 --> 0:06:51,000
RT: But I know electric fences are already invented,

117
0:06:51.681,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but I want to make mine.

118
0:06:53.918,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

119
0:06:56.009,000 --> 0:06:59,000
CA: You already tried it once, right, and you --RT: I tried it before,

120
0:06:59.179,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but I stopped because it gave me a shock. (Laughter)

121
0:07:05.936,000 --> 0:07:08,000
CA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.

122
0:07:09.262,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.

123
0:07:12.23,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Thank you so much.RT: Thank you. (Applause)

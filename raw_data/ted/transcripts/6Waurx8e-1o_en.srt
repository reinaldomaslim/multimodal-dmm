1
0:00:16.188,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I decided when I was asked to do this

2
0:00:18.069,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend, Richard Feynman.

3
0:00:21.791,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and enjoyed his presence.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I'm going to tell you about the Richard Feynman that I knew.

6
0:00:30.787,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm sure there are people here who could tell you

7
0:00:33.11,000 --> 0:00:34,000
about the Richard Feynman they knew,

8
0:00:34.851,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman.

9
0:00:37.4,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Richard Feynman was a very complex man.

10
0:00:39.407,000 --> 0:00:4,000
He was a man of many, many parts.

11
0:00:41.724,000 --> 0:00:45,000
He was, of course, foremost, a very, very, very great scientist.

12
0:00:47.058,000 --> 0:00:49,000
He was an actor. You saw him act.

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I also had the good fortune to be in those lectures,

14
0:00:52.942,000 --> 0:00:53,000
up in the balcony.

15
0:00:54.796,000 --> 0:00:55,000
They were fantastic.

16
0:00:57.145,000 --> 0:00:58,000
He was a philosopher.

17
0:00:58.891,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He was a drum player.

18
0:01:00.085,000 --> 0:01:01,000
He was a teacher par excellence.

19
0:01:03.743,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Richard Feynman was also a showman,

20
0:01:06.424,000 --> 0:01:07,000
an enormous showman.

21
0:01:08.011,000 --> 0:01:1,000
He was brash, irreverent.

22
0:01:11.446,000 --> 0:01:15,000
He was full of macho, a kind of macho one-upmanship.

23
0:01:16.715,000 --> 0:01:19,000
He loved intellectual battle.

24
0:01:20.665,000 --> 0:01:22,000
He had a gargantuan ego.

25
0:01:24.417,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But the man had, somehow,

26
0:01:27.917,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a lot of room at the bottom.

27
0:01:30.393,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And what I mean by that is a lot of room, in my case --

28
0:01:35.147,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I can't speak for anybody else, but in my case --

29
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
a lot of room for another big ego.

30
0:01:41.563,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Well, not as big as his,

31
0:01:42.977,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but fairly big.

32
0:01:46.15,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I always felt good with Dick Feynman.

33
0:01:48.396,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It was always fun to be with him.

34
0:01:50.846,000 --> 0:01:51,000
He always made me feel smart.

35
0:01:53.013,000 --> 0:01:55,000
How can somebody like that make you feel smart?

36
0:01:55.244,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Somehow he did.

37
0:01:56.434,000 --> 0:01:58,000
He made me feel smart. He made me feel he was smart.

38
0:01:58.918,000 --> 0:01:59,000
He made me feel we were both smart,

39
0:02:00.893,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and the two of us could solve any problem whatever.

40
0:02:05.343,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And in fact, we did sometimes do physics together.

41
0:02:08.375,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We never published a paper together,

42
0:02:10.444,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but we did have a lot of fun.

43
0:02:14.02,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He loved to win,

44
0:02:15.939,000 --> 0:02:17,000
win these little macho games we would sometimes play.

45
0:02:18.663,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And he didn't only play them with me, but with all sorts of people.

46
0:02:21.951,000 --> 0:02:22,000
He would almost always win.

47
0:02:23.812,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But when he didn't win, when he lost,

48
0:02:26.899,000 --> 0:02:28,000
he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun

49
0:02:29.56,000 --> 0:02:3,000
as if he had won.

50
0:02:31.591,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I remember once he told me a story

51
0:02:33.763,000 --> 0:02:34,000
about a joke the students played on him.

52
0:02:36.152,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I think it was for his birthday --

53
0:02:38.713,000 --> 0:02:39,000
they took him for lunch

54
0:02:40.154,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to a sandwich place in Pasadena.

55
0:02:44.796,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It may still exist; I don't know.

56
0:02:46.844,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Celebrity sandwiches was their thing.

57
0:02:49.45,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.

58
0:02:51.814,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich.

59
0:02:54.633,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The students went there in advance,

60
0:02:56.839,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and arranged that they'd all order Feynman sandwiches.

61
0:03:00.261,000 --> 0:03:02,000
One after another, they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches.

62
0:03:03.272,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Feynman loved this story.

63
0:03:04.524,000 --> 0:03:08,000
He told me this story, and he was really happy and laughing.

64
0:03:08.582,000 --> 0:03:1,000
When he finished the story, I said to him,

65
0:03:11.356,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"Dick, I wonder what would be the difference

66
0:03:14.243,000 --> 0:03:16,000
between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich."

67
0:03:17.751,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And without skipping a beat at all,

68
0:03:19.79,000 --> 0:03:22,000
he said, "Well, they'd be about the same.

69
0:03:23.056,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham."

70
0:03:26.402,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Ham" as in bad actor.

71
0:03:28.111,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:29.659,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Well, I happened to have been very quick that day,

73
0:03:33.093,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I said, "Yeah, but a lot less baloney."

74
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:38.238,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Applause)

76
0:03:39.399,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The truth of the matter

77
0:03:42.605,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham,

78
0:03:46.611,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but absolutely no baloney.

79
0:03:50.905,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What Feynman hated worse than anything else

80
0:03:53.202,000 --> 0:03:55,000
was intellectual pretense --

81
0:03:55.228,000 --> 0:03:56,000
phoniness,

82
0:03:56.481,000 --> 0:03:58,000
false sophistication, jargon.

83
0:04:00.21,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I remember sometime during the mid-'80s,

84
0:04:04.502,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times

85
0:04:08.66,000 --> 0:04:11,000
up in San Francisco -- at some very rich guy's house --

86
0:04:11.849,000 --> 0:04:13,000
up in San Francisco for dinner.

87
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And the last time the rich guy invited us,

88
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
he also invited a couple of philosophers.

89
0:04:18.42,000 --> 0:04:2,000
These guys were philosophers of mind.

90
0:04:20.972,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness.

91
0:04:24.36,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And they were full of all kinds of jargon.

92
0:04:27.074,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I'm trying to remember the words --

93
0:04:29.494,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"monism," "dualism," categories all over the place.

94
0:04:33.408,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I didn't know what those meant, neither did Dick or Sydney, for that matter.

95
0:04:37.006,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And what did we talk about?

96
0:04:38.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Well, what do you talk about when you talk about minds?

97
0:04:41.399,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There's one obvious thing to talk about:

98
0:04:43.587,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Can a machine become a mind?

99
0:04:45.838,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Can you build a machine

100
0:04:47.591,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that thinks like a human being that is conscious?

101
0:04:51.101,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We sat around and talked about this -- we of course never resolved it.

102
0:04:54.455,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But the trouble with the philosophers

103
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is that they were philosophizing

104
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
when they should have been science-ophizing.

105
0:05:01.048,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's a scientific question, after all.

106
0:05:03.412,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And this was a very, very dangerous thing to do

107
0:05:06.343,000 --> 0:05:07,000
around Dick Feynman.

108
0:05:07.796,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:10.538,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Feynman let them have it -- both barrels, right between the eyes.

110
0:05:13.757,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It was brutal; it was funny -- ooh, it was funny.

111
0:05:16.852,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But it was really brutal.

112
0:05:18.589,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He really popped their balloon.

113
0:05:21.325,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But the amazing thing was -- Feynman had to leave a little early;

114
0:05:24.849,000 --> 0:05:27,000
he wasn't feeling too well, so he left a little bit early.

115
0:05:27.975,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers.

116
0:05:30.893,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And the amazing thing is these guys were flying.

117
0:05:33.907,000 --> 0:05:34,000
They were so happy.

118
0:05:36.088,000 --> 0:05:38,000
They had met the great man;

119
0:05:38.366,000 --> 0:05:4,000
they had been instructed by the great man;

120
0:05:40.818,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they had an enormous amount of fun

121
0:05:42.783,000 --> 0:05:44,000
having their faces shoved in the mud ...

122
0:05:46.135,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And it was something special.

123
0:05:48.618,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman,

124
0:05:52.031,000 --> 0:05:55,000
even when he did what he did.

125
0:05:58.674,000 --> 0:06:,000
Dick -- he was my friend; I did call him Dick --

126
0:06:01.372,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Dick and I had a little bit of a rapport.

127
0:06:04.082,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had.

128
0:06:06.98,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We liked each other; we liked the same kind of things.

129
0:06:09.627,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I also like the intellectual macho games.

130
0:06:13.538,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Sometimes I would win, mostly he would win,

131
0:06:15.642,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but we both enjoyed them.

132
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And Dick became convinced at some point

133
0:06:19.674,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality.

134
0:06:24.486,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I don't think he was right.

135
0:06:25.964,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I think the only point of similarity between us

136
0:06:28.207,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is we both like to talk about ourselves.

137
0:06:30.429,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But he was convinced of this.

138
0:06:33.294,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And the man was incredibly curious.

139
0:06:36.372,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And he wanted to understand what it was and why it was

140
0:06:40.07,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that there was this funny connection.

141
0:06:43.634,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And one day, we were walking.

142
0:06:45.342,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We were in France, in Les Houches.

143
0:06:47.192,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We were up in the mountains, 1976.

144
0:06:50.84,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And Feynman said to me, "Leonardo ..."

145
0:06:55.122,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The reason he called me "Leonardo" is because we were in Europe,

146
0:06:58.181,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and he was practicing his French.

147
0:06:59.856,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And he said, "Leonardo,

149
0:07:05.247,000 --> 0:07:08,000
were you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid?"

150
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I said, "Well, my real hero was my father.

151
0:07:13.317,000 --> 0:07:15,000
He was a working man,

152
0:07:15.492,000 --> 0:07:16,000
had a fifth-grade education.

153
0:07:17.635,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He was a master mechanic, and he taught me how to use tools.

154
0:07:20.483,000 --> 0:07:23,000
He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things.

155
0:07:24.475,000 --> 0:07:26,000
He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem.

156
0:07:26.53,000 --> 0:07:27,000
He didn't call it the hypotenuse,

157
0:07:28.507,000 --> 0:07:3,000
he called it the shortcut distance."

158
0:07:31.115,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And Feynman's eyes just opened up.

159
0:07:33.916,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He went off like a lightbulb.

160
0:07:36.271,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And he said that he had had

161
0:07:38.376,000 --> 0:07:41,000
basically exactly the same relationship with his father.

162
0:07:42.13,000 --> 0:07:45,000
In fact, he had been convinced at one time

163
0:07:45.574,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that to be a good physicist,

164
0:07:49.409,000 --> 0:07:52,000
it was very important to have had that kind of relationship

165
0:07:52.766,000 --> 0:07:53,000
with your father.

166
0:07:53.946,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I apologize for the sexist conversation here,

167
0:07:56.976,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but this is the way it really happened.

168
0:07:58.86,000 --> 0:08:01,000
He said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary,

169
0:08:02.681,000 --> 0:08:05,000
a necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist.

170
0:08:06.915,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Being Dick, he, of course, wanted to check this.

171
0:08:10.072,000 --> 0:08:12,000
He wanted to go out and do an experiment.

172
0:08:12.372,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

173
0:08:13.412,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Well, he did.

174
0:08:14.588,000 --> 0:08:15,000
He went out and did an experiment.

175
0:08:16.27,000 --> 0:08:18,000
He asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists,

176
0:08:19.209,000 --> 0:08:21,000
"Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you?"

177
0:08:21.578,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They were all men,

178
0:08:23.565,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and to a man, every single one of them said,

179
0:08:26.219,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"My mother."

180
0:08:27.467,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:30.558,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There went that theory, down the trash can of history.

182
0:08:34.582,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:35.71,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But he was very excited that he had finally met somebody

184
0:08:38.536,000 --> 0:08:41,000
who had the same experience with his father

185
0:08:42.156,000 --> 0:08:43,000
as he had with his father.

186
0:08:43.615,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And for some time, he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well.

187
0:08:47.764,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I don't know. Maybe. Who knows?

188
0:08:49.86,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist.

189
0:08:55.882,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Feynman's style -- no, "style" is not the right word.

190
0:08:59.86,000 --> 0:09:01,000
"Style" makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn,

191
0:09:02.729,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or the suit he was wearing.

192
0:09:04.054,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It's something much deeper than that,

193
0:09:05.997,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but I can't think of another word for it.

194
0:09:08.092,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Feynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest,

195
0:09:13.558,000 --> 0:09:16,000
most elementary solution to a problem that was possible.

196
0:09:17.497,000 --> 0:09:2,000
If it wasn't possible, you had to use something fancier.

197
0:09:21.729,000 --> 0:09:25,000
No doubt, part of this was his great joy and pleasure

198
0:09:26.325,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in showing people that he could think more simply than they could.

199
0:09:30.097,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But he also deeply believed, he truly believed,

200
0:09:33.28,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that if you couldn't explain something simply,

201
0:09:35.544,000 --> 0:09:36,000
you didn't understand it.

202
0:09:38.4,000 --> 0:09:41,000
In the 1950s, people were trying to figure out

203
0:09:41.677,000 --> 0:09:42,000
how superfluid helium worked.

204
0:09:44.573,000 --> 0:09:45,000
There was a theory.

205
0:09:45.773,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It was due to a Russian mathematical physicist.

206
0:09:48.208,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It was a complicated theory;

207
0:09:49.642,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I'll tell you what it was soon enough.

208
0:09:51.777,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It was a terribly complicated theory,

209
0:09:53.649,000 --> 0:09:55,000
full of very difficult integrals and formulas

210
0:09:56.51,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and mathematics and so forth.

211
0:09:58.86,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And it sort of worked, but it didn't work very well.

212
0:10:02.121,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The only way it worked

213
0:10:03.487,000 --> 0:10:06,000
is when the helium atoms were very, very far apart.

214
0:10:06.73,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And unfortunately,

215
0:10:09.467,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other.

216
0:10:12.649,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Feynman decided, as a sort of amateur helium physicist,

217
0:10:16.014,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that he would try to figure it out.

218
0:10:18.288,000 --> 0:10:2,000
He had an idea, a very clear idea.

219
0:10:20.716,000 --> 0:10:21,000
He would try to figure out

220
0:10:22.134,000 --> 0:10:27,000
what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like.

221
0:10:27.234,000 --> 0:10:28,000
He would try to visualize it,

222
0:10:28.905,000 --> 0:10:3,000
guided by a small number of simple principles.

223
0:10:31.86,000 --> 0:10:33,000
The small number of simple principles were very, very simple.

224
0:10:34.86,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other,

225
0:10:38.261,000 --> 0:10:39,000
they repel.

226
0:10:39.593,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero,

227
0:10:43.015,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other.

228
0:10:46.124,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The other fact is that in the ground state --

229
0:10:48.457,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the lowest energy state of a quantum system --

230
0:10:51.218,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the wave function is always very smooth;

231
0:10:54.513,000 --> 0:10:56,000
it has the minimum number of wiggles.

232
0:10:56.632,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So he sat down --

233
0:10:58.184,000 --> 0:11:,000
and I imagine he had nothing more

234
0:11:00.479,000 --> 0:11:02,000
than a simple piece of paper and a pencil --

235
0:11:02.916,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and he tried to write down, and did write down,

236
0:11:05.18,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the simplest function that he could think of,

237
0:11:07.499,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which had the boundary conditions

238
0:11:09.5,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that the wave function vanish when things touch

239
0:11:11.988,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and is smooth in between.

240
0:11:14.493,000 --> 0:11:16,000
He wrote down a simple thing -- so simple, in fact,

241
0:11:17.256,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that I suspect a really smart high-school student

242
0:11:20.407,000 --> 0:11:21,000
who didn't even have calculus

243
0:11:21.86,000 --> 0:11:22,000
could understand what he wrote down.

244
0:11:24.337,000 --> 0:11:27,000
The thing was, that simple thing that he wrote down

245
0:11:27.51,000 --> 0:11:3,000
explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium,

246
0:11:31.075,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and then some.

247
0:11:32.764,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I've always wondered whether the professionals --

248
0:11:35.765,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the real professional helium physicists --

249
0:11:37.85,000 --> 0:11:39,000
were just a little bit embarrassed by this.

250
0:11:40.422,000 --> 0:11:42,000
They had their super-powerful technique,

251
0:11:43.115,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and they couldn't do as well.

252
0:11:44.915,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Incidentally, I'll tell you what that super-powerful technique was.

253
0:11:49.066,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It was the technique of Feynman diagrams.

254
0:11:51.639,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

255
0:11:53.52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
He did it again in 1968.

256
0:11:56.781,000 --> 0:12:,000
In 1968, in my own university -- I wasn't there at the time --

257
0:12:01.791,000 --> 0:12:03,000
they were exploring the structure of the proton.

258
0:12:04.757,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles;

259
0:12:08.397,000 --> 0:12:09,000
this was more or less known.

260
0:12:10.782,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And the way to analyze it was, of course, Feynman diagrams.

261
0:12:14.142,000 --> 0:12:16,000
That's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for --

262
0:12:16.707,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to understand particles.

263
0:12:18.494,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The experiments that were going on were very simple:

264
0:12:21.13,000 --> 0:12:22,000
you simply take the proton,

265
0:12:22.489,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and you hit it really sharply with an electron.

266
0:12:25.123,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for.

267
0:12:28.251,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated.

268
0:12:32.338,000 --> 0:12:33,000
They're difficult integrals.

269
0:12:33.902,000 --> 0:12:36,000
If you could do all of them, you would have a very precise theory,

270
0:12:37.097,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but you couldn't -- they were just too complicated.

271
0:12:40.573,000 --> 0:12:41,000
People were trying to do them.

272
0:12:42.058,000 --> 0:12:44,000
You could do a one-loop diagram. Don't worry about one loop.

273
0:12:45.002,000 --> 0:12:48,000
One loop, two loops -- maybe you could do a three-loop diagram,

274
0:12:48.031,000 --> 0:12:5,000
but beyond that, you couldn't do anything.

275
0:12:50.109,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Feynman said, "Forget all of that.

276
0:12:51.777,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Just think of the proton

277
0:12:53.272,000 --> 0:12:57,000
as an assemblage, a swarm, of little particles."

278
0:12:57.629,000 --> 0:12:58,000
He called them "partons."

279
0:12:59.304,000 --> 0:13:04,000
He said, "Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast."

280
0:13:05.031,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Because they're moving real fast,

281
0:13:08.256,000 --> 0:13:12,000
relativity says the internal motions go very slow.

282
0:13:13.081,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The electron hits it suddenly --

283
0:13:14.717,000 --> 0:13:18,000
it's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton.

284
0:13:19.413,000 --> 0:13:2,000
What do you see?

285
0:13:20.592,000 --> 0:13:24,000
You see a frozen bunch of partons.

286
0:13:24.65,000 --> 0:13:25,000
They don't move,

287
0:13:25.856,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and because they don't move during the course of the experiment,

288
0:13:28.936,000 --> 0:13:3,000
you don't have to worry about how they're moving.

289
0:13:31.269,000 --> 0:13:33,000
You don't have to worry about the forces between them.

290
0:13:33.899,000 --> 0:13:38,000
You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons."

291
0:13:39.574,000 --> 0:13:42,000
This was the key to analyzing these experiments.

292
0:13:43.062,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Extremely effective.

293
0:13:46.247,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Somebody said the word "revolution" is a bad word.

294
0:13:48.773,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I suppose it is, so I won't say "revolution,"

295
0:13:50.938,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but it certainly evolved very, very deeply our understanding of the proton,

296
0:13:56.464,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and of particles beyond that.

297
0:13:58.63,000 --> 0:14:,000
Well, I had some more that I was going to tell you

298
0:14:01.272,000 --> 0:14:02,000
about my connection with Feynman,

299
0:14:02.953,000 --> 0:14:03,000
what he was like,

300
0:14:04.151,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but I see I have exactly half a minute.

301
0:14:06.479,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So I think I'll just finish up by saying:

302
0:14:10.43,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event.

303
0:14:13.25,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I think he would have said, "I don't need this."

304
0:14:18.142,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But ...

305
0:14:19.316,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Laughter)

306
0:14:20.348,000 --> 0:14:21,000
How should we honor Feynman?

307
0:14:21.73,000 --> 0:14:22,000
How should we really honor Feynman?

308
0:14:23.436,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I think the answer is we should honor Feynman

309
0:14:26.604,000 --> 0:14:29,000
by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches

310
0:14:30.59,000 --> 0:14:31,000
as we can.

311
0:14:32.201,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Thank you.

312
0:14:33.376,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Applause)

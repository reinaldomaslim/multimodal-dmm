Corey Hajim: Hi, Chris, how are you?

3
0:00:14.5,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Chris Anderson: I'm very well, Corey,

4
0:00:16.333,000 --> 0:00:18,000
it's absolutely lovely to see you.

5
0:00:18.542,000 --> 0:00:19,000
CH: It's great to see you, too.

6
0:00:20.208,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:21.583,000 --> 0:00:26,000
CA: Somehow, you're always smiling, no matter how dangerous, weird,

8
0:00:26.875,000 --> 0:00:27,000
crazy things are.

9
0:00:28.208,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Thank you for that.

10
0:00:29.5,000 --> 0:00:31,000
CH: You don't see me in the other room crying afterwards,

11
0:00:32.208,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but we'll leave that for the other [unclear].

12
0:00:34.583,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So Chris, this is week three of these conversations,

13
0:00:37.708,000 --> 0:00:41,000
how are you thinking about the people we should be speaking with?

14
0:00:43.124,000 --> 0:00:45,000
CA: I mean, there are so many aspects to this, right?

15
0:00:45.625,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There's understanding the basic pandemic itself

16
0:00:47.917,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and all the science around that.

17
0:00:50.25,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There's the psychology that we're all going through, the mindset.

18
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And we've had speakers addressing both of these.

19
0:00:57.417,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And then I think increasingly,

20
0:00:58.917,000 --> 0:01:,000
the conversation is going to be "what now?"

21
0:01:01.458,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"How do we dig ourselves out of this?

22
0:01:04.292,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What's the way forward?"

23
0:01:06.75,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And there's a couple of speakers this week focused on that.

24
0:01:09.583,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And I think it's --

25
0:01:11.5,000 --> 0:01:12,000
These conversations are incredibly rich,

26
0:01:13.458,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because I think one of the things

27
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that people have got growing consensus on

28
0:01:19.083,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is that step one, we kind of get, right?

29
0:01:22.125,000 --> 0:01:23,000
You shut things down,

30
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
physically distance in whatever way you can,

31
0:01:27.208,000 --> 0:01:29,000
different countries have gone about it slightly differently,

32
0:01:30.083,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but basically that "flattens the curve,"

33
0:01:32.458,000 --> 0:01:33,000
ultimately,

34
0:01:35.542,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the number of cases, the number of infections slows down.

35
0:01:38.542,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And, but then what?

36
0:01:40.667,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Because you can't go back to life as normal,

37
0:01:44.042,000 --> 0:01:45,000
when you're living at home completely.

38
0:01:45.917,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You could do some things, but you can't.

39
0:01:47.958,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And so that's what we're going to talk about today.

40
0:01:51.5,000 --> 0:01:56,000
CH: Right, it feels really hopeful to talk about some actions we can take

41
0:01:57.083,000 --> 0:02:,000
besides just staying away from everybody else.

42
0:02:00.167,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So, well, I guess I'll pass it over to you to introduce the speaker,

43
0:02:04.083,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I will come back a little bit later

44
0:02:06.125,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to share some questions from our audience.

45
0:02:08.292,000 --> 0:02:11,000
CA: Thanks so much, Corey, see you again in a bit.

46
0:02:11.417,000 --> 0:02:12,000
CH: Thank you.

47
0:02:12.708,000 --> 0:02:14,000
CA: And yes, if you know anyone out there

48
0:02:15.5,000 --> 0:02:21,000
who has just got stuck on, "But how do people get back to work?"

49
0:02:21.75,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"Where do we go from here?"

50
0:02:24.625,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Those are the people who you should,

51
0:02:26.375,000 --> 0:02:28,000
maybe invite them into this conversation right now,

52
0:02:28.833,000 --> 0:02:3,000
because I think they're going to be really interested.

53
0:02:31.667,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Our speaker, our guest

54
0:02:34.625,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is a professor at Harvard, Danielle Allen.

55
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
She runs, among other things,

56
0:02:40.833,000 --> 0:02:44,000
she runs an institute for ethics there, the Safra institute.

57
0:02:44.958,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And fundamentally, she's thinking about the ethical questions

58
0:02:49.375,000 --> 0:02:5,000
about what's happening here,

59
0:02:50.75,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but she has pulled together an extraordinary multidisciplinary team

60
0:02:54.792,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of economists, business leaders and others

61
0:02:58.458,000 --> 0:03:,000
who have put together a plan,

62
0:03:00.583,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I've been obsessed with this whole thing

63
0:03:02.667,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and how we find our way out.

64
0:03:04.917,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This plan is as compelling a plan as I've seen anywhere.

65
0:03:09.833,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So let's dig into it without further ado,

66
0:03:12.708,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Danielle Allen, welcome here to TED Connects.

67
0:03:17.458,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Danielle Allen: Thank you, Chris, happy to be here.

68
0:03:19.875,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I'm really, really grateful to have the chance

69
0:03:22.042,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to have this conversation with you.

70
0:03:24.5,000 --> 0:03:26,000
CA: It's -- It's so good,

71
0:03:26.917,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I just enjoyed our conversation over the last couple of days.

72
0:03:31.375,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is such a complex problem.

73
0:03:33.958,000 --> 0:03:36,000
What I kind of want you to do is just go through it step-by-step,

74
0:03:37.042,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to see the logic

75
0:03:39.708,000 --> 0:03:41,000
of what it is that your team are putting forward.

76
0:03:42.333,000 --> 0:03:44,000
First of all --

77
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Just the problem itself of how we get the economy going again,

78
0:03:50.417,000 --> 0:03:52,000
just talk a bit about what's at stake there,

79
0:03:52.625,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because sometimes this is framed as

80
0:03:54.792,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"The economy? Who cares about the economy?

81
0:03:56.833,000 --> 0:03:57,000
People's lives are at stake.

82
0:03:58.458,000 --> 0:04:,000
So let's just focus on that, don't worry about the economy."

83
0:04:01.375,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But it's not as simple as that.

84
0:04:02.958,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I mean, as an ethicist,

85
0:04:04.292,000 --> 0:04:06,000
what's at stake if we don't restart the economy somehow?

86
0:04:08.375,000 --> 0:04:1,000
DA: Well we have to recognize that we've actually faced

87
0:04:11.042,000 --> 0:04:13,000
two existential threats simultaneously.

88
0:04:13.583,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The first was to the public health system.

89
0:04:15.875,000 --> 0:04:18,000
If the virus had been allowed to unfold unimpeded,

90
0:04:19.167,000 --> 0:04:21,000
our public health systems would have collapsed

91
0:04:21.375,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and that would have produced a whole legitimacy crisis

92
0:04:23.923,000 --> 0:04:24,000
for our public institutions.

93
0:04:25.333,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So of course we shut down, we had to do that,

94
0:04:27.5,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it was a necessary self-defense action

95
0:04:29.75,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that has, however, really devastated the economy.

96
0:04:33.125,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And that is also an existential threat,

97
0:04:35.007,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we can't actually endure a closed economy

98
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
over a duration of 12 to 18 months.

99
0:04:40.167,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Nor can we really endure a situation

100
0:04:42.042,000 --> 0:04:45,000
where we don't know whether we might have another two to three months

101
0:04:45.333,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of extensive social distancing.

102
0:04:46.917,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So we really need an integrated strategy,

103
0:04:49.375,000 --> 0:04:51,000
one that recognizes both of these existential threats

104
0:04:51.958,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and finds a way to control the disease

105
0:04:53.917,000 --> 0:04:55,000
at the same that we can keep the economy open.

106
0:04:56.75,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We call that combination of controlling the disease

107
0:04:59.208,000 --> 0:05:,000
while keeping the economy open

108
0:05:00.708,000 --> 0:05:01,000
pandemic resilience.

109
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We think that's what we should be aiming for.

110
0:05:04.917,000 --> 0:05:05,000
CA: So people who aren't moved

111
0:05:06.375,000 --> 0:05:08,000
by the notion of the economy, capitalism, whatever,

112
0:05:09.333,000 --> 0:05:12,000
think instead about the millions and millions of jobs that were lost,

113
0:05:12.667,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the people who are desperate to make money.

114
0:05:15.083,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And I guess the lives that will be lost unless we solve this problem.

115
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
DA: Absolutely, the economy is one of the foundational pillars

116
0:05:23.125,000 --> 0:05:26,000
for a healthy society with opportunity and with justice.

117
0:05:26.417,000 --> 0:05:28,000
You can't have a just society either,

118
0:05:28.583,000 --> 0:05:31,000
if you haven't secured a just and functioning economy

119
0:05:31.708,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that delivers well-being for people.

120
0:05:33.917,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So all we have to do is remember back to 2008,

121
0:05:36.375,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and think about the impacts on things like suicide and depression

122
0:05:39.5,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and so forth, that flowed from that recession,

123
0:05:41.708,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so the economy is a public health concern

124
0:05:44.333,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in the same way that the virus is a public health concern.

125
0:05:47.792,000 --> 0:05:51,000
CA: OK, so talk about why this is such an intractable problem.

126
0:05:52.125,000 --> 0:05:53,000
People isolate,

127
0:05:53.5,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in many countries in the world now you're starting to see the cases flatten

128
0:05:57.083,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and in many cases decrease.

129
0:05:59.958,000 --> 0:06:,000
It looks like,

130
0:06:01.375,000 --> 0:06:04,000
whether it's happened now in your country or not,

131
0:06:05.292,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that will happen sooner or later.

132
0:06:06.958,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So why isn't that problem solved,

133
0:06:08.917,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we've beaten the virus, let's get back to work?

134
0:06:12.333,000 --> 0:06:13,000
DA: That's a great question

135
0:06:13.667,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and it really speaks to how new the experience for us is

136
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to encounter a novel virus.

137
0:06:18.667,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It just really hasn't happened to our society in a very, very long time.

138
0:06:22.5,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So we are what's called the susceptible population,

139
0:06:25.083,000 --> 0:06:28,000
meaning not any of us at the beginning of this had immunity.

140
0:06:28.458,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We were all susceptible to catching the disease.

141
0:06:31.917,000 --> 0:06:32,000
For a society to be safe,

142
0:06:33.292,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it needs to have what's called herd immunity.

143
0:06:35.458,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You could achieve that through vaccination

144
0:06:37.5,000 --> 0:06:38,000
or through people getting the disease.

145
0:06:39.334,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But it takes 50 to 67 percent of the population to get the disease

146
0:06:43.167,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in order to achieve that level of protection.

147
0:06:45.875,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We don't expect a vaccine anytime in the next 12 months,

148
0:06:48.792,000 --> 0:06:49,000
possibly 18 months,

149
0:06:50.083,000 --> 0:06:52,000
so we have to recognize that that pathway is not open to us.

150
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And to get a sense of the magnitude

151
0:06:54.708,000 --> 0:06:57,000
of what it would mean to live through the disease to get to herd immunity,

152
0:06:58.209,000 --> 0:06:59,000
think about this:

153
0:06:59.625,000 --> 0:07:,000
In Italy right now

154
0:07:01.292,000 --> 0:07:03,000
they estimate that about 15 percent of the population

155
0:07:03.833,000 --> 0:07:05,000
has probably been exposed to the disease.

156
0:07:05.958,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So you'd have to repeat what Italy has done

157
0:07:08.667,000 --> 0:07:1,000
three or more times,

158
0:07:10.833,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to get to a place where you can reasonably think

159
0:07:13.125,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that there's herd immunity.

160
0:07:14.5,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And I think you can see that when you think of that picture,

161
0:07:17.375,000 --> 0:07:18,000
how destabilizing a process would be

162
0:07:19.125,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of just leaving things broadly open without disease controls.

163
0:07:23.833,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So the real trick is whether or not there's a substitute for social distancing

164
0:07:27.667,000 --> 0:07:29,000
as a method for controlling the disease.

165
0:07:30.708,000 --> 0:07:32,000
CA: Right. So Italy, even with that 15 percent

166
0:07:33.125,000 --> 0:07:35,000
has suffered at least 15,000 deaths,

167
0:07:35.542,000 --> 0:07:38,000
some people argue that it's underreported by 50 percent there,

168
0:07:38.583,000 --> 0:07:39,000
it might be 30,000 deaths plus there,

169
0:07:40.583,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and as they come down the curve, there will be more to come.

170
0:07:43.417,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Multiply that by five or six, say, for the bigger population size of the US

171
0:07:47.708,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and the herd immunity idea per se doesn't seem like a winning idea.

172
0:07:54.208,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I mean, it's a horrible idea.

173
0:07:55.833,000 --> 0:07:56,000
DA: It's a horrible idea, exactly.

174
0:07:57.708,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And we do have alternatives, that's the important thing,

175
0:08:00.352,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we actually do have a way of controlling the disease,

176
0:08:03.417,000 --> 0:08:05,000
minimizing loss of life and reopening the economy,

177
0:08:06.083,000 --> 0:08:08,000
so that's the thing we should all be focusing on.

178
0:08:08.708,000 --> 0:08:12,000
CA: And again, the initial problem is that if you just let people start coming back,

179
0:08:13.292,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as soon as they gather again in reasonable numbers,

180
0:08:16.208,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the risk is that this highly infectious bug

181
0:08:18.5,000 --> 0:08:19,000
just takes off again.

182
0:08:20.5,000 --> 0:08:21,000
DA: Exactly.

183
0:08:21.792,000 --> 0:08:23,000
CA: And so one scenario is that you have

184
0:08:24.125,000 --> 0:08:27,000
countries lurching from a little bit of activity here

185
0:08:27.875,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and then suddenly it explodes again and everyone has to retreat.

186
0:08:30.958,000 --> 0:08:32,000
That does not seem attractive,

187
0:08:33.625,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that also just doesn't work.

188
0:08:36.042,000 --> 0:08:37,000
DA: No, exactly.

189
0:08:37.333,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I mean, we described that as a freeze in place strategy

190
0:08:39.958,000 --> 0:08:4,000
for dealing with this.

191
0:08:41.25,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That is you freeze and you shut down all activity,

192
0:08:43.667,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and then that flattens the curve, you open up again,

193
0:08:46.208,000 --> 0:08:49,000
then you have another peak, you have to freeze again and so forth.

194
0:08:49.333,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So you have this repeated process of freezing,

195
0:08:51.542,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which just does tremendous damage to the economy over time.

196
0:08:54.333,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I mean the upfront damage is huge,

197
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but then there's never space to recover from it,

198
0:08:58.5,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because of great deal of uncertainty

199
0:09:00.417,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and repeated applications of economically ruinous social distancing.

200
0:09:04.208,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So I think you're really pointing to the features of the disease

201
0:09:08.708,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that make this situation a problem that it is.

202
0:09:11.583,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And there are really two that people should focus on.

203
0:09:14.125,000 --> 0:09:15,000
One is the degree of infectiousness.

204
0:09:15.875,000 --> 0:09:17,000
This is a highly infectious virus.

205
0:09:18.042,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So the comparison to the Spanish flu is a reasonable one

206
0:09:21.125,000 --> 0:09:23,000
from the point of view of degree of infectiousness.

207
0:09:24.042,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Then the second really important point about the disease

208
0:09:26.708,000 --> 0:09:28,000
is that it's possible to be an asymptomatic carrier.

209
0:09:29.208,000 --> 0:09:31,000
That is to be infectious, to carry the virus,

210
0:09:31.333,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and never show any symptoms yourself.

211
0:09:33.458,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Current estimates are still imprecise,

212
0:09:35.333,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but people think that about 20 percent of virus carriers are asymptomatic.

213
0:09:39.917,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And that is really the thing that makes it so hard to control.

214
0:09:43.083,000 --> 0:09:44,000
People don't know they're sick

215
0:09:44.583,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and then they become disease vectors,

216
0:09:46.375,000 --> 0:09:47,000
spreading it everywhere they go.

217
0:09:48.875,000 --> 0:09:49,000
CA: Yes, indeed.

218
0:09:50.167,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So talk a bit, Danielle, about your thinking

219
0:09:53.292,000 --> 0:09:55,000
about how we might outwit this thing.

220
0:09:57.333,000 --> 0:09:59,000
DA: So the alternative to social distancing

221
0:09:59.75,000 --> 0:10:01,000
as a strategy for controlling the disease

222
0:10:01.833,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is really massively ramped up, massively scaled up testing,

223
0:10:06.708,000 --> 0:10:08,000
combined with individual quarantine.

224
0:10:09.042,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So we are going to continue to need individual quarantine

225
0:10:11.958,000 --> 0:10:13,000
for those who are positive carriers of the virus,

226
0:10:14.542,000 --> 0:10:17,000
until such a point as we have gotten a vaccine.

227
0:10:17.875,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Now what does that mean exactly?

228
0:10:19.458,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It means that the standard quarantine that aligns with the incubation period,

229
0:10:24.292,000 --> 0:10:25,000
14 days is often what people talk about,

230
0:10:26.292,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in the conservative picture

231
0:10:27.75,000 --> 0:10:29,000
you might say twice the incubation period length,

232
0:10:30.083,000 --> 0:10:31,000
28 days for individual quarantine.

233
0:10:32.083,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And we need that quarantine for people who are symptomatic

234
0:10:34.833,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and for asymptomatic carriers of the virus.

235
0:10:37.292,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Now the only way that you can actually run an individual quarantine

236
0:10:40.833,000 --> 0:10:42,000
as opposed to a collective quarantine regime,

237
0:10:43.583,000 --> 0:10:45,000
is if you do massive testing.

238
0:10:46.458,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We really need to make testing in a sense universally available,

239
0:10:50.042,000 --> 0:10:53,000
so that we can be testing broadly across the population.

240
0:10:53.75,000 --> 0:10:56,000
There are ways to target test, make it more efficient and so forth,

241
0:10:56.917,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but in principle, what one should imagine,

242
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:,000
is really wide-scale testing,

243
0:11:00.458,000 --> 0:11:01,000
tens of millions of tests a day,

244
0:11:02.167,000 --> 0:11:05,000
connected with quarantine for those who test positive.

245
0:11:05.375,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Coughs) Excuse me.

246
0:11:09.917,000 --> 0:11:1,000
CA: So weird.

247
0:11:11.208,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Anytime anyone coughs today, you go, "Oh, God, are you OK?"

248
0:11:14.333,000 --> 0:11:15,000
DA: Yeah, no, no, I'm fine,

249
0:11:15.708,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Frog in the throat, that's all it is.

250
0:11:18.542,000 --> 0:11:19,000
CA: (Laughs)

251
0:11:21.792,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So just to play out a thought experiment.

252
0:11:23.958,000 --> 0:11:26,000
If we had an infinite number of tests available,

253
0:11:27.208,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and after the curve has flattened and cases have gone down,

254
0:11:31.917,000 --> 0:11:32,000
everyone came back to work,

255
0:11:33.375,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but everyone was tested every day.

256
0:11:37.083,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Then what we think is that the tests will show up positive

257
0:11:41.875,000 --> 0:11:42,000
at the same time,

258
0:11:43.167,000 --> 0:11:45,000
or possibly even ahead of the time that people are infectious.

259
0:11:46.125,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But certainly, let's say at the same time,

260
0:11:48.167,000 --> 0:11:5,000
regardless of whether they're symptomatic.

261
0:11:50.25,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And so you could --

262
0:11:52.375,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Those people would immediately go back home

263
0:11:55.167,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and the rest of the population should be OK,

264
0:11:57.292,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we should be able to get work done,

265
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in that thought experiment, right?

266
0:12:01.542,000 --> 0:12:03,000
DA: Right, in that thought experiment, exactly, yeah.

267
0:12:04.417,000 --> 0:12:05,000
CA: But the trouble is,

268
0:12:05.708,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that that would mean doing, whatever, like, 200 million tests a day.

269
0:12:10.167,000 --> 0:12:11,000
DA: Right, exactly.

270
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
CA: Which is many, many orders of magnitude more than we have

271
0:12:15.208,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and could even imagine ramping up to.

272
0:12:17.25,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So you have a proposal, and this is the ingenuity,

273
0:12:20.125,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the proposal,

274
0:12:21.417,000 --> 0:12:25,000
of how to potentially administer tests in a way that's much more efficient.

275
0:12:26.083,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Talk a bit about that.

276
0:12:27.75,000 --> 0:12:28,000
DA: Sure.

277
0:12:29.042,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So if you were going to use a purely random testing method

278
0:12:32.167,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to control the disease,

279
0:12:33.458,000 --> 0:12:35,000
you could probably actually get away with testing everybody

280
0:12:36.292,000 --> 0:12:37,000
every two or three days --

281
0:12:37.875,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I'm playing along with your thought experiment here --

282
0:12:40.5,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and bring the number down to 100 million tests a day.

283
0:12:43.042,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But even that is a magnitude

284
0:12:44.583,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that would take us multiple months to get to,

285
0:12:46.792,000 --> 0:12:49,000
let's just say if we even wanted to try to do something like that.

286
0:12:49.917,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So the thing that you really need is smart testing.

287
0:12:52.917,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So rather than testing the population at random,

288
0:12:55.208,000 --> 0:12:57,000
what you do is you use testing

289
0:12:57.917,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to identify people who are positive,

290
0:12:59.792,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and then you add to that contact tracing or contact warning,

291
0:13:04.042,000 --> 0:13:05,000
we think about it in both ways.

292
0:13:05.917,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And what this means is that once you know who's a positive test,

293
0:13:09.75,000 --> 0:13:11,000
you figure out who else has been exposed to that person

294
0:13:12.458,000 --> 0:13:13,000
over the previous two weeks,

295
0:13:13.875,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and they all get tested as well.

296
0:13:15.5,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So you start to identify a class of people

297
0:13:17.542,000 --> 0:13:19,000
who are a higher probability of being infectious

298
0:13:20.417,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and you test that group of people.

299
0:13:22.125,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So you move away from random testing,

300
0:13:24.625,000 --> 0:13:27,000
you target it through contact tracing or contact warning.

301
0:13:28.042,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And then, depending on the level of effectiveness

302
0:13:30.875,000 --> 0:13:33,000
of your contact-tracing and contact-warning strategy,

303
0:13:34.542,000 --> 0:13:35,000
you can reduce the numbers.

304
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So on a moderately effective contact-tracing regimen,

305
0:13:39.542,000 --> 0:13:41,000
you could imagine doing 20 million tests a day.

306
0:13:42.292,000 --> 0:13:46,000
On a highly effective regime of contact tracing and warning,

307
0:13:46.917,000 --> 0:13:49,000
you could get yourself down to the order of five to 10 million tests a day.

308
0:13:51.458,000 --> 0:13:54,000
CA: And some countries in Asia seem to have pulled off

309
0:13:54.958,000 --> 0:13:58,000
a version of this strategy that has been effective.

310
0:13:59.333,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But it requires one of two things, if I understand you right, Danielle,

311
0:14:02.833,000 --> 0:14:04,000
it requires either just this massively scaled up,

312
0:14:05.708,000 --> 0:14:09,000
or potentially quite intrusive sort of manual contact tracing

313
0:14:10.375,000 --> 0:14:12,000
where you have big teams who swoop in to anyone

314
0:14:12.875,000 --> 0:14:13,000
who's tested positive

315
0:14:14.5,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and try to unpack their complete recent social history.

316
0:14:19.125,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Or technology plays a role,

317
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and this is where it gets complicated,

318
0:14:23.875,000 --> 0:14:26,000
because you know, there are apps in some of the Asian countries,

319
0:14:27.083,000 --> 0:14:28,000
like, China has an app

320
0:14:28.708,000 --> 0:14:31,000
which most people are, I think, required to carry,

321
0:14:31.75,000 --> 0:14:33,000
certainly in Wuhan and elsewhere,

322
0:14:33.833,000 --> 0:14:36,000
where it's very good at predicting

323
0:14:37.75,000 --> 0:14:39,000
whether someone may need quarantine.

324
0:14:40.75,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And they will be required to do so.

325
0:14:42.625,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And so there are all these concerns about government control,

326
0:14:45.542,000 --> 0:14:46,000
government intrusion.

327
0:14:47.958,000 --> 0:14:52,000
You are in discussion about ways of doing some kind of technology

328
0:14:53.417,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that would be more acceptable in a democracy,

329
0:14:56.167,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and I'd love you to share what those are.

330
0:14:58.708,000 --> 0:14:59,000
DA: Sure, I'm happy to do that.

331
0:15:00.25,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So I think it's an important thing to say upfront

332
0:15:02.75,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that the rates at which we would need to test per capita

333
0:15:06.5,000 --> 0:15:08,000
are higher, much higher than Asian countries used,

334
0:15:09.458,000 --> 0:15:11,000
because prevalence is much higher here.

335
0:15:11.708,000 --> 0:15:12,000
They caught it earlier,

336
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:16,000
they had these tools built before the pandemic hit.

337
0:15:16.042,000 --> 0:15:17,000
As a consequence,

338
0:15:17.333,000 --> 0:15:2,000
they're able to control it with a lower per capita rate of testing

339
0:15:20.5,000 --> 0:15:21,000
than will be the case for us.

340
0:15:21.958,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We just have to accept that fact at this point

341
0:15:24.208,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and recognize that massively scaling up is specific to our situation,

342
0:15:27.5,000 --> 0:15:29,000
because we weren't ready before it hit.

343
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:33,000
So then, yes, OK, if we're trying to do the smart testing,

344
0:15:33.333,000 --> 0:15:35,000
trying to use tools, what can you do?

345
0:15:35.375,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So we're actually open to manual testing in the plan that we've developed,

346
0:15:38.876,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I want to just say that,

347
0:15:40.167,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and I think that society, we have a big choice to make,

348
0:15:42.792,000 --> 0:15:45,000
whether what we want is a big core of manual contact tracers

349
0:15:46.042,000 --> 0:15:48,000
who are tracing people's histories

350
0:15:48.292,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and figuring out who they've been in contact with

351
0:15:50.667,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and who they've been exposed to.

352
0:15:52.215,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Or if we want to try to use a technological system.

353
0:15:54.667,000 --> 0:15:56,000
The important thing is there is a diversity of options

354
0:15:57.215,000 --> 0:15:58,000
within the technology space.

355
0:15:58.583,000 --> 0:16:01,000
So it's really important to recognize that places like Singapore and China

356
0:16:02.5,000 --> 0:16:05,000
have used highly centralized data systems for supporting this.

357
0:16:06.333,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And so what happens is, sort of, you carry your phone around,

358
0:16:10.292,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and everybody is connected to a central data system,

359
0:16:12.792,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and then when somebody in the system has a positive test,

360
0:16:15.5,000 --> 0:16:16,000
that gets put into the app,

361
0:16:16.875,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and then their phone communicates to other phones

362
0:16:19.185,000 --> 0:16:21,000
that it's been in proximity with over the previous two weeks,

363
0:16:22.083,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to alert people that they too need to get a test, OK?

364
0:16:24.917,000 --> 0:16:25,000
That's the basic concept.

365
0:16:26.208,000 --> 0:16:27,000
In China and Singapore

366
0:16:27.917,000 --> 0:16:3,000
the data structure for doing this is highly centralized.

367
0:16:31.208,000 --> 0:16:33,000
There are, however, a lot of innovative apps

368
0:16:33.708,000 --> 0:16:34,000
under development right now

369
0:16:35.375,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that depend instead on a very privacy-protective structure

370
0:16:39.708,000 --> 0:16:41,000
where the data lives on the individual user's phone

371
0:16:42.292,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and through a combination of encryption and tokens

372
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
users of phones can communicate with other users of phones,

373
0:16:48.167,000 --> 0:16:49,000
but the data is not centralized.

374
0:16:49.958,000 --> 0:16:52,000
So in that regard, it becomes more of a peer-to-peer sharing,

375
0:16:53.042,000 --> 0:16:55,000
sort of concept of friends warn friends

376
0:16:55.167,000 --> 0:16:57,000
that they should probably go get tested.

377
0:16:57.958,000 --> 0:17:,000
Then you would have a central repository of test data,

378
0:17:01.417,000 --> 0:17:03,000
but the truth is, we already have that,

379
0:17:03.583,000 --> 0:17:05,000
because all influenza tests for example,

380
0:17:05.625,000 --> 0:17:07,000
already roll up into CDC

381
0:17:08.333,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and Health and Human Services databases,

382
0:17:10.375,000 --> 0:17:12,000
so that they can track influenza patterns every year.

383
0:17:13.208,000 --> 0:17:15,000
CA: So tell me if I understand this right.

384
0:17:15.833,000 --> 0:17:18,000
You would carry on your phone an app

385
0:17:18.958,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that would, when you got, say, within six feet

386
0:17:23.208,000 --> 0:17:25,000
of another human carrying that app,

387
0:17:25.542,000 --> 0:17:28,000
the phones would exchange a Bluetooth -- using Bluetooth technology

388
0:17:29.25,000 --> 0:17:31,000
they exchange a kind of token

389
0:17:31.542,000 --> 0:17:32,000
that says, "Hi, we connected."

390
0:17:33.125,000 --> 0:17:34,000
But it's encrypted.

391
0:17:35.375,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And that is not communicated to a central server,

392
0:17:38.417,000 --> 0:17:39,000
that is on the phone.

393
0:17:40.292,000 --> 0:17:42,000
But if either of you

394
0:17:43.083,000 --> 0:17:46,000
in the next week or two tests positive,

395
0:17:46.833,000 --> 0:17:49,000
your phone will be able to communicate to all the people

396
0:17:49.875,000 --> 0:17:5,000
which it exchanged token with,

397
0:17:51.833,000 --> 0:17:55,000
to say, "Uh oh, someone who you were close to in the last two weeks

398
0:17:56.417,000 --> 0:17:57,000
has tested positive.

399
0:17:57.792,000 --> 0:17:58,000
You've got to isolate."

400
0:17:59.167,000 --> 0:18:02,000
That's basically how it works, it's done that way.

401
0:18:02.833,000 --> 0:18:03,000
DA: Exactly.

402
0:18:04.125,000 --> 0:18:06,000
CA: And then after, what, three or four weeks,

403
0:18:06.875,000 --> 0:18:08,000
the tokens can actually autodelete?

404
0:18:09.667,000 --> 0:18:1,000
They go, they're not there anymore.

405
0:18:11.5,000 --> 0:18:12,000
DA: They expire, that's right.

406
0:18:13.042,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Because you only need the most recent two weeks' information or data

407
0:18:16.257,000 --> 0:18:17,000
about where you've been

408
0:18:17.542,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and what other phones your phone has interacted with.

409
0:18:20.083,000 --> 0:18:21,000
So that's the really key thing.

410
0:18:21.875,000 --> 0:18:24,000
CA: Alright, we'll come back to that in a minute,

411
0:18:25.25,000 --> 0:18:28,000
but let's see what our friends are asking online.

412
0:18:28.542,000 --> 0:18:29,000
DA: OK.

413
0:18:29.833,000 --> 0:18:3,000
CH: Hi, Danielle, hi, Chris.

414
0:18:31.25,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Yeah, we've got a lot of great questions,

415
0:18:33.25,000 --> 0:18:36,000
people are super interested in how this is all going to work.

416
0:18:37.75,000 --> 0:18:4,000
There's a couple of questions I'm trying to cobble together here.

417
0:18:41.417,000 --> 0:18:44,000
I think people are really interested in your thoughts

418
0:18:44.75,000 --> 0:18:46,000
on the United States health care system.

419
0:18:47.375,000 --> 0:18:5,000
We have so many underinsured and uninsured people

420
0:18:50.958,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and the changes that you might make to that system,

421
0:18:54.833,000 --> 0:18:56,000
I mean, does that situation make things worse,

422
0:18:57.042,000 --> 0:18:59,000
and what changes would you make to the system

423
0:18:59.708,000 --> 0:19:01,000
so that we're not as vulnerable in the future?

424
0:19:03.576,000 --> 0:19:04,000
DA: So that's a great set of questions,

425
0:19:05.458,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and so just from the point of view of the testing program,

426
0:19:09.708,000 --> 0:19:12,000
it is absolutely critical that the testing be free.

427
0:19:13.25,000 --> 0:19:14,000
And so there is absolutely,

428
0:19:15.208,000 --> 0:19:16,000
a sort of necessary feature of this,

429
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:21,000
which is about, kind of, universal access element to the health system.

430
0:19:21.625,000 --> 0:19:23,000
And so I'm sure there will be tweaking that's necessary

431
0:19:24.625,000 --> 0:19:26,000
in the existing health system to achieve that.

432
0:19:27.333,000 --> 0:19:29,000
We've also without any question seen vulnerabilities

433
0:19:29.958,000 --> 0:19:32,000
that relate to and stem from our fragmented health system.

434
0:19:33.5,000 --> 0:19:36,000
So I think there's a much bigger, longer-term question to be had,

435
0:19:36.572,000 --> 0:19:37,000
or conversation to have,

436
0:19:37.833,000 --> 0:19:39,000
about how we overcome that fragmentation.

437
0:19:40.292,000 --> 0:19:42,000
So yes, I do hope this moment will be a spur

438
0:19:43.292,000 --> 0:19:46,000
for that longer-term conversation about improving our health system

439
0:19:47.042,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and really achieving that universal coverage that we so badly need.

440
0:19:51.958,000 --> 0:19:54,000
CH: OK, thank you, I'll see you both again in a little bit.

441
0:19:55.25,000 --> 0:19:56,000
CA: Thanks, Corey.

442
0:19:57.542,000 --> 0:20:01,000
So let's stay with this tech issue for a bit.

443
0:20:02.167,000 --> 0:20:04,000
And the sort of civil rights or privacy questions

444
0:20:05.042,000 --> 0:20:09,000
that it might still raise in some people.

445
0:20:09.708,000 --> 0:20:11,000
So one concern is that

446
0:20:12.333,000 --> 0:20:16,000
surely, if your phone is able to contact these other phones,

447
0:20:17.083,000 --> 0:20:19,000
someone somewhere is ultimately going to reverse that

448
0:20:19.708,000 --> 0:20:22,000
and we'll have some kind of record of your,

449
0:20:23.208,000 --> 0:20:25,000
you know, everyone who you've connected with,

450
0:20:25.792,000 --> 0:20:28,000
and that might be concerning to some.

451
0:20:29.042,000 --> 0:20:31,000
Is that a legitimate concern?

452
0:20:31.167,000 --> 0:20:34,000
DA: I think it is, I mean, I think we've been working hard on this question

453
0:20:34.75,000 --> 0:20:35,000
and really trying to think it through

454
0:20:36.583,000 --> 0:20:39,000
and when you talk to legal experts and civil liberties experts and so forth,

455
0:20:40.179,000 --> 0:20:41,000
everybody starts with the same premise:

456
0:20:42.083,000 --> 0:20:43,000
assume failure.

457
0:20:43.375,000 --> 0:20:44,000
Assume that you'll have a data breach.

458
0:20:45.292,000 --> 0:20:46,000
Think for that

459
0:20:46.583,000 --> 0:20:48,000
and what kind of protection you want in that regard.

460
0:20:49.042,000 --> 0:20:5,000
And so when you think that way,

461
0:20:50.958,000 --> 0:20:53,000
you of course are trying to minimize any likelihood of that happening,

462
0:20:54.292,000 --> 0:20:57,000
so hence the privacy-protective structure of phones communicating with phones,

463
0:20:58,000 --> 0:21:01,000
data living on the hardware of the phone,

464
0:21:01.25,000 --> 0:21:03,000
not in the server, etc.

465
0:21:03.833,000 --> 0:21:04,000
And then also you would want

466
0:21:05.25,000 --> 0:21:07,000
a kind of democratic accountability feature,

467
0:21:07.5,000 --> 0:21:1,000
so for example having the Department of Health and Human Services

468
0:21:10.667,000 --> 0:21:14,000
have an auditing function to audit whoever is manning the server

469
0:21:15.542,000 --> 0:21:17,000
or controls the server

470
0:21:17.875,000 --> 0:21:18,000
through which the tokens are exchanged

471
0:21:19.75,000 --> 0:21:21,000
you would want to audit their functionality

472
0:21:21.833,000 --> 0:21:22,000
and how they're using the data.

473
0:21:23.417,000 --> 0:21:24,000
But then again, you presume failure,

474
0:21:25.25,000 --> 0:21:28,000
that somebody's reverse engineering, the audit system fails in some fashion.

475
0:21:28.917,000 --> 0:21:29,000
What's your protection then?

476
0:21:30.333,000 --> 0:21:32,000
The answer to that would appear to be upfront legislation

477
0:21:33.083,000 --> 0:21:36,000
that prohibits the commercialization of this COVID testing data.

478
0:21:36.833,000 --> 0:21:38,000
So that anybody who in any way tried to commercialize it

479
0:21:39.542,000 --> 0:21:4,000
in any kind of way,

480
0:21:40.833,000 --> 0:21:42,000
would be subject to legal penalty.

481
0:21:43.25,000 --> 0:21:45,000
So I think that's how you build the fence up upfront

482
0:21:45.75,000 --> 0:21:48,000
in the expectation that somebody would find the way to crack it.

483
0:21:49.5,000 --> 0:21:5,000
CA: And then there's a set of questions

484
0:21:51.458,000 --> 0:21:53,000
around how you get this app out there at scale,

485
0:21:54.417,000 --> 0:21:56,000
because it's only effective if,

486
0:21:56.458,000 --> 0:22:,000
say, two thirds of the people who are working are carrying it, right,

487
0:22:00.5,000 --> 0:22:01,000
something like that.

488
0:22:01.958,000 --> 0:22:02,000
DA: Right.

489
0:22:03.25,000 --> 0:22:08,000
CA: And so short of authoritarian "everyone must have this app,"

490
0:22:08.458,000 --> 0:22:1,000
I guess there are ways that are interesting

491
0:22:10.542,000 --> 0:22:12,000
to say to people, one, this is a really useful app,

492
0:22:12.958,000 --> 0:22:15,000
it will alert you quickly if you're at any risk.

493
0:22:16.167,000 --> 0:22:17,000
But two,

494
0:22:17.583,000 --> 0:22:19,000
to get to the kind of scale we're talking about,

495
0:22:19.917,000 --> 0:22:2,000
you might have to say to people,

496
0:22:21.542,000 --> 0:22:23,000
"Look, we're slowly going to come back to work,

497
0:22:23.833,000 --> 0:22:25,000
industry by industry, company by company,

498
0:22:25.875,000 --> 0:22:28,000
and the deal for you to come back and break isolation,

499
0:22:29.208,000 --> 0:22:3,000
the societal deal,

500
0:22:30.833,000 --> 0:22:33,000
is that you have to be willing to carry this app."

501
0:22:34.417,000 --> 0:22:36,000
And you could, for people who didn't want to do that,

502
0:22:36.958,000 --> 0:22:37,000
I guess you could have some protection,

503
0:22:38.875,000 --> 0:22:39,000
you can't lose your job for that.

504
0:22:40.833,000 --> 0:22:42,000
But, I mean, can you picture society making the choice

505
0:22:43.417,000 --> 0:22:47,000
that it is reasonable to require people who want to come back to work

506
0:22:48.292,000 --> 0:22:51,000
to carry that alert technology with them?

507
0:22:52.417,000 --> 0:22:53,000
DA: So this is the hardest question.

508
0:22:54.417,000 --> 0:22:56,000
We know we don't want an authoritarian model,

509
0:22:56.833,000 --> 0:22:58,000
such as the one used in China and Singapore,

510
0:22:59.708,000 --> 0:23:01,000
so we have to figure out instead how to activate that thing,

511
0:23:02.708,000 --> 0:23:05,000
which is sort of the most important democratic resource or asset,

512
0:23:05.958,000 --> 0:23:06,000
namely solidarity.

513
0:23:07.583,000 --> 0:23:09,000
So what is it that, from a solidarity perspective,

514
0:23:10.167,000 --> 0:23:12,000
it's reasonable for us to ask of each other?

515
0:23:12.458,000 --> 0:23:15,000
That has to be the frame for deciding how we approach this.

516
0:23:15.667,000 --> 0:23:16,000
And so one aspect of this

517
0:23:17.208,000 --> 0:23:21,000
is really, truly the building a culture of opting in to this.

518
0:23:21.292,000 --> 0:23:22,000
And there are examples of this.

519
0:23:22.793,000 --> 0:23:25,000
So for example, New York has tackled HIV testing

520
0:23:26.5,000 --> 0:23:29,000
through a program that goes by the label "New York Knows,"

521
0:23:3,000 --> 0:23:35,000
and it started out with labels of "Manhattan Knows" or "Brooklyn Knows,"

522
0:23:35.083,000 --> 0:23:37,000
and so forth, of the different burrows.

523
0:23:37.25,000 --> 0:23:38,000
And what this program is

524
0:23:38.542,000 --> 0:23:4,000
is one that is owned by community organizations,

525
0:23:41.042,000 --> 0:23:42,000
community partners,

526
0:23:42.583,000 --> 0:23:44,000
that do the job of spreading the word

527
0:23:44.75,000 --> 0:23:46,000
and recruiting people into testing programs.

528
0:23:47.208,000 --> 0:23:49,000
And New York has the goal of having every single New Yorker

529
0:23:5,000 --> 0:23:51,000
be tested for HIV,

530
0:23:51.667,000 --> 0:23:54,000
so in other words, it's established as an expectation,

531
0:23:54.75,000 --> 0:23:55,000
that universal participation,

532
0:23:56.583,000 --> 0:23:59,000
and it's activated a network of community partners and organizations,

533
0:24:00.208,000 --> 0:24:02,000
to cultivate that commitment to solidarity.

534
0:24:02.667,000 --> 0:24:03,000
And so I think, in all honesty,

535
0:24:04.208,000 --> 0:24:07,000
that that would be a really huge part of what you would need to do

536
0:24:07.542,000 --> 0:24:08,000
in order to tap into solidarity,

537
0:24:09.292,000 --> 0:24:11,000
to have this work.

538
0:24:11.375,000 --> 0:24:15,000
I'm sure that we would see some amount of requiring in different context,

539
0:24:16.042,000 --> 0:24:17,000
I think that's a very hard one,

540
0:24:17.583,000 --> 0:24:2,000
because you don't want to generate labor discrimination problems.

541
0:24:21.083,000 --> 0:24:22,000
And so the model there,

542
0:24:22.375,000 --> 0:24:25,000
to think about and to sort of figure out what are our parameters,

543
0:24:25.458,000 --> 0:24:26,000
what we think is fair,

544
0:24:26.75,000 --> 0:24:28,000
connects to things that schools currently do,

545
0:24:28.875,000 --> 0:24:32,000
for example, when they require that students show vaccination proof

546
0:24:33.125,000 --> 0:24:35,000
before they can start the school year and things like that.

547
0:24:35.958,000 --> 0:24:38,000
So there are multiple states that do that in schools for vaccines.

548
0:24:39.542,000 --> 0:24:4,000
Would schools do the same thing,

549
0:24:41.25,000 --> 0:24:43,000
what's the sort of labor, the workforce question like,

550
0:24:43.958,000 --> 0:24:45,000
I think that very much remains to be worked through,

551
0:24:46.417,000 --> 0:24:48,000
but it's a hugely important question.

552
0:24:48.667,000 --> 0:24:51,000
CA: I'd be curious what the watching audience thinks about this,

553
0:24:51.708,000 --> 0:24:52,000
maybe you could enter a comment on it.

554
0:24:53.583,000 --> 0:24:56,000
But I mean, is it reasonable, in the world that we're in right now,

555
0:24:57.25,000 --> 0:24:58,000
for a company, let's say, to say,

556
0:24:59.167,000 --> 0:25:01,000
"Look, we want to get back to work,

557
0:25:01.333,000 --> 0:25:03,000
but we want to do so and respect the safety of all our workers.

558
0:25:04.333,000 --> 0:25:06,000
That means that for you to come back to work,

559
0:25:06.458,000 --> 0:25:08,000
you need a test showing that you're negative.

560
0:25:08.708,000 --> 0:25:11,000
And you need to carry this app

561
0:25:12.5,000 --> 0:25:15,000
so that we alert people quickly if there's a problem."

562
0:25:15.958,000 --> 0:25:16,000
Is that --

563
0:25:17.667,000 --> 0:25:19,000
"We won't fire you if you don't come in,

564
0:25:19.708,000 --> 0:25:2,000
but if you want to come back to work,

565
0:25:21.542,000 --> 0:25:22,000
that's what you'll have to agree to."

566
0:25:23.417,000 --> 0:25:25,000
Is that a reasonable chance?

567
0:25:25.542,000 --> 0:25:27,000
I'm curious what people think.

568
0:25:28.375,000 --> 0:25:3,000
Is there any other way to get --

569
0:25:30.417,000 --> 0:25:31,000
Sorry.

570
0:25:31.958,000 --> 0:25:34,000
DA: I mean, again, there is precedent for this

571
0:25:35.042,000 --> 0:25:37,000
in the sense that drug testing works this way

572
0:25:37.75,000 --> 0:25:38,000
in many employment contexts, right.

573
0:25:39.708,000 --> 0:25:42,000
There are many roles where people have to do routine drug tests

574
0:25:43.333,000 --> 0:25:46,000
as a part of preserving their job.

575
0:25:47.083,000 --> 0:25:49,000
That was a hotly debated issue in the 1980s,

576
0:25:49.458,000 --> 0:25:51,000
people sort of think back when that sort of first came in,

577
0:25:52.208,000 --> 0:25:53,000
and there was a lot of concern about it.

578
0:25:54.137,000 --> 0:25:56,000
We have managed to develop a regime for that,

579
0:25:56.667,000 --> 0:25:58,000
that has achieved an equilibrium of a kind.

580
0:25:59.375,000 --> 0:26:02,000
So I imagine that something is possible in this space,

581
0:26:02.5,000 --> 0:26:04,000
but we would have to draw on the prior experience

582
0:26:04.958,000 --> 0:26:06,000
with things like drug testing in the workplace, I think.

583
0:26:08.958,000 --> 0:26:09,000
CA: I mean, one problem that we face

584
0:26:10.708,000 --> 0:26:12,000
when you think about these big systems introduced

585
0:26:13.042,000 --> 0:26:15,000
is that in the past, there's history

586
0:26:15.833,000 --> 0:26:17,000
where something got introduced,

587
0:26:18.083,000 --> 0:26:21,000
you think of the PATRIOT Act that came in after 9/11

588
0:26:21.583,000 --> 0:26:24,000
and a lot of people have a lot of problems with that Act,

589
0:26:24.917,000 --> 0:26:26,000
and it gets renewed relentlessly, relentlessly,

590
0:26:27.208,000 --> 0:26:29,000
and here we are, nearly 20 years later,

591
0:26:29.292,000 --> 0:26:31,000
and it's still with us.

592
0:26:32.042,000 --> 0:26:35,000
So that creates quite a high bar

593
0:26:35.208,000 --> 0:26:38,000
for any standard that we push out here.

594
0:26:38.542,000 --> 0:26:4,000
How do we persuade people

595
0:26:41.125,000 --> 0:26:45,000
that this is custom-made for the current situation that we're in,

596
0:26:45.25,000 --> 0:26:47,000
and it's not going to be picked up and subsequently abused

597
0:26:48.042,000 --> 0:26:5,000
by companies or by government?

598
0:26:50.417,000 --> 0:26:52,000
DA: That's an absolutely critical question,

599
0:26:52.5,000 --> 0:26:55,000
and I think we have a lot to learn from places like Germany,

600
0:26:55.917,000 --> 0:26:59,000
which are really, really strong and rigorous on privacy protections.

601
0:27:00.167,000 --> 0:27:04,000
Perhaps having some of the highest privacy-protection standards in the world.

602
0:27:04.417,000 --> 0:27:06,000
And Germany, over the course of the last few weeks,

603
0:27:06.875,000 --> 0:27:08,000
has articulated an approach that definitely picks up

604
0:27:09.375,000 --> 0:27:1,000
several of these elements.

605
0:27:10.75,000 --> 0:27:13,000
So there are ways of building in privacy structures

606
0:27:14.083,000 --> 0:27:17,000
that are meeting the standards of the German privacy framework,

607
0:27:17.458,000 --> 0:27:2,000
and so I think for us, that's a really important place to look to,

608
0:27:20.75,000 --> 0:27:22,000
and learn from them how they're structuring it,

609
0:27:22.965,000 --> 0:27:24,000
to achieve those privacy protections.

610
0:27:25.708,000 --> 0:27:27,000
CA: Danielle, you're an ethicist, among other things,

611
0:27:28.583,000 --> 0:27:29,000
as well as a political theorist,

612
0:27:30.5,000 --> 0:27:34,000
and is it, as you think about how to apply ethical questions to this,

613
0:27:34.917,000 --> 0:27:37,000
is it inherent in a situation like this that there are going to be trade-offs,

614
0:27:38.708,000 --> 0:27:42,000
that there is no "perfect solution" that we just, you know --

615
0:27:43.042,000 --> 0:27:44,000
These things are fundamentally --

616
0:27:44.667,000 --> 0:27:47,000
You've got two goods that are fundamentally in conflict with each other

617
0:27:48.542,000 --> 0:27:51,000
or if you like, avoidance of two evils that are going to clash.

618
0:27:51.708,000 --> 0:27:55,000
And that we're not going to get away sort of untainted to some extent,

619
0:27:56.208,000 --> 0:27:59,000
we just have to try and make the least bad choice?

620
0:27:59.75,000 --> 0:28:01,000
DA: It's a great question, and I think,

621
0:28:02.5,000 --> 0:28:06,000
I tend to formulate things as being about hard choices and judgments,

622
0:28:06.542,000 --> 0:28:07,000
rather than being about trade-offs.

623
0:28:08.25,000 --> 0:28:11,000
I think trade-offs often suggest that you can precisely quantify

624
0:28:12.042,000 --> 0:28:15,000
this degree of monetizable harm against that degree of monetizable harm,

625
0:28:15.75,000 --> 0:28:18,000
and I think that's actually not as helpful to us in this current moment,

626
0:28:19.667,000 --> 0:28:2,000
to be honest.

627
0:28:20.958,000 --> 0:28:22,000
So in effect, I think the most important thing

628
0:28:23.25,000 --> 0:28:25,000
is that we clarify our core values.

629
0:28:25.792,000 --> 0:28:27,000
And so the way we've tried to articulate that

630
0:28:27.917,000 --> 0:28:3,000
is to say we have a fundamental value in securing public health.

631
0:28:31.083,000 --> 0:28:32,000
We have a fundamental value

632
0:28:32.625,000 --> 0:28:34,000
in securing a functioning, healthy economy.

633
0:28:35.208,000 --> 0:28:36,000
We have a fundamental value

634
0:28:36.583,000 --> 0:28:39,000
in securing civil liberties and justice and constitutional democracy.

635
0:28:39.875,000 --> 0:28:42,000
And so then the question is, given that set of fundamental values,

636
0:28:43.042,000 --> 0:28:44,000
what are the policy options

637
0:28:44.708,000 --> 0:28:46,000
that actually do secure all of those things?

638
0:28:47.375,000 --> 0:28:49,000
So in that regard, at the end of the day,

639
0:28:49.542,000 --> 0:28:52,000
you know, there's a bunch of libertarians in the group that we work on,

640
0:28:52.958,000 --> 0:28:53,000
and a lot of us come out very strongly,

641
0:28:54.917,000 --> 0:28:56,000
sort of, privacy protecting, liberty protecting point of view.

642
0:28:57.875,000 --> 0:28:59,000
And so we're not here to sacrifice those things.

643
0:29:00.167,000 --> 0:29:03,000
We're rather here to find a solution that aligns with the values

644
0:29:03.5,000 --> 0:29:04,000
that we bring in to this problem.

645
0:29:05.167,000 --> 0:29:07,000
So that's how we think about the decision making.

646
0:29:07.667,000 --> 0:29:09,000
CA: Talk a bit more, actually, about the group

647
0:29:09.875,000 --> 0:29:11,000
that you've pooled together over this.

648
0:29:11.917,000 --> 0:29:13,000
I know that there's a TED speaker Paul Romer,

649
0:29:14.042,000 --> 0:29:17,000
an economist at Stanford, who's, I think, a key member.

650
0:29:17.375,000 --> 0:29:19,000
Who else is in the group?

651
0:29:19.708,000 --> 0:29:2,000
DA: Well, Paul was a key member.

652
0:29:21.333,000 --> 0:29:24,000
I'm afraid we parted ways to some extent, because he's advocating random testing,

653
0:29:25.25,000 --> 0:29:28,000
so the sort of 100 million tests a day direction,

654
0:29:28.792,000 --> 0:29:31,000
and he's not a fan of the contact-tracing approach,

655
0:29:32,000 --> 0:29:34,000
so he does have, you know,

656
0:29:34.875,000 --> 0:29:37,000
he's sort of at one end of a kind of libertarian spectrum on that

657
0:29:38.167,000 --> 0:29:41,000
and my view, however, is that testing 100 million a day

658
0:29:42,000 --> 0:29:43,000
is far more intrusive

659
0:29:43.958,000 --> 0:29:47,000
than smart testing supported by privacy protective contact tracing.

660
0:29:48.292,000 --> 0:29:5,000
I also think it's really important to throw into the mix

661
0:29:51,000 --> 0:29:53,000
the fact that collective social distancing

662
0:29:53.083,000 --> 0:29:55,000
is a huge infringement on our civil liberties.

663
0:29:55.375,000 --> 0:29:56,000
We keep forgetting that.

664
0:29:56.667,000 --> 0:29:59,000
The alternative is not contact tracing versus nothing,

665
0:30:00.083,000 --> 0:30:02,000
it's contact tracing versus social distancing.

666
0:30:03,000 --> 0:30:04,000
We can't go out,

667
0:30:04.292,000 --> 0:30:07,000
we can't form associations where we get to be together in person,

668
0:30:07.364,000 --> 0:30:09,000
churchgoers can't go to church right now.

669
0:30:09.708,000 --> 0:30:12,000
You know, political parties are having their conventions postponed.

670
0:30:13.417,000 --> 0:30:15,000
If that's not infringement on our civil liberties,

671
0:30:15.792,000 --> 0:30:16,000
I don't know what is.

672
0:30:17.083,000 --> 0:30:18,000
So from my point of view,

673
0:30:18.417,000 --> 0:30:2,000
the civil liberties conversation is one about the contrast

674
0:30:21.167,000 --> 0:30:24,000
between the kind of infringement that is produced by social distancing

675
0:30:24.542,000 --> 0:30:28,000
versus the kind of infringement or reshaping

676
0:30:29.167,000 --> 0:30:31,000
that would be imposed by contact-tracing regime.

677
0:30:31.542,000 --> 0:30:33,000
I didn't answer your question about our group.

678
0:30:33.75,000 --> 0:30:36,000
CA: Go ahead, it's just amazing this thing is moving so fast in real time.

679
0:30:37.292,000 --> 0:30:39,000
Talk about some of the other people who are in your group.

680
0:30:40.167,000 --> 0:30:44,000
DA: Sure, so Glen Weyl is an economist at Microsoft,

681
0:30:44.375,000 --> 0:30:45,000
a political economist,

682
0:30:45.667,000 --> 0:30:46,000
he's a really key figure

683
0:30:46.958,000 --> 0:30:48,000
and he is really an innovative mechanism design thinker,

684
0:30:49.708,000 --> 0:30:5,000
who is really good at kind of,

685
0:30:51.208,000 --> 0:30:54,000
figuring out how to craft incentive structures and so forth

686
0:30:54.625,000 --> 0:30:59,000
that help people make choices in socially productive ways,

687
0:30:59.958,000 --> 0:31:01,000
in ways that are also freedom-respecting, and so forth.

688
0:31:02.625,000 --> 0:31:06,000
So he's really been helping us think about the design of the policy pathway,

689
0:31:07.333,000 --> 0:31:09,000
Rajiv Sethi is another economist,

690
0:31:09.708,000 --> 0:31:11,000
Lucas Stanczyk is a philosopher at Harvard

691
0:31:12.083,000 --> 0:31:15,000
who has been scrutinizing the civil liberties and justice questions.

692
0:31:15.792,000 --> 0:31:16,000
I mean, that is his line of work,

693
0:31:17.75,000 --> 0:31:19,000
those are the things he's most committed to,

694
0:31:19.875,000 --> 0:31:21,000
and that's what he's doing.

695
0:31:22.083,000 --> 0:31:24,000
We've reached out to a number of public health groups

696
0:31:24.625,000 --> 0:31:25,000
for regular consultations,

697
0:31:25.917,000 --> 0:31:27,000
so they're not as directly part of our group

698
0:31:28.083,000 --> 0:31:29,000
in the sense of advancing a policy,

699
0:31:29.792,000 --> 0:31:32,000
but in terms of informing our epidemiological understanding,

700
0:31:33.542,000 --> 0:31:37,000
we've relied a lot on folks at the Chan School of Public Health at Harvard.

701
0:31:38.708,000 --> 0:31:39,000
So lawyers as well,

702
0:31:4,000 --> 0:31:43,000
Glenn Cohen, who directs the Petrie-Flom Center for law and bioethics

703
0:31:43.333,000 --> 0:31:44,000
has been a critical member,

704
0:31:44.917,000 --> 0:31:46,000
Andrew Crespo also at Harvard Law School,

705
0:31:47,000 --> 0:31:49,000
Rosa Brooks at Georgetown Law school,

706
0:31:49.708,000 --> 0:31:51,000
I could go on, I'm missing key people, critical scientists.

707
0:31:52.5,000 --> 0:31:54,000
Actually, there's a great paper on solidarity

708
0:31:54.667,000 --> 0:31:57,000
by Melani Cammett and Evan Lieberman that people should check out too.

709
0:31:58,000 --> 0:32:,000
CA: It's exciting that one of the impacts of this,

710
0:32:00.833,000 --> 0:32:01,000
and I've seen it in other areas as well,

711
0:32:02.792,000 --> 0:32:05,000
this crisis is really breaking a lot of cross-disciplinary lines

712
0:32:06.417,000 --> 0:32:08,000
and bringing people together in unexpected combinations,

713
0:32:09.125,000 --> 0:32:1,000
which is good.

714
0:32:10.417,000 --> 0:32:11,000
DA: Yes.

715
0:32:11.708,000 --> 0:32:14,000
CA: So how, if this plan got general acceptance, how --

716
0:32:15.083,000 --> 0:32:17,000
I mean, obviously, the clock is ticking, this is urgent,

717
0:32:17.75,000 --> 0:32:19,000
what would it look like to move this forward?

718
0:32:19.876,000 --> 0:32:21,000
Give a sense of what you think it would cost,

719
0:32:22.003,000 --> 0:32:24,000
give a sense of who might own it,

720
0:32:24.625,000 --> 0:32:29,000
like, what would it take to actually activate this giant idea?

721
0:32:29.917,000 --> 0:32:32,000
DA: Alright, so it's a big price tag, so I hope you're sitting down --

722
0:32:33.227,000 --> 0:32:34,000
I'm glad you're sitting down.

723
0:32:34.75,000 --> 0:32:36,000
So over two years,

724
0:32:36.792,000 --> 0:32:38,000
based on conservative estimates of what you would need,

725
0:32:39.583,000 --> 0:32:42,000
that is to say maximal estimates for testing and things like that,

726
0:32:43.167,000 --> 0:32:45,000
it's got a price tag of 500 billion,

727
0:32:45.542,000 --> 0:32:47,000
which includes both the production of the tests

728
0:32:48.25,000 --> 0:32:5,000
and the personnel of test administration,

729
0:32:51.208,000 --> 0:32:53,000
contact tracing and all of that.

730
0:32:53.833,000 --> 0:32:54,000
So it's important to remember though,

731
0:32:55.667,000 --> 0:32:57,000
that that production ramp up and the contact tracing ramp up

732
0:32:58.583,000 --> 0:32:59,000
are employment possibilities,

733
0:33:00.542,000 --> 0:33:04,000
so in that regard, they would counteract the negative impact on employment

734
0:33:04.667,000 --> 0:33:05,000
of the social distancing.

735
0:33:06.542,000 --> 0:33:07,000
So it's a big price tag,

736
0:33:07.833,000 --> 0:33:09,000
but it would be multipurpose in that regard,

737
0:33:09.958,000 --> 0:33:1,000
contributing to jumping up the economy,

738
0:33:11.84,000 --> 0:33:13,000
as well as the testing program itself.

739
0:33:15.125,000 --> 0:33:17,000
It would be important that it be phased in,

740
0:33:17.208,000 --> 0:33:21,000
and phasing it in would actually give us a way of testing out the paradigm

741
0:33:21.5,000 --> 0:33:22,000
as we went.

742
0:33:22.792,000 --> 0:33:24,000
So for example, for a first phase of rollout,

743
0:33:25.333,000 --> 0:33:26,000
probably what you would want to do,

744
0:33:27.042,000 --> 0:33:29,000
ideally by the end of the next month,

745
0:33:29.292,000 --> 0:33:31,000
would be to have a full range of testing

746
0:33:32,000 --> 0:33:35,000
for a combination of everybody in the health care sector

747
0:33:35.833,000 --> 0:33:37,000
and everybody who might fill in

748
0:33:38.042,000 --> 0:33:4,000
and substitute for any health care workers who test positive.

749
0:33:40.958,000 --> 0:33:42,000
So in other words, your health care worker pool

750
0:33:43.5,000 --> 0:33:45,000
and a substitute pool, say a national service corps,

751
0:33:46.167,000 --> 0:33:49,000
of folks who can fill in for health care workers who test positive.

752
0:33:49.5,000 --> 0:33:53,000
If you can get those two groups, those two sectors

753
0:33:54,000 --> 0:33:56,000
fully under testing, contact-tracing regime,

754
0:33:56.417,000 --> 0:33:58,000
so you know that every health care worker is not positive,

755
0:33:59.292,000 --> 0:34:01,000
and anybody who is is immediately quarantined and so forth,

756
0:34:02.083,000 --> 0:34:04,000
we would stabilize our public health infrastructure,

757
0:34:04.583,000 --> 0:34:06,000
and that would already get about 30 percent of the workforce

758
0:34:07.458,000 --> 0:34:09,000
under this kind of testing and tracing regime.

759
0:34:10.292,000 --> 0:34:12,000
And then you'd move on, with that stabilized,

760
0:34:12.625,000 --> 0:34:14,000
to other critical and essential workers, etc.

761
0:34:15.417,000 --> 0:34:16,000
So the bad news, Chris, is you know,

762
0:34:17.333,000 --> 0:34:2,000
who would be the last people to be folded into this?

763
0:34:20.625,000 --> 0:34:21,000
It would be you, it would be me,

764
0:34:22.173,000 --> 0:34:24,000
the people who can actually telecommute for work, OK.

765
0:34:24.833,000 --> 0:34:28,000
Because we would have the least call on social needs

766
0:34:29.167,000 --> 0:34:3,000
to pull us back out into the workforce.

767
0:34:31.049,000 --> 0:34:33,000
So we'd be the last ones out.

768
0:34:33.208,000 --> 0:34:34,000
But that's a good thing,

769
0:34:34.5,000 --> 0:34:37,000
I think that's a part of making the point that we're all in this together

770
0:34:38.042,000 --> 0:34:4,000
and that there are sacrifices in different places,

771
0:34:40.417,000 --> 0:34:42,000
and service workers, care workers and so forth

772
0:34:42.667,000 --> 0:34:43,000
would be able to get out faster.

773
0:34:44.25,000 --> 0:34:47,000
CA: And that addresses what is definitely one of the most shocking

774
0:34:47.417,000 --> 0:34:49,000
and painful aspects of the current moment,

775
0:34:49.5,000 --> 0:34:51,000
which is, you know, for those of us working from home

776
0:34:52.042,000 --> 0:34:53,000
it feels traumatic,

777
0:34:53.333,000 --> 0:34:56,000
but it's nothing like what others are experiencing,

778
0:34:56.417,000 --> 0:34:59,000
whose livelihood depends on being out there,

779
0:34:59.792,000 --> 0:35:,000
doing, you know, physical work.

780
0:35:01.75,000 --> 0:35:06,000
And so I think it's excellent, obviously, that the plan focuses on them first.

781
0:35:07.542,000 --> 0:35:09,000
How applicable is this to other countries?

782
0:35:10.25,000 --> 0:35:13,000
You're obviously talking -- The plan is developed for the US.

783
0:35:14.875,000 --> 0:35:17,000
It's inspired by what's happened, in some ways, in some Asian countries.

784
0:35:18.5,000 --> 0:35:2,000
Is it applicable to other countries as well?

785
0:35:20.792,000 --> 0:35:21,000
DA: It absolutely is,

786
0:35:22.083,000 --> 0:35:24,000
and we're already seeing Europe move in this way.

787
0:35:24.417,000 --> 0:35:26,000
So Europe and the UK are ahead of the US on this point,

788
0:35:27.042,000 --> 0:35:29,000
I mean, the rough shape of the plan that we're proposing

789
0:35:29.875,000 --> 0:35:32,000
seems to be pretty much the rough shape of the plan that's emerging

790
0:35:33.042,000 --> 0:35:34,000
in Europe and the UK.

791
0:35:34.333,000 --> 0:35:35,000
So I think it's a really important moment

792
0:35:36.333,000 --> 0:35:38,000
to bring together those policy conversations,

793
0:35:38.5,000 --> 0:35:4,000
bring together those modeling conversations

794
0:35:40.583,000 --> 0:35:42,000
and help each other out on this one.

795
0:35:43.042,000 --> 0:35:46,000
CA: And I guess the reason I'm delighted that you're engaged in this

796
0:35:46.292,000 --> 0:35:47,000
is that it's --

797
0:35:49.208,000 --> 0:35:5,000
You know, it's fundamentally framed here

798
0:35:51.167,000 --> 0:35:53,000
as this is a discussion that society has to have.

799
0:35:53.542,000 --> 0:35:55,000
There are ethical choices we have to make here

800
0:35:55.709,000 --> 0:35:56,000
as part of this.

801
0:35:57.417,000 --> 0:36:,000
And so we can't just leave it up to the scientists,

802
0:36:01.042,000 --> 0:36:02,000
as brilliant as they are.

803
0:36:02.833,000 --> 0:36:03,000
And the politicians, for goodness sake.

804
0:36:04.75,000 --> 0:36:07,000
We all need to understand what is at stake here,

805
0:36:08.542,000 --> 0:36:11,000
what the choices are, what the hard choices are

806
0:36:12.25,000 --> 0:36:14,000
and know that any direction is tricky,

807
0:36:14.625,000 --> 0:36:15,000
but we, you know --

808
0:36:16.333,000 --> 0:36:18,000
This really matters.

809
0:36:18.958,000 --> 0:36:19,000
DA: Absolutely.

810
0:36:20.25,000 --> 0:36:22,000
I think you've put it so well.

811
0:36:22.292,000 --> 0:36:25,000
I think that's what makes this kind of question different in a democracy.

812
0:36:25.745,000 --> 0:36:28,000
It really is important that we all collectively achieve understanding,

813
0:36:29.083,000 --> 0:36:31,000
have clarity about the directional options

814
0:36:31.167,000 --> 0:36:35,000
and have a sense of collectively moving in a direction that we desire, right.

815
0:36:35.5,000 --> 0:36:37,000
That we consent to, in a sense.

816
0:36:38.958,000 --> 0:36:39,000
CA: Corey.

817
0:36:40.625,000 --> 0:36:41,000
CH: Hi, I just wanted to come back

818
0:36:42.333,000 --> 0:36:45,000
and give you a little feedback on what people are saying online

819
0:36:46,000 --> 0:36:48,000
in terms of the testing,

820
0:36:48.75,000 --> 0:36:49,000
to be able to go back to work,

821
0:36:50.333,000 --> 0:36:51,000
you know, how people feel about that.

822
0:36:52.167,000 --> 0:36:55,000
Obviously, there's lots of questions about the app and privacy.

823
0:36:55.833,000 --> 0:36:56,000
Some people are hesitant about it,

824
0:36:57.542,000 --> 0:36:59,000
they're wondering whether it will be mandatory,

825
0:36:59.757,000 --> 0:37:01,000
which you touched on.

826
0:37:02.25,000 --> 0:37:04,000
Maybe you will opt in to be able to go back in the office.

827
0:37:05.042,000 --> 0:37:09,000
I'm in, I would test to be able to go back in the office myself,

828
0:37:09.75,000 --> 0:37:11,000
but I think people are wondering about that.

829
0:37:11.875,000 --> 0:37:16,000
But the general consensus is it seems like a reasonable possibility.

830
0:37:17.625,000 --> 0:37:18,000
There are a couple of questions.

831
0:37:19.542,000 --> 0:37:2,000
One I think you just touched on

832
0:37:21.083,000 --> 0:37:23,000
in terms of the global possibilities.

833
0:37:23.667,000 --> 0:37:28,000
Do you see some collaboration on the global landscape,

834
0:37:28.708,000 --> 0:37:29,000
do you see people talking to each other?

835
0:37:30.667,000 --> 0:37:32,000
Obviously, if we want international travel to come back,

836
0:37:33.583,000 --> 0:37:35,000
that seems like a key piece of it.

837
0:37:36.292,000 --> 0:37:37,000
DA: Yes.

838
0:37:37.583,000 --> 0:37:39,000
So I think travel is one of the hardest pieces of this,

839
0:37:40.208,000 --> 0:37:42,000
and actually I don't think that there are good,

840
0:37:42.458,000 --> 0:37:43,000
clear answers on that yet.

841
0:37:43.75,000 --> 0:37:46,000
Scientists are talking to each other across international boundaries

842
0:37:47.042,000 --> 0:37:48,000
without any questions.

843
0:37:48.333,000 --> 0:37:5,000
I think the scientific community is really well

844
0:37:50.667,000 --> 0:37:53,000
and at work, really connected, trying to think about these things.

845
0:37:53.875,000 --> 0:37:56,000
It's not clear to me how well-networked the policy-making community is,

846
0:37:57.25,000 --> 0:37:58,000
in all honesty.

847
0:37:58.542,000 --> 0:38:,000
So I think there's probably a lot of room for building

848
0:38:01.167,000 --> 0:38:05,000
a tighter international network of policy makers on that front.

849
0:38:05.375,000 --> 0:38:07,000
And the hardest part is going to be the travel piece.

850
0:38:08.042,000 --> 0:38:11,000
And honestly, we haven't even talked about parts of the globe

851
0:38:11.958,000 --> 0:38:14,000
like Africa or India, South America,

852
0:38:15.958,000 --> 0:38:18,000
where they're not yet getting towards this policy paradigm.

853
0:38:19.083,000 --> 0:38:23,000
So the virus is going to live in the world, without any question.

854
0:38:23.292,000 --> 0:38:25,000
And live in the world probably in quite significant ways

855
0:38:26.208,000 --> 0:38:28,000
for a considerable period of time.

856
0:38:28.375,000 --> 0:38:3,000
So I think the role of travel restrictions

857
0:38:30.875,000 --> 0:38:33,000
is probably going to be with us for a spell.

858
0:38:34.083,000 --> 0:38:37,000
And so it really does matter that we get the design of those right.

859
0:38:37.833,000 --> 0:38:39,000
I think it's Hong Kong that has a particularly,

860
0:38:40.083,000 --> 0:38:42,000
what looks to me like a sort of, useful regime,

861
0:38:42.5,000 --> 0:38:45,000
where anybody who is coming into Hong Kong for longer than two weeks

862
0:38:46.083,000 --> 0:38:49,000
has to go into 14-day quarantine when they arrive.

863
0:38:49.542,000 --> 0:38:51,000
But for anybody who is coming for a shorter time,

864
0:38:51.852,000 --> 0:38:52,000
they have to be tested when they arrive

865
0:38:53.75,000 --> 0:38:55,000
and then they have to also go through active monitoring

866
0:38:56.417,000 --> 0:38:58,000
during the period of their time in Hong Kong,

867
0:38:58.542,000 --> 0:39:01,000
which means having temperature checks and so forth reported.

868
0:39:02.083,000 --> 0:39:04,000
So I think that's a reasonable thing to do

869
0:39:04.125,000 --> 0:39:07,000
in order to keep business travel up and running,

870
0:39:07.542,000 --> 0:39:1,000
even as we're all trying to deal with controlling the virus.

871
0:39:12.042,000 --> 0:39:14,000
CH: And you also mentioned solidarity

872
0:39:15.042,000 --> 0:39:17,000
and I think that touches on another question

873
0:39:17.125,000 --> 0:39:18,000
that someone brought up online

874
0:39:18.792,000 --> 0:39:24,000
about some of the social impacts after the 1918 epidemic

875
0:39:25.375,000 --> 0:39:26,000
and the fear,

876
0:39:27.208,000 --> 0:39:3,000
and the, you know, the fear of the other,

877
0:39:30.917,000 --> 0:39:32,000
and foreigners and all that.

878
0:39:33.375,000 --> 0:39:35,000
And how do we get through this

879
0:39:35.792,000 --> 0:39:37,000
without that kind of fallout

880
0:39:38.292,000 --> 0:39:4,000
and you know, how do we, kind of, keep ourselves together

881
0:39:41.042,000 --> 0:39:42,000
and looking out for each other?

882
0:39:43.583,000 --> 0:39:45,000
DA: I think that's such a hugely important question.

883
0:39:46.042,000 --> 0:39:48,000
And I mean, in one sense it's easy,

884
0:39:48.208,000 --> 0:39:53,000
because the virus is an adversary to every human being equally, right.

885
0:39:53.833,000 --> 0:39:56,000
We are all completely equal in relationship to it.

886
0:39:57.75,000 --> 0:40:,000
And so what we are really all aspiring to here is

887
0:40:01.458,000 --> 0:40:05,000
sort of transformation of our basic socioeconomic infrastructure

888
0:40:05.667,000 --> 0:40:09,000
in a way that puts us all on a footing to be pandemic-resilient.

889
0:40:09.833,000 --> 0:40:11,000
So I've been using the metaphor

890
0:40:12.167,000 --> 0:40:13,000
we need to put ourselves on a war footing

891
0:40:14.167,000 --> 0:40:16,000
to mobilize the economy to fight the virus,

892
0:40:16.25,000 --> 0:40:19,000
and I stand by that in a sense that we do need to mobilize the economy.

893
0:40:19.792,000 --> 0:40:2,000
But really at the end of the day,

894
0:40:21.417,000 --> 0:40:24,000
it's not a war against a human adversary or anything of that kind.

895
0:40:24.625,000 --> 0:40:25,000
And so what we're really talking about

896
0:40:26.5,000 --> 0:40:28,000
goes back to the questions about the health infrastructure,

897
0:40:29.292,000 --> 0:40:3,000
health care.

898
0:40:30.583,000 --> 0:40:33,000
We're really talking about achieving a transformed peace situation

899
0:40:33.75,000 --> 0:40:35,000
where our economies and our societies are pandemic-resilient.

900
0:40:36.667,000 --> 0:40:37,000
That's the real goal here

901
0:40:38.292,000 --> 0:40:39,000
and it really does require an investment,

902
0:40:40.292,000 --> 0:40:43,000
so because of the 2003 SARS experience,

903
0:40:43.958,000 --> 0:40:47,000
Asian nations have been investing over the last five years or plus,

904
0:40:48.75,000 --> 0:40:51,000
in pandemic-resilient equipment and infrastructure.

905
0:40:52.208,000 --> 0:40:53,000
We haven't done that in the US,

906
0:40:53.75,000 --> 0:40:56,000
so we find ourselves in a position where we have to accelerate

907
0:40:56.774,000 --> 0:40:57,000
in a matter of months,

908
0:40:58.042,000 --> 0:41:01,000
something that has taken other people years to build and develop.

909
0:41:01.833,000 --> 0:41:02,000
So I think really focusing on that,

910
0:41:03.667,000 --> 0:41:07,000
and the goal is an economy that's not vulnerable to pandemic, right.

911
0:41:08.5,000 --> 0:41:1,000
I mean, because we don't want to leave this pandemic

912
0:41:11.042,000 --> 0:41:13,000
and have the economy be just as vulnerable to pandemic

913
0:41:13.667,000 --> 0:41:16,000
at the end of the pandemic as we were at the beginning of it.

914
0:41:16.792,000 --> 0:41:17,000
We don't want to be vulnerable this way.

915
0:41:18.721,000 --> 0:41:19,000
And so in that regard,

916
0:41:2,000 --> 0:41:24,000
the job is to build in that infrastructure for pandemic resilience ASAP.

917
0:41:26,000 --> 0:41:27,000
CA: Wow.

918
0:41:27.292,000 --> 0:41:28,000
CH: Thank you.

919
0:41:28.583,000 --> 0:41:33,000
CA: Danielle, given the price tag you're talking about on this,

920
0:41:34.333,000 --> 0:41:38,000
half a trillion dollars, basically, up to.

921
0:41:38.5,000 --> 0:41:41,000
That's significantly less than some of the multitrillion dollar numbers

922
0:41:41.875,000 --> 0:41:42,000
that are getting thrown around,

923
0:41:43.417,000 --> 0:41:45,000
so, I mean in terms of the scale of the problem,

924
0:41:45.75,000 --> 0:41:46,000
it's probably an appropriate number.

925
0:41:47.583,000 --> 0:41:49,000
But it sounds like, to have any chance of doing this,

926
0:41:50.084,000 --> 0:41:52,000
this would have to be a kind of federal initiative

927
0:41:52.5,000 --> 0:41:53,000
at some level.

928
0:41:53.917,000 --> 0:41:54,000
DA: Yes.

929
0:41:55.292,000 --> 0:41:58,000
CA: We have a problem that more than half the country

930
0:41:58.667,000 --> 0:42:01,000
fundamentally doesn't trust

931
0:42:01.875,000 --> 0:42:03,000
key parts of the administration,

932
0:42:04.208,000 --> 0:42:05,000
let's say.

933
0:42:05.5,000 --> 0:42:08,000
How could this be framed in a way that could build trust

934
0:42:08.708,000 --> 0:42:12,000
and make it feel like this is the country as a whole,

935
0:42:13.042,000 --> 0:42:16,000
that there's this coalition of trusted voices

936
0:42:16.542,000 --> 0:42:19,000
who are the final decision makers on this?

937
0:42:21.542,000 --> 0:42:23,000
DA: So we have this incredible federalist system,

938
0:42:24.542,000 --> 0:42:25,000
and we need to see it as an asset.

939
0:42:26.208,000 --> 0:42:28,000
It's modularized and flexible, and we need to activate that.

940
0:42:29.042,000 --> 0:42:31,000
We do need all the parts of the system working,

941
0:42:31.333,000 --> 0:42:33,000
so we do need the federal government working on behalf of this,

942
0:42:34.333,000 --> 0:42:37,000
we need the state governments working and municipal governments.

943
0:42:37.958,000 --> 0:42:38,000
On the federal end of things,

944
0:42:39.375,000 --> 0:42:4,000
we need Congress to fund.

945
0:42:40.667,000 --> 0:42:41,000
So in the first instance,

946
0:42:41.958,000 --> 0:42:43,000
there's a really big need for funding legislation,

947
0:42:44.833,000 --> 0:42:48,000
and also, Congress can really help by directing investment,

948
0:42:49.125,000 --> 0:42:5,000
not just in the testing program itself,

949
0:42:51.007,000 --> 0:42:53,000
but in the national service corps,

950
0:42:53.083,000 --> 0:42:55,000
probably flowing through state governments,

951
0:42:55.167,000 --> 0:42:57,000
through the national --

952
0:42:57.583,000 --> 0:42:59,000
The reserves in every state.

953
0:43:00.292,000 --> 0:43:01,000
That would be sort of health reserves.

954
0:43:02.208,000 --> 0:43:03,000
You know, really expand that program

955
0:43:04,000 --> 0:43:07,000
with a combination of employment program and backing up that sector.

956
0:43:07.292,000 --> 0:43:09,000
So there's a lot for Congress to do as a part of this.

957
0:43:1,000 --> 0:43:14,000
For the testing program, we really do need the kind of procurement order

958
0:43:14.083,000 --> 0:43:15,000
to produce capacity

959
0:43:15.375,000 --> 0:43:17,000
that the Defense Department is the best example of.

960
0:43:18.167,000 --> 0:43:21,000
So in the ideal, a sort of testing supply board

961
0:43:22,000 --> 0:43:26,000
that brought in leading figures who are masters of supply chain logistics

962
0:43:26.958,000 --> 0:43:27,000
from the private sector,

963
0:43:28.25,000 --> 0:43:3,000
working in close coordination with the federal government

964
0:43:30.941,000 --> 0:43:31,000
would be great.

965
0:43:32.208,000 --> 0:43:35,000
The White House has recently, in the last week or so,

966
0:43:35.417,000 --> 0:43:38,000
begun to put in pieces of architecture that goes in this way,

967
0:43:38.542,000 --> 0:43:41,000
sort of a testing supply czar, for example,

968
0:43:41.583,000 --> 0:43:44,000
an admiral, I believe.

969
0:43:44.625,000 --> 0:43:45,000
So we need people of that kind

970
0:43:46.583,000 --> 0:43:49,000
who are really superb masters of logistics, procurement,

971
0:43:50.208,000 --> 0:43:51,000
contracts and that sort of thing,

972
0:43:51.875,000 --> 0:43:55,000
to be able to ramp up an active, functional supply chain

973
0:43:56.042,000 --> 0:44:,000
for testing to deliver at the order of tens of millions of tests a day.

974
0:44:00.167,000 --> 0:44:02,000
So we do need [unclear], absolutely is a key part of that,

975
0:44:02.917,000 --> 0:44:03,000
key driver of that.

976
0:44:04.208,000 --> 0:44:06,000
And so it's a time for all the parts of our government

977
0:44:06.792,000 --> 0:44:09,000
to come together and do their respective pieces.

978
0:44:11.25,000 --> 0:44:14,000
CA: So I'm kind of in awe at the scale at which you're thinking.

979
0:44:14.333,000 --> 0:44:15,000
I guess as we wrap up here,

980
0:44:16.208,000 --> 0:44:21,000
if I might, I'd love to just go to a bit more personal place.

981
0:44:21.333,000 --> 0:44:23,000
Like, I'm just curious about you

982
0:44:23.625,000 --> 0:44:26,000
and what is it in your past

983
0:44:26.875,000 --> 0:44:28,000
that is, sort of,

984
0:44:29.333,000 --> 0:44:3,000
is providing the fire right now,

985
0:44:30.881,000 --> 0:44:33,000
the drive to try to do this?

986
0:44:34.417,000 --> 0:44:35,000
How are you?

987
0:44:35.708,000 --> 0:44:36,000
How are you feeling about this?

988
0:44:38.708,000 --> 0:44:4,000
Tell us a bit about you, please.

989
0:44:40.875,000 --> 0:44:43,000
DA: Well, that's a very generous question.

990
0:44:45.042,000 --> 0:44:49,000
You know, I love this country.

991
0:44:49.167,000 --> 0:44:51,000
I'll admit that's where the motivation starts from,

992
0:44:52.125,000 --> 0:44:53,000
in the sense that,

993
0:44:53.417,000 --> 0:44:55,000
like, lots of people would say that I'm a global humanitarian,

994
0:44:56.375,000 --> 0:44:58,000
and watching the world succumb to the disease motivates me.

995
0:44:59.208,000 --> 0:45:01,000
I think of Paul Farmer for example, as an example.

996
0:45:01.875,000 --> 0:45:02,000
And I respect that and I get that,

997
0:45:03.583,000 --> 0:45:05,000
but at the end of the day, I love my country.

998
0:45:06,000 --> 0:45:09,000
And it hurt, just hurt, in the beginning of this,

999
0:45:09.583,000 --> 0:45:1,000
and what hurt particularly,

1000
0:45:11.542,000 --> 0:45:15,000
was I was very clear, early on, that I was getting better information

1001
0:45:15.917,000 --> 0:45:16,000
as a member of the Harvard faculty

1002
0:45:17.833,000 --> 0:45:19,000
than my fellow parishioners,

1003
0:45:20.375,000 --> 0:45:24,000
than the people who were serving me in restaurants and cafes,

1004
0:45:24.5,000 --> 0:45:27,000
and it just like, that made me angry, in all honesty.

1005
0:45:28.083,000 --> 0:45:3,000
As a combination of those two things, I was like,

1006
0:45:30.917,000 --> 0:45:31,000
A, I want to understand this,

1007
0:45:32.458,000 --> 0:45:33,000
and B, I want to share what I understand

1008
0:45:34.417,000 --> 0:45:37,000
because it's not fair that people like me get it,

1009
0:45:37.792,000 --> 0:45:39,000
and that's not being shared with other people.

1010
0:45:42.167,000 --> 0:45:44,000
CA: Wow, that's powerful.

1011
0:45:44.417,000 --> 0:45:47,000
I think all of us, we all feel this weird mixture

1012
0:45:47.5,000 --> 0:45:53,000
of almost guilt at how fortunate a position some of us are in.

1013
0:45:53.875,000 --> 0:45:55,000
Certainly a lot of gratitude, anger.

1014
0:45:59.333,000 --> 0:46:04,000
Were you persuaded, Whitney, by this idea, by the possibility of it?

1015
0:46:05.958,000 --> 0:46:06,000
CH: Sorry, you're meaning me.

1016
0:46:07.542,000 --> 0:46:09,000
CA: Sorry! (Laughs) Did I say Whitney?

1017
0:46:1,000 --> 0:46:11,000
CH: Totally OK.

1018
0:46:11.833,000 --> 0:46:12,000
Whitney's your usual pal.

1019
0:46:13.458,000 --> 0:46:15,000
CA: I'm the world's worst person on names,

1020
0:46:15.5,000 --> 0:46:18,000
and Whitney and I have been hanging out here the last few weeks.

1021
0:46:18.583,000 --> 0:46:19,000
Corey.

1022
0:46:19.875,000 --> 0:46:2,000
CH: It's absolutely fine.

1023
0:46:21.167,000 --> 0:46:23,000
Being mistaken for Whitney is a huge compliment.

1024
0:46:24.375,000 --> 0:46:25,000
It's very persuasive,

1025
0:46:25.667,000 --> 0:46:28,000
and I think so hopeful to hear a constructive plan

1026
0:46:29.417,000 --> 0:46:35,000
and a feeling that there is a path out of this that is both possible for us

1027
0:46:35.458,000 --> 0:46:36,000
as humans,

1028
0:46:36.75,000 --> 0:46:37,000
to get back to being together,

1029
0:46:38.292,000 --> 0:46:41,000
but then also as an economy and as a country.

1030
0:46:42.5,000 --> 0:46:44,000
I'm really inspired by your work

1031
0:46:44.708,000 --> 0:46:46,000
and so grateful to you for sharing it with us.

1032
0:46:48.321,000 --> 0:46:49,000
DA: I appreciate that, thank you.

1033
0:46:49.917,000 --> 0:46:51,000
I'm really glad to get a chance to talk about it

1034
0:46:52.208,000 --> 0:46:55,000
and share the knowledge that our group has acquired

1035
0:46:55.833,000 --> 0:46:56,000
over the last month.

1036
0:46:57.125,000 --> 0:46:58,000
So thank you.

1037
0:46:58.458,000 --> 0:47:01,000
CA: So if someone wants to keep in touch with the progress of this idea,

1038
0:47:01.863,000 --> 0:47:02,000
what should they do?

1039
0:47:03.958,000 --> 0:47:06,000
DA: OK, so now I should know our website URL by heart,

1040
0:47:07.5,000 --> 0:47:09,000
but of course, I don't, I'm afraid.

1041
0:47:10.167,000 --> 0:47:14,000
If somebody googles "COVID,"

1042
0:47:14.875,000 --> 0:47:19,000
"Safra," "Allen," that's my surname,

1043
0:47:19.917,000 --> 0:47:2,000
our website will come up.

1044
0:47:21.667,000 --> 0:47:24,000
So if you just remember those three words, "COVID," "Safra," "Allen,"

1045
0:47:25.167,000 --> 0:47:26,000
and Google that,

1046
0:47:26.458,000 --> 0:47:27,000
you should get to our white papers,

1047
0:47:28.417,000 --> 0:47:29,000
op-eds, things like that.

1048
0:47:29.958,000 --> 0:47:32,000
We are hoping to have our full policy road map

1049
0:47:33.125,000 --> 0:47:34,000
published by the end of the week.

1050
0:47:34.958,000 --> 0:47:35,000
That's our target goal.

1051
0:47:37.083,000 --> 0:47:4,000
CA: Yeah. It's: ethics.harvard.edu.

1052
0:47:41,000 --> 0:47:42,000
DA: OK.

1053
0:47:42.792,000 --> 0:47:44,000
Exactly, that takes you to the main landing page,

1054
0:47:45.125,000 --> 0:47:46,000
and then to the COVID site.

1055
0:47:46.542,000 --> 0:47:48,000
CA: And then to the COVID-19 from there, yeah.

1056
0:47:49.208,000 --> 0:47:5,000
DA: Exactly.

1057
0:47:52.25,000 --> 0:47:54,000
CA: Alright, well, thank you so much, Danielle,

1058
0:47:54.625,000 --> 0:47:55,000
I found this absolutely fascinating.

1059
0:47:56.5,000 --> 0:47:57,000
DA: Thank you.

1060
0:47:57.792,000 --> 0:47:58,000
CA: It's going to take --

1061
0:47:59.667,000 --> 0:48:01,000
I mean, this is not an ordinary idea.

1062
0:48:01.917,000 --> 0:48:03,000
We don't often at TED have someone come and say,

1063
0:48:04.833,000 --> 0:48:07,000
"Yeah, I've got this idea for how to spend half a trillion dollars,

1064
0:48:08.208,000 --> 0:48:12,000
and it could make a difference between the US

1065
0:48:12.25,000 --> 0:48:15,000
and other places around the world actually getting the economy going again.

1066
0:48:15.833,000 --> 0:48:2,000
That's not usual, so this has been a gift to us today, thank you for that.

1067
0:48:21.375,000 --> 0:48:22,000
DA: Thank you.

1068
0:48:22.667,000 --> 0:48:24,000
CA: To everyone listening, this is an important debate.

1069
0:48:25.292,000 --> 0:48:26,000
And it's not finished yet,

1070
0:48:26.625,000 --> 0:48:3,000
there will be many other contributions to ideas like this, I think.

1071
0:48:31.625,000 --> 0:48:32,000
DA: That's for sure.

1072
0:48:32.958,000 --> 0:48:34,000
CA: Yeah, chip in, chip in.

1073
0:48:35.208,000 --> 0:48:38,000
Thank you all so much for being part of this today.

1074
0:48:38.792,000 --> 0:48:39,000
We're back again tomorrow.

1075
0:48:40.417,000 --> 0:48:42,000
Corey, do you have details on that?

1076
0:48:43.625,000 --> 0:48:44,000
CH: I do.

1077
0:48:44.917,000 --> 0:48:46,000
And also, you can listen to this conversation

1078
0:48:47.708,000 --> 0:48:5,000
on our website TED.com or on Facebook,

1079
0:48:51.083,000 --> 0:48:54,000
and you can also listen to the recording of it

1080
0:48:54.792,000 --> 0:48:55,000

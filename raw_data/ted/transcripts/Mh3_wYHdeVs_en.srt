1
0:00:12.553,000 --> 0:00:15,000
An image is worth more than a thousand words,

2
0:00:16.395,000 --> 0:00:18,000
so I'm going to start my talk

3
0:00:18.522,000 --> 0:00:2,000
by stop talking and show you a few images

4
0:00:21.19,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I recently captured.

5
0:00:42.712,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So by now, my talk is already 6,000 words long,

6
0:00:46.742,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I feel like I should stop here.

7
0:00:48.89,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:51.31,000 --> 0:00:52,000
At the same time, I probably owe you

9
0:00:53.131,000 --> 0:00:54,000
some explanation

10
0:00:54.137,000 --> 0:00:57,000
about the images that you just saw.

11
0:00:57.24,000 --> 0:00:59,000
What I am trying to do as a photographer,

12
0:00:59.963,000 --> 0:01:01,000
as an artist, is to bring the world

13
0:01:02.446,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of art and science together.

14
0:01:05.823,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Whether it is an image of a soap bubble

15
0:01:08.162,000 --> 0:01:1,000
captured at the very moment where it's bursting,

16
0:01:10.928,000 --> 0:01:12,000
as you can see in this image,

17
0:01:13.4,000 --> 0:01:15,000
whether it's a universe made of tiny little beads

18
0:01:16.008,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of oil paint,

19
0:01:18.506,000 --> 0:01:22,000
strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways,

20
0:01:22.849,000 --> 0:01:26,000
or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces,

21
0:01:27.115,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I'm always trying to link those two fields together.

22
0:01:31.081,000 --> 0:01:33,000
What I find very intriguing about those two

23
0:01:33.471,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is that they both look at the same thing:

24
0:01:36.75,000 --> 0:01:38,000
They are a response to their surroundings.

25
0:01:39.574,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And yet, they do it in a very different way.

26
0:01:43.467,000 --> 0:01:45,000
If you look at science on one hand,

27
0:01:45.514,000 --> 0:01:48,000
science is a very rational approach

28
0:01:48.937,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to its surroundings,

29
0:01:50.418,000 --> 0:01:52,000
whereas art on the other hand

30
0:01:52.507,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings.

31
0:01:56.81,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What I am trying to do is I'm trying

32
0:01:58.827,000 --> 0:02:,000
to bring those two views into one

33
0:02:01.468,000 --> 0:02:04,000
so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart

34
0:02:05.418,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but also to the viewer's brain.

35
0:02:08.612,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects.

36
0:02:13.278,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The first one has to do with making sound visible.

37
0:02:18.332,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now as you may know,

38
0:02:19.35,000 --> 0:02:21,000
sound travels in waves,

39
0:02:21.976,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so if you have a speaker,

40
0:02:24.299,000 --> 0:02:26,000
a speaker actually does nothing else

41
0:02:26.348,000 --> 0:02:27,000
than taking the audio signal,

42
0:02:28.232,000 --> 0:02:31,000
transform it into a vibration,

43
0:02:31.829,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which is then transported through the air,

44
0:02:34.53,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is captured by our ear,

45
0:02:36.392,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and transformed into an audio signal again.

46
0:02:39.933,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now I was thinking,

47
0:02:41.779,000 --> 0:02:45,000
how can I make those sound waves visible?

48
0:02:45.999,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So I came up with the following setup.

49
0:02:48.115,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I took a speaker, I placed a thin foil

50
0:02:51.835,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of plastic on top of that speaker,

51
0:02:54.07,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and then I added tiny little crystals

52
0:02:56.737,000 --> 0:02:57,000
on top of that speaker.

53
0:02:58.714,000 --> 0:03:,000
And now, if I would play a sound through that speaker,

54
0:03:01.614,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it would cause the crystals to move up and down.

55
0:03:05.496,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now this happens very fast,

56
0:03:07.795,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in the blink of an eye,

57
0:03:09.747,000 --> 0:03:12,000
so, together with LG, we captured this motion

58
0:03:13.434,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with a camera that is able

59
0:03:15.12,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to capture more than 3,000 frames per second.

60
0:03:18.595,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Let me show you what this looks like.

61
0:03:22.068,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Music: "Teardrop" by Massive Attack)

62
0:04:03.406,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Applause)

63
0:04:08.724,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Thank you very much.

64
0:04:09.987,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I agree, it looks pretty amazing.

65
0:04:13.231,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But I have to tell you a funny story.

66
0:04:15.59,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I got an indoor sunburn doing this

67
0:04:18.104,000 --> 0:04:2,000
while shooting in Los Angeles.

68
0:04:20.152,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn

69
0:04:22.427,000 --> 0:04:23,000
just on any of the beaches,

70
0:04:24.153,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but I got mine indoors,

71
0:04:26.223,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and what happened is that,

72
0:04:27.932,000 --> 0:04:29,000
if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second,

73
0:04:30.753,000 --> 0:04:34,000
you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.

74
0:04:35.242,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So we had this speaker set up,

75
0:04:37.771,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and we had the camera facing it,

76
0:04:39.37,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and lots of lights pointing at the speaker,

77
0:04:42.756,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I would set up the speaker,

78
0:04:44.111,000 --> 0:04:47,000
put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker,

79
0:04:47.157,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and we would do this over and over again,

80
0:04:49.978,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and it was until midday that I realized

81
0:04:52.739,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that I had a completely red face

82
0:04:55.076,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because of the lights pointing at the speaker.

83
0:04:58.162,000 --> 0:05:,000
What was so funny about it was that

84
0:05:00.468,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the speaker was only coming from the right side,

85
0:05:03.195,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so the right side of my face was completely red

86
0:05:06.562,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera

87
0:05:08.404,000 --> 0:05:1,000
for the rest of the week.

88
0:05:11.246,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Let me now turn to another project

89
0:05:13.349,000 --> 0:05:16,000
which involves less harmful substances.

90
0:05:19.852,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid?

91
0:05:23.492,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Ah, some of you have. Excellent.

92
0:05:26.014,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Should I skip that part?

93
0:05:27.891,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

94
0:05:29.473,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior.

95
0:05:32.736,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's a liquid that is completely black.

96
0:05:34.988,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's got an oily consistency.

97
0:05:37.482,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it,

98
0:05:40.942,000 --> 0:05:42,000
which makes it magnetic.

99
0:05:43.081,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field,

100
0:05:46.634,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it would change its appearance.

101
0:05:49.427,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now I've got a live demonstration over here

102
0:05:53.222,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to show this to you.

103
0:05:59.533,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate,

104
0:06:02.486,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and underneath that plate, there is a magnet.

105
0:06:06.014,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid

106
0:06:09.006,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to that magnet.

107
0:06:17.609,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Let's just slightly move it to the right

108
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent.

109
0:06:30.088,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So what you can see now is that

110
0:06:32.281,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the ferrofluid has formed spikes.

111
0:06:34.678,000 --> 0:06:37,000
This is due to the attraction and the repulsion

112
0:06:38.031,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of the individual particles inside the liquid.

113
0:06:41.74,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now this looks already quite interesting,

114
0:06:43.983,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but let me now add some watercolors to it.

115
0:06:47.537,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Those are just standard watercolors

116
0:06:49.991,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that you would paint with.

117
0:06:51.622,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You wouldn't paint with syringes,

118
0:06:52.965,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but it works just the same.

119
0:07:10.798,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So what happened now is,

120
0:07:12.91,000 --> 0:07:15,000
when the watercolor was flowing into the structure,

121
0:07:16.154,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid.

122
0:07:19.505,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That's because the ferrofluid itself

123
0:07:21.841,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is hydrophobic.

124
0:07:24.024,000 --> 0:07:26,000
That means it doesn't mix with the water.

125
0:07:26.187,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And at the same time, it tries to maintain its position

126
0:07:29.196,000 --> 0:07:3,000
above the magnet,

127
0:07:30.561,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and therefore, it creates those amazing-looking

128
0:07:33.956,000 --> 0:07:36,000
structures of channels and tiny little ponds

129
0:07:37.289,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of colorful water paint.

130
0:07:39.869,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So that was the second project.

131
0:07:41.62,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Let me now turn to the last project,

132
0:07:43.972,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which involves

133
0:07:48.744,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the national beverage of Scotland.

134
0:07:50.834,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:53.154,000 --> 0:07:56,000
This image, and also this one,

136
0:07:57.074,000 --> 0:08:,000
were made using whiskey.

137
0:08:00.345,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Now you might ask yourself,

138
0:08:01.835,000 --> 0:08:02,000
how did he do that?

139
0:08:02.863,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey

140
0:08:04.712,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and then draw the hallucination he got

141
0:08:07.423,000 --> 0:08:1,000
from being drunk onto paper?

142
0:08:11.037,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I can assure you I was fully conscious

143
0:08:13.281,000 --> 0:08:16,000
while I was taking those pictures.

144
0:08:16.391,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now, whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol,

145
0:08:20.493,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and alcohol has got some very interesting properties.

146
0:08:24.729,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Maybe you have experienced

147
0:08:26.42,000 --> 0:08:28,000
some of those properties before,

148
0:08:28.546,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but I am talking about the physical properties,

149
0:08:31.265,000 --> 0:08:33,000
not the other ones.

150
0:08:33.5,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules

151
0:08:37.7,000 --> 0:08:38,000
would spread in the air,

152
0:08:39.043,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance.

153
0:08:43.123,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And at the same time, alcohol is highly flammable.

154
0:08:47.81,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And it was with those two properties

155
0:08:49.959,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that I was able to create the images

156
0:08:52.564,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that you're seeing right now.

157
0:08:54.594,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Let me demonstrate this over here.

158
0:09:04.709,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel.

159
0:09:08.027,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's got nothing in it.

160
0:09:09.336,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen

161
0:09:13.144,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and whiskey.

162
0:09:31.962,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Add some more.

163
0:09:38.171,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now we just wait for a few seconds

164
0:09:40.186,000 --> 0:09:43,000
for the molecules to spread inside the bottle.

165
0:09:43.233,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And now, let's set that on fire.

166
0:09:45.63,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

167
0:10:03.74,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So that's all that happens.

168
0:10:05.278,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It goes really fast, and it's not that impressive.

169
0:10:08.477,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I could do it again to show it one more time,

170
0:10:11.083,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but some would argue that this is a complete waste

171
0:10:13.814,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it.

172
0:10:17.666,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But let me show you a slow motion

173
0:10:19.754,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in a completely darkened room

174
0:10:21.449,000 --> 0:10:26,000
of what I just showed you in this live demonstration.

175
0:10:33.605,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So what happened is that the flame

176
0:10:36.338,000 --> 0:10:39,000
traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom,

177
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
burning the mix of the air molecules

178
0:10:43.379,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and the alcohol.

179
0:10:45.208,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So the images that you saw at the beginning,

180
0:10:48.024,000 --> 0:10:52,000
they are actually a flame stopped in time

181
0:10:52.368,000 --> 0:10:54,000
while it is traveling through the bottle,

182
0:10:54.846,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and you have to imagine

183
0:10:56.064,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it was flipped around 180 degrees.

184
0:10:59.53,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So that's how those images were made.

185
0:11:01.968,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Applause)

186
0:11:06.324,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Thank you.

187
0:11:09.097,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So, I have now showed you three projects,

188
0:11:12.18,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and you might ask yourself, what is it good for?

189
0:11:14.832,000 --> 0:11:15,000
What's the idea behind it?

190
0:11:16.423,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Is it just a waste of whiskey?

191
0:11:17.756,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Is it just some strange materials?

192
0:11:21.981,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Those three projects, they're based on very simple

193
0:11:24.794,000 --> 0:11:25,000
scientific phenomena,

194
0:11:26.456,000 --> 0:11:28,000
such as magnetism, the sound waves,

195
0:11:29.197,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or over here, the physical properties of a substance,

196
0:11:33.239,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and what I'm trying to do

197
0:11:35.151,000 --> 0:11:38,000
is I'm trying to use these phenomena

198
0:11:38.3,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and show them in a poetic and unseen way,

199
0:11:41.417,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and therefore invite the viewer

200
0:11:43.836,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to pause for a moment

201
0:11:45.736,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and think about all the beauty

202
0:11:48.451,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that is constantly surrounding us.

203
0:11:52.394,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Thank you very much.

204
0:11:53.823,000 --> 0:11:57,000
(Applause)

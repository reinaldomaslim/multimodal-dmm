1
0:00:13.039,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The power of yet.

2
0:00:15.944,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I heard about a high school in Chicago

3
0:00:18.547,000 --> 0:00:22,000
where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate,

4
0:00:22.723,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and if they didn't pass a course, they got the grade "Not Yet."

5
0:00:28.246,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I thought that was fantastic,

6
0:00:30.699,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because if you get a failing grade, you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere.

7
0:00:34.484,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But if you get the grade "Not Yet",

8
0:00:37.408,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you understand that you're on a learning curve.

9
0:00:40.927,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It gives you a path into the future.

10
0:00:44.337,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"Not Yet" also gave me insight

11
0:00:48.125,000 --> 0:00:52,000
into a critical event early in my career,

12
0:00:52.425,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a real turning point.

13
0:00:54.598,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I wanted to see

14
0:00:56.093,000 --> 0:01:01,000
how children coped with challenge and difficulty,

15
0:01:01.554,000 --> 0:01:04,000
so I gave 10-year-olds

16
0:01:04.746,000 --> 0:01:07,000
problems that were slightly too hard for them.

17
0:01:09.085,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way.

18
0:01:14.108,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They said things like, "I love a challenge,"

19
0:01:18.132,000 --> 0:01:22,000
or, "You know, I was hoping this would be informative."

20
0:01:23.751,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They understood that their abilities could be developed.

21
0:01:29.71,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They had what I call a growth mindset.

22
0:01:33.581,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But other students felt it was tragic, catastrophic.

23
0:01:38.978,000 --> 0:01:42,000
From their more fixed mindset perspective,

24
0:01:43.279,000 --> 0:01:46,000
their intelligence had been up for judgment,

25
0:01:47.225,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and they failed.

26
0:01:50.219,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet,

27
0:01:55.319,000 --> 0:01:59,000
they were gripped in the tyranny of now.

28
0:01:59.722,000 --> 0:02:,000
So what do they do next?

29
0:02:01.674,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'll tell you what they do next.

30
0:02:04.104,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In one study, they told us they would probably cheat the next time

31
0:02:10.341,000 --> 0:02:13,000
instead of studying more if they failed a test.

32
0:02:14.277,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In another study, after a failure,

33
0:02:17.684,000 --> 0:02:2,000
they looked for someone who did worse than they did

34
0:02:20.823,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so they could feel really good about themselves.

35
0:02:25.327,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And in study after study, they have run from difficulty.

36
0:02:31.461,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain

37
0:02:37.105,000 --> 0:02:4,000
as students confronted an error.

38
0:02:40.251,000 --> 0:02:44,000
On the left, you see the fixed-mindset students.

39
0:02:44.311,000 --> 0:02:46,000
There's hardly any activity.

40
0:02:46.768,000 --> 0:02:48,000
They run from the error.

41
0:02:49.069,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They don't engage with it.

42
0:02:51.694,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But on the right, you have the students with the growth mindset,

43
0:02:55.365,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the idea that abilities can be developed.

44
0:02:59.308,000 --> 0:03:,000
They engage deeply.

45
0:03:01.253,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Their brain is on fire with yet.

46
0:03:04.334,000 --> 0:03:05,000
They engage deeply.

47
0:03:06.652,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They process the error.

48
0:03:08.679,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They learn from it and they correct it.

49
0:03:13.91,000 --> 0:03:15,000
How are we raising our children?

50
0:03:16.6,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Are we raising them for now instead of yet?

51
0:03:21.783,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting As?

52
0:03:26.921,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Are we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams?

53
0:03:32.375,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Their biggest goal is getting the next A, or the next test score?

54
0:03:39.311,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them

55
0:03:45.973,000 --> 0:03:47,000
into their future lives?

56
0:03:48.14,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Maybe, because employers are coming to me and saying,

57
0:03:52.271,000 --> 0:03:55,000
"We have already raised a generation

58
0:03:55.767,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of young workers who can't get through the day

59
0:03:59.873,000 --> 0:04:01,000
without an award."

60
0:04:02.462,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So what can we do?

61
0:04:05.469,000 --> 0:04:08,000
How can we build that bridge to yet?

62
0:04:09.277,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Here are some things we can do.

63
0:04:11.392,000 --> 0:04:14,000
First of all, we can praise wisely,

64
0:04:15.391,000 --> 0:04:18,000
not praising intelligence or talent.

65
0:04:18.623,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That has failed.

66
0:04:20.457,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Don't do that anymore.

67
0:04:22.119,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But praising the process that kids engage in,

68
0:04:26.647,000 --> 0:04:3,000
their effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance,

69
0:04:30.928,000 --> 0:04:31,000
their improvement.

70
0:04:32.601,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient.

71
0:04:39.344,000 --> 0:04:41,000
There are other ways to reward yet.

72
0:04:42.503,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We recently teamed up with game scientists

73
0:04:46.801,000 --> 0:04:48,000
from the University of Washington

74
0:04:48.945,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to create a new online math game that rewarded yet.

75
0:04:54.077,000 --> 0:05:,000
In this game, students were rewarded for effort, strategy and progress.

76
0:05:00.313,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The usual math game

77
0:05:02.869,000 --> 0:05:06,000
rewards you for getting answers right, right now,

78
0:05:07.299,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but this game rewarded process.

79
0:05:10.393,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And we got more effort,

80
0:05:13.184,000 --> 0:05:15,000
more strategies,

81
0:05:15.379,000 --> 0:05:18,000
more engagement over longer periods of time,

82
0:05:19.297,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and more perseverance when they hit really, really hard problems.

83
0:05:25.489,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Just the words "yet" or "not yet," we're finding,

84
0:05:29.107,000 --> 0:05:32,000
give kids greater confidence,

85
0:05:32.575,000 --> 0:05:38,000
give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence.

86
0:05:39.333,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And we can actually change students' mindsets.

87
0:05:44.875,000 --> 0:05:46,000
In one study, we taught them

88
0:05:47.236,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that every time they push out of their comfort zone

89
0:05:51.717,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to learn something new and difficult,

90
0:05:55.163,000 --> 0:06:,000
the neurons in their brain can form new, stronger connections,

91
0:06:00.839,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and over time, they can get smarter.

92
0:06:04.288,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Look what happened: In this study,

93
0:06:06.815,000 --> 0:06:09,000
students who were not taught this growth mindset

94
0:06:10.592,000 --> 0:06:15,000
continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition,

95
0:06:16.342,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades.

96
0:06:23.318,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We have shown this now, this kind of improvement,

97
0:06:29.265,000 --> 0:06:35,000
with thousands and thousands of kids, especially struggling students.

98
0:06:36.072,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So let's talk about equality.

99
0:06:40.291,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In our country, there are groups of students

100
0:06:44.553,000 --> 0:06:46,000
who chronically underperform,

101
0:06:47.372,000 --> 0:06:5,000
for example, children in inner cities,

102
0:06:50.544,000 --> 0:06:53,000
or children on Native American reservations.

103
0:06:54.027,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And they've done so poorly for so long

104
0:06:57.788,000 --> 0:07:,000
that many people think it's inevitable.

105
0:07:01.404,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But when educators create growth mindset classrooms

106
0:07:07.319,000 --> 0:07:09,000
steeped in yet,

107
0:07:09.714,000 --> 0:07:12,000
equality happens.

108
0:07:12.858,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And here are just a few examples.

109
0:07:17.027,000 --> 0:07:22,000
In one year, a kindergarten class in Harlem, New York

110
0:07:22.938,000 --> 0:07:26,000
scored in the 95th percentile

111
0:07:27.461,000 --> 0:07:3,000
on the national achievement test.

112
0:07:30.634,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Many of those kids could not hold a pencil

113
0:07:35.02,000 --> 0:07:37,000
when they arrived at school.

114
0:07:37.776,000 --> 0:07:39,000
In one year,

115
0:07:40.588,000 --> 0:07:44,000
fourth-grade students in the South Bronx, way behind,

116
0:07:45.448,000 --> 0:07:51,000
became the number one fourth-grade class in the state of New York

117
0:07:51.734,000 --> 0:07:53,000
on the state math test.

118
0:07:55.083,000 --> 0:07:59,000
In a year, to a year and a half,

119
0:07:59.427,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Native American students in a school on a reservation

120
0:08:04.801,000 --> 0:08:09,000
went from the bottom of their district to the top,

121
0:08:11.824,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and that district included affluent sections of Seattle.

122
0:08:17.193,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So the Native kids outdid the Microsoft kids.

123
0:08:25.125,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed.

124
0:08:32.921,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Before, effort and difficulty

125
0:08:36.64,000 --> 0:08:41,000
made them feel dumb, made them feel like giving up,

126
0:08:41.841,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but now, effort and difficulty,

127
0:08:45.623,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that's when their neurons are making new connections,

128
0:08:49.159,000 --> 0:08:5,000
stronger connections.

129
0:08:50.968,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That's when they're getting smarter.

130
0:08:54.796,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy.

131
0:09:00.19,000 --> 0:09:03,000
He said, "Dear Professor Dweck,

132
0:09:04.209,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research,

133
0:09:11.182,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and that's why I decided to put it into practice.

134
0:09:16.188,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I put more effort into my schoolwork,

135
0:09:20.099,000 --> 0:09:22,000
into my relationship with my family,

136
0:09:23.054,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and into my relationship with kids at school,

137
0:09:27.302,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas.

138
0:09:34.44,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I now realize I've wasted most of my life."

139
0:09:41.357,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Let's not waste any more lives,

140
0:09:47.096,000 --> 0:09:5,000
because once we know

141
0:09:50.898,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that abilities are capable of such growth,

142
0:09:56.304,000 --> 0:10:02,000
it becomes a basic human right for children, all children,

143
0:10:03.268,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to live in places that create that growth,

144
0:10:08.933,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to live in places filled with "yet".

145
0:10:14.987,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Thank you.

146
0:10:16.162,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Applause)

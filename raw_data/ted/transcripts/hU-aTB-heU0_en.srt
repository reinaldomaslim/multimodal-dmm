1
0:00:12.852,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Last summer, I got a call from a woman named Ellie.

2
0:00:16.049,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And she had heard about the family separations at the southern border

3
0:00:19.313,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and wanted to know what she could do to help.

4
0:00:21.839,000 --> 0:00:24,000
She told me the story of her grandfather and his father.

5
0:00:26.285,000 --> 0:00:28,000
When they were kids in Poland,

6
0:00:28.397,000 --> 0:00:29,000
their father,

7
0:00:29.664,000 --> 0:00:3,000
fearing for his son's safety,

8
0:00:31.592,000 --> 0:00:34,000
gave them a little bit of money and told them to walk west,

9
0:00:34.75,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to just keep walking west across Europe.

10
0:00:37.134,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And they did.

11
0:00:38.317,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They walked all the way west across Europe,

12
0:00:40.359,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and they got on a boat and they got to America.

13
0:00:44.159,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Ellie said that when she heard the stories of the teens

14
0:00:48.203,000 --> 0:00:5,000
walking up across Mexico,

15
0:00:50.623,000 --> 0:00:54,000
all she could think about was her grandfather and his brother.

16
0:00:55.248,000 --> 0:00:58,000
She said that for her, the stories were exactly the same.

17
0:00:59.841,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Those brothers were the Hassenfeld Brothers --

18
0:01:03.456,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the "Has" "bros" --

19
0:01:06.596,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the Hasbro toy company,

20
0:01:08.793,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which, of course, brought us Mr. Potato Head.

21
0:01:13.254,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But that is not actually why I'm telling you this story.

22
0:01:17.302,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I'm telling you this story because it made me think

23
0:01:20.586,000 --> 0:01:23,000
about whether I would have the faith,

24
0:01:23.827,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the courage,

25
0:01:25.396,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to send my teens -- and I have three of them --

26
0:01:28.839,000 --> 0:01:29,000
on a journey like that.

27
0:01:31.169,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Knowing that they wouldn't be safe where we were,

28
0:01:34.6,000 --> 0:01:36,000
would I be able to watch them go?

29
0:01:38.995,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I started my career decades ago at the southern US border,

30
0:01:43.898,000 --> 0:01:45,000
working with Central American asylum seekers.

31
0:01:46.928,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And in the last 16 years, I've been at HIAS,

32
0:01:50.518,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the Jewish organization that fights for refugee rights around the world,

33
0:01:54.643,000 --> 0:01:55,000
as a lawyer and an advocate.

34
0:01:56.919,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And one thing I've learned is that, sometimes,

35
0:02:01.229,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the things that we're told make us safer and stronger

36
0:02:05.143,000 --> 0:02:06,000
actually don't.

37
0:02:07.262,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And, in fact, some of these policies have the opposite of the intended results

38
0:02:12.225,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and in the meantime, cause tremendous and unnecessary suffering.

39
0:02:18.571,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So why are people showing up at our southern border?

40
0:02:21.732,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Most of the immigrants and refugees that are coming to our southern border

41
0:02:25.234,000 --> 0:02:29,000
are fleeing three countries: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

42
0:02:29.952,000 --> 0:02:31,000
These countries are consistently ranked

43
0:02:32.384,000 --> 0:02:35,000
among the most violent countries in the world.

44
0:02:35.719,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's very difficult to be safe in these countries,

45
0:02:38.11,000 --> 0:02:41,000
let alone build a future for yourself and your family.

46
0:02:42.18,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And violence against women and girls is pervasive.

47
0:02:46.021,000 --> 0:02:49,000
People have been fleeing Central America

48
0:02:49.315,000 --> 0:02:5,000
for generations.

49
0:02:50.919,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Generations of refugees have been coming to our shores,

50
0:02:53.551,000 --> 0:02:57,000
fleeing the civil wars of the 1980s,

51
0:02:58.336,000 --> 0:03:,000
in which the United States was deeply involved.

52
0:03:01.227,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is nothing new.

53
0:03:03.169,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What's new is that recently, there's been a spike in families,

54
0:03:07.961,000 --> 0:03:09,000
children and families, showing up at checkpoints

55
0:03:10.779,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and presenting themselves to seek asylum.

56
0:03:14.262,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Now, this has been in the news lately,

57
0:03:16.452,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so I want you to remember a few things as you see those images.

58
0:03:19.794,000 --> 0:03:25,000
One, this is not a historically high level of interceptions at the southern border,

59
0:03:25.912,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and, in fact, people are presenting themselves at checkpoints.

60
0:03:29.444,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Two, people are showing up with the clothes on their backs;

61
0:03:34.339,000 --> 0:03:36,000
some of them are literally in flip-flops.

62
0:03:36.705,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And three, we're the most powerful country in the world.

63
0:03:40.204,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's not a time to panic.

64
0:03:42.601,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's easy from the safety of the destination country

65
0:03:45.151,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to think in terms of absolutes:

66
0:03:47.046,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Is it legal, or is it illegal?

67
0:03:49.734,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But the people who are wrestling with these questions

68
0:03:52.261,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and making these decisions about their families

69
0:03:56.1,000 --> 0:03:58,000
are thinking about very different questions:

70
0:03:58.688,000 --> 0:03:59,000
How do I keep my daughter safe?

71
0:04:01.458,000 --> 0:04:02,000
How do I protect my son?

72
0:04:04.114,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And if you want absolutes,

73
0:04:06.398,000 --> 0:04:09,000
it's absolutely legal to seek asylum.

74
0:04:09.862,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It is a fundamental right in our own laws and in international law.

75
0:04:14.773,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And, in fact --

76
0:04:15.987,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Applause)

77
0:04:22.875,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it stems from the 1951 Refugee Convention,

78
0:04:26.44,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which was the world's response to the Holocaust

79
0:04:29.536,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and a way for countries to say never again would we return people to countries

80
0:04:33.37,000 --> 0:04:35,000
where they would harmed or killed.

81
0:04:36.306,000 --> 0:04:38,000
There are several ways refugees come to this country.

82
0:04:38.851,000 --> 0:04:4,000
One is through the US Refugee Admissions Program.

83
0:04:41.679,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Through that program, the US identifies and selects refugees abroad

84
0:04:45.833,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and brings them to the United States.

85
0:04:48.527,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Last year, the US resettled fewer refugees

86
0:04:52.193,000 --> 0:04:55,000
than at any time since the program began in 1980.

87
0:04:55.898,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And this year, it'll probably be less.

88
0:04:58.8,000 --> 0:05:,000
And this is at a time when we have more refugees in the world

89
0:05:01.787,000 --> 0:05:03,000
than at any other time in recorded history,

90
0:05:03.866,000 --> 0:05:04,000
even since World War II.

91
0:05:06.02,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Another way that refugees come to this country is by seeking asylum.

92
0:05:09.811,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Asylum seekers are people who present themselves at a border

93
0:05:13.12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and say that they'll be persecuted if they're sent back home.

94
0:05:16.448,000 --> 0:05:19,000
An asylum seeker is simply somebody who's going through the process

95
0:05:19.686,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in the United States

96
0:05:20.869,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to prove that they meet the refugee definition.

97
0:05:25.407,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And it's never been more difficult to seek asylum.

98
0:05:28.867,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Border guards are telling people when they show up at our borders

99
0:05:31.969,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that our country's full, that they simply can't apply.

100
0:05:34.542,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This is unprecedented and illegal.

101
0:05:36.828,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Under a new program,

102
0:05:39.092,000 --> 0:05:43,000
with the kind of Orwellian title "Migrant Protection Protocols,"

103
0:05:44.472,000 --> 0:05:46,000
refugees are told they have to wait in Mexico

104
0:05:47.152,000 --> 0:05:5,000
while their cases make their way through the courts in the United States,

105
0:05:50.654,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and this can take months or years.

106
0:05:52.334,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Meanwhile, they're not safe,

107
0:05:54.177,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and they have no access to lawyers.

108
0:05:57.83,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Our country, our government, has detained over 3,000 children,

109
0:06:02.214,000 --> 0:06:04,000
separating them from their parents' arms,

110
0:06:04.815,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as a deterrent from seeking asylum.

111
0:06:07.723,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Many were toddlers,

112
0:06:09.913,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and at least one was a six-year-old blind girl.

113
0:06:12.581,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And this is still going on.

114
0:06:14.812,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We spend billions to detain people in what are virtually prisons

115
0:06:18.704,000 --> 0:06:19,000
who have committed no crime.

116
0:06:22.799,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And family separation has become the hallmark of our immigration system.

117
0:06:28.603,000 --> 0:06:33,000
That's a far cry from a shining city on a hill or a beacon of hope

118
0:06:33.685,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or all of the other ways we like to talk about ourselves and our values.

119
0:06:38.137,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Migration has always been with us, and it always will be.

120
0:06:41.899,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The reasons why people flee -- persecution, war, violence,

121
0:06:45.602,000 --> 0:06:46,000
climate change

122
0:06:47.139,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the ability now to see on your phone what life is like in other places --

123
0:06:51.453,000 --> 0:06:52,000
those pressures are only growing.

124
0:06:54.602,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But there are ways that we can have policies that reflect our values

125
0:07:00.303,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and actually make sense, given the reality in the world.

126
0:07:03.98,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The first thing we need to do is dial back the toxic rhetoric

127
0:07:10.087,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that has been the basis of our national debate on this issue for too long.

128
0:07:15.437,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Applause)

129
0:07:22.702,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I am not an immigrant or a refugee myself,

130
0:07:25.87,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but I take these attacks personally, because my grandparents were.

131
0:07:31.211,000 --> 0:07:35,000
My great-grandmother Rose didn't see her kids for seven years,

132
0:07:35.783,000 --> 0:07:37,000
as she tried to bring them from Poland to New York.

133
0:07:38.269,000 --> 0:07:39,000
She left my grandfather when he was seven

134
0:07:40.224,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and didn't see him again until he was 14.

135
0:07:42.269,000 --> 0:07:43,000
On the other side of my family,

136
0:07:43.889,000 --> 0:07:46,000
my grandmother Aliza left Poland in the 1930s

137
0:07:47.55,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and left for what was then the British Mandate of Palestine,

138
0:07:50.447,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and she never saw her family and friends again.

139
0:07:53.741,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Global cooperation as a response to global migration and displacement

140
0:07:58.819,000 --> 0:08:02,000
would go a long way towards making migration something that isn't a crisis

141
0:08:03.328,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but something that just is,

142
0:08:04.705,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and that we deal with as a global community.

143
0:08:08.488,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Humanitarian aid is also critical.

144
0:08:10.917,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The amount of support we provide to countries in Central America

145
0:08:13.942,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that are sending refugees and migrants

146
0:08:16.395,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is a tiny fraction of the amount we spend on enforcement and detention.

147
0:08:22.756,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And we can absolutely have an asylum system that works.

148
0:08:27.46,000 --> 0:08:29,000
For a tiny fraction of the cost of a wall,

149
0:08:30.204,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we could hire more judges,

150
0:08:31.609,000 --> 0:08:33,000
make sure asylum seekers have lawyers

151
0:08:33.863,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and commit to a humane asylum system.

152
0:08:36.955,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Applause)

153
0:08:45.09,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And we could resettle more refugees.

154
0:08:48.118,000 --> 0:08:51,000
To give you a sense of the decline in the refugee program:

155
0:08:51.315,000 --> 0:08:55,000
three years ago, the US resettled 15,000 Syrian refugees

156
0:08:55.598,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in response to the largest refugee crisis on earth.

157
0:08:58.261,000 --> 0:09:01,000
A year later, that number was 3,000.

158
0:09:01.402,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And last year, that number was 62 people.

159
0:09:06.109,000 --> 0:09:07,000
62 people.

160
0:09:08.819,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Despite the harsh rhetoric and efforts to block immigration,

161
0:09:12.743,000 --> 0:09:13,000
keep refugees out of the country,

162
0:09:14.704,000 --> 0:09:17,000
support for refugees and immigrants in this country, according to polls,

163
0:09:18.109,000 --> 0:09:19,000
has never been higher.

164
0:09:19.376,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Organizations like HIAS, where I work,

165
0:09:21.341,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and other humanitarian and faith-based organizations,

166
0:09:23.873,000 --> 0:09:25,000
make it easy for you to take a stand

167
0:09:26.044,000 --> 0:09:28,000
when there's a law that's worth opposing

168
0:09:28.638,000 --> 0:09:31,000
or a law that's worth supporting or a policy that needs oversight.

169
0:09:32.485,000 --> 0:09:33,000
If you have a phone,

170
0:09:33.86,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you can do something,

171
0:09:35.207,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and if you want to do more, you can.

172
0:09:36.979,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I will tell you that if you see one of these detention centers

173
0:09:40.599,000 --> 0:09:41,000
along the border

174
0:09:41.878,000 --> 0:09:42,000
with children in them -- they're jails --

175
0:09:43.849,000 --> 0:09:44,000
you will never be the same.

176
0:09:47.32,000 --> 0:09:49,000
What I loved so much about my call with Ellie

177
0:09:50.792,000 --> 0:09:53,000
was that she knew in her core that the stories of her grandparents

178
0:09:55.537,000 --> 0:09:57,000
were no different than today's stories,

179
0:09:57.7,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and she wanted to do something about it.

180
0:10:00.974,000 --> 0:10:02,000
If I leave you with one thing,

181
0:10:03.344,000 --> 0:10:05,000
beyond the backstory for Mr. Potato Head,

182
0:10:05.77,000 --> 0:10:08,000
which is, of course, a good story to leave with,

183
0:10:09.222,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it's that a country shows strength

184
0:10:14.522,000 --> 0:10:16,000
through compassion and pragmatism,

185
0:10:16.863,000 --> 0:10:17,000
not through force and through fear.

186
0:10:19.448,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Applause)

187
0:10:29.139,000 --> 0:10:33,000
These stories of the Hassenfelds and my relatives and your relatives

188
0:10:33.329,000 --> 0:10:35,000
are still happening today; they're all the same.

189
0:10:37.269,000 --> 0:10:4,000
A country is strong when it says to the refugee,

190
0:10:40.57,000 --> 0:10:43,000
not, "Go away," but,

191
0:10:43.791,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"It's OK, we've got you, you're safe."

192
0:10:47.112,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Thank you.

193
0:10:48.299,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Applause)

194
0:10:51.148,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Thanks.

195
0:10:52.378,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Applause)

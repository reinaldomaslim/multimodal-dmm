2
0:00:13.518,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The first time

3
0:00:15.422,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I felt fear

4
0:00:17.841,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was 41 years old.

5
0:00:20.502,000 --> 0:00:22,000
People have always said I was brave.

6
0:00:23.499,000 --> 0:00:25,000
When I was little, I'd climb the highest tree,

7
0:00:26.142,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I'd approach any animal fearlessly.

8
0:00:29.821,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I liked challenges.

9
0:00:32.106,000 --> 0:00:33,000
My father used to say,

10
0:00:34.622,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"Good steel can withstand any temperature."

11
0:00:40.153,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And when I entered into Colombian politics,

12
0:00:44.265,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I thought I'd be able to withstand any temperature.

13
0:00:46.77,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I wanted to end corruption;

14
0:00:48.965,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I wanted to cut ties between politicians and drug traffickers.

15
0:00:53.168,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The first time I was elected,

16
0:00:55.85,000 --> 0:00:57,000
it was because I called out, by name,

17
0:00:58.557,000 --> 0:01:01,000
corrupt and untouchable politicians.

18
0:01:02.172,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I also called out the president

19
0:01:05.388,000 --> 0:01:07,000
for his ties to the cartels.

20
0:01:09.46,000 --> 0:01:11,000
That's when the threats started.

21
0:01:12.449,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I had to send my very young children out of the country one morning,

22
0:01:17.805,000 --> 0:01:21,000
hidden, all the way to the airport, in the French ambassador's armored car.

23
0:01:22.425,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Days later,

24
0:01:24.742,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I was the victim of an attack, but emerged unharmed.

25
0:01:28.944,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The following year,

26
0:01:31.135,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the Colombian people elected me with the highest number of votes.

27
0:01:35.755,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I thought people applauded me because I was brave.

28
0:01:40.224,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I, too, thought I was brave.

29
0:01:43.279,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But I wasn't.

30
0:01:46.714,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I had simply never before experienced

31
0:01:50.905,000 --> 0:01:52,000
true fear.

32
0:01:54.557,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That changed

33
0:01:57.066,000 --> 0:01:59,000
on February 23, 2002.

34
0:02:01.066,000 --> 0:02:04,000
At the time, I was a presidential candidate in Colombia

35
0:02:05.029,000 --> 0:02:08,000
promoting my campaign agenda,

36
0:02:08.401,000 --> 0:02:11,000
when I was detained by a group of armed men.

37
0:02:12.222,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They were wearing uniforms with military garments.

38
0:02:16.41,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I looked at their boots; they were rubber.

39
0:02:19.187,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And I knew

40
0:02:20.62,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that the Colombian army wore leather boots.

41
0:02:23.767,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I knew that these were FARC guerrillas.

42
0:02:28.068,000 --> 0:02:3,000
From that point on, everything happened very quickly.

43
0:02:33.457,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The commando leader ordered us to stop the vehicle.

44
0:02:37.891,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Meanwhile, one of his men stepped on an antipersonnel mine

45
0:02:42.704,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and flew through the air.

46
0:02:45.574,000 --> 0:02:47,000
He landed, sitting upright,

47
0:02:48.256,000 --> 0:02:49,000
right in front of me.

48
0:02:49.929,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We made eye contact

49
0:02:52.841,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and it was then that the young man understood:

50
0:02:56.246,000 --> 0:02:58,000
his rubber boot with his leg still in it

51
0:02:58.753,000 --> 0:02:59,000
had landed far away.

52
0:03:01.744,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Sighs)

53
0:03:04.823,000 --> 0:03:05,000
He started

54
0:03:08.689,000 --> 0:03:1,000
screaming like crazy.

55
0:03:12.972,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And the truth is,

56
0:03:14.816,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I felt -- as I feel right now, because I'm reliving these emotions --

57
0:03:20.984,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I felt at that moment that something inside of me was breaking

58
0:03:25.54,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and that I was being infected with his fear.

59
0:03:28.467,000 --> 0:03:3,000
My mind went blank and couldn't think;

60
0:03:31.355,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it was paralyzed.

61
0:03:33.243,000 --> 0:03:34,000
When I finally reacted,

62
0:03:36.879,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I said to myself,

63
0:03:38.716,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"They're going to kill me,

64
0:03:41.128,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and I didn't say goodbye to my children."

65
0:03:46.798,000 --> 0:03:5,000
As they took me into the deepest depths of the jungle,

66
0:03:52.796,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the FARC soldiers announced

67
0:03:55.169,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that if the government didn't negotiate,

68
0:03:58.406,000 --> 0:03:59,000
they'd kill me.

69
0:04:00.674,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And I knew

70
0:04:03.269,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that the government wouldn't negotiate.

71
0:04:07.865,000 --> 0:04:08,000
From that point on,

72
0:04:09.898,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I went to sleep in fear every night --

73
0:04:13.014,000 --> 0:04:14,000
cold sweats,

74
0:04:15.039,000 --> 0:04:16,000
shaking,

75
0:04:17.187,000 --> 0:04:19,000
stomach ache,

76
0:04:19.211,000 --> 0:04:2,000
insomnia.

77
0:04:21.793,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But worse than that was what was happening to my mind,

78
0:04:24.397,000 --> 0:04:28,000
because my memory was being erased: all the phone numbers,

79
0:04:28.92,000 --> 0:04:29,000
addresses,

80
0:04:30.431,000 --> 0:04:32,000
names of very dear people,

81
0:04:32.524,000 --> 0:04:35,000
even significant life events.

82
0:04:38.386,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And so,

83
0:04:40.41,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I began to doubt myself, to doubt my mental health.

84
0:04:44.862,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And with doubt came desperation,

85
0:04:48.565,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and with desperation came depression.

86
0:04:51.787,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I was suffering notorious behavioral changes

87
0:04:54.589,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and it wasn't just paranoia in moments of panic.

88
0:04:58.969,000 --> 0:05:,000
It was distrust,

89
0:05:02.692,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it was hatred,

90
0:05:04.716,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and it was also the urge to kill.

91
0:05:07.574,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This, I realized

92
0:05:09.865,000 --> 0:05:13,000
when they had me chained by the neck to a tree.

93
0:05:15.767,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They kept me outside that day,

94
0:05:20.086,000 --> 0:05:21,000
during a tropical downpour.

95
0:05:23.058,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I remember feeling an urgent need to use the bathroom.

96
0:05:32.832,000 --> 0:05:33,000
"Whatever you have to do,

97
0:05:36.616,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you'll do in front of me,

98
0:05:43.481,000 --> 0:05:44,000
bitch,"

99
0:05:50.871,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the guard screamed at me.

100
0:06:01.121,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And I

101
0:06:04.797,000 --> 0:06:06,000
decided at that moment

102
0:06:16.66,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to kill him.

103
0:06:22.155,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And for days,

104
0:06:26.426,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I was planning, trying to find the right moment, the right way to do it,

105
0:06:30.563,000 --> 0:06:31,000
filled with hatred,

106
0:06:32.072,000 --> 0:06:33,000
filled with fear.

107
0:06:33.984,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Then suddenly,

108
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I rose up,

109
0:06:37.084,000 --> 0:06:38,000
snapped out of it

110
0:06:39.209,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and thought:

111
0:06:41.405,000 --> 0:06:43,000
"I'm not going to become one of them.

112
0:06:43.533,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I'm not going to become an assassin.

113
0:06:46.47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I still have enough freedom

114
0:06:52.756,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to decide

115
0:06:55.327,000 --> 0:06:56,000
who I want to be."

116
0:06:59.832,000 --> 0:07:,000
That's when I learned that fear

117
0:07:04.134,000 --> 0:07:06,000
brought me face to face with myself.

118
0:07:07.047,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It forced me

119
0:07:09.212,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to align my energies,

120
0:07:11.698,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to align my meridians.

121
0:07:15.321,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I learned that facing fear

122
0:07:19.717,000 --> 0:07:22,000
could become a pathway to growth.

123
0:07:25.55,000 --> 0:07:27,000
A lot of emotions arise when I talk about all of this,

124
0:07:28.938,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but when I think back,

125
0:07:32.601,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I'm able to identify

126
0:07:34.979,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the steps I took to do it.

127
0:07:38.093,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I want to share three of them with you.

128
0:07:41.518,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The first

129
0:07:45.383,000 --> 0:07:47,000
was to be guided by principles.

130
0:07:48.426,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Because I realized

131
0:07:49.628,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that in the midst of panic and mental block,

132
0:07:53.309,000 --> 0:07:56,000
if I followed my principles,

133
0:07:56.634,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I acted correctly.

134
0:08:00.265,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I remember the first night

135
0:08:03.46,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in a concentration camp that the guerrillas had built

136
0:08:07.332,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in the middle of the jungle,

137
0:08:09.448,000 --> 0:08:12,000
with 12-foot-high bars,

138
0:08:12.826,000 --> 0:08:13,000
barbed wire,

139
0:08:14.455,000 --> 0:08:16,000
lookouts in the four corners

140
0:08:16.819,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and armed men pointing guns at us 24 hours a day.

141
0:08:21.318,000 --> 0:08:23,000
That morning, the first morning,

142
0:08:24.678,000 --> 0:08:26,000
some men arrived, yelling:

143
0:08:27.409,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"Count off! Count off!"

144
0:08:30.567,000 --> 0:08:34,000
My fellow hostages woke up, startled,

145
0:08:34.77,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and began to identify themselves in numbered sequence.

146
0:08:38.637,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But when it was my turn,

147
0:08:41.732,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I said,

148
0:08:43.858,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"Ingrid Betancourt.

149
0:08:45.227,000 --> 0:08:48,000
If you want to know if I'm here, call me by my name."

150
0:08:49.386,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The guards' fury

151
0:08:52.669,000 --> 0:08:54,000
was nothing compared to that of the other hostages,

152
0:08:55.84,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because, obviously they were scared --

153
0:08:58.939,000 --> 0:08:59,000
we were all scared --

154
0:09:00.372,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and they were afraid that, because of me, they would be punished.

155
0:09:04.476,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But for me,

156
0:09:05.771,000 --> 0:09:11,000
beyond fear was the need to defend my identity,

157
0:09:12.456,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to not let them turn me into a thing or a number.

158
0:09:16.027,000 --> 0:09:17,000
That was one of the principles:

159
0:09:18.138,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to defend

160
0:09:21.416,000 --> 0:09:23,000
what I considered to be human dignity.

161
0:09:25.277,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But make no mistake:

162
0:09:27.204,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the guerrillas had it all

163
0:09:30.534,000 --> 0:09:31,000
very well analyzed --

164
0:09:32.205,000 --> 0:09:34,000
they had been kidnapping for years,

165
0:09:34.42,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and they had developed a technique

166
0:09:38.865,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to break us,

167
0:09:40.494,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to defeat us, to divide us.

168
0:09:42.835,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And so,

169
0:09:44.708,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the second step

170
0:09:47.977,000 --> 0:09:5,000
was to learn how to build supportive trust,

171
0:09:51.008,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to learn how to unite.

172
0:09:55.268,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The jungle is like a different planet.

173
0:09:59.533,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's a world

174
0:10:04.023,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of shadows, of rain,

175
0:10:07.937,000 --> 0:10:11,000
with the hum of millions of bugs --

176
0:10:12.551,000 --> 0:10:14,000
majiña ants, bullet ants.

177
0:10:15.496,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I didn't stop scratching a single day while I was in the jungle.

178
0:10:21.032,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And of course, there were tarantulas, scorpions, anacondas ...

179
0:10:25.643,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I once came face to face with a 24-foot long anaconda

180
0:10:29.87,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that could have swallowed me in one bite.

181
0:10:32.048,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Jaguars ...

182
0:10:33.921,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But I want to tell you

183
0:10:35.945,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that none of these animals did us as much harm

184
0:10:40.741,000 --> 0:10:41,000
as the human beings.

185
0:10:46.979,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The guerrillas terrorized us.

186
0:10:49.665,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They spread rumors.

187
0:10:53.514,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Among the hostages, they sparked betrayals,

188
0:10:57.087,000 --> 0:10:58,000
jealousy,

189
0:10:59.111,000 --> 0:11:,000
resentment,

190
0:11:01.135,000 --> 0:11:02,000
mistrust.

191
0:11:03.595,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The first time I escaped for a long time was with Lucho.

192
0:11:10.093,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Lucho had been a hostage for two years longer than I had.

193
0:11:13.557,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We decided to tie ourselves up

194
0:11:17.51,000 --> 0:11:18,000
with ropes

195
0:11:19.181,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to have the strength to lower ourselves into that dark water

196
0:11:23.622,000 --> 0:11:26,000
full of piranhas and alligators.

197
0:11:28.271,000 --> 0:11:32,000
What we did was, during the day, we would hide in the mangroves.

198
0:11:33.702,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And at night,

199
0:11:35.393,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we would leave, get in the water,

200
0:11:38.377,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and we would swim and let the current carry us.

201
0:11:42.778,000 --> 0:11:44,000
That went on for several days.

202
0:11:45.615,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But Lucho

203
0:11:49.004,000 --> 0:11:5,000
became sick.

204
0:11:50.386,000 --> 0:11:51,000
He was diabetic,

205
0:11:52.41,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and he fell into a diabetic coma.

206
0:11:55.148,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So the guerrillas captured us.

207
0:12:00.618,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But after having lived through that with Lucho,

208
0:12:04.702,000 --> 0:12:06,000
after having faced fear together, united,

209
0:12:08.371,000 --> 0:12:11,000
not punishment, not violence -- nothing --

210
0:12:12.711,000 --> 0:12:15,000
could ever again divide us.

211
0:12:19.128,000 --> 0:12:2,000
What's certain is,

212
0:12:20.938,000 --> 0:12:23,000
all the guerrillas' manipulation was so damaging to us

213
0:12:26.057,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that even today,

214
0:12:28.888,000 --> 0:12:3,000
among some of the hostages

215
0:12:32.586,000 --> 0:12:33,000
from back then,

216
0:12:35.531,000 --> 0:12:36,000
tensions linger,

217
0:12:38.104,000 --> 0:12:41,000
passed down from all that poison

218
0:12:43.586,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that the guerrillas created.

219
0:12:47.745,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The third step

220
0:12:50.459,000 --> 0:12:52,000
is very important to me,

221
0:12:52.88,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and it's a gift that I want to give to you.

222
0:12:56.163,000 --> 0:13:,000
The third step is to learn how to develop faith.

223
0:13:02.994,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I want to explain it like this:

224
0:13:07.61,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Jhon Frank Pinchao

225
0:13:09.929,000 --> 0:13:11,000
was a police officer

226
0:13:12.281,000 --> 0:13:14,000
who had been a hostage for more than eight years.

227
0:13:15.385,000 --> 0:13:18,000
He was famous for being the biggest scaredy-cat of us all.

228
0:13:22.163,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But Pincho -- I called him "Pincho" --

229
0:13:24.942,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Pincho decided that he wanted to escape.

230
0:13:30.192,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And he asked me to help him.

231
0:13:31.579,000 --> 0:13:34,000
By that point, I basically had a master's degree in escape attempts.

232
0:13:35.108,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Laughter)

233
0:13:37.012,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So

234
0:13:40.014,000 --> 0:13:41,000
we got started but we had a delay,

235
0:13:41.773,000 --> 0:13:43,000
because first, Pincho had to learn how to swim.

236
0:13:45.257,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And we had to carry out all these preparations in total secrecy.

237
0:13:50.855,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Anyway, when we finally had everything ready,

238
0:13:54.257,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Pincho came up to me one afternoon and said,

239
0:13:58.451,000 --> 0:14:01,000
"Ingrid, suppose I'm in the jungle,

240
0:14:01.634,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and I go around and around in circles, and I can't find the way out.

241
0:14:05.279,000 --> 0:14:06,000
What do I do?"

242
0:14:07.846,000 --> 0:14:08,000
"Pincho,

243
0:14:10.571,000 --> 0:14:11,000
you grab a phone,

244
0:14:13.06,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and you call the man upstairs."

245
0:14:15.831,000 --> 0:14:18,000
"Ingrid, you know I don't believe in God."

246
0:14:23.577,000 --> 0:14:25,000
"God doesn't care. He'll still help you."

247
0:14:29.079,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Applause)

248
0:14:35.447,000 --> 0:14:37,000
It rained all night that night.

249
0:14:39.024,000 --> 0:14:4,000
The following morning,

250
0:14:41.738,000 --> 0:14:43,000
the camp woke up to a big commotion,

251
0:14:43.837,000 --> 0:14:45,000
because Pincho had fled.

252
0:14:46.545,000 --> 0:14:48,000
They made us dismantle the camp, and we started marching.

253
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
During the march,

254
0:14:52.149,000 --> 0:14:56,000
the head guerrillas told us that Pincho had died,

255
0:14:56.729,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and that they had found his remains

256
0:14:59.888,000 --> 0:15:,000
eaten by an anaconda.

257
0:15:04.379,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Seventeen days passed --

258
0:15:06.097,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and believe me, I counted them, because they were torture for me.

259
0:15:13.98,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But on the seventeenth day,

260
0:15:18.003,000 --> 0:15:19,000
the news exploded from the radio:

261
0:15:19.943,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Pincho was free and obviously alive.

262
0:15:24.024,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And this was the first thing he said:

263
0:15:28.872,000 --> 0:15:3,000
"I know my fellow hostages are listening.

264
0:15:31.633,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Ingrid,

265
0:15:33.151,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I did what you told me.

266
0:15:34.897,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I called the man upstairs,

267
0:15:36.592,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and he sent me the patrol that rescued me from the jungle."

268
0:15:43.284,000 --> 0:15:46,000
That was an extraordinary moment,

269
0:15:46.321,000 --> 0:15:47,000
because ...

270
0:15:48.098,000 --> 0:15:5,000
obviously fear is contagious.

271
0:15:50.729,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But faith is, too.

272
0:15:52.183,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Faith isn't rational or emotional.

273
0:15:55.631,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Faith

274
0:15:57.86,000 --> 0:15:59,000
is an exercise of the will.

275
0:16:01.087,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It's the discipline of the will.

276
0:16:04.173,000 --> 0:16:07,000
It's what allows us to transform everything that we are --

277
0:16:07.668,000 --> 0:16:09,000
our weaknesses, our frailties,

278
0:16:09.99,000 --> 0:16:1,000
into strength, into power.

279
0:16:11.604,000 --> 0:16:13,000
It's truly a transformation.

280
0:16:14.641,000 --> 0:16:16,000
It's what gives us the strength

281
0:16:17.526,000 --> 0:16:18,000
to stand up

282
0:16:20.264,000 --> 0:16:21,000
in the face of fear

283
0:16:22.484,000 --> 0:16:23,000
look above it,

284
0:16:24.232,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and see beyond it.

285
0:16:28.042,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I hope you remember that,

286
0:16:31.605,000 --> 0:16:32,000
because I know we all need

287
0:16:34.463,000 --> 0:16:36,000
to connect with that strength we have inside of us

288
0:16:38.057,000 --> 0:16:42,000
for the times when there's a storm raging around our boat.

289
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Many, many, many, many years passed

290
0:16:49.399,000 --> 0:16:53,000
before I could return to my house.

291
0:16:55.936,000 --> 0:17:,000
But when they took us, handcuffed, into the helicopter

292
0:17:00.989,000 --> 0:17:02,000
that finally took us out of the jungle,

293
0:17:03.068,000 --> 0:17:06,000
everything happened as quickly as when they kidnapped me.

294
0:17:07.797,000 --> 0:17:08,000
In an instant,

295
0:17:09.453,000 --> 0:17:13,000
I saw the guerrilla commander at my feet,

296
0:17:13.5,000 --> 0:17:14,000
gagged,

297
0:17:15.566,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and the rescue leader,

298
0:17:19.01,000 --> 0:17:2,000
yelling:

299
0:17:20.927,000 --> 0:17:23,000
"We're the Colombian army!

300
0:17:24.367,000 --> 0:17:26,000
You are free!"

301
0:17:28.303,000 --> 0:17:29,000
The shriek

302
0:17:30.62,000 --> 0:17:32,000
that came out of all of us

303
0:17:32.716,000 --> 0:17:33,000
when we regained our freedom,

304
0:17:35.201,000 --> 0:17:39,000
continues to vibrate in me to this day.

305
0:17:42.089,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Now,

306
0:17:44.363,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I know they can divide all of us,

307
0:17:47.594,000 --> 0:17:49,000
they can manipulate us all with fear.

308
0:17:52.646,000 --> 0:17:56,000
The "No" vote on the peace referendum in Colombia;

309
0:17:56.938,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Brexit;

310
0:17:58.731,000 --> 0:18:01,000
the idea of a wall between Mexico and the United States;

311
0:18:03.143,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Islamic terrorism --

312
0:18:04.849,000 --> 0:18:08,000
they're all examples of using fear politically

313
0:18:09.855,000 --> 0:18:11,000
to divide and recruit us.

314
0:18:14.19,000 --> 0:18:16,000
We all feel fear.

315
0:18:16.912,000 --> 0:18:19,000
But we can all avoid being recruited

316
0:18:21.254,000 --> 0:18:26,000
using the resources we have -- our principles, unity, faith.

317
0:18:27.659,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Yes, fear is part of the human condition,

318
0:18:31.291,000 --> 0:18:34,000
as well as being necessary for survival.

319
0:18:35.205,000 --> 0:18:36,000
But above all,

320
0:18:36.968,000 --> 0:18:4,000
it's the guide by which each of us builds

321
0:18:42.574,000 --> 0:18:45,000
our identity, our personality.

322
0:18:48.649,000 --> 0:18:54,000
It's true, I was 41 years old the first time I felt fear,

323
0:18:55.653,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and feeling fear was not my decision.

324
0:19:00.061,000 --> 0:19:04,000
But it was my decision what to do with that fear.

325
0:19:07.054,000 --> 0:19:1,000
You can survive

326
0:19:11.46,000 --> 0:19:13,000
crawling along, fearful.

327
0:19:14.898,000 --> 0:19:15,000
But you can also

328
0:19:17.847,000 --> 0:19:19,000
rise above the fear,

329
0:19:20.406,000 --> 0:19:22,000
rise up, spread your wings,

330
0:19:23.242,000 --> 0:19:27,000
and soar, fly high, high, high, high, until you reach the stars,

331
0:19:27.943,000 --> 0:19:3,000
where all of us want to go.

332
0:19:33.367,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Thank you.

333
0:19:34.543,000 --> 0:19:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.254,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When my 91-year-old mother, Elia, moved in with me,

2
0:00:17.23,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I thought I was doing her a service.

3
0:00:20.46,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In fact, it was the other way around.

4
0:00:23.914,000 --> 0:00:27,000
You see, Mom was having issues with memory loss and accepting her age.

5
0:00:29.128,000 --> 0:00:3,000
She looked defeated.

6
0:00:31.914,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I tried to make her as comfortable as possible,

7
0:00:35.353,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but when I was at my easel, painting,

8
0:00:37.773,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I would peek over and see her just ... there.

9
0:00:41.836,000 --> 0:00:44,000
She'd be staring at nothing in particular.

10
0:00:45.633,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'd watch her slowly climb the stairs,

11
0:00:49.411,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and she wasn't the mom I grew up with.

12
0:00:52.053,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I saw, instead, a frail,

13
0:00:55.442,000 --> 0:00:58,000
tiny, old woman.

14
0:01:01.339,000 --> 0:01:04,000
A few weeks went by, and I needed a break from my painting.

15
0:01:04.899,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I wanted to play with the new camera I had just bought.

16
0:01:07.581,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I was excited -- it had all sorts of dials,

17
0:01:10.994,000 --> 0:01:12,000
buttons and settings I wanted to learn,

18
0:01:13.343,000 --> 0:01:17,000
so I set up my tripod facing this large mirror,

19
0:01:18.053,000 --> 0:01:23,000
blocking the doorway to the only bathroom in the house.

20
0:01:23.443,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:25.244,000 --> 0:01:27,000
After a while, I hear,

22
0:01:29.094,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Imitating Italian accent) "I need to use the washroom."

23
0:01:31.76,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:32.785,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"Five minutes, Mom. I need to do this."

25
0:01:36.379,000 --> 0:01:4,000
15 minutes later, and I hear, again,

26
0:01:42.205,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"I need to use the washroom."

27
0:01:45.157,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"Five more minutes."

28
0:01:47.913,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Then this happened.

29
0:01:53.323,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:57.312,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Applause)

31
0:02:05.072,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And this.

32
0:02:09.136,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:14.609,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And then, this.

34
0:02:19.383,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:25.807,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I had my "aha!" moment.

36
0:02:29.198,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We connected.

37
0:02:30.729,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We had something tangible we could do together.

38
0:02:36.991,000 --> 0:02:4,000
My mom was born in a small mountain village in central Italy,

39
0:02:41.349,000 --> 0:02:43,000
where her parents had land and sheep.

40
0:02:44.658,000 --> 0:02:46,000
At a young age, her father died of pneumonia,

41
0:02:47.561,000 --> 0:02:51,000
leaving his wife and two daughters alone with all the heavy chores.

42
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They found that they couldn't cope.

43
0:02:56.363,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So a very hard decision was made.

44
0:02:59.49,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Mom, the oldest, at 13,

45
0:03:02.974,000 --> 0:03:06,000
was married off to a complete stranger twice her age.

46
0:03:08.927,000 --> 0:03:12,000
She went from being just a kid and was pushed into adulthood.

47
0:03:14.621,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Mom had her first child when she was only 16.

48
0:03:20.726,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Years later, and now living in Toronto,

49
0:03:23.744,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Mom got work in a clothing factory

50
0:03:26.054,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and soon became manager of a very large sewing department.

51
0:03:31.839,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And because it was full of immigrant workers,

52
0:03:34.387,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Mom taught herself words from translation books.

53
0:03:38.419,000 --> 0:03:42,000
She then practiced them in French, Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish,

54
0:03:42.792,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Polish, Russian, Romanian, Hungarian, all around the house.

55
0:03:47.695,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I was in awe of her focus and determination to succeed

56
0:03:53.449,000 --> 0:03:55,000
at whatever she loved to do.

57
0:03:56.863,000 --> 0:03:58,000
After that bathroom "aha!" moment,

58
0:03:59.553,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I practiced my newfound camera skills with Mom as portrait model.

59
0:04:05.053,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Through all of this, she talked, and I listened.

60
0:04:08.895,000 --> 0:04:12,000
She'd tell me about her early childhood and how she was feeling now.

61
0:04:13.952,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We had each other's attention.

62
0:04:17.404,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Mom was losing her short-term memory,

63
0:04:19.42,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but was better recalling her younger years.

64
0:04:23.023,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I'd ask, and she would tell me stories.

65
0:04:25.884,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I listened, and I was her audience.

66
0:04:29.932,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I got ideas.

67
0:04:31.377,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I wrote them down, and I sketched them out.

68
0:04:34.926,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I showed her what to do by acting out the scenarios myself.

69
0:04:40.038,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We would then stage them.

70
0:04:42.434,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So she posed, and I learned more about photography.

71
0:04:48.585,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Mom loved the process, the acting.

72
0:04:53.18,000 --> 0:04:57,000
She felt worthy again, she felt wanted and needed.

73
0:04:58.419,000 --> 0:05:,000
And she certainly wasn't camera-shy.

74
0:05:00.768,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

75
0:05:04.564,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Applause)

76
0:05:12.748,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Mom laughed hysterically at this one.

77
0:05:16.236,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

78
0:05:19.093,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The idea for this image came from an old German film I'd seen,

79
0:05:23.571,000 --> 0:05:25,000
about a submarine, called "Das Boot."

80
0:05:26.483,000 --> 0:05:29,000
As you can see, what I got instead looked more like "E.T."

81
0:05:30.268,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

82
0:05:32.173,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So I put this image aside, thinking it was a total failure,

83
0:05:35.863,000 --> 0:05:37,000
because it didn't reach my particular vision.

84
0:05:38.752,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But Mom laughed so hard,

85
0:05:41.164,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I eventually, for fun, decided to post it online anyway.

86
0:05:47.129,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It got an incredible amount of attention.

87
0:05:51.875,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, with any Alzheimer's, dementia,

88
0:05:56.046,000 --> 0:05:59,000
there's a certain amount of frustration and sadness

89
0:05:59.823,000 --> 0:06:,000
for everyone involved.

90
0:06:02.434,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is Mom's silent scream.

91
0:06:06.53,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Her words to me one day were,

92
0:06:08.736,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"Why is my head so full of things to say,

93
0:06:12.974,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but before they reach my mouth, I forget what they are?"

94
0:06:20.239,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"Why is my head so full of things to say,

95
0:06:27.946,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but before they reach my mouth, I forget what they are?"

96
0:06:33.968,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Applause)

97
0:06:44.564,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now, as full-time care partner and full-time painter,

98
0:06:49.842,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I had my frustrations too.

99
0:06:53.009,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

100
0:06:55.588,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But to balance off all the difficulties, we played.

101
0:06:58.866,000 --> 0:06:59,000
That was Mom's happy place.

102
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And I needed her to be there, too.

103
0:07:05.909,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

104
0:07:10.11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

105
0:07:15.093,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

106
0:07:19.196,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now, Mom was also preoccupied with aging.

107
0:07:22.45,000 --> 0:07:26,000
She would say, "How did I get so old, so fast?"

108
0:07:29.77,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Audience sighs)

109
0:07:41.996,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"So old."

110
0:07:48.795,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"So fast."

111
0:07:53.292,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I also got Mom to model for my oil paintings.

112
0:07:57.942,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This painting is called "The Dressmaker."

113
0:08:02.101,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I remember, as a kid,

114
0:08:05.109,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Mom sewing clothes for the whole family

115
0:08:07.847,000 --> 0:08:1,000
on this massive, heavy sewing machine

116
0:08:11.388,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that was bolted to the floor in the basement.

117
0:08:15.173,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Many nights, I would go downstairs and bring my schoolwork with me.

118
0:08:20.808,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I would sit behind her in this overstuffed chair.

119
0:08:25.935,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The low hum of the huge motor and the repetitive stitching sounds

120
0:08:30.784,000 --> 0:08:31,000
were comforting to me.

121
0:08:33.612,000 --> 0:08:34,000
When Mom moved into my house,

122
0:08:35.469,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I saved this machine and stored it in my studio for safekeeping.

123
0:08:40.22,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This painting brought me back to my childhood.

124
0:08:44.284,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The interesting part

125
0:08:46.123,000 --> 0:08:49,000
was that it was now Mom, sitting behind me,

126
0:08:51.181,000 --> 0:08:53,000
watching me paint her

127
0:08:53.451,000 --> 0:08:55,000
working on that very same machine she sewed at

128
0:08:57.276,000 --> 0:09:01,000
when I sat behind her, watching her sew,

129
0:09:01.546,000 --> 0:09:03,000
50 years earlier.

130
0:09:07.466,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I also gave Mom a project to do, to keep her busy and thinking.

131
0:09:11.831,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I provided her with a small camera

132
0:09:14.022,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and asked her to take at least 10 pictures a day of anything she wanted.

133
0:09:18.545,000 --> 0:09:19,000
These are Mom's photographs.

134
0:09:21.411,000 --> 0:09:24,000
She's never held a camera in her life before this.

135
0:09:25.625,000 --> 0:09:26,000
She was 93.

136
0:09:53.386,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We would sit down together and talk about our work.

137
0:09:57.187,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I would try to explain

138
0:09:58.886,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

139
0:10:00.068,000 --> 0:10:02,000
how and why I did them,

140
0:10:03.014,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the meaning, the feeling, why they were relevant.

141
0:10:07.49,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Mom, on the other hand, would just bluntly say,

142
0:10:10.879,000 --> 0:10:11,000
"sì,"

143
0:10:12.077,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"no,"

144
0:10:13.585,000 --> 0:10:15,000
"bella" or "bruta."

145
0:10:15.744,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

146
0:10:17.347,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I watched her facial expressions.

147
0:10:21.681,000 --> 0:10:25,000
She always had the last say, with words or without.

148
0:10:28.641,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This voyage of discovery hasn't ended with Mom.

149
0:10:33.705,000 --> 0:10:36,000
She is now in an assisted living residence,

150
0:10:37.205,000 --> 0:10:39,000
a 10-minute walk away from my home.

151
0:10:41.038,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I visit her every other day.

152
0:10:45.651,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Her dementia had gotten to the point

153
0:10:47.429,000 --> 0:10:49,000
where it was unsafe for her to be in my house.

154
0:10:50.667,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It has a lot of stairs.

155
0:10:54.546,000 --> 0:10:56,000
She doesn't know my name anymore.

156
0:10:58.76,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Voice breaking) But you know what? That's OK.

157
0:11:02.783,000 --> 0:11:04,000
She still recognizes my face

158
0:11:05.338,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and always has a big smile when she sees me.

159
0:11:10.813,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Applause)

160
0:11:23.219,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Applause ends)

161
0:11:25.077,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I don't take pictures of her anymore.

162
0:11:28.292,000 --> 0:11:3,000
That wouldn't be fair or ethical on my part.

163
0:11:32.49,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And she wouldn't understand the reasons for doing them.

164
0:11:36.394,000 --> 0:11:37,000
My father,

165
0:11:38.395,000 --> 0:11:39,000
my brother,

166
0:11:40.253,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Voice breaking) my nephew,

167
0:11:46.893,000 --> 0:11:48,000
my partner and my best friend,

168
0:11:49.378,000 --> 0:11:5,000
all passed away suddenly.

169
0:11:51.98,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And I didn't have the chance

170
0:11:54.022,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to tell them how much I appreciated and loved them.

171
0:11:58.807,000 --> 0:12:01,000
With Mom, I need to be there

172
0:12:02.764,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and make it a very long goodbye.

173
0:12:09.066,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Applause)

174
0:12:20.811,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Applause ends)

175
0:12:22.684,000 --> 0:12:26,000
For me, it's about being present and really listening.

176
0:12:27.382,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Dependents want to feel a part of something, anything.

177
0:12:30.573,000 --> 0:12:33,000
It doesn't need to be something exceptionally profound that's shared --

178
0:12:35.041,000 --> 0:12:37,000
it could be as simple as walks together.

179
0:12:38.635,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Give them a voice

180
0:12:41.262,000 --> 0:12:44,000
of interaction, participation,

181
0:12:44.582,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and a feeling of belonging.

182
0:12:48.363,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Make the time meaningful.

183
0:12:52.688,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Life, it's about wanting to live

184
0:12:56.141,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and not waiting to die.

185
0:13:01.787,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Applause)

186
0:13:11.339,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Applause ends)

187
0:13:14.776,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Can I get a wave and a smile from everyone, please?

188
0:13:18.665,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

189
0:13:20.188,000 --> 0:13:21,000
This is for you, Mom.

190
0:13:23.554,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Camera clicks)

191
0:13:25.571,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Applause)

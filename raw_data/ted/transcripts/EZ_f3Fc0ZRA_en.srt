1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I have a doppelganger.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Dr. Gero is a brilliant

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but slightly mad scientist

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga."

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If you look very carefully,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
you see that his skull has been replaced

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with a transparent Plexiglas dome

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
so that the workings of his brain can be observed

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and also controlled with light.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That's exactly what I do --

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
optical mind control.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But in contrast to my evil twin

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
who lusts after world domination,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
my motives are not sinister.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I control the brain

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
in order to understand how it works.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now wait a minute, you may say,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
how can you go straight to controlling the brain

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
without understanding it first?

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Many neuroscientists agree with this view

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and think that understanding will come

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
from more detailed observation and analysis.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons,

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we would understand the brain."

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But think for a moment what that means.

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Even if we could measure

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
what every cell is doing at all times,

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we would still have to make sense

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of the recorded activity patterns,

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and that's so difficult,

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
chances are we'll understand these patterns

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
just as little as the brains that produce them.

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Take a look at what brain activity might look like.

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
In this simulation, each black dot

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is one nerve cell.

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The dot is visible

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse.

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
There's 10,000 neurons here.

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
So you're looking at roughly one percent

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of the brain of a cockroach.

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Your brains are about 100 million times

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
more complicated.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Somewhere, in a pattern like this,

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is you,

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
your perceptions,

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
your emotions, your memories,

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
your plans for the future.

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But we don't know where,

52
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
since we don't know how to read the pattern.

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We don't understand the code used by the brain.

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
To make progress,

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we need to break the code.

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But how?

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
An experienced code-breaker will tell you

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it's essential to be able to play with them,

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to rearrange them at will.

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So in this situation too,

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to decode the information

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
contained in patterns like this,

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
watching alone won't do.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We need to rearrange the pattern.

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In other words,

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
instead of recording the activity of neurons,

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we need to control it.

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's not essential that we can control

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The more targeted our interventions, the better.

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I'll show you in a moment

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
how we can achieve the necessary precision.

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose,

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
will at once unravel all its mysteries.

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But we'll certainly learn a lot.

78
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, I'm by no means

79
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the first person to realize

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
how powerful a tool intervention is.

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The history of attempts

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to tinker with the function of the nervous system

83
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is long and illustrious.

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It dates back at least 200 years,

85
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to Galvani's famous experiments

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in the late 18th century and beyond.

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
when he connected the lumbar nerve

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to a source of electrical current.

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
nugget of the neural code:

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that information is written in the form

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of electrical impulses.

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Galvani's approach

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
of probing the nervous system with electrodes

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
has remained state-of-the-art until today,

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
despite a number of drawbacks.

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.

99
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's hard to do in animals that run around,

100
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and there is a physical limit

101
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to the number of wires

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that can be inserted simultaneously.

103
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So around the turn of the last century,

104
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I started to think,

105
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic

106
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and turn it upside down?"

107
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So instead of inserting a wire

108
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
into one spot of the brain,

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
re-engineer the brain itself

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
so that some of its neural elements

111
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
such as a flash of light.

113
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light,

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
overcome many of the obstacles to discovery.

115
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
First, it's clearly a non-invasive,

116
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
wireless form of communication.

117
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And second, just as in a radio broadcast,

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
you can communicate with many receivers at once.

119
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You don't need to know where these receivers are,

120
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it doesn't matter if these receivers move --

121
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
just think of the stereo in your car.

122
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It gets even better,

123
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers

124
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
out of materials that are encoded in DNA.

125
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So each nerve cell

126
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
with the right genetic makeup

127
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
will spontaneously produce a receiver

128
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that allows us to control its function.

129
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I hope you'll appreciate

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the beautiful simplicity

131
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
of this concept.

132
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There's no high-tech gizmos here,

133
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
just biology revealed through biology.

134
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close.

135
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,

136
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we see that its outer membrane

137
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is studded with microscopic pores.

138
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Pores like these conduct electrical current

139
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and are responsible

140
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for all the communication in the nervous system.

141
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But these pores here are special.

142
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
They are coupled to light receptors

143
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
similar to the ones in your eyes.

144
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor,

145
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,

146
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and the neuron fires electrical impulses.

147
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,

148
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we can achieve incredible precision.

149
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is because,

150
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
although each cell in our bodies

151
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
contains the same set of genes,

152
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
different mixes of genes get turned on and off

153
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in different cells.

154
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You can exploit this to make sure

155
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that only some neurons

156
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
contain our light-activated pore and others don't.

157
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell

158
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in the upper-left corner

159
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
does not respond to light

160
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
because it lacks the light-activated pore.

161
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The approach works so well

162
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that we can write purely artificial messages

163
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
directly to the brain.

164
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
In this example, each electrical impulse,

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
each deflection on the trace,

166
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is caused by a brief pulse of light.

167
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And the approach, of course, also works

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in moving, behaving animals.

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is the first ever such experiment,

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's.

171
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It was done six or seven years ago

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
by my then graduate student, Susana Lima.

173
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left

174
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain

175
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
expressed the light-activated pore.

176
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You're familiar with these cells

177
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
because they are the ones that frustrate you

178
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
when you try to swat the fly.

179
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air

180
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and fly away whenever you move your hand in position.

181
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.

182
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,

183
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but it can't actually take off

184
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.

185
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly

186
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to a flash it could see,

187
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Susana did a simple

188
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but brutally effective experiment.

189
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
She cut the heads off of her flies.

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
These headless bodies can live for about a day,

191
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but they don't do much.

192
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
They just stand around

193
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and groom excessively.

194
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.

195
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Anyway, as you'll see in a moment,

197
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Susana was able to turn on the flight motor

198
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies

199
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and get some of the headless bodies

200
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to actually take off and fly away.

201
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They didn't get very far, obviously.

202
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Since we took these first steps,

203
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the field of optogenetics has exploded.

204
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And there are now hundreds of labs

205
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
using these approaches.

206
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And we've come a long way

207
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
since Galvani's and Susana's first successes

208
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in making animals twitch or jump.

209
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We can now actually interfere with their psychology

210
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
in rather profound ways,

211
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
as I'll show you in my last example,

212
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
which is directed at a familiar question.

213
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Life is a string of choices

214
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.

215
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We cope with this pressure by having brains,

216
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and within our brains, decision-making centers

217
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that I've called here the "Actor."

218
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The Actor implements a policy that takes into account

219
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the state of the environment

220
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and the context in which we operate.

221
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Our actions change the environment, or context,

222
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.

223
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Now to put some neurobiological meat

224
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
on this abstract model,

225
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
we constructed a simple one-dimensional world

226
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for our favorite subject, fruit flies.

227
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks

228
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
contains one fly.

229
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The left and the right halves of the chamber

230
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
are filled with two different odors,

231
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and a security camera watches

232
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
as the flies pace up and down between them.

233
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Here's some such CCTV footage.

234
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber

235
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
where the two odor streams meet,

236
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
it has to make a decision.

237
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It has to decide whether to turn around

238
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and stay in the same odor,

239
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
or whether to cross the midline

240
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and try something new.

241
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
These decisions are clearly a reflection

242
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
of the Actor's policy.

243
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Now for an intelligent being like our fly,

244
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
this policy is not written in stone

245
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but rather changes as the animal learns from experience.

246
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We can incorporate such an element

247
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
of adaptive intelligence into our model

248
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
by assuming that the fly's brain

249
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
contains not only an Actor,

250
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but a different group of cells,

251
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
a "Critic," that provides a running commentary

252
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
on the Actor's choices.

253
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You can think of this nagging inner voice

254
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
as sort of the brain's equivalent

255
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of the Catholic Church,

256
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
if you're an Austrian like me,

257
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
or the super-ego, if you're Freudian,

258
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
or your mother, if you're Jewish.

259
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Laughter)

260
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Now obviously,

261
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
the Critic is a key ingredient

262
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in what makes us intelligent.

263
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So we set out to identify

264
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the cells in the fly's brain

265
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that played the role of the Critic.

266
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And the logic of our experiment was simple.

267
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We thought if we could use our optical remote control

268
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to activate the cells of the Critic,

269
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor

270
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
into changing its policy.

271
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
In other words,

272
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
the fly should learn from mistakes

273
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that it thought it had made

274
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but, in reality, it had not made.

275
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So we bred flies

276
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
whose brains were more or less randomly peppered

277
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
with cells that were light addressable.

278
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And then we took these flies

279
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and allowed them to make choices.

280
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And whenever they made one of the two choices,

281
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
chose one odor,

282
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in this case the blue one over the orange one,

283
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
we switched on the lights.

284
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
If the Critic was among the optically activated cells,

285
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the result of this intervention

286
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
should be a change in policy.

287
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
The fly should learn to avoid

288
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
the optically reinforced odor.

289
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Here's what happened in two instances:

290
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We're comparing two strains of flies,

291
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
each of them having

292
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,

293
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
shown here in green on the left and on the right.

294
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
What's common among these groups of cells

295
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.

296
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But the identities of the individual

297
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
dopamine-producing neurons

298
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
are clearly largely different on the left and on the right.

299
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Optically activating

300
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
these hundred or so cells

301
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
into two strains of flies

302
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
has dramatically different consequences.

303
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
If you look first at the behavior

304
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
of the fly on the right,

305
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber

306
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
where the two odors meet,

307
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
it marches straight through, as it did before.

308
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Its behavior is completely unchanged.

309
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.

310
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint,

311
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
it pauses,

312
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it carefully scans the odor interface

313
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
as if it was sniffing out its environment,

314
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and then it turns around.

315
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
This means that the policy that the Actor implements

316
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
now includes an instruction to avoid the odor

317
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that's in the right half of the chamber.

318
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
This means that the Critic

319
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
must have spoken in that animal,

320
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and that the Critic must be contained

321
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,

322
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.

323
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Through many such experiments,

324
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
we were able to narrow down

325
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the identity of the Critic

326
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
to just 12 cells.

327
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
These 12 cells, as shown here in green,

328
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
send the output to a brain structure

329
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
called the "mushroom body,"

330
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which is shown here in gray.

331
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We know from our formal model

332
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that the brain structure

333
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor.

334
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So this anatomy suggests

335
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that the mushroom bodies have something to do

336
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
with action choice.

337
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,

338
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
this makes perfect sense.

339
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
In fact, it makes so much sense

340
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that we can construct an electronic toy circuit

341
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that simulates the behavior of the fly.

342
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
In this electronic toy circuit,

343
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
the mushroom body neurons are symbolized

344
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
by the vertical bank of blue LEDs

345
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
in the center of the board.

346
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
These LED's are wired to sensors

347
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.

348
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Each odor activates a different combination of sensors,

349
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
which in turn activates

350
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
a different odor detector in the mushroom body.

351
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,

352
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
the Actor,

353
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
can tell which odor is present

354
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.

355
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
What the Actor does with this information

356
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
depends on its policy,

357
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
which is stored in the strengths of the connection,

358
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
between the odor detectors

359
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and the motors

360
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that power the fly's evasive actions.

361
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off

362
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and the fly will continue straight on its course.

363
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on

364
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and the fly will initiate a turn.

365
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Now consider a situation

366
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
in which the motors stay off,

367
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the fly continues on its path

368
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and it suffers some painful consequence

369
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
such as getting zapped.

370
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
In a situation like this,

371
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
we would expect the Critic to speak up

372
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and to tell the Actor

373
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
to change its policy.

374
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We have created such a situation, artificially,

375
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
by turning on the critic with a flash of light.

376
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
That caused a strengthening of the connections

377
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
between the currently active odor detector

378
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and the motors.

379
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
So the next time

380
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
the fly finds itself facing the same odor again,

381
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors

382
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and to trigger an evasive maneuver.

383
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I don't know about you,

384
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
but I find it exhilarating to see

385
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
how vague psychological notions

386
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
evaporate and give rise

387
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,

388
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
even if it's the mind of the fly.

389
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
This is one piece of good news.

390
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
The other piece of good news,

391
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
for a scientist at least,

392
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
is that much remains to be discovered.

393
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
In the experiments I told you about,

394
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
we have lifted the identity of the Critic,

395
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
but we still have no idea

396
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
how the Critic does its job.

397
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong

398
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
without a teacher, or your mother, telling you,

399
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
is a very hard problem.

400
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
There are some ideas in computer science

401
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and in artificial intelligence

402
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
as to how this might be done,

403
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
but we still haven't solved

404
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
a single example

405
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
of how intelligent behavior

406
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
springs from the physical interactions

407
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
in living matter.

408
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I think we'll get there in the not too distant future.

409
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Thank you.

410
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Applause)

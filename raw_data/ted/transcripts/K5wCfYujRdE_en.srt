1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's the Second World War.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A German prison camp.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And this man,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Archie Cochrane,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is a prisoner of war and a doctor,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and he has a problem.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The problem is that the men under his care

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
are suffering

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from an excruciating and debilitating condition

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that Archie doesn't really understand.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The symptoms

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But he doesn't know whether it's an infection, whether it's to do with malnutrition.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
He doesn't know how to cure it.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And he's operating in a hostile environment.

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And people do terrible things in wars.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The German camp guards, they've got bored.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for fun.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
On one particular occasion,

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
while it was full of prisoners.

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
He said he heard suspicious laughter.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor,

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
was one of the first men in

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to clear up the mess.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And one more thing:

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Archie was suffering from this illness himself.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So the situation seemed pretty desperate.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But Archie Cochrane

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
was a resourceful person.

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp,

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and now he managed

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to get hold of supplies of marmite

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
on the black market.

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is.

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British.

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It looks like crude oil.

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It tastes ...

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
zesty.

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And importantly,

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
it's a rich source

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of vitamin B12.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
into two equal groups.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
He gives half of them vitamin C.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He gives half of them vitamin B12.

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He very carefully and meticulously notes his results

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in an exercise book.

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And after just a few days,

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it becomes clear

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that whatever is causing this illness,

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
marmite is the cure.

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp.

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now you've got to imagine at the moment --

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
forget this photo, imagine this guy

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair.

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
He hasn't been able to shave -- a sort of Billy Connolly figure.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Cochrane, he starts ranting at these Germans

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in this Scottish accent --

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent --

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and explains to them how German culture was the culture

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And he can't understand

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
how this barbarism can be tolerated,

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and he vents his frustrations.

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And then he goes back to his quarters,

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
breaks down and weeps

69
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because he's convinced that the situation is hopeless.

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But a young German doctor

71
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and says to his colleagues,

73
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"This evidence is incontrovertible.

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners,

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it's a war crime."

76
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And the next morning,

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
supplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp,

78
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and the prisoners begin to recover.

79
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Now I'm not telling you this story

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude,

81
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
although Archie Cochrane is a dude.

82
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I'm not even telling you the story

83
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because I think we should be running

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
more carefully controlled randomized trials

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in all aspects of public policy,

86
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
although I think that would also be completely awesome.

87
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'm telling you this story

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because Archie Cochrane, all his life,

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
fought against a terrible affliction,

90
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and he realized it was debilitating to individuals

91
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and it was corrosive to societies.

92
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And he had a name for it.

93
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
He called it the God complex.

94
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.

95
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So the symptoms of the complex

96
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
are, no matter how complicated the problem,

97
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you have an absolutely overwhelming belief

98
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that you are infallibly right in your solution.

99
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now Archie was a doctor,

100
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so he hung around with doctors a lot.

101
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.

102
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor,

103
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but I see the God complex around me all the time

104
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in my fellow economists.

105
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I see it in our business leaders.

106
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I see it in the politicians we vote for --

107
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
people who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world,

108
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
are nevertheless absolutely convinced

109
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that they understand the way that the world works.

110
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about,

111
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the world is simply far too complex

112
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to understand in that way.

113
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Well let me give you an example.

114
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Imagine for a moment

115
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that, instead of Tim Harford in front of you,

116
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.

117
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You know Hans:

118
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the Mick Jagger of TED.

119
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics,

121
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
these amazing animations.

122
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But a typical Hans Rosling graph:

124
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
think for a moment, not what it shows,

125
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but think instead about what it leaves out.

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So it'll show you GDP per capita,

127
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
population, longevity,

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that's about it.

129
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So three pieces of data for each country --

130
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
three pieces of data.

131
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Three pieces of data is nothing.

132
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I mean, have a look at this graph.

133
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.

134
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He's at MIT.

135
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now you won't be able to understand a word of it,

136
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but this is what it looks like.

137
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Cesar has trolled the database

138
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
of over 5,000 different products,

139
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and he's used techniques of network analysis

140
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to interrogate this database

141
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and to graph relationships between the different products.

142
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And it's wonderful, wonderful work.

143
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
You show all these interconnections, all these interrelations.

144
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And I think it'll be profoundly useful

145
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in understanding how it is that economies grow.

146
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Brilliant work.

147
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine

148
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
explaining how this works.

149
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And what we learned

150
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is Cesar's work is far too good to explain

151
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in The New York Times Magazine.

152
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Five thousand products --

153
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that's still nothing.

154
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Five thousand products --

155
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
imagine counting every product category

156
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in Cesar Hidalgo's data.

157
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Imagine you had one second

158
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
per product category.

159
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
In about the length of this session,

160
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
you would have counted all 5,000.

161
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now imagine doing the same thing

162
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
for every different type of product on sale in Walmart.

163
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
There are 100,000 there. It would take you all day.

164
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now imagine trying to count

165
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
every different specific product and service

166
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
on sale in a major economy

167
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
such as Tokyo, London or New York.

168
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's even more difficult in Edinburgh

169
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan.

170
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
If you wanted to count every product and service

171
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
on offer in New York --

172
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
there are 10 billion of them --

173
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
it would take you 317 years.

174
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
This is how complex the economy we've created is.

175
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And I'm just counting toasters here.

176
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem.

177
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The complexity here is unbelievable.

178
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And just a piece of context --

179
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the societies in which our brains evolved

180
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
had about 300 products and services.

181
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You could count them in five minutes.

182
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us.

183
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
This perhaps is why

184
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we find the God complex so tempting.

185
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We tend to retreat and say, "We can draw a picture,

186
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we can post some graphs,

187
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we get it, we understand how this works."

188
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And we don't.

189
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We never do.

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here.

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I'm not trying to say we can't solve

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
complicated problems in a complicated world.

193
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We clearly can.

194
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But the way we solve them

195
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
is with humility --

196
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to abandon the God complex

197
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works.

198
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And we have a problem-solving technique that works.

199
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Now you show me

200
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
a successful complex system,

201
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I will show you a system

202
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that has evolved through trial and error.

203
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Here's an example.

204
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This baby was produced through trial and error.

205
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I realize that's an ambiguous statement.

206
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Maybe I should clarify it.

207
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This baby is a human body: it evolved.

208
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
What is evolution?

209
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Over millions of years, variation and selection,

210
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
variation and selection --

211
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
trial and error,

212
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
trial and error.

213
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And it's not just biological systems

214
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that produce miracles through trial and error.

215
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
You could use it in an industrial context.

216
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So let's say you wanted to make detergent.

217
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Let's say you're Unilever

218
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.

219
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
How do you do it?

220
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent.

221
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.

222
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You create a spray of detergent.

223
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Then the spray dries. It turns into powder.

224
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It falls to the floor.

225
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes.

226
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You sell it at a supermarket.

227
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
You make lots of money.

228
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
How do you design that nozzle?

229
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It turns out to be very important.

230
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Now if you ascribe to the God complex,

231
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
what you do is you find yourself a little God.

232
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist --

233
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.

234
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
And he will, or she will,

235
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
calculate the optimal design of the nozzle.

236
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now Unilever did this and it didn't work --

237
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
too complicated.

238
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Even this problem, too complicated.

239
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones

240
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem --

241
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
trial and error,

242
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
variation and selection.

243
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
You take a nozzle

244
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.

245
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
You try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.

246
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
You create 10 variations on that one.

247
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best.

248
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You try out 10 variations on that one.

249
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You see how this works, right?

250
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And after 45 generations,

251
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you have this incredible nozzle.

252
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It looks a bit like a chess piece --

253
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
functions absolutely brilliantly.

254
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We have no idea

255
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
why it works,

256
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
no idea at all.

257
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And the moment you step back from the God complex --

258
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
let's just try to have a bunch of stuff;

259
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not --

260
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
you can solve your problem.

261
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Now this process of trial and error

262
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is actually far more common in successful institutions

263
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
than we care to recognize.

264
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And we've heard a lot about how economies function.

265
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.

266
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
How did it become the world's greatest economy?

267
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I could give you all kinds of facts and figures

268
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
about the U.S. economy,

269
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but I think the most salient one is this:

270
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
ten percent of American businesses

271
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
disappear every year.

272
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That is a huge failure rate.

273
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's far higher than the failure rate of, say, Americans.

274
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year.

275
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Which leads us to conclude

276
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
American businesses fail faster than Americans,

277
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.

278
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And eventually, they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection

279
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that they will make us all their pets --

280
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

281
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
if, of course, they haven't already done so.

282
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I sometimes wonder.

283
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But it's this process of trial and error

284
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that explains this great divergence,

285
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
this incredible performance of Western economies.

286
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge.

287
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's come through trial and error.

288
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Now I've been sort of banging on about this

289
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
for the last couple of months,

290
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and people sometimes say to me,

291
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
"Well Tim, it's kind of obvious.

292
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Obviously trial and error is very important.

293
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Obviously experimentation is very important.

294
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?"

295
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So I say, okay, fine.

296
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You think it's obvious?

297
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I will admit it's obvious

298
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
when schools

299
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
start teaching children

300
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.

301
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Stop giving them lists of questions

302
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
every single one of which has an answer.

303
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And there's an authority figure in the corner

304
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers.

305
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And if you can't find the answers,

306
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
you must be lazy or stupid.

307
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
When schools stop doing that all the time,

308
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I will admit that, yes,

309
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing.

310
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
When a politician stands up

311
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
campaigning for elected office

312
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and says, "I want to fix our health system.

313
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I want to fix our education system.

314
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I have no idea how to do it.

315
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I have half a dozen ideas.

316
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail.

317
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Then we'll test some other ideas out.

318
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We'll find some that work. We'll build on those.

319
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We'll get rid of the ones that don't." --

320
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
when a politician campaigns on that platform,

321
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and more importantly, when voters like you and me

322
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
are willing to vote for that kind of politician,

323
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
then I will admit

324
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that it is obvious that trial and error works, and that -- thank you.

325
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

326
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Until then, until then

327
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error

328
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and why we should abandon the God complex.

329
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Because it's so hard

330
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to admit our own fallibility.

331
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
It's so uncomfortable.

332
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody.

333
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
There's this one trial he ran

334
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
many years after World War II.

335
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
He wanted to test out

336
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the question of, where is it

337
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that patients should recover

338
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
from heart attacks?

339
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital,

340
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
or should they recover at home?

341
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down.

342
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
They had the God complex in spades.

343
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients,

344
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and they knew it was very unethical

345
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to run any kind of trial or experiment.

346
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this.

347
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
He ran his trial.

348
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And after the trial had been running for a little while,

349
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
he gathered together all his colleagues

350
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
around his table,

351
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and he said, "Well, gentlemen,

352
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
we have some preliminary results.

353
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
They're not statistically significant.

354
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
But we have something.

355
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.

356
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
It is dangerous for patients

357
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to recover from heart attacks at home.

358
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
They should be in hospital."

359
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table

360
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.

361
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now.

362
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Shut it down at once."

363
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And there's this huge hubbub.

364
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Archie lets it die down.

365
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen,

366
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because when I gave you the table of results,

367
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I swapped the two columns around.

368
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It turns out your hospitals are killing people,

369
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and they should be at home.

370
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Would you like to close down the trial now,

371
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
or should we wait until we have robust results?"

372
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Tumbleweed

373
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
rolls through the meeting room.

374
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
But Cochrane would do that kind of thing.

375
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And the reason he would do that kind of thing

376
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
is because he understood

377
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
it feels so much better

378
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
to stand there and say,

379
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
"Here in my own little world,

380
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I am a god, I understand everything.

381
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
I do not want to have my opinions challenged.

382
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I do not want to have my conclusions tested."

383
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
It feels so much more comfortable

384
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
simply to lay down the law.

385
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Cochrane understood

386
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that uncertainty, that fallibility,

387
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that being challenged, they hurt.

388
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that.

389
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy.

390
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
It isn't easy.

391
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It's incredibly painful.

392
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And since I started talking about this subject

393
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and researching this subject,

394
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I've been really haunted by something

395
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
a Japanese mathematician said on the subject.

396
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
So shortly after the war,

397
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
this young man, Yutaka Taniyama,

398
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
developed this amazing conjecture

399
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.

400
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It turned out to be absolutely instrumental

401
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
many decades later

402
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
in proving Fermat's Last Theorem.

403
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
In fact, it turns out it's equivalent

404
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
to proving Fermat's Last Theorem.

405
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
You prove one, you prove the other.

406
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
But it was always a conjecture.

407
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Taniyama tried and tried and tried

408
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and he could never prove that it was true.

409
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958,

410
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Yutaka Taniyama killed himself.

411
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
His friend, Goro Shimura --

412
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
who worked on the mathematics with him --

413
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
many decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life.

414
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
He said,

415
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
"He was not a very careful person

416
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
as a mathematician.

417
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
He made a lot of mistakes.

418
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
But he made mistakes in a good direction.

419
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I tried to emulate him,

420
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
but I realized

421
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
it is very difficult

422
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
to make good mistakes."

423
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Thank you.

424
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
(Applause)

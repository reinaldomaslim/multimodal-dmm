1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today --

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we think of financial and economic primarily --

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the ones that concern me most

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is the deficit of political dialogue --

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
our ability to address modern conflicts

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
as they are,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to go to the source of what they're all about

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and to understand the key players

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and to deal with them.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We who are diplomats,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I can tell you, our agenda is full.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
There is trade, there is disarmament,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
there is cross-border relations.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But the picture is changing,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and we are seeing that there are new key players

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
coming onto the scene.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We loosely call them "groups."

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
They may represent social, religious,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
political, economic, military realities.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And we struggle with how to deal with them.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The rules of engagement:

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
how to talk, when to talk,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and how to deal with them.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Let me show you a slide here

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which illustrates the character of conflicts

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
since 1946 until today.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You see the green

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is a traditional interstate conflict,

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the ones we used to read about.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The red is modern conflict,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
conflicts within states.

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
These are quite different,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and they are outside the grasp

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
of modern diplomacy.

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And the core of these key actors

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
are groups

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
who represent different interests

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
inside countries.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So in a way, it is everybody's business.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
recent years,

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is that very few

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of these domestic interstate, intrastate conflicts

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
can be solved militarily.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They may have to be dealt with with military means,

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but they cannot be solved by military means.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They need political solutions.

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And we, therefore, have a problem,

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because they escape traditional diplomacy.

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And we have among states

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a reluctance in dealing with them.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Plus, during the last decade,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we've been in the mode

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
where dealing with groups

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
was conceptually and politically dangerous.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
After 9/11,

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
either you were with us or against us.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It was black or white.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And groups are very often

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
immediately label terrorists.

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And who would talk to terrorists?

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The West, as I would see it,

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
comes out of that decade weakened,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because we didn't understand the group.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So we've spent more time

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
on focusing on why we should not talk to others

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
than finding out how we talk to others.

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now I'm not naive.

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You cannot talk to everybody all the time.

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And there are times you should walk.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And sometimes military intervention is necessary.

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I happen to believe that Libya was necessary

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary.

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And my country relies on its security

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
through military alliance, that's clear.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But still we have a large deficit

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in dealing with and understanding modern conflict.

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Let us turn to Afghanistan.

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
10 years after that military intervention,

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that country is far from secure.

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The situation, to be honest, is very serious.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now again, the military is necessary,

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but the military is no problem-solver.

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister,

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I met the commander of ISAF,

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the international troops.

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And he told me that, "This can be won militarily, minister.

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We just have to persevere."

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now four COM ISAF's later,

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
we hear a different message:

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
"This cannot be won militarily.

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We need military presence,

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but we need to move to politics.

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We can only solve this through a political solution.

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And it is not us who will solve it;

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Afghans have to solve it."

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But then they need a different political process

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
than the one they were given in 2001, 2002.

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They need an inclusive process

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where the real fabric of this very complicated society

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
can deal with their issues.

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Everybody seems to agree with that.

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It was very controversial to say three, four, five years ago.

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Now everybody agrees.

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But now, as we prepare to talk,

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we understand how little we know.

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Because we didn't talk.

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We didn't grasp what was going on.

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The International Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC,

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is talking to everyone,

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and it is doing so because it is neutral.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And that's one reason why

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that organization probably

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is the best informed key player

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to understand modern conflict --

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because they talk.

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
My point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk.

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And you don't have to agree

121
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
when you sit down with the other side.

122
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And you can always walk.

123
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But if you don't talk,

124
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you can't engage the other side.

125
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And the other side which you're going to engage

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is the one with whom you profoundly disagree.

127
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process,

128
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
"You don't make peace with your friends,

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
you make peace with your enemies."

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's hard, but it is necessary.

131
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Let me go one step further.

132
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This is Tahrir Square.

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There's a revolution going on.

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The Arab Spring is heading into fall

135
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and is moving into winter.

136
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It will last for a long, long time.

137
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And who knows what it will be called in the end.

138
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
That's not the point.

139
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The point is that we are probably seeing,

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
for the first time in the history of the Arab world,

141
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
a revolution bottom-up --

142
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
people's revolution.

143
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Social groups are taking to the streets.

144
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And we find out in the West

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that we know very little about what's happening.

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Because we never talk to the people in these countries.

147
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Most governments followed

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the dictate of the authoritarian leaders

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to stay away from these different groups,

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because they were terrorists.

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So now that they are emerging in the street

152
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and we salute the democratic revolution,

153
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we find out how little we know.

154
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Right now, the discussion goes,

155
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
"Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood?

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Should we talk to Hamas?

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
If we talk to them, we may legitimize them."

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I think that is wrong.

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
If you talk in the right way, you make it very clear

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that talking is not agreeing.

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood,

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
as we should,

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that they must respect minority rights,

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
if we don't accept majority rights?

165
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Because they may turn out to be a majority.

166
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
How can we escape [having] a double-standard,

167
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
if we at the same time preach democracy

168
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and at the same time

169
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
don't want to deal with the groups that are representative?

170
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
How will we ever be interlocutors?

171
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now my diplomats are instructed

172
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to talk to all these groups.

173
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But talking can be done in different ways.

174
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and talking at the political level.

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid.

177
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion.

178
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
There's a big array

179
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of the ways of dealing with this.

180
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So if we refuse

181
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to talk to these new groups

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that are going to be dominating the news in years to come,

183
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we will further radicalization,

184
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I believe.

185
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We will make the road from violent activities into politics

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
harder to travel.

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that if you move towards democracy,

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
if you move towards taking part

190
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in civilized and normal standards among states,

191
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
there are some rewards on the other side.

192
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The paradox here

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is that the last decade probably was a lost decade

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
for making progress on this.

195
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising --

196
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and for one reason primarily.

197
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the reason is what happened in South Africa:

198
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Nelson Mandela.

199
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
When Mandela came out of prison

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
after 27 years of captivity,

201
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
if he had told his people,

202
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"It's time to take up the arms,

203
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
it's time to fight,"

204
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
he would have been followed.

205
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I think the international community

206
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
would have said, "Fair enough.

207
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's their right to fight."

208
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now as you know, Mandela didn't do that.

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
In his memoirs, "Long Road to Freedom,"

210
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
he wrote that he survived

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
during those years of captivity

212
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because he always decided to look upon his oppressor

213
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as also being a human being,

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
also being a human being.

215
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So he engaged a political process of dialogue,

216
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
not as a strategy of the weak,

217
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but as a strategy of the strong.

218
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And he engaged talking profoundly

219
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
by settling some of the most tricky issues

220
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
through a truth and reconciliation process

221
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
where people came and talked.

222
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now South African friends will know

223
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that was very painful.

224
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So what can we learn from all of this?

225
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Dialogue is not easy --

226
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
not between individuals, not between groups, not between governments --

227
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but it is very necessary.

228
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
If we're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts,

229
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
if we're going to understand these new groups

230
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
which are coming from bottom-up,

231
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
supported by technology, which is available to all,

232
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets

233
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
believing that we are doing interstate relations.

234
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We have to connect

235
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
with these profound changes.

236
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And what is dialogue really about?

237
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
When I enter into dialogue,

238
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I really hope that the other side

239
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
would pick up my points of view,

240
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that I would impress upon them

241
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
my opinions and my values.

242
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I cannot do that

243
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
unless I send the signals that I will be open

244
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to listen to the other side's signals.

245
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We need a lot more training on how to do that

246
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and a lot more practice

247
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
on how that can take problem-solving forward.

248
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We know from our personal experiences

249
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that it's easy sometimes

250
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
just to walk,

251
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and sometimes you may need to fight.

252
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances.

253
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Sometimes you have to.

254
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But that strategy seldom takes you very far.

255
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The alternative is a strategy

256
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
of engagement and principled dialogue.

257
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And I believe we need to strengthen this approach

258
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in modern diplomacy,

259
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
not only between states,

260
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
but also within states.

261
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We are seeing some new signs.

262
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We could never have done

263
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the convention against anti-personnel landmines

264
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and the convention that is banning cluster munitions

265
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
unless we had done diplomacy differently,

266
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
by engaging with civil society.

267
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
All of a sudden,

268
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
NGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans,

269
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but they were taking [them] into the negotiations,

270
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
partly because they represented the victims of these weapons.

271
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And they brought their knowledge.

272
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And there was an interaction

273
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up.

274
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is perhaps a first element

275
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of a change.

276
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
In the future, I believe,

277
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
we should draw examples from these different illustrations,

278
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
not to have diplomacy

279
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
which is disconnected from people and civil society.

280
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And we have to go also

281
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
beyond traditional diplomacy

282
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to the survival issue of our times,

283
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
climate change.

284
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations,

285
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
unless we are able to make civil society and people,

286
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
not part of the problem, but part of the solution?

287
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy

288
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
very different from the one we are practicing today

289
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations,

290
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but when we move toward something

291
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which has to be much more

292
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
along a broad mobilization.

293
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It's crucial to understand, I believe,

294
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
because of technology and because of globalization,

295
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
societies from bottom-up.

296
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We as diplomats

297
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
need to know the social capital

298
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
of communities.

299
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
What is it that makes people trust each other,

300
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
not only between states,

301
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
but also within states?

302
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy,

303
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
of the the solution we devise as diplomats

304
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
if they cannot be reflected and understood

305
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
by also these broader forces of societies

306
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that we now very loosely call groups?

307
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
The good thing is that we are not powerless.

308
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We have never had

309
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
as many means of communication,

310
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
means of being connected, means of reaching out,

311
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
means of including.

312
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
The diplomatic toolbox

313
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
is actually full of different tools we can use

314
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to strengthen our communication.

315
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade

316
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
where we had a fear of touching it.

317
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Now, I hope, in the coming years,

318
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples

319
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that fear is receding

320
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and that we can take courage

321
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
from that alliance

322
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
with civil society

323
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
in different countries

324
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
to support their problem-solving,

325
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
among the Afghans,

326
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
inside the Palestinian population,

327
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
between the peoples of Palestine and Israel.

328
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And as we try to understand this broad movement

329
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
across the Arab world,

330
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
we are not powerless.

331
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We need to improve the necessary skills,

332
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and we need the courage to use them.

333
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
In my country,

334
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I have seen how the council of Islamist groups

335
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and Christian groups

336
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
came together, not as a government initiative,

337
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but they came together on their own initiative

338
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
to establish contact and dialogue

339
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
in times where things were pretty low-key tension.

340
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And when tension increased,

341
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
they already had that dialogue,

342
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and that was a strength to deal with different issues.

343
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Our modern Western societies

344
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
are more complex than before,

345
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
in this time of migration.

346
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
How are we going to settle and build a bigger "We"

347
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to deal with our issues

348
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
if we don't improve our skills of communication?

349
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So there are many reasons,

350
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and for all of these reasons,

351
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
this is time and this is why we must talk.

352
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Thank you for your attention.

353
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Applause)

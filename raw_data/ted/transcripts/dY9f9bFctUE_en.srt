1
0:00:12.46,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Worldwide, over 1.5 billion people experience armed conflict.

2
0:00:18.7,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In response, people are forced to flee their country,

3
0:00:21.42,000 --> 0:00:24,000
leaving over 15 million refugees.

4
0:00:25.34,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Children, without a doubt,

5
0:00:26.7,000 --> 0:00:28,000
are the most innocent and vulnerable victims ...

6
0:00:30.46,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but not just from the obvious physical dangers,

7
0:00:33.1,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but from the often unspoken effects that wars have on their families.

8
0:00:38.1,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The experiences of war leave children at a real high risk

9
0:00:41.34,000 --> 0:00:43,000
for the development of emotional and behavioral problems.

10
0:00:45.78,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Children, as we can only imagine,

11
0:00:47.66,000 --> 0:00:49,000
will feel worried, threatened and at risk.

12
0:00:50.38,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But there is good news.

13
0:00:52.22,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The quality of care that children receive in their families

14
0:00:55.98,000 --> 0:00:58,000
can have a more significant effect on their well-being

15
0:00:59.46,000 --> 0:01:02,000
than from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to.

16
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So actually, children can be protected

17
0:01:07.02,000 --> 0:01:11,000
by warm, secure parenting during and after conflict.

18
0:01:13.74,000 --> 0:01:16,000
In 2011, I was a first-year PhD student

19
0:01:17.1,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the University of Manchester School of Psychological Sciences.

20
0:01:20.86,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Like many of you here,

21
0:01:22.34,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I watched the crisis in Syria unfold in front of me on the TV.

22
0:01:26.38,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My family is originally from Syria,

23
0:01:28.7,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and very early on,

24
0:01:29.98,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I lost several family members in really horrifying ways.

25
0:01:33.58,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'd sit and I'd gather with my family and watch the TV.

26
0:01:37.02,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We've all seen those scenes:

27
0:01:38.46,000 --> 0:01:4,000
bombs destroying buildings,

28
0:01:40.54,000 --> 0:01:41,000
chaos, destruction

29
0:01:42.86,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and people screaming and running.

30
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It was always the people screaming and running that really got me the most,

31
0:01:49.22,000 --> 0:01:51,000
especially those terrified-looking children.

32
0:01:53.22,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I was a mother to two young, typically inquisitive children.

33
0:01:56.94,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They were five and six then,

34
0:01:58.54,000 --> 0:02:01,000
at an age where they typically asked lots and lots of questions,

35
0:02:01.62,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and expected real, convincing answers.

36
0:02:04.94,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, I began to wonder what it might be like

37
0:02:07.62,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to parent my children in a war zone and a refugee camp.

38
0:02:12.06,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Would my children change?

39
0:02:14.5,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Would my daughter's bright, happy eyes lose their shine?

40
0:02:18.34,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Would my son's really relaxed and carefree nature become fearful and withdrawn?

41
0:02:24.62,000 --> 0:02:25,000
How would I cope?

42
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Would I change?

43
0:02:30.46,000 --> 0:02:32,000
As psychologists and parent trainers,

44
0:02:32.7,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we know that arming parents with skills in caring for their children

45
0:02:36.62,000 --> 0:02:38,000
can have a huge effect on their well-being,

46
0:02:40.02,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we call this parent training.

47
0:02:42.5,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The question I had was,

48
0:02:44.46,000 --> 0:02:47,000
could parent training programs be useful for families

49
0:02:48.22,000 --> 0:02:51,000
while they were still in war zones or refugee camps?

50
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Could we reach them with advice or training

51
0:02:53.86,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that would help them through these struggles?

52
0:02:57.66,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So I approached my PhD supervisor,

53
0:03:00.42,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Professor Rachel Calam,

54
0:03:01.94,000 --> 0:03:05,000
with the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world.

55
0:03:06.58,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I wasn't quite sure what exactly I wanted to do.

56
0:03:09.86,000 --> 0:03:1,000
She listened carefully and patiently,

57
0:03:11.74,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and then to my joy she said,

58
0:03:13.34,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"If that's what you want to do, and it means so much to you,

59
0:03:16.22,000 --> 0:03:17,000
then let's do it.

60
0:03:17.5,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Let's find ways to see if parent programs

61
0:03:20.5,000 --> 0:03:22,000
can be useful for families in these contexts."

62
0:03:23.78,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So for the past five years, myself and my colleagues --

63
0:03:26.7,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Prof. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright --

64
0:03:29.3,000 --> 0:03:31,000
have been working on ways to support families

65
0:03:31.54,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that have experienced war and displacement.

66
0:03:35.38,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, to know how to help families that have been through conflict

67
0:03:38.82,000 --> 0:03:39,000
support their children,

68
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the first step must obviously be to ask them what they're struggling with,

69
0:03:44.1,000 --> 0:03:45,000
right?

70
0:03:45.34,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I mean, it seems obvious.

71
0:03:46.74,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But it's often those that are the most vulnerable,

72
0:03:49.14,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that we're trying to support,

73
0:03:50.58,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that we actually don't ask.

74
0:03:51.94,000 --> 0:03:54,000
How many times have we just assumed we know exactly the right thing

75
0:03:55.14,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that's going to help someone or something without actually asking them first?

76
0:03:59.22,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So I travelled to refugee camps in Syria and in Turkey,

77
0:04:02.9,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and I sat with families, and I listened.

78
0:04:06.06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I listened to their parenting challenges,

79
0:04:08.82,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I listened to their parenting struggles

80
0:04:11.1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I listened to their call for help.

81
0:04:13.34,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And sometimes that was just paused,

82
0:04:15.38,000 --> 0:04:17,000
as all I could do was hold hands with them

83
0:04:17.46,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and just join them in silent crying and prayer.

84
0:04:20.42,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They told me about their struggles,

85
0:04:22.86,000 --> 0:04:25,000
they told me about the rough, harsh refugee camp conditions

86
0:04:26.66,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that made it hard to focus on anything but practical chores

87
0:04:29.899,000 --> 0:04:3,000
like collecting clean water.

88
0:04:32.42,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They told me how they watched their children withdraw;

89
0:04:35.74,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the sadness, depression, anger,

90
0:04:38.94,000 --> 0:04:41,000
bed-wetting, thumb-sucking, fear of loud noises,

91
0:04:42.14,000 --> 0:04:43,000
fear of nightmares --

92
0:04:44.02,000 --> 0:04:45,000
terrifying, terrifying nightmares.

93
0:04:46.78,000 --> 0:04:49,000
These families had been through what we had been watching on the TV.

94
0:04:51.06,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The mothers --

95
0:04:52.3,000 --> 0:04:54,000
almost half of them were now widows of war,

96
0:04:54.5,000 --> 0:04:56,000
or didn't even know if their husbands were dead or alive --

97
0:04:57.3,000 --> 0:04:59,000
described how they felt they were coping so badly.

98
0:05:01.3,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them.

99
0:05:05.38,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They didn't know how to answer their children's questions.

100
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
What I found incredibly astonishing and so motivational

101
0:05:12.62,000 --> 0:05:16,000
was that these families were so motivated to support their children.

102
0:05:17.54,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Despite all these challenges they faced,

103
0:05:19.98,000 --> 0:05:21,000
they were trying to help their children.

104
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
They were making attempts at seeking support from NGO workers,

105
0:05:25.9,000 --> 0:05:26,000
from refugee camp teachers,

106
0:05:27.82,000 --> 0:05:28,000
professional medics,

107
0:05:29.06,000 --> 0:05:3,000
other parents.

108
0:05:30.86,000 --> 0:05:33,000
One mother I met had only been in a camp for four days,

109
0:05:34.1,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and had already made two attempts

110
0:05:35.74,000 --> 0:05:37,000
at seeking support for her eight-year-old daughter

111
0:05:38.18,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who was having terrifying nightmares.

112
0:05:41.82,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But sadly, these attempts are almost always useless.

113
0:05:45.5,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Refugee camp doctors, when available,

114
0:05:47.58,000 --> 0:05:48,000
are almost always too busy,

115
0:05:49.38,000 --> 0:05:53,000
or don't have the knowledge or the time for basic parenting supports.

116
0:05:54.18,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Refugee camp teachers and other parents are just like them --

117
0:05:57.94,000 --> 0:06:,000
part of a new refugee community who's struggling with new needs.

118
0:06:02.82,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So then we began to think.

119
0:06:05.58,000 --> 0:06:07,000
How could we help these families?

120
0:06:09.06,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The families were struggling with things much bigger than they could cope with.

121
0:06:13.22,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The Syrian crisis made it clear

122
0:06:14.94,000 --> 0:06:19,000
how incredibly impossible it would be to reach families on an individual level.

123
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
How else could we help them?

124
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
How would we reach families at a population level

125
0:06:26.22,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and low costs

126
0:06:28.94,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in these terrifying, terrifying times?

127
0:06:32.7,000 --> 0:06:34,000
After hours of speaking to NGO workers,

128
0:06:35.3,000 --> 0:06:37,000
one suggested a fantastic innovative idea

129
0:06:37.78,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of distributing parenting information leaflets via bread wrappers --

130
0:06:42.82,000 --> 0:06:46,000
bread wrappers that were being delivered to families in a conflict zone in Syria

131
0:06:47.18,000 --> 0:06:48,000
by humanitarian workers.

132
0:06:49.18,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So that's what we did.

133
0:06:50.82,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The bread wrappers haven't changed at all in their appearance,

134
0:06:53.82,000 --> 0:06:55,000
except for the addition of two pieces of paper.

135
0:06:56.62,000 --> 0:07:,000
One was a parenting information leaflet that had basic advice and information

136
0:07:01.54,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that normalized to the parent what they might be experiencing,

137
0:07:04.98,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and what their child might be experiencing.

138
0:07:07.02,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And information on how they could support themselves and their children,

139
0:07:10.86,000 --> 0:07:14,000
such as information like spending time talking to your child,

140
0:07:15.1,000 --> 0:07:17,000
showing them more affection,

141
0:07:17.22,000 --> 0:07:19,000
being more patient with your child,

142
0:07:19.3,000 --> 0:07:2,000
talking to your children.

143
0:07:21.14,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The other piece of paper was a feedback questionnaire,

144
0:07:23.74,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and of course, there was a pen.

145
0:07:25.98,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So is this simply leaflet distribution,

146
0:07:29.5,000 --> 0:07:32,000
or is this actually a possible means of delivering psychological first aid

147
0:07:33.34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that provides warm, secure, loving parenting?

148
0:07:36.42,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We managed to distribute 3,000 of these in just one week.

149
0:07:41.98,000 --> 0:07:44,000
What was incredible was we had a 60 percent response rate.

150
0:07:45.66,000 --> 0:07:49,000
60 percent of the 3,000 families responded.

151
0:07:49.9,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I don't know how many researchers we have here today,

152
0:07:52.42,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but that kind of response rate is fantastic.

153
0:07:54.78,000 --> 0:07:57,000
To have that in Manchester would be a huge achievement,

154
0:07:58.06,000 --> 0:08:,000
let alone in a conflict zone in Syria --

155
0:08:00.78,000 --> 0:08:03,000
really highlighting how important these kinds of messages were to families.

156
0:08:07.02,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I remember how excited and eager we were for the return of the questionnaires.

157
0:08:10.98,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The families had left hundreds of messages --

158
0:08:13.5,000 --> 0:08:15,000
most incredibly positive and encouraging.

159
0:08:15.9,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But my favorite has got to be,

160
0:08:17.66,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"Thank you for not forgetting about us and our children."

161
0:08:22.1,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This really illustrates the potential means

162
0:08:24.18,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of the delivery of psychological first aid to families,

163
0:08:26.98,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and the return of feedback, too.

164
0:08:29.1,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Just imagine replicating this using other means

165
0:08:31.62,000 --> 0:08:35,000
such as baby milk distribution, or female hygiene kits,

166
0:08:36.22,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or even food baskets.

167
0:08:39.841,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But let's bring this closer to home,

168
0:08:41.58,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because the refugee crisis

169
0:08:42.9,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is one that is having an effect on every single one of us.

170
0:08:46.34,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We're bombarded with images daily of statistics and of photos,

171
0:08:50.979,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and that's not surprising,

172
0:08:52.58,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because by last month,

173
0:08:53.859,000 --> 0:08:56,000
over one million refugees had reached Europe.

174
0:08:56.98,000 --> 0:08:57,000
One million.

175
0:08:58.78,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Refugees are joining our communities,

176
0:09:01.94,000 --> 0:09:02,000
they're becoming our neighbors,

177
0:09:03.46,000 --> 0:09:05,000
their children are attending our children's schools.

178
0:09:07.1,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So we've adapted the leaflet to meet the needs of European refugees,

179
0:09:11.42,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and we have them online, open-access,

180
0:09:13.78,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in areas with a really high refugee influx.

181
0:09:16.46,000 --> 0:09:19,000
For example, the Swedish healthcare uploaded it onto their website,

182
0:09:19.7,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and within the first 45 minutes,

183
0:09:21.42,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it was downloaded 343 times --

184
0:09:25.3,000 --> 0:09:26,000
really highlighting how important it is

185
0:09:27.22,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for volunteers, practitioners and other parents

186
0:09:29.78,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to have open-access, psychological first-aid messages.

187
0:09:35.1,000 --> 0:09:41,000
In 2013, I was sitting on the cold, hard floor of a refugee camp tent

188
0:09:41.3,000 --> 0:09:44,000
with mothers sitting around me as I was conducting a focus group.

189
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Across from me stood an elderly lady

190
0:09:47.58,000 --> 0:09:5,000
with what seemed to be a 13-year-old girl lying beside her,

191
0:09:51.06,000 --> 0:09:53,000
with her head on the elderly lady's knees.

192
0:09:53.9,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The girl stayed quiet throughout the focus group,

193
0:09:56.7,000 --> 0:09:57,000
not talking at all,

194
0:09:58.02,000 --> 0:10:,000
with her knees curled up against her chest.

195
0:10:00.86,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Towards the end of the focus group,

196
0:10:02.58,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and as I was thanking the mothers for their time,

197
0:10:05.58,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the elderly lady looked at me while pointing at the young girl,

198
0:10:08.58,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and said to me, "Can you help us with...?"

199
0:10:11.9,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Not quite sure what she expected me to do,

200
0:10:14.3,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I looked at the young girl and smiled,

201
0:10:16.18,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and in Arabic I said,

202
0:10:17.58,000 --> 0:10:19,000
"Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?"

203
0:10:19.62,000 --> 0:10:2,000
"What's your name?"

204
0:10:21.54,000 --> 0:10:23,000
She looked at me really confused and unengaged,

205
0:10:24.3,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but then said, "Halul."

206
0:10:26.66,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Halul is the pet's name for the Arabic female name, Hala,

207
0:10:31.22,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and is only really used to refer to really young girls.

208
0:10:35.14,000 --> 0:10:38,000
At that point I realized that actually Hala was probably much older than 13.

209
0:10:39.62,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It turns out Hala was a 25-year-old mother to three young children.

210
0:10:44.74,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Hala had been a confident, bright, bubbly, loving, caring mother

211
0:10:48.74,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to her children,

212
0:10:49.98,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but the war had changed all of that.

213
0:10:52.82,000 --> 0:10:56,000
She had lived through bombs being dropped in her town;

214
0:10:57.22,000 --> 0:10:59,000
she had lived through explosions.

215
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
When fighter jets were flying around their building,

216
0:11:02.74,000 --> 0:11:03,000
dropping bombs,

217
0:11:03.98,000 --> 0:11:05,000
her children would be screaming, terrified from the noise.

218
0:11:06.74,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Hala would frantically grab pillows and cover her children's ears

219
0:11:09.86,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to block out the noise,

220
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
all the while screaming herself.

221
0:11:13.9,000 --> 0:11:14,000
When they reached the refugee camp

222
0:11:15.62,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and she knew they were finally in some kind of safety,

223
0:11:18.86,000 --> 0:11:21,000
she completely withdrew to acting like her old childhood self.

224
0:11:22.9,000 --> 0:11:24,000
She completely rejected her family --

225
0:11:26.3,000 --> 0:11:27,000
her children, her husband.

226
0:11:29.02,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Hala simply could no longer cope.

227
0:11:32.42,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This is a parenting struggle with a really tough ending,

228
0:11:35.34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but sadly, it's not uncommon.

229
0:11:37.18,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Those who experience armed conflict and displacement

230
0:11:40.18,000 --> 0:11:42,000
will face serious emotional struggles.

231
0:11:43.54,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And that's something we can all relate to.

232
0:11:46.74,000 --> 0:11:49,000
If you have been through a devastating time in your life,

233
0:11:50.42,000 --> 0:11:53,000
if you have lost someone or something you really care about,

234
0:11:55.22,000 --> 0:11:57,000
how would you continue to cope?

235
0:11:58.5,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Could you still be able to care for yourself and for your family?

236
0:12:03.3,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Given that the first years of a child's life are crucial

237
0:12:06.46,000 --> 0:12:09,000
for healthy physical and emotional development,

238
0:12:09.74,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and that 1.5 billion people are experiencing armed conflict --

239
0:12:14.74,000 --> 0:12:16,000
many of whom are now joining our communities --

240
0:12:17.46,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we cannot afford to turn a blind eye

241
0:12:19.38,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to the needs of those who are experiencing war and displacement.

242
0:12:24.62,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We must prioritize these families' needs --

243
0:12:27.1,000 --> 0:12:31,000
both those who are internally displaced, and those who are refugees worldwide.

244
0:12:32.9,000 --> 0:12:37,000
These needs must be prioritized by NGO workers, policy makers,

245
0:12:37.94,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the WHO, the UNHCR and every single one of us

246
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in whatever capacity it is that we function in our society.

247
0:12:47.42,000 --> 0:12:52,000
When we begin to recognize the individual faces of the conflict,

248
0:12:52.62,000 --> 0:12:56,000
when we begin to notice those intricate emotions on their faces,

249
0:12:57.14,000 --> 0:12:58,000
we begin to see them as humans, too.

250
0:12:59.82,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We begin to see the needs of these families,

251
0:13:02.54,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and these are the real human needs.

252
0:13:05.66,000 --> 0:13:07,000
When these family needs are prioritized,

253
0:13:08.38,000 --> 0:13:11,000
interventions for children in humanitarian settings

254
0:13:11.7,000 --> 0:13:16,000
will prioritize and recognize the primary role of the family in supporting children.

255
0:13:17.66,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Family mental health will be shouting loud and clear

256
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in global, international agenda.

257
0:13:22.9,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And children will be less likely to enter social service systems

258
0:13:26.62,000 --> 0:13:27,000
in resettlement countries

259
0:13:28.22,000 --> 0:13:3,000
because their families would have had support earlier on.

260
0:13:32.34,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And we will be more open-minded,

261
0:13:35.1,000 --> 0:13:36,000
more welcoming, more caring

262
0:13:36.94,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and more trusting to those who are joining our communities.

263
0:13:41.62,000 --> 0:13:43,000
We need to stop wars.

264
0:13:44.54,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We need to build a world where children can dream of planes dropping gifts,

265
0:13:49.22,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and not bombs.

266
0:13:51.14,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Until we stop armed conflicts raging throughout the world,

267
0:13:55.22,000 --> 0:13:57,000
families will continue to be displaced,

268
0:13:57.94,000 --> 0:13:58,000
leaving children vulnerable.

269
0:13:59.9,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But by improving parenting and caregiver support,

270
0:14:02.98,000 --> 0:14:07,000
it may be possible to weaken the links between war and psychological difficulties

271
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
in children and their families.

272
0:14:10.66,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Thank you.

273
0:14:11.9,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Applause)

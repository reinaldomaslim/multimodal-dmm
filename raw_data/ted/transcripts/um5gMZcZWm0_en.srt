1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Once upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children.

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land,

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it was the worst. It killed the most children.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist,

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who came up with a partial cure for that disease.

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died,

7
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but it was certainly better than what they had before.

8
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free,

9
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
virtually free, and was very easy to use.

10
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it

11
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
on the youngest children, on infants, and on one-year-olds.

12
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
And so, as a consequence, a few years later,

13
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientist

14
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him,

15
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but building on the invention of the first one --

16
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
came up with a second cure.

17
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And the beauty of the second cure for this disease

18
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds.

19
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive,

20
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and it was very complicated to use.

21
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly,

22
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end.

23
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But what they did, of course, since it was so complicated and expensive,

24
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds.

25
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And they kept on using the existing cure that they had

26
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
on the two-year-olds and up.

27
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And this went on for quite some time. People were happy.

28
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They had their two cures. Until a particular mother,

29
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
whose child had just turned two, died of this disease.

30
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And she thought to herself, "My child just turned two,

31
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
and until the child turned two, I had always used

32
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
this complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment.

33
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And then the child turned two, and I started using

34
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the cheap and easy treatment, and I wonder" --

35
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and she wondered, like all parents who lose children wonder --

36
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"if there isn't something that I could have done,

37
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
like keep on using that complicated, expensive cure."

38
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And she told all the other people, and she said,

39
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"How could it possibly be that something

40
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that's cheap and simple works as well as something

41
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that's complicated and expensive?"

42
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And the people thought, "You know, you're right.

43
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch

44
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and use the cheap and simple solution."

45
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And the government, they heard her story and the other people,

46
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and they said, "Yeah, you're right, we should make a law.

47
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment

48
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and not let anybody use this on their children."

49
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And the people were happy. They were satisfied.

50
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
For many years this went along, and everything was fine.

51
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But then along came a lowly economist, who had children himself,

52
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and he used the expensive and complicated treatment.

53
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But he knew about the cheap and simple one.

54
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And he thought about it, and the expensive one

55
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
didn't seem that great to him. So he thought,

56
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data,

57
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
so maybe I should go and look at the data

58
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment

59
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
actually works any better than the cheap and simple one."

60
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And lo and behold, when he went through the data,

61
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
he found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicated

62
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
solution was any better than the cheap one,

63
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
at least for the children who were two and older --

64
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger.

65
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And so, he went forth to the people and he said,

66
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"I've made this wonderful finding:

67
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution,

68
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year,

69
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and we could spend that on our children in other ways."

70
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And the parents were very unhappy, and they said,

71
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"This is a terrible thing, because how can the cheap and easy thing

72
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
be as good as the hard thing?" And the government was very upset.

73
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And in particular, the people who made this expensive solution

74
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
were very upset because they thought,

75
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free?

76
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We would lose all of our market."

77
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And people were very angry, and they called him horrible names.

78
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And he decided that maybe he should leave the country

79
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for a few days, and seek out some more intelligent,

80
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
open-minded people in a place called Oxford,

81
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and come and try and tell the story at that place.

82
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And so, anyway, here I am. It's not a fairy tale.

83
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's a true story about the United States today,

84
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and the disease I'm referring to is actually

85
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
motor vehicle accidents for children.

86
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And the free cure is adult seatbelts, and the expensive cure --

87
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the 300-million-dollar-a-year cure -- is child car seats.

88
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And what I'd like to talk to you about today

89
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true:

90
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that for children two years old and up,

91
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
there really is no real benefit -- proven benefit -- of car seats,

92
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in spite of the incredible energy

93
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that has been devoted toward expanding the laws

94
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and making it socially unacceptable

95
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why --

96
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
what is it that makes that true?

97
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And then, finally talk a little bit about a third way,

98
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
about another technology, which is probably better than anything we have,

99
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but which -- there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption

100
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
precisely because people are so enamored

101
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
with the current car seat solution. OK.

102
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So, many times when you try to do research on data,

103
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data.

104
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.

105
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So the United States keeps a data set

106
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of every fatal accident that's happened since 1975.

107
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So in every car crash in which at least one person dies,

108
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
they have information on all of the people.

109
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So if you look at that data -- it's right up on the National Highway

110
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Transportation Safety Administration's website --

111
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
you can just look at the raw data,

112
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence

113
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up.

114
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So, here is the data. Here I have, among two- to six-year-olds --

115
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
anyone above six, basically no one uses car seats,

116
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
so you can't compare -- 29.3 percent of the children who are unrestrained

117
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in a crash in which at least one person dies, themselves die.

118
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
If you put a child in a car seat, 18.2 percent of the children die.

119
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data,

120
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
19.4 percent die. And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt,

121
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells you

122
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worse

123
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
than the lap-and-shoulder belt. And that just reminds you

124
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that when you deal with raw data, there are hundreds

125
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of confounding variables that may be getting in the way.

126
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So what we do in the study is -- and this is just presenting

127
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the same information, but turned into a figure to make it easier.

128
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So the yellow bar represents car seats,

129
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts.

130
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And this is all relative to unrestrained --

131
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the bigger the bar, the better. Okay.

132
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So, this is the data I just showed, OK?

133
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So the highest bar is what you're striving to beat.

134
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So you can control for the basic things, like how hard the crash was,

135
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
what seat the child was sitting in, etc., the age of the child.

136
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And that's that middle set of bars.

137
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And so, you can see that the lap-only seatbelts

138
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
start to look worse once you do that.

139
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And then finally, the last set of bars,

140
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
which are really controlling for everything

141
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
you could possibly imagine about the crash,

142
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
50, 75, 100 different characteristics of the crash.

143
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts,

144
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
when it comes to saving lives, fatalities look exactly identical.

145
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well.

146
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And it's not just overall. It's very robust

147
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to anything you want to look at.

148
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
One thing that's interesting: if you look at frontal-impact crashes --

149
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
when the car crashes, the front hits into something --

150
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
indeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better.

151
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And I think this isn't just chance.

152
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In order to have the car seat approved,

153
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you need to pass certain federal standards,

154
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash.

155
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes,

156
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
indeed, the car seats don't perform as well.

157
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass,

158
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as we always expect people to do,

159
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to optimize relative to bright-line rules

160
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
about how affected the car will be.

161
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And the other thing you might argue is,

162
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
"Well, car seats have got a lot better over time.

163
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And so if we look at recent crashes --

164
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the whole data set is almost 30 years' worth of data --

165
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far, far better."

166
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But indeed, in recent crashes the lap-and-shoulder seatbelts,

167
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
actually, are doing even better than the car seats.

168
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They say, "Well, that's impossible, that can't be."

169
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And the line of argument, if you ask parents, is,

170
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"But car seats are so expensive and complicated,

171
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and they have this big tangle of latches,

172
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts

173
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because they are so expensive and complicated?"

174
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's kind of an interesting logic,

175
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
I think, that people use. And the other logic, they say,

176
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use them

177
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
if they weren't much better."

178
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them

179
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is not actually based on very much.

180
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents

181
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
whose children died after they turned two,

182
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which has led to the passage of all these laws -- not very much on data.

183
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So you can only get so far, I think, in telling your story

184
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
by using these abstract statistics.

185
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking --

186
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we had a cookout -- I was asking them what advice they might have for me

187
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
about proving my point. They said, "Why don't you run some crash tests?"

188
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And I said, "That's a great idea."

189
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So we actually tried to commission some crash tests.

190
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And it turns out that as we called around to the independent

191
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
crash test companies around the country,

192
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
none of them wanted to do our crash test

193
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
because they said, some explicitly, some not so explicitly,

194
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
"All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers.

195
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats."

196
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Now, eventually, one did. Under the conditions of anonymity,

197
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
they said they would be happy to do this test for us --

198
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so anonymity, and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed.

199
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And so, we went to Buffalo, New York,

200
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and here is the precursor to it.

201
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
These are the crash test dummies,

202
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
waiting for their chance to take the center stage.

203
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And then, here's how the crash test works.

204
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know --

205
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.

206
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So they just have these bench seats,

207
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.

208
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So I just wanted you to look at this.

209
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think

210
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
car seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat.

211
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Does he not look content, ready to go,

212
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
like he could survive anything? And then, if you look at the kid in back,

213
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens.

214
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's hard to believe, when you look at this, that

215
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash.

216
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So this is going to be a crash

217
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
where they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall

218
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
at 30 miles an hour, and see what happens. OK?

219
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So, let me show you what happens.

220
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
These are three-year-old dummies, by the way.

221
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So here -- this is the car seat. Now watch two things:

222
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
watch how the head goes forward,

223
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and basically hits the knees -- and this is in the car seat --

224
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and watch how the car seat flies around, in the rebound, up in the air.

225
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The car seat's moving all over the place.

226
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Bear in mind there are two things about this.

227
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
This is a car seat that was installed by someone

228
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
who has installed 1,000 car seats, who knew exactly how to do it.

229
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And also it turned out these bench seats

230
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
are the very best way to install car seats.

231
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them.

232
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat,

233
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
OK? So, that kid in this crash fared very well.

234
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The federal standards are

235
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that you have to score below a 1,000

236
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to be an approved car seat on this crash,

237
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in some metric of units which are not important.

238
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And this crash would have been about a 450.

239
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So this car seat was actually an above-average car seat

240
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
from Consumer Reports, and did quite well.

241
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So the next one. Now, this is the kid, same crash,

242
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
who is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all, actually,

243
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
relative to the other child. The funny thing is,

244
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up

245
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to do the car seats, and so, they actually don't even have a way

246
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound.

247
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually

248
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500

249
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
out of -- you know, on this range -- relative to a 400 and something.

250
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But still, if you just took that data from that crash

251
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat.

252
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I would like you to approve it for selling,"

253
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
then they would say, "This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.

254
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000."

255
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors

256
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
into being approved as a car seat.

257
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So, in some sense, what this is suggesting

258
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong,

259
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
which is putting children at risk. It's just that, fundamentally,

260
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the car seats aren't doing much.

261
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time,

262
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat --

263
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
at rebound, it takes a lot longer --

264
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt.

265
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well.

266
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The six-year-old is in a car seat, and it turns out

267
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that looks terrible, but that's great. That's like a 400, OK?

268
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So that kid would do fine in the crash.

269
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all.

270
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt,

271
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and in fact, they get exactly within, you know,

272
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
within one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old,

273
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.

274
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
That's some more evidence, so in some sense --

275
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I was criticized by a scientist, who said, "You could never publish

276
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
a study with an n of 4," meaning those four crashes.

277
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So I wrote him back and I said, "What about an n of 45,004?"

278
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Because I had the other 45,000 other real-world crashes.

279
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And I just think that it's interesting that the idea

280
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
of using real-world crashes, which is very much something

281
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that economists think would be the right thing to do,

282
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
is something that scientists don't actually, usually think --

283
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
they would rather use a laboratory,

284
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies,

285
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
than actually 30 years of data of what we've seen

286
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
with children and with car seats.

287
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And so I think the answer to this puzzle

288
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
is that there's a much better solution out there,

289
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that's gotten nobody excited because everyone

290
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working.

291
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And if you think from a design perspective,

292
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
about going back to square one, and say,

293
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
"I just want to protect kids in the back seat."

294
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say,

295
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
"Well, the right way to start would be,

296
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
let's make a great seat belt for adults.

297
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And then, let's make this really big contraption

298
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain."

299
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I mean, why not start -- who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids?

300
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
But essentially, do something like this,

301
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do,

302
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
but there's no reason I could see

303
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat.

304
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's just actually -- you see, this is folding up -- it's behind the seat.

305
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
You've got a regular seat for adults, and then you fold it down,

306
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and the kid sits on top, and it's integrated.

307
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution,

308
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and it's got to work better than what we already have.

309
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So the question is, is there any hope for adoption of something like this,

310
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
which would presumably save a lot of lives?

311
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.

312
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful,

313
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and why this may someday be adopted or not,

314
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
lies in a story that my dad told me, relating to when he was a doctor

315
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
in the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago:

316
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
you were allowed to do things then you can't do today.

317
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So, my father would have patients come in

318
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
who he thought were not really sick.

319
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them,

320
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and he'd say, "Come back in a week, if you still feel lousy."

321
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
OK, and most of them would not come back,

322
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
but some of them would come back.

323
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick,

324
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills.

325
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
They were almost impossible to swallow.

326
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And these, to me, are the analogy for the car seats.

327
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
People would look at these and say, "Man, this thing is so big

328
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better,

329
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
you know, what possibly could?"

330
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back,

331
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
because it worked. But every once in a while,

332
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
there was still a patient convinced that he was sick,

333
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills.

334
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And the jar of pills he had, he said,

335
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
were the tiniest little pills he could find,

336
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
so small you could barely see them.

337
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And he would say, listen, I know I gave you that huge pill,

338
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
that complicated, hard-to-swallow pill before,

339
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
but now I've got one that's so potent,

340
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that is really tiny and small and almost invisible.

341
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
It's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see."

342
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And it turned out that never,

343
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
in all the times my dad gave out this pill, the really tiny pill,

344
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness.

345
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
So, my dad always took that as evidence

346
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that this little, teeny, powerful pill

347
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
had the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense, if that's the right story,

348
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
I think integrated car seats you will see, very quickly,

349
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
becoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion

350
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
is, well, maybe after coming to my father three times,

351
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
getting sent home with placebos, he still felt sick,

352
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
he went and found another doctor.

353
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And that's completely possible. And if that's the case,

354
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.

355
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Thank you very much.

356
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
(Applause)

357
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
(Audience: I just wanted to ask you, when we wear seatbelts

358
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life,

359
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
it's also to prevent lots of serious injury.

360
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Your data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury.

361
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Is there any data to show that child seats

362
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
are actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts

363
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
for serious injury? Because that would prove your case.)

364
0:17:49.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Steven Levitt: Yeah, that's a great question. In my data, and in another data set

365
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I've looked at for New Jersey crashes,

366
0:17:55.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
I find very small differences in injury.

367
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
So in this data, it's statistically insignificant differences

368
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
in injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.

369
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
In the New Jersey data, which is different,

370
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
because it's not just fatal crashes,

371
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported,

372
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:14,000
it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries,

373
0:18:14.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
but generally they're the minor injuries.

374
0:18:16.33,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Now, what's interesting, I should say this as a disclaimer,

375
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data,

376
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:27,000
which suggests that car seats are dramatically better.

377
0:18:27.33,000 --> 0:18:29,000
And they use a completely different methodology that involves --

378
0:18:29.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
after the crash occurs, they get from the insurance companies

379
0:18:32.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
the names of the people who were in the crash,

380
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and they call them on the phone,

381
0:18:35.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and they asked them what happened.

382
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:39,000
And I really can't resolve, yet,

383
0:18:39.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and I'd like to work with these medical researchers

384
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
to try to understand how there can be these differences,

385
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
which are completely at odds with one another.

386
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:5,000
But it's obviously a critical question.

387
0:18:50.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
The question is even if -- are there enough serious injuries

388
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:56,000
to make these cost-effective? It's kind of tricky.

389
0:18:56.33,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Even if they're right, it's not so clear

390
0:18:58.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
that they're so cost-effective.

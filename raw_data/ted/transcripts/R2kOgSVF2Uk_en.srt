0:00:13.552,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This man is wearing what we call

3
0:00:16.266,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a bee beard. (Laughter)

4
0:00:19.036,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A beard full of bees.

5
0:00:20.485,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now, this is what many of you might picture

6
0:00:23.728,000 --> 0:00:25,000
when you think about honeybees, maybe insects,

7
0:00:26.701,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or maybe anything that has more legs than two.

8
0:00:29.789,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And let me start by telling you, I gotcha.

9
0:00:32.447,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I understand that. But, there are many things to know,

10
0:00:36.928,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I want you to open your minds here,

11
0:00:39.608,000 --> 0:00:42,000
keep them open, and change your perspective about honeybees.

12
0:00:43.098,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Notice that this man is not getting stung.

13
0:00:46.063,000 --> 0:00:49,000
He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin,

14
0:00:49.507,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the other bees are attracted to it.

15
0:00:51.626,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees,

16
0:00:55.662,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and that goes deep back for thousands of years.

17
0:00:59.43,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees

18
0:01:02.592,000 --> 0:01:04,000
for pollination and, even more recently,

19
0:01:05.552,000 --> 0:01:06,000
as an economic commodity.

20
0:01:07.376,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing,

21
0:01:10.176,000 --> 0:01:12,000
not just dying, but they're gone.

22
0:01:12.753,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We don't even find dead bodies.

23
0:01:14.555,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This is called colony collapse disorder,

24
0:01:16.926,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe

25
0:01:19.138,000 --> 0:01:21,000
still do not know what's causing it,

26
0:01:21.584,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but what we do know is that, with the declining numbers

27
0:01:24.154,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops

28
0:01:28.391,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that we rely on for food is going up in price.

29
0:01:33.398,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So honeybees are important for their role in the economy

30
0:01:37.156,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as well as in agriculture.

31
0:01:39.181,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Here you can see some pictures of what are called

32
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
green roofs, or urban agriculture.

33
0:01:43.689,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We're familiar with the image on the left that shows

34
0:01:45.967,000 --> 0:01:47,000
a local neighborhood garden in the South End.

35
0:01:48.751,000 --> 0:01:5,000
That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard.

36
0:01:51.542,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And perhaps a green roof in the future,

37
0:01:53.961,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when we're further utilizing urban areas,

38
0:01:55.892,000 --> 0:01:58,000
where there are stacks of garden spaces.

39
0:01:59.35,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Check out this image above the orange line in Boston.

40
0:02:02.703,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Try to spot the beehive. It's there.

41
0:02:06.18,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's on the rooftop, right on the corner there,

42
0:02:08.877,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and it's been there for a couple of years now.

43
0:02:11.27,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The way that urban beekeeping currently operates

44
0:02:14.522,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is that the beehives are quite hidden,

45
0:02:17.113,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and it's not because they need to be.

46
0:02:19.14,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea,

47
0:02:22.117,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and that's why I want you today to try to think about this,

48
0:02:25.791,000 --> 0:02:27,000
think about the benefits of bees in cities

49
0:02:28.074,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and why they really are a terrific thing.

50
0:02:30.333,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works.

51
0:02:33.303,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So we know flowers, we know fruits and vegetables,

52
0:02:35.886,000 --> 0:02:38,000
even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock

53
0:02:39.092,000 --> 0:02:41,000
for the meats that we eat, rely on pollinators,

54
0:02:41.555,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but you've got male and female parts to a plant here,

55
0:02:44.988,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and basically pollinators are attracted to plants

56
0:02:47.878,000 --> 0:02:5,000
for their nectar, and in the process,

57
0:02:50.905,000 --> 0:02:53,000
a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen,

58
0:02:54.28,000 --> 0:02:57,000
or that male kind of sperm counterpart, along the way,

59
0:02:57.712,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and then travel to different flowers, and eventually

60
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
an apple, in this case, will be produced.

61
0:03:03.449,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You can see the orientation. The stem is down.

62
0:03:05.716,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it,

63
0:03:08.67,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but that's a basic overview of how pollination works.

64
0:03:11.528,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And let's think about urban living, not today,

65
0:03:14.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and not in the past, but what about in a hundred years?

66
0:03:17.265,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges

67
0:03:21.203,000 --> 0:03:24,000
these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people,

68
0:03:25.133,000 --> 0:03:28,000
billions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people,

69
0:03:28.494,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and how little space there will be to fit all of them,

70
0:03:31.858,000 --> 0:03:34,000
so we need to change the way that we see cities, and

71
0:03:35.28,000 --> 0:03:38,000
looking at this picture on the left of New York City today,

72
0:03:38.643,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you can see how gray and brown it is.

73
0:03:40.51,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back

74
0:03:44.041,000 --> 0:03:46,000
into the atmosphere,

75
0:03:46.077,000 --> 0:03:48,000
contributing to global climate change, no doubt.

76
0:03:48.412,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops

77
0:03:50.912,000 --> 0:03:53,000
everywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops

78
0:03:54.075,000 --> 0:03:57,000
right in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation,

79
0:03:57.878,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we save on a healthier diet, and we also educate

80
0:04:01.974,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and create new jobs locally.

81
0:04:03.676,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living.

82
0:04:08.342,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Here's some data that we collected through our company

83
0:04:11.726,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage

84
0:04:14.628,000 --> 0:04:16,000
honeybee hives for anybody who wants them,

85
0:04:16.871,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees,

86
0:04:20.388,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop

87
0:04:23.247,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or fire escape, for even that matter,

88
0:04:25.728,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is.

89
0:04:28.502,000 --> 0:04:3,000
There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed

90
0:04:30.634,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here,

91
0:04:34.077,000 --> 0:04:35,000
overwintering survival.

92
0:04:35.477,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now this has been a huge problem for many years,

93
0:04:38.302,000 --> 0:04:42,000
basically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came

94
0:04:42.362,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and brought many different viruses, bacteria

95
0:04:45.738,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and fungal diseases with it.

96
0:04:47.542,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Overwintering success is hard,

97
0:04:49.291,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and that's when most of the colonies are lost,

98
0:04:51.584,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and we found that in the cities, bees are surviving

99
0:04:54.25,000 --> 0:04:56,000
better than they are in the country.

100
0:04:56.598,000 --> 0:04:58,000
A bit counterintuitive, right?

101
0:04:58.826,000 --> 0:05:,000
We think, oh, bees, countryside, agriculture,

102
0:05:00.908,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but that's not what the bees are showing.

103
0:05:03.135,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The bees like it in the city. (Laughter)

104
0:05:05.284,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Furthermore, they also produce more honey.

105
0:05:08.431,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The urban honey is delicious.

106
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel,

107
0:05:14.097,000 --> 0:05:16,000
where we have hundreds of thousands of bees

108
0:05:16.569,000 --> 0:05:17,000
flying overheard right now

109
0:05:18.072,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by,

110
0:05:20.377,000 --> 0:05:22,000
are going to all of the local community gardens

111
0:05:22.687,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and making delicious, healthy honey

112
0:05:25.086,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that just tastes like the flowers in our city.

113
0:05:28.114,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production,

114
0:05:32.901,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is higher as well as the overwintering survival,

115
0:05:36.016,000 --> 0:05:37,000
compared to rural areas.

116
0:05:37.39,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Again, a bit counterintuitive.

117
0:05:39.392,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And looking back historically at the timeline

118
0:05:42.713,000 --> 0:05:46,000
of honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see

119
0:05:46.989,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland.

120
0:05:50.037,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily

121
0:05:53.188,000 --> 0:05:55,000
something new. It has been happening

122
0:05:55.813,000 --> 0:05:57,000
since over a thousand years ago,

123
0:05:57.88,000 --> 0:06:,000
but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities.

124
0:06:01.577,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So one thing I want to encourage you to think about

125
0:06:03.605,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is the idea of what an urban island is.

126
0:06:06.007,000 --> 0:06:09,000
You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer.

127
0:06:09.403,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Why are bees doing better in the city?

128
0:06:10.982,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is a big question now to help us understand

129
0:06:13.654,000 --> 0:06:15,000
why they should be in the city.

130
0:06:15.975,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Perhaps there's more pollen in the city.

131
0:06:17.997,000 --> 0:06:19,000
With the trains coming in to urban hubs, they can

132
0:06:20.213,000 --> 0:06:22,000
carry pollen with them, very light pollen,

133
0:06:22.792,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and it's just a big supermarket in the city.

134
0:06:25.129,000 --> 0:06:28,000
A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks.

135
0:06:28.956,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities

136
0:06:31.722,000 --> 0:06:33,000
than there are in [rural] areas.

137
0:06:33.94,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Perhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet,

138
0:06:36.792,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but that's one idea to think about, urban islands.

139
0:06:39.399,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And colony collapse disorder is not the only thing

140
0:06:43.323,000 --> 0:06:45,000
affecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying,

141
0:06:46.225,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and it's a huge, huge grand challenge of our time.

142
0:06:49.929,000 --> 0:06:51,000
What you can see up here is a map of the world,

143
0:06:52.401,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite.

144
0:06:55.473,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now, the varroa mite is what changed the game

145
0:06:58.161,000 --> 0:07:,000
in beekeeping, and you can see, at the top right,

146
0:07:01.016,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the years are changing, we're coming up to modern times,

147
0:07:04.279,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and you can see the spread of the varroa mite

148
0:07:06.609,000 --> 0:07:08,000
from the early 1900s through now.

149
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's 1968, and we're pretty much covering Asia.

150
0:07:12.211,000 --> 0:07:16,000
1971, we saw it spread to Europe and South America,

151
0:07:16.273,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and then, when we get to the 1980s,

152
0:07:20.661,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and specifically to 1987, the varroa mite finally came

153
0:07:24.895,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to North America and to the United States,

154
0:07:27.277,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and that is when the game changed

155
0:07:29.733,000 --> 0:07:31,000
for honeybees in the United States.

156
0:07:32.414,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Many of us will remember our childhood growing up,

157
0:07:34.502,000 --> 0:07:36,000
maybe you got stung by a bee, you saw bees on flowers.

158
0:07:36.728,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Think of the kids today. Their childhood's a bit different.

159
0:07:40.666,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They don't experience this.

160
0:07:42.59,000 --> 0:07:44,000
The bees just aren't around anymore.

161
0:07:45.09,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem.

162
0:07:48.53,000 --> 0:07:49,000
What can we do here?

163
0:07:50.235,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So, what I do is honeybee research.

164
0:07:52.8,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health.

165
0:07:54.893,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I started in 2005 studying honeybees.

166
0:07:58.358,000 --> 0:08:,000
In 2006, honeybees started disappearing,

167
0:08:00.7,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so suddenly, like, this little nerd kid

168
0:08:03.061,000 --> 0:08:05,000
going to school working with bugs — (Laughter) —

169
0:08:05.678,000 --> 0:08:07,000
became very relevant in the world.

170
0:08:07.771,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And it worked out that way.

171
0:08:08.852,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier.

172
0:08:12.851,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I don't research what's killing the bees, per se.

173
0:08:15.642,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I'm not one of the many researchers around the world

174
0:08:17.825,000 --> 0:08:2,000
who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases

175
0:08:20.896,000 --> 0:08:22,000
or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees.

176
0:08:23.448,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We're looking at ways to make bees healthier

177
0:08:25.441,000 --> 0:08:28,000
through vaccines, through yogurt, like probiotics,

178
0:08:29.072,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees,

179
0:08:33.872,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and this process is so easy, even a 7-year-old can do it.

180
0:08:36.907,000 --> 0:08:38,000
You just mix up some pollen, sugar and water,

181
0:08:39.267,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and whatever active ingredient you want to put in,

182
0:08:41.069,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved,

183
0:08:43.267,000 --> 0:08:45,000
just immune boosters.

184
0:08:45.437,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Humans think about our own health in a prospective way.

185
0:08:47.637,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We exercise, we eat healthy, we take vitamins.

186
0:08:50.297,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way?

187
0:08:53.34,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Bring them to areas where they're thriving

188
0:08:55.906,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and try to make them healthier before they get sick.

189
0:08:59.342,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines

190
0:09:03.531,000 --> 0:09:06,000
with needles. (Laughter) Like, years,

191
0:09:06.873,000 --> 0:09:08,000
years at the bench, "Oh my gosh, it's 3 a.m.

192
0:09:09.175,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and I'm still pricking bees." (Laughter)

193
0:09:10.526,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And then one day I said, "Why don't we just do an oral vaccine?"

194
0:09:14.4,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's like, "Ugh," so that's what we do. (Laughter)

195
0:09:19.048,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives,

196
0:09:22.236,000 --> 0:09:24,000
because they can be anything.

197
0:09:24.718,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I mean, really open your mind with this.

198
0:09:26.621,000 --> 0:09:28,000
You can paint a hive to match your home.

199
0:09:28.795,000 --> 0:09:31,000
You can hide a hive inside your home.

200
0:09:32.165,000 --> 0:09:33,000
These are three hives on the rooftop

201
0:09:33.977,000 --> 0:09:35,000
of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel,

202
0:09:36.088,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and they're beautiful here. I mean, we matched

203
0:09:38.548,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the new color of the inside of their rooms to do

204
0:09:41.229,000 --> 0:09:44,000
some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets,

205
0:09:44.466,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and these bees are terrific, and they also will use

206
0:09:47.485,000 --> 0:09:49,000
herbs that are growing in the garden.

207
0:09:50.091,000 --> 0:09:53,000
That's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking,

208
0:09:53.19,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and the honey -- they do live events --

209
0:09:55.069,000 --> 0:09:57,000
they'll use that honey at their bars.

210
0:09:57.207,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar

211
0:09:59.827,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because there are different types of sugars in there.

212
0:10:01.954,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We also have a classroom hives project,

213
0:10:04.331,000 --> 0:10:06,000
where -- this is a nonprofit venture --

214
0:10:06.983,000 --> 0:10:09,000
we're spreading the word around the world for how

215
0:10:10.1,000 --> 0:10:12,000
honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom

216
0:10:12.385,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or into the museum setting, behind glass,

217
0:10:14.691,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and used as an educational tool.

218
0:10:17.099,000 --> 0:10:18,000
This hive that you see here has been

219
0:10:18.723,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in Fenway High School for many years now.

220
0:10:21.274,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park.

221
0:10:23.233,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Nobody notices it. If you're not a flower,

222
0:10:25.188,000 --> 0:10:27,000
these bees do not care about you. (Laughter)

223
0:10:27.809,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They don't. They don't. They'll say,

224
0:10:30.18,000 --> 0:10:32,000
"S'cuse me, flying around." (Laughter)

225
0:10:33.091,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Some other images here in telling a part of the story

226
0:10:35.654,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that really made urban beekeeping terrific is

227
0:10:38.292,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in New York City, beekeeping was illegal until 2010.

228
0:10:41.656,000 --> 0:10:44,000
That's a big problem, because what's going to pollinate

229
0:10:44.993,000 --> 0:10:47,000
all of the gardens and the produce locally? Hands?

230
0:10:48.417,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I mean, locally in Boston, there is a terrific company

231
0:10:51.773,000 --> 0:10:53,000
called Green City Growers, and they are going

232
0:10:54.178,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q-Tips,

233
0:10:57.689,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and if they miss that three day window, there's no fruit.

234
0:11:00.243,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Their clients aren't happy, and people go hungry.

235
0:11:03.146,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So this is important.

236
0:11:05.014,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We have also some images of honey from Brooklyn.

237
0:11:07.121,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Now, this was a mystery in the New York Times

238
0:11:09.073,000 --> 0:11:1,000
where the honey was very red, and the

239
0:11:10.921,000 --> 0:11:11,000
New York State forensics department came in

240
0:11:12.445,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and they actually did some science to match

241
0:11:15.047,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the red dye with that found

242
0:11:17.567,000 --> 0:11:2,000
in a maraschino cherry factory down the street. (Laughter)

243
0:11:20.818,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So you can tailor your honey to taste however you want

244
0:11:24.216,000 --> 0:11:26,000
by planting bee-friendly flowers.

245
0:11:26.511,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping.

246
0:11:29.249,000 --> 0:11:31,000
They've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house

247
0:11:31.799,000 --> 0:11:33,000
for many years now, and that's what really got people started, thinking,

248
0:11:34.735,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"Wow, we can do this, and we should do this."

249
0:11:38.203,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Also in London, and in Europe across the board,

250
0:11:41.036,000 --> 0:11:44,000
they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops

251
0:11:44.288,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and integrating beehives,

252
0:11:46.786,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and I'll show you an ending note here.

253
0:11:49.967,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I would like to encourage you to open your mind.

254
0:11:52.042,000 --> 0:11:55,000
What can you do to save the bees or to help them

255
0:11:55.203,000 --> 0:11:58,000
or to think of sustainable cities in the future?

256
0:11:58.994,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Well, really, just change your perspective.

257
0:12:00.964,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Try to understand that bees are very important.

258
0:12:02.938,000 --> 0:12:04,000
A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it.

259
0:12:05.349,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The bee dies. Honeybees die when they sting,

260
0:12:08.663,000 --> 0:12:1,000
so they don't want to do it either. (Laughter)

261
0:12:11.105,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's nothing to panic about. They're all over the city.

262
0:12:15.195,000 --> 0:12:17,000
You could even get your own hive if you want.

263
0:12:17.297,000 --> 0:12:18,000
There are great resources available,

264
0:12:19.025,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you

265
0:12:21.981,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and it's important for our educational system in the world

266
0:12:25.107,000 --> 0:12:27,000
for students to learn about agriculture worldwide

267
0:12:27.793,000 --> 0:12:3,000
such as this little girl, who, again, is not even getting stung.

268
0:12:31.628,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:13.619,000 --> 0:00:17,000
For the past few years, we've been calling men out.

2
0:00:19.103,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It had to be done.

3
0:00:20.326,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Applause)

4
0:00:22.302,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But lately, I've been thinking we need to do something even harder.

5
0:00:28.567,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We need, as my good friend Tony Porter says,

6
0:00:32.173,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to find a way to call men in.

7
0:00:37.412,000 --> 0:00:41,000
My father began to sexually abuse me when I was five years old.

8
0:00:42.586,000 --> 0:00:45,000
He would come into my room in the middle of the night.

9
0:00:45.705,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He appeared to be in a trance.

10
0:00:48.476,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The abuse continued until I was 10.

11
0:00:51.846,000 --> 0:00:53,000
When I tried to resist him,

12
0:00:54.173,000 --> 0:00:56,000
when I was finally able to say no,

13
0:00:56.984,000 --> 0:00:57,000
he began to beat me.

14
0:00:58.816,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He called me stupid.

15
0:01:00.614,000 --> 0:01:01,000
He said I was a liar.

16
0:01:02.974,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The sexual abuse ended when I was 10,

17
0:01:05.729,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but actually, it never ended.

18
0:01:09.531,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It changed who I was.

19
0:01:11.823,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I was filled with anxiety and guilt and shame all the time,

20
0:01:16.322,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I didn't know why.

21
0:01:18.145,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I hated my body, I hated myself,

22
0:01:21.224,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I got sick a lot,

23
0:01:22.994,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I couldn't think,

24
0:01:24.324,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I couldn't remember things.

25
0:01:26.343,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was drawn to dangerous men and women

26
0:01:29.569,000 --> 0:01:33,000
who I allowed -- actually, I invited -- to treat me badly,

27
0:01:34.462,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because that is what my father taught me love was.

28
0:01:38.708,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I waited my whole life for my father to apologize to me.

29
0:01:44.118,000 --> 0:01:45,000
He didn't.

30
0:01:45.494,000 --> 0:01:46,000
He wouldn't.

31
0:01:47.033,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And then, with the recent scandals of famous men,

32
0:01:49.818,000 --> 0:01:52,000
as one after another was exposed,

33
0:01:53.231,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I realized something:

34
0:01:55.481,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I have never heard a man

35
0:01:58.56,000 --> 0:02:02,000
who has committed rape or physical violence

36
0:02:02.782,000 --> 0:02:06,000
ever publicly apologize to his victim.

37
0:02:08.294,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I began to wonder,

38
0:02:10.14,000 --> 0:02:15,000
what would an authentic, deep apology be like?

39
0:02:20.179,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So, something strange began to happen.

40
0:02:24.404,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I began to write,

41
0:02:26.306,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and my father's voice began to come through me.

42
0:02:30.235,000 --> 0:02:32,000
He began to tell me what he had done

43
0:02:32.806,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and why.

44
0:02:34.269,000 --> 0:02:36,000
He began to apologize.

45
0:02:37.128,000 --> 0:02:39,000
My father is dead almost 31 years,

46
0:02:39.613,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and yet, in this apology,

47
0:02:41.385,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the one I had to write for him,

48
0:02:44.001,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I discovered the power of an apology

49
0:02:48.51,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and how it actually might be the way to move forward

50
0:02:51.265,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the crisis we now face

51
0:02:53.388,000 --> 0:02:56,000
with men and all the women they abuse.

52
0:02:57.196,000 --> 0:03:,000
Apology is a sacred commitment.

53
0:03:01.798,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It requires complete honesty.

54
0:03:04.719,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It demands deep self-interrogation and time.

55
0:03:07.972,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It cannot be rushed.

56
0:03:10.052,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I discovered an apology has four steps,

57
0:03:13.164,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and, if you would, I'd like to take you through them.

58
0:03:16.157,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The first is you have to say what, in detail, you did.

59
0:03:20.858,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Your accounting cannot be vague.

60
0:03:23.236,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"I'm sorry if I hurt you"

61
0:03:24.706,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or "I'm sorry if I sexually abused you"

62
0:03:26.731,000 --> 0:03:27,000
doesn't cut it.

63
0:03:28.35,000 --> 0:03:31,000
You have to say what actually happened.

64
0:03:32.351,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"I came into the room in the middle of the night,

65
0:03:34.7,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and I pulled your underpants down."

66
0:03:37.81,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"I belittled you because I was jealous of you

67
0:03:39.945,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and I wanted you to feel less."

68
0:03:42.373,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The liberation is in the details.

69
0:03:46.088,000 --> 0:03:48,000
An apology is a remembering.

70
0:03:48.954,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It connects the past with the present.

71
0:03:51.45,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It says that what occurred actually did occur.

72
0:03:55.838,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The second step is you have to ask yourself why.

73
0:04:00.997,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Survivors are haunted by the why.

74
0:04:04.043,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Why? Why would my father want to sexually abuse his eldest daughter?

75
0:04:09.163,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Why would he take my head and smash it against a wall?

76
0:04:15.565,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In my father's case,

77
0:04:17.692,000 --> 0:04:2,000
he was a child born long after the other children.

78
0:04:22.671,000 --> 0:04:25,000
He was an accident that became "the miracle."

79
0:04:26.495,000 --> 0:04:29,000
He was adored and treated as the golden boy.

80
0:04:30.714,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But adoration, it turns out, is not love.

81
0:04:34.41,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Adoration is a projection

82
0:04:35.887,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of someone's need for you to be perfect

83
0:04:38.181,000 --> 0:04:39,000
onto you.

84
0:04:39.788,000 --> 0:04:41,000
My father had to live up to this impossible ideal,

85
0:04:42.755,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and so he was never allowed to be himself.

86
0:04:45.441,000 --> 0:04:47,000
He was never allowed to express tenderness

87
0:04:47.526,000 --> 0:04:5,000
or vulnerability, curiosity, doubt.

88
0:04:50.783,000 --> 0:04:52,000
He was never allowed to cry.

89
0:04:53.023,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And so he was forced to push all those feelings underground,

90
0:04:56.211,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and they eventually metastasized.

91
0:04:59.124,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Those suppressed feelings later became Shadowman,

92
0:05:03.319,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and he was out of control,

93
0:05:04.987,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and he eventually unleashed his torrent on me.

94
0:05:10.215,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The third step is you have to open your heart

95
0:05:14.239,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and feel what your victim felt as you were abusing her.

96
0:05:19.072,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You have to let your heart break.

97
0:05:21.056,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You have to feel the horror and betrayal

98
0:05:23.228,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and the long-term impacts of your abuse on your victim.

99
0:05:27.883,000 --> 0:05:3,000
You have to sit with the suffering you have caused.

100
0:05:31.729,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And, of course, the fourth step

101
0:05:33.397,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is taking responsibility for what you have done

102
0:05:36.618,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and making amends.

103
0:05:38.977,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So, why would anyone want to go through such a grueling and humbling process?

104
0:05:44.982,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Why would you want to rip yourself open?

105
0:05:48.636,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Because it is the only thing that will set yourself free.

106
0:05:52.853,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It is the only thing that will set your victim free.

107
0:05:56.564,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You didn't just destroy your victim.

108
0:05:59.408,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You destroyed yourself.

109
0:06:01.479,000 --> 0:06:05,000
There is no one who enacts violence on another person

110
0:06:05.63,000 --> 0:06:07,000
who doesn't suffer from the effects themselves.

111
0:06:09.348,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It creates an incredibly dark and contaminating spirit,

112
0:06:16.012,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and it spreads throughout your entire life.

113
0:06:19.962,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The apology I wrote -- I learned something

114
0:06:22.756,000 --> 0:06:24,000
about a different lens we have to look through

115
0:06:25.18,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to understand the problem of men's violence

116
0:06:28.227,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that I and one billion other women have survived.

117
0:06:32.438,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We often turn to punishment first.

118
0:06:35.576,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's our first instinct, but actually,

119
0:06:38.024,000 --> 0:06:42,000
although punishment sometimes is effective,

120
0:06:42.464,000 --> 0:06:44,000
on its own, it is not enough.

121
0:06:44.738,000 --> 0:06:45,000
My father punished me.

122
0:06:46.849,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I was shut down,

123
0:06:48.1,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and I was broken.

124
0:06:50.587,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I think punishment hardens us, but it doesn't teach us.

125
0:06:54.166,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Humiliation is not revelation.

126
0:06:57.334,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We actually need to create a process that may involve punishment,

127
0:07:02.214,000 --> 0:07:04,000
whereby we open a doorway

128
0:07:04.553,000 --> 0:07:08,000
where men can actually become something and someone else.

129
0:07:09.847,000 --> 0:07:11,000
For so many years, I hated my father.

130
0:07:12.256,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I wanted him dead. I wanted him in prison.

131
0:07:15.258,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But actually, that rage kept me connected to my father's story.

132
0:07:20.086,000 --> 0:07:24,000
What I really wanted wasn't just for my father to be stopped.

133
0:07:24.681,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I wanted him to change.

134
0:07:26.277,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I wanted him to apologize.

135
0:07:28.181,000 --> 0:07:29,000
That's what we want.

136
0:07:29.871,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We don't want men to be destroyed,

137
0:07:32.196,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we don't want them to only be punished.

138
0:07:34.974,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We want them to see us, the victims that they have harmed,

139
0:07:39.656,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and we want them to repent

140
0:07:41.675,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and change.

141
0:07:43.425,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And I actually believe this is possible.

142
0:07:46.474,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I really believe it's our way forward.

143
0:07:49.928,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But we need men to join us.

144
0:07:53.354,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We need men now to be brave and be part of this transformation.

145
0:07:59.677,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I have spent most of my life calling men out,

146
0:08:04.344,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and I am here now,

147
0:08:07.336,000 --> 0:08:08,000
right now,

148
0:08:09.049,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to call you in.

149
0:08:13.104,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Thank you.

150
0:08:14.28,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Applause)

151
0:08:16.714,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Thank you.

152
0:08:17.889,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Applause)

153
0:08:18.929,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Thank you, thank you.

154
0:08:20.222,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Applause)

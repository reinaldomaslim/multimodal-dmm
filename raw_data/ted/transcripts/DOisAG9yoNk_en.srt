1
0:04:22.3,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So now that I was 4,000 dollars in the hole, I did two things.

2
0:04:25.859,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The first is that I unlinked my credit card

3
0:04:28.437,000 --> 0:04:29,000
from my car-sharing apps.

4
0:04:29.926,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Instead, I linked a debit card that only had 300 dollars a month.

5
0:04:34.046,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If I needed more,

6
0:04:35.268,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I had to go through the whole process of adding a new card,

7
0:04:38.142,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and we know that every click, every barrier, changes our behavior.

8
0:00:00.165,000 --> 0:00:01,000
We all know that saving is important

9
0:00:01.948,000 --> 0:00:02,000
and is something that we should be doing.

10
0:00:03.966,000 --> 0:00:05,000
And yet, overall, we're doing less and less of it.

11
0:00:06.347,000 --> 0:00:08,000
[The Way We Work]

12
0:00:10.622,000 --> 0:00:11,000
We know what we need to do.

13
0:00:12.233,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The question is: How do we do it?

14
0:00:14.392,000 --> 0:00:15,000
And that's what I'm here to teach you.

15
0:00:16.242,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Your savings behavior isn't a question of how smart you are

16
0:00:19.099,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or how much willpower you have.

17
0:00:20.633,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The amount we save depends on the environmental cues around us.

18
0:00:23.934,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Let me give you an example.

19
0:00:25.371,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We ran a study in which, in one group,

20
0:00:27.903,000 --> 0:00:29,000
we showed people their income on a monthly basis.

21
0:00:30.823,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In another group, we showed people their income on a weekly basis.

22
0:00:34.49,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And what we found was that people who saw their income on a weekly basis

23
0:00:38.8,000 --> 0:00:4,000
were able to budget better throughout the month.

24
0:00:41.196,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now, it's important to know

25
0:00:42.52,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that we didn't change how much money people were receiving,

26
0:00:45.321,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we just changed the environment in which they understood their income.

27
0:00:48.659,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And environmental cues like this have an impact.

28
0:00:51.128,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So I'm not going to share tricks with you that you already know.

29
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'm not going to tell you how to open up a savings account

30
0:00:56.946,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or how to start saving for your retirement.

31
0:00:58.982,000 --> 0:01:,000
What I am going to share with you is how to bridge this gap

32
0:01:01.891,000 --> 0:01:02,000
from your intentions to save

33
0:01:03.728,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and your actions.

34
0:01:05.046,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Are you ready?

35
0:01:06.251,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Here's number one:

36
0:01:07.466,000 --> 0:01:08,000
harness the power of pre-commitment.

37
0:01:09.237,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Fundamentally, we think about ourselves in two different ways:

38
0:01:12.284,000 --> 0:01:14,000
our present self and our future self.

39
0:01:14.769,000 --> 0:01:15,000
In the future, we're perfect.

40
0:01:16.444,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In the future, we're going to save for retirement,

41
0:01:18.824,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we're going to lose weight,

42
0:01:20.143,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we're going to call our parents more.

43
0:01:21.96,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But we oftentimes forget that our future self

44
0:01:24.109,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is exactly the same person as our present self.

45
0:01:27.173,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We know that one of the best times to save is when you get your tax return.

46
0:01:30.776,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So we tried an A/B test.

47
0:01:32.434,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In the first group, we texted people in early February,

48
0:01:35.847,000 --> 0:01:37,000
hopefully before they even filed for their taxes.

49
0:01:38.323,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And we asked them,

50
0:01:39.506,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"If you get a tax refund, what percentage would you like to save?"

51
0:01:42.867,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now this is a really hard question.

52
0:01:44.589,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They didn't know if they would receive a tax refund or how much.

53
0:01:48.189,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But we asked the question anyway.

54
0:01:49.906,000 --> 0:01:53,000
In the second group, we asked people right after they received their refund,

55
0:01:54.119,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"What percentage would you like to save?"

56
0:01:56.119,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now, here's what happened.

57
0:01:57.437,000 --> 0:02:,000
In that second condition, when people just received their tax refund,

58
0:02:01.396,000 --> 0:02:04,000
they wanted to save about 17 percent of their tax refund.

59
0:02:04.541,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But in the condition when we asked people before they even filed their taxes,

60
0:02:09.081,000 --> 0:02:13,000
savings rates increased from 17 percent to 27 percent

61
0:02:13.558,000 --> 0:02:14,000
when we asked in February.

62
0:02:14.96,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Why?

63
0:02:16.154,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Because you're committing for your future self,

64
0:02:18.394,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and of course your future self can save 27 percent.

65
0:02:21.117,000 --> 0:02:23,000
These large changes in savings behavior

66
0:02:23.744,000 --> 0:02:26,000
came from the fact that we changed the decision-making environment.

67
0:02:26.927,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We want you to be able to harness that same power.

68
0:02:29.37,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So take a moment

69
0:02:30.654,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and think about the ways in which you can sign up your future self

70
0:02:34.093,000 --> 0:02:36,000
for something that you know today will be a little bit hard.

71
0:02:37.093,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Sign up for an app that lets you make savings decisions in advance.

72
0:02:40.776,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The trick is, you have to have that binding contract.

73
0:02:44.006,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Number two: use transition moments to your advantage.

74
0:02:47.632,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We did an experiment with a website

75
0:02:49.54,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that helps older adults share their housing.

76
0:02:52.085,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We ran two ads on social media,

77
0:02:54.061,000 --> 0:02:56,000
targeted to the same population of 64-year-olds.

78
0:02:56.927,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In one group, we said, "Hey, you're getting older.

79
0:02:59.992,000 --> 0:03:,000
Are you ready for retirement?

80
0:03:01.45,000 --> 0:03:02,000
House sharing can help."

81
0:03:02.657,000 --> 0:03:04,000
In the second group, we got a little bit more specific

82
0:03:05.497,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and said, "You're 64 turning 65.

83
0:03:07.903,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Are you ready for retirement?

84
0:03:09.352,000 --> 0:03:1,000
House sharing can help."

85
0:03:10.704,000 --> 0:03:11,000
What we're doing in that second group

86
0:03:12.569,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is highlighting that a transition is happening.

87
0:03:15.085,000 --> 0:03:16,000
All of a sudden,

88
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we saw click-through rates, and ultimately sign-up rates, increase

89
0:03:19.406,000 --> 0:03:2,000
when we highlight that.

90
0:03:20.59,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In psychology, we call this the "fresh start effect."

91
0:03:23.331,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Whether it's the start of a new year or even a new season,

92
0:03:26.53,000 --> 0:03:28,000
your motivation to act increases.

93
0:03:28.988,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So right now, put a meeting request on your calendar

94
0:03:31.561,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for the day before your next birthday.

95
0:03:33.466,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Identify the one financial thing you most want to do.

96
0:03:36.863,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And commit yourself to it.

97
0:03:38.78,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The third and final trick:

98
0:03:40.521,000 --> 0:03:43,000
get a handle on small, frequent purchases.

99
0:03:43.736,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We've run a few different studies

100
0:03:45.792,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and found that the number one purchase people say they regret, after bank fees,

101
0:03:50.403,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is eating out.

102
0:03:51.577,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's a frequent purchase we make almost every day,

103
0:03:54.379,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and it's death by a thousand cuts.

104
0:03:56.574,000 --> 0:03:58,000
A coffee here, a burrito there ...

105
0:03:58.957,000 --> 0:04:,000
It adds up and decreases our ability to save.

106
0:04:02.513,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Back when I lived in New York City,

107
0:04:04.268,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I looked at my expenses

108
0:04:05.673,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and saw that I spent over 2,000 dollars on ride-sharing apps.

109
0:04:09.887,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It was more than my New York City rent.

110
0:04:11.926,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I vowed to make a change.

111
0:04:13.752,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And the next month, I spent 2,000 dollars again --

112
0:04:16.738,000 --> 0:04:19,000
no change, because the information alone didn't change my behavior.

113
0:04:20.577,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I didn't change my environment.

114
0:04:42.618,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We aren't machines.

115
0:04:43.912,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We don't carry around an abacus every day,

116
0:04:46.388,000 --> 0:04:49,000
adding up what we're spending, in comparison to what we wanted.

117
0:04:50.098,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But what our brains are very good at

118
0:04:52.376,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is counting up the number of times we've done something.

119
0:04:55.551,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So I gave myself a limit.

120
0:04:57.36,000 --> 0:05:,000
I can only use ride-sharing apps three times a week.

121
0:05:00.942,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It forced me to ration my travels.

122
0:05:03.68,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I got a handle on my car-sharing expenses to the benefit of my husband,

123
0:05:07.362,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because of the environmental changes that I did.

124
0:05:09.633,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So get a handle on whatever that purchase is for you,

125
0:05:12.529,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and change your environment to make it harder to do so.

126
0:05:15.895,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Those are my tips for you.

127
0:05:17.72,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But I want you to remember one thing.

128
0:05:19.879,000 --> 0:05:22,000
As human beings, we can be irrational when it comes to saving

129
0:05:23.83,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and spending and budgeting.

130
0:05:25.728,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But luckily, we know this about ourselves,

131
0:05:27.998,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we can predict how we'll act under certain environments.

132
0:05:31.641,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Let's do that with saving.

133
0:05:33.45,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Let's change our environment to help our future selves.

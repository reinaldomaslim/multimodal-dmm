1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My topic

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is economic growth in China and India.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the question I want to explore with you

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is whether or not

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
democracy has helped or has hindered

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
economic growth.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
You may say this is not fair,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
because I'm selecting two countries

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to make a case against democracy.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Actually, exactly the opposite

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is what I'm going to do.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'm going to use these two countries

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to make an economic argument for democracy,

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
rather than against democracy.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The first question there

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is why China has grown so much faster

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
than India.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Over the last 30 years,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in terms of the GDP growth rates,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
China has grown at twice the rate of India.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In the last five years,

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the two countries have begun to converge somewhat

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in economic growth.

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But over the last 30 years,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
China undoubtedly

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
has done much better than India.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
One simple answer

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Look at the skyline of Shanghai.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This is the Pudong area.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The picture on India

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in India.

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The idea there

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
behind these two pictures

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is that the Chinese government

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
can act above rule of law.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It can plan

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
for the long-term benefits of the country

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and in the process,

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
evict millions of people --

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that's just a small technical issue.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Whereas in India, you cannot do that,

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
because you have to listen to the public.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
You're being constrained by the public's opinion.

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
agrees with that view.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In an interview

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
printed in the financial press of India,

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
He said that he wants to make Mumbai

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
another Shanghai.

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This is an Oxford-trained economist

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
steeped in humanistic values,

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and yet he agrees

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth,

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that emphasizes the following features

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
for promoting economic development:

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
infrastructures, airports,

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
highways, bridges, things like that.

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And you need a strong government to do that,

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because you cannot respect private property rights.

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You need also state ownership,

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
especially of land assets,

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
in order to build and roll out infrastructures

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
very quickly.

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The implication of that model

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is that democracy

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is a hindrance for economic growth,

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
rather than a facilitator of economic growth.

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Here's the key question.

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Just how important are infrastructures

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for economic growth?

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This is a key issue.

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth,

77
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
then you would argue a strong government is necessary

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to promote growth.

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
If you believe

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe,

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
then you will put less emphasis

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
on strong government.

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So to illustrate that question,

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
let me give you two countries.

85
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And for the sake of brevity,

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I'll call one country Country 1

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and the other country Country 2.

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Country 1

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
has a systematic advantage over Country 2

90
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in infrastructures.

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Country 1 has more telephones,

92
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and Country 1 has a longer system of railways.

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So if I were to ask you,

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
"Which is China

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and which is India,

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and which country has grown faster?"

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
if you believe in the infrastructure view,

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
then you will say, "Country 1 must be China.

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
They must have done better, in terms of economic growth.

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And Country 2 is possibly India."

101
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Actually the country with more telephones

102
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is the Soviet Union,

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and the data referred to 1989.

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones,

105
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the country collapsed.

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That's not too good.

107
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The picture there is Khrushchev.

108
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I know that in 1989

109
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
he no longer ruled the Soviet Union,

110
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but that's the best picture that I can find.

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Telephones, infrastructures

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
do not guarantee you economic growth.

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Country 2, that has fewer telephones,

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is China.

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Since 1989,

117
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the country has performed at a double-digit rate

118
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
every year for the last 20 years.

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union

120
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
other than the fact about their telephones,

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you would have made a poor prediction

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
about their economic growth

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in the next two decades.

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Country 1, that has a longer system of railways,

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is actually India.

126
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And Country 2 is China.

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is a very little known fact

128
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
about the two countries.

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Yes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage

130
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
over India.

131
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But for many years,

132
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
until the late 1990s,

133
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
China had an infrastructure disadvantage

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
vis-a-vis India.

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In developing countries,

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the most common mode of transportation

137
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is the railways,

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and the British built a lot of railways in India.

139
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
India is the smaller of the two countries,

140
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and yet it had a longer system of railways

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
until the late 1990s.

142
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So clearly,

143
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
infrastructure doesn't explain

144
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
why China did better before the late 1990s,

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
as compared with India.

146
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide,

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the evidence is more supportive of the view

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.

149
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The economy grows,

150
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
government accumulates more resources,

151
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and the government can invest in infrastructure --

152
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
rather than infrastructure being a cause

153
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
for economic growth.

154
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And this is clearly the story

155
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
of the Chinese economic growth.

156
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Let me look at this question more directly.

157
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Is democracy bad for economic growth?

158
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Now let's turn to two countries,

159
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Country A and Country B.

160
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Country A, in 1990,

161
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
had about $300 per capita GDP

162
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
as compared with Country B,

163
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
which had $460 in per capita GDP.

164
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
By 2008,

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Country A has surpassed Country B

166
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with $700 per capita GDP

167
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
as compared with $650 per capita GDP.

168
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Both countries are in Asia.

169
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
If I were to ask you,

170
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"Which are the two Asian countries?

171
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And which one is a democracy?"

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you may argue,

173
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
"Well, maybe Country A is China

174
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and Country B is India."

175
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
In fact, Country A

176
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is democratic India,

177
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and Country B is Pakistan --

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the country that has a long period

179
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of military rule.

180
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And it's very common

181
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that we compare India with China.

182
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
That's because the two countries

183
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
have about the same population size.

184
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But the more natural comparison

185
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is actually between India and Pakistan.

186
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Those two countries are geographically similar.

187
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They have a complicated, but shared common history.

188
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
By that comparison,

189
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
democracy looks very, very good

190
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in terms of economic growth.

191
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So why do economists fall in love

192
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
with authoritarian governments?

193
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
One reason is the East Asian Model.

194
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
In East Asia,

195
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we have had successful economic growth stories

196
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
such as Korea, Taiwan,

197
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Hong Kong and Singapore.

198
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Some of these economies

199
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
were ruled by authoritarian governments

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in the 60s and 70s

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and 1980s.

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The problem with that view

203
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is like asking all the winners of lotteries,

204
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"Have you won the lottery?"

205
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And they all tell you, "Yes, we have won the lottery."

206
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And then you draw the conclusion

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the odds of winning the lottery

208
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
are 100 percent.

209
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The reason is you never go

210
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and bother to ask the losers

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
who also purchased lottery tickets

212
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and didn't end up winning the prize.

213
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
For each of these successful authoritarian governments

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in East Asia,

215
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
there's a matched failure.

216
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't.

217
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Taiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.

218
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Burma didn't succeed.

219
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The Philippines didn't succeed.

220
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide,

221
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
there's really no support for the idea

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that authoritarian governments

223
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
hold a systematic edge over democracies

224
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in terms of economic growth.

225
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So the East Asian model

226
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
has this massive selection bias --

227
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
it is known as selecting on a dependent variable,

228
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
something we always tell our students to avoid.

229
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So exactly why did China grow so much faster?

230
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I will take you to the Cultural Revolution,

231
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
when China went mad,

232
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and compare that country's performance with India

233
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
under Indira Gandhi.

234
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The question there is: Which country did better,

235
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
China or India?

236
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
China was during the Cultural Revolution.

237
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution,

238
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
China out-perfomed India

239
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in terms of GDP growth

240
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
by an average of about 2.2 percent every year

241
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in terms of per capita GDP.

242
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So that's when China was mad.

243
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
The whole country went mad.

244
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It must mean that the country

245
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth

246
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to overcome the negative effects

247
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of the Cultural Revolution.

248
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The advantage the country had

249
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
was human capital --

250
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
nothing else but human capital.

251
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is the world development index indicator data

252
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
in the early 1990s.

253
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And this is the earliest data that I can find.

254
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The adult literacy rate in China

255
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is 77 percent

256
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
as compared with 48 percent in India.

257
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The contrast in literacy rates

258
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
is especially sharp

259
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
between Chinese women and Indian women.

260
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I haven't told you about the definition of literacy.

261
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
In China, the definition of literacy

262
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is the ability to read and write

263
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
1,500 Chinese characters.

264
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
In India, the definition of literacy,

265
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
operating definition of literacy,

266
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is the ability, the grand ability,

267
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to write your own name

268
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in whatever language you happen to speak.

269
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy

270
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
is much more substantial

271
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
than the data here indicated.

272
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
If you go to other sources of data

273
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
such as Human Development Index,

274
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that data series,

275
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
go back to the early 1970s,

276
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
you see exactly the same contrast.

277
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
China held a huge advantage

278
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in terms of human capital

279
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
vis-a-vis India.

280
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Life expectancies:

281
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
as early as 1965,

282
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
China had a huge advantage in life expectancy.

283
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
On average, as a Chinese in 1965,

284
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
you lived 10 years more

285
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
than an average Indian.

286
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So if you have a choice

287
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
between being a Chinese and being an Indian,

288
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
you would want to become a Chinese

289
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in order to live 10 years longer.

290
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
If you made that decision in 1965,

291
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the down side of that

292
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.

293
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So you have to always think carefully

294
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
about these decisions.

295
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If you cannot chose your nationality,

296
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
then you will want to become an Indian man.

297
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Because, as an Indian man,

298
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
you have about two years of life expectancy advantage

299
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
vis-a-vis Indian women.

300
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
This is an extremely strange fact.

301
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's very rare among countries

302
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to have this kind of pattern.

303
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It shows the systematic discrimination and biases

304
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in the Indian society

305
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
against women.

306
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The good news is, by 2006,

307
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
India has closed the gap

308
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
between men and women

309
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
in terms of life expectancy.

310
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Today, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge

311
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
over Indian men.

312
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So India is reverting to the normal.

313
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But India still has a lot of work to do

314
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
in terms of gender equality.

315
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
These are the two pictures

316
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province

317
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and garment factories in India.

318
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
In China, it's all women.

319
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women

320
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in the coastal part of the country,

321
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
whereas in India, it's all men.

322
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Financial Times printed this picture

323
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
of an Indian textile factory

324
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
with the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile."

325
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
By looking at these two pictures,

326
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I say no, it won't overtake China for a while.

327
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
If you look at other East Asian countries,

328
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
women there play a hugely important role

329
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
in terms of economic take-off --

330
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle

331
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
associated with East Asia.

332
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
India still has a long way to go

333
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
to catch up with China.

334
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Then the issue is,

335
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
what about the Chinese political system?

336
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
You talk about human capital,

337
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
you talk about education and public health.

338
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
What about the political system?

339
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Isn't it true that the one-party political system

340
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
has facilitated economic growth in China?

341
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Actually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.

342
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It depends on a distinction that you draw

343
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
between statics of the political system

344
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and the dynamics of the political system.

345
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Statically, China is a one-party system,

346
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
authoritarian -- there's no question about it.

347
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Dynamically, it has changed over time

348
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
to become less authoritarian and more democratic.

349
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
When you explain change --

350
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
for example, economic growth;

351
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
economic growth is about change --

352
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
when you explain change,

353
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
you use other things that have changed to explain change,

354
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
rather than using the constant to explain change.

355
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change,

356
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
but a fixed effect only explains changes

357
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in interaction with the things that change.

358
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
In terms of the political changes,

359
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
they have introduced village elections.

360
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
They have increased the security of proprietors.

361
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And they have increased the security

362
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
with long-term land leases.

363
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
There are also financial reforms in rural China.

364
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.

365
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
To me, the pace of political changes

366
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
is too slow, too gradual.

367
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And my own view is the country

368
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
is going to face some substantial challenges,

369
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.

370
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But nevertheless,

371
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
the system has moved in a more liberal direction,

372
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
moved in a more democratic direction.

373
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.

374
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
In fact, when India was growing

375
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
at a Hindu rate of growth --

376
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
about one percent, two percent a year --

377
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that was when India was least democratic.

378
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.

379
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
The Indian government owned and operated

380
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
all the TV stations.

381
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
A little-known fact about India in the 1990s

382
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
is that the country

383
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
not only has undertaken economic reforms,

384
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
the country has also undertaken political reforms

385
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
by introducing village self-rule,

386
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
privatization of media

387
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and introducing freedom of information acts.

388
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So the dynamic perspective

389
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
fits both with China and in India

390
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
in terms of the direction.

391
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Why do many people believe

392
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that India is still a growth disaster?

393
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
One reason

394
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
is they are always comparing India with China.

395
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
But China is a superstar

396
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
in terms of economic growth.

397
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
If you are a NBA player

398
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan,

399
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
you're going to look not so impressive.

400
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
But that doesn't mean

401
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
that you're a bad basketball player.

402
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Comparing with a superstar

403
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
is the wrong benchmark.

404
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
In fact, if you compare India

405
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
with the average developing country,

406
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
even before the more recent period

407
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
of acceleration of Indian growth --

408
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
now India is growing between eight and nine percent --

409
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
even before this period,

410
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth

411
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
among emerging economies.

412
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
This is a very impressive record indeed.

413
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Let's think about the future:

414
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant.

415
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Which country has the growth momentum?

416
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
China, I believe, still has

417
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
some of the excellent raw fundamentals --

418
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
mostly the social capital,

419
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
the public health,

420
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
the sense of egalitarianism

421
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
that you don't find in India.

422
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
But I believe that India has the momentum.

423
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
It has the improving fundamentals.

424
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
The government has invested in basic education,

425
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
has invested in basic health.

426
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I believe the government should do more,

427
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
but nevertheless, the direction it is moving in

428
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
is the right direction.

429
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
India has the right institutional conditions

430
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
for economic growth,

431
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
whereas China is still struggling

432
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
with political reforms.

433
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I believe that the political reforms are a must for China

434
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
to maintain its growth.

435
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And it's very important to have political reforms,

436
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
to have widely shared benefits of economic growth.

437
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
I don't know whether that's going to happen or not,

438
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
but I'm an optimist.

439
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Hopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal

440
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
that political reforms will happen in China.

441
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Thank you very much.

442
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
(Applause)

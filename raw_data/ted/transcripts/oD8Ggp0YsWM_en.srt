[This talk contains mature content]

0:00:16.975,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When I was 14,

3
0:00:18.613,000 --> 0:00:22,000
my parents intended to marry me off to a man of their choosing.

4
0:00:23.433,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I refused.

5
0:00:25.171,000 --> 0:00:29,000
That choice to defy my family shaped everything in my life

6
0:00:29.39,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and set me on the path to become who I am today.

7
0:00:32.978,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But it was very painful at times and continues to be so.

8
0:00:36.988,000 --> 0:00:4,000
My parents were raised in traditional, uneducated Moroccan families

9
0:00:41.313,000 --> 0:00:45,000
where a girl's main value is measured by her virginity.

10
0:00:46.095,000 --> 0:00:47,000
They emigrated to Belgium,

11
0:00:47.875,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I was born, raised and educated there.

12
0:00:51.571,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I did not accept their view of the world.

13
0:00:54.421,000 --> 0:00:56,000
When I said no to them,

14
0:00:56.502,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I paid for it dearly in terms of physical and emotional abuse.

15
0:01:00.717,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But eventually, I escaped from their home

16
0:01:03.496,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and became a federal police detective

17
0:01:05.602,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who could help protect the rights of others.

18
0:01:08.493,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My specialty was investigating cases in counterterrorism,

19
0:01:12.455,000 --> 0:01:14,000
child abduction and homicide.

20
0:01:15.191,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I loved that work,

21
0:01:16.53,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and it was extremely fulfilling.

22
0:01:19.562,000 --> 0:01:22,000
With my Muslim background, Arabic language skills

23
0:01:22.793,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and an interest in working internationally,

24
0:01:25.344,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I decided to seek new challenges.

25
0:01:28.132,000 --> 0:01:3,000
After decades of being a police officer,

26
0:01:30.629,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I was recruited to become an investigator of sexual and gender-based violence

27
0:01:35.223,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as a member of the Justice Rapid Response and UN Women roster.

28
0:01:40.169,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Justice Rapid Response is an organization

29
0:01:42.595,000 --> 0:01:44,000
for criminal investigations of mass atrocities.

30
0:01:45.781,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They run on both public and private funding

31
0:01:49.232,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and provide evidence and reports to more than 100 participating countries.

32
0:01:54.63,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Many countries in conflict are often unable to provide a just process

33
0:01:58.496,000 --> 0:02:,000
to those who have been victims of mass violence.

34
0:02:01.554,000 --> 0:02:02,000
To respond to that,

35
0:02:02.871,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Justice Rapid Response was created in partnership with UN Women.

36
0:02:07.571,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Together,

37
0:02:08.748,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Justice Rapid Response and UN Women recruited, trained and certified

38
0:02:13.774,000 --> 0:02:15,000
more than 250 professionals

39
0:02:16.355,000 --> 0:02:19,000
with a specific expertise in sexual and gender-based violence,

40
0:02:19.969,000 --> 0:02:2,000
like me.

41
0:02:21.571,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Our investigations are carried out under international law,

42
0:02:25.112,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and our findings eventually become evidence to prosecute war criminals.

43
0:02:30.122,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This mechanism provides hope to victims

44
0:02:33.284,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that justice and accountability may someday be found

45
0:02:36.808,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in the wake of war and conflict.

46
0:02:40.205,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Let me tell you about the most challenging work I have ever done.

47
0:02:44.56,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This was in Iraq.

48
0:02:47.492,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Since the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,

49
0:02:52.203,000 --> 0:02:54,000
this group has systematically attacked and tortured

50
0:02:55.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
many religious minorities and ethnicities,

51
0:02:58.44,000 --> 0:02:59,000
such as the Christians,

52
0:03:00.193,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the Shia Turkmen, Shia Muslims, Shia Shabaks and the Yazidis.

53
0:03:05.788,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The persecution of the Yazidis has been especially horrific.

54
0:03:10.102,000 --> 0:03:13,000
On the 3rd and 15th of August 2014,

55
0:03:13.266,000 --> 0:03:18,000
ISIS attacked approximately 20 villages and towns in Sinjar, Iraq.

56
0:03:19.046,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They executed all the males over the age of 14,

57
0:03:23.692,000 --> 0:03:25,000
including the elderly and disabled.

58
0:03:26.096,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They divided up the women and girls,

59
0:03:28.761,000 --> 0:03:29,000
raped them

60
0:03:29.989,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and sold them into sexual and domestic slavery.

61
0:03:32.802,000 --> 0:03:33,000
One month later,

62
0:03:33.992,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a UN Human Rights Council resolution led to the fact-finding mission on Iraq

63
0:03:38.719,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to investigate and document alleged violations and abuses

64
0:03:42.126,000 --> 0:03:44,000
committed by ISIS and associated groups.

65
0:03:45.136,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I was sent to investigate the atrocities committed against the Yazidis,

66
0:03:49.008,000 --> 0:03:51,000
with a focus on sexual and gender-based crimes.

67
0:03:52.737,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The Yazidis are a Kurdish-speaking ethnoreligious community

68
0:03:56.524,000 --> 0:03:57,000
based in Northern Iraq.

69
0:03:58.655,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Their belief system incorporates aspects of Judaism, Christianity,

70
0:04:03.584,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Islam and Zoroastrianism.

71
0:04:06.669,000 --> 0:04:07,000
For hundreds of years,

72
0:04:07.961,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Muslims and Christians who do not understand their beliefs

73
0:04:11.329,000 --> 0:04:14,000
have condemned the Yazidis as devil worshippers.

74
0:04:15.171,000 --> 0:04:19,000
ISIS thought of them in this way and vowed to destroy them.

75
0:04:20.703,000 --> 0:04:23,000
OK, let's do an experimental thought here.

76
0:04:24.369,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I want you to think about your worst sexual experience

77
0:04:28.726,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and recall it in detail.

78
0:04:32.341,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now turn to the person to your right

79
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and describe that experience.

80
0:04:37.283,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:41.52,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I know it's difficult, eh?

82
0:04:43.284,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:45.215,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But, of course, I don't expect you to do that.

84
0:04:47.434,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You would all be uncomfortable and embarrassed.

85
0:04:50.587,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And so imagine an 11-year-old girl in the Middle East

86
0:04:54.423,000 --> 0:04:56,000
who was not educated about sexuality,

87
0:04:57.211,000 --> 0:04:59,000
who was taken from her comfort zone,

88
0:04:59.419,000 --> 0:05:,000
her family,

89
0:05:00.656,000 --> 0:05:04,000
who witnessed the execution of her father and brothers,

90
0:05:04.704,000 --> 0:05:05,000
having to describe in detail

91
0:05:06.573,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the rape that she faced in a culture where talking about sexuality is taboo.

92
0:05:12.884,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Her only way of recovering her honor is to hide the crime,

93
0:05:17.305,000 --> 0:05:19,000
believe she was married against her will,

94
0:05:19.826,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or deny the events out of shame and fear of being rejected.

95
0:05:24.004,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I interviewed a girl who I will call "Ayda."

96
0:05:26.487,000 --> 0:05:29,000
She was purchased by an ISIS leader, or emir,

97
0:05:29.677,000 --> 0:05:33,000
together with 13 other girls aged between 11 and 18 years old.

98
0:05:34.142,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Amongst the group were her three nieces and two cousins.

99
0:05:37.815,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The 14 girls were taken to a house full of ISIS fighters.

100
0:05:41.815,000 --> 0:05:45,000
An imam was present who made it clear that their religion was wrong,

101
0:05:45.974,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and the only good path was to accept Islam and marry a Muslim man.

102
0:05:51.126,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The emir wrote the names of the girls on 14 small pieces of paper.

103
0:05:56.03,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Two ISIS fighters would pick a piece of paper each.

104
0:06:00.29,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They would call out the name written on the paper,

105
0:06:03.368,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and those girls were forcibly taken into another room.

106
0:06:07.739,000 --> 0:06:1,000
While the emir and the imam heard the two girls screaming

107
0:06:10.91,000 --> 0:06:11,000
as they were being raped,

108
0:06:12.806,000 --> 0:06:13,000
they began laughing.

109
0:06:15.118,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Both were telling the other girls

110
0:06:16.771,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that the two girls should enjoy the experience instead of screaming.

111
0:06:20.996,000 --> 0:06:23,000
After a while, the girls were brought back into the room.

112
0:06:24.636,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They were in shock and were bleeding.

113
0:06:27.537,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They confirmed that they had been married and suffered a lot of pain.

114
0:06:31.96,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It is important to consider the fact that they had been raised

115
0:06:35.124,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to believe in sexual intercourse with one man in their lifetime:

116
0:06:38.986,000 --> 0:06:39,000
their husband.

117
0:06:40.554,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The only connection that they could make in their shocked state

118
0:06:44.271,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is to define their rape as marriage.

119
0:06:48.694,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Before the next two girls were taken to be raped,

120
0:06:51.536,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Ayda made a terrifying decision.

121
0:06:54.169,000 --> 0:06:56,000
As the oldest of the group, she convinced the emir

122
0:06:56.845,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to let them use the bathroom in order to wash themselves before marriage.

123
0:07:01.103,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Ayda had been told by one of the girls

124
0:07:03.505,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that she noticed rat poison in the bathroom.

125
0:07:06.596,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The 14 girls decided to end their suffering

126
0:07:09.861,000 --> 0:07:1,000
by drinking the poison.

127
0:07:12.293,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Before the poison took full effect,

128
0:07:14.583,000 --> 0:07:16,000
they were discovered by ISIS and taken to the hospital,

129
0:07:17.185,000 --> 0:07:18,000
where they survived.

130
0:07:19.038,000 --> 0:07:21,000
ISIS decided to separate the girls

131
0:07:21.781,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and sell them individually.

132
0:07:24.77,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Ayda was taken to another house and brutally raped

133
0:07:28.703,000 --> 0:07:31,000
after she attempted again to kill herself with her headscarf.

134
0:07:32.607,000 --> 0:07:34,000
She was beaten and raped every two days.

135
0:07:35.976,000 --> 0:07:37,000
After four months in captivity,

136
0:07:38.727,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Ayda found the courage to escape.

137
0:07:41.147,000 --> 0:07:43,000
She never saw the other 13 girls again.

138
0:07:44.881,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I interviewed Ayda multiple times.

139
0:07:47.447,000 --> 0:07:5,000
She was willing to speak to me because she had heard from other victims

140
0:07:50.864,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that there was a woman from the UN who understood her complicated culture.

141
0:07:55.457,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I looked into her eyes

142
0:07:56.91,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and listened deeply to the stories of her darkest hours.

143
0:08:00.735,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We established a personal connection that continues to this day.

144
0:08:04.97,000 --> 0:08:08,000
My upbringing made it easy for me to understand her extreme sense of shame

145
0:08:09.695,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and her fear of being rejected.

146
0:08:12.291,000 --> 0:08:16,000
These types of investigations are not only about gathering information and evidence,

147
0:08:16.49,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but they're also about victim support.

148
0:08:19.22,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The bonds I established with the victims

149
0:08:21.496,000 --> 0:08:24,000
strengthens their confidence and willingness to seek justice.

150
0:08:26.128,000 --> 0:08:27,000
As she considered her escape,

151
0:08:27.562,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Ayda, like all Yazidi survivors,

152
0:08:30.092,000 --> 0:08:31,000
faced a dilemma:

153
0:08:32.234,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Should she continue to suffer the abuse of her captors,

154
0:08:36.202,000 --> 0:08:38,000
or would it be better to return home,

155
0:08:39.018,000 --> 0:08:42,000
where she would face shame, rejection

156
0:08:42.331,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and possibly honor killing?

157
0:08:46.009,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I know all too well the pain of being rejected

158
0:08:48.548,000 --> 0:08:5,000
by my Moroccan community in Belgium,

159
0:08:50.588,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and I did not want this to happen to the Yazidi community.

160
0:08:54.072,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So a group of concerned entities,

161
0:08:55.867,000 --> 0:09:,000
including the UN, NGOs, politicians and members of the Yazidi community

162
0:09:01.368,000 --> 0:09:02,000
approached a religious leader,

163
0:09:03.208,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Baba Sheikh.

164
0:09:04.403,000 --> 0:09:05,000
After many meetings,

165
0:09:05.691,000 --> 0:09:08,000
he realized that these girls had not disrespected their religion

166
0:09:09.247,000 --> 0:09:11,000
by being forcibly converted to Islam

167
0:09:11.643,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and married to ISIS fighters.

168
0:09:13.632,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Instead, they have been abducted, raped and sexually enslaved.

169
0:09:19.279,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I am happy to report that, after our meetings,

170
0:09:21.776,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Baba Sheikh announced publicly

171
0:09:23.898,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that the survivors should be treated as victims

172
0:09:26.538,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and embraced by the community.

173
0:09:28.971,000 --> 0:09:3,000
This message was heard throughout the community

174
0:09:31.514,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and eventually reached the survivors being held captive by ISIS.

175
0:09:35.55,000 --> 0:09:36,000
After his declaration of support,

176
0:09:37.568,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the survivors were motivated to escape from ISIS

177
0:09:40.558,000 --> 0:09:41,000
as Ayda has done,

178
0:09:42.137,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and many young Yazidi women took the bold step

179
0:09:45.172,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and returned home to their communities.

180
0:09:47.979,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Baba Sheikh's public pronouncement

181
0:09:50.248,000 --> 0:09:52,000
saved the lives of many young Yazidi women,

182
0:09:52.868,000 --> 0:09:55,000
both in captivity and after their escape.

183
0:09:56.824,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Sadly, not all religious leaders agreed to talk with us.

184
0:10:00.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Some victims had far worse outcomes than the Yazidis.

185
0:10:04.224,000 --> 0:10:08,000
For example, only 43 of the 500-600 victims

186
0:10:08.704,000 --> 0:10:1,000
from the Shia Turkmen community

187
0:10:10.747,000 --> 0:10:13,000
were able to return home after escaping ISIS.

188
0:10:14.371,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Some of them were advised by their family

189
0:10:16.695,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to stay with ISIS

190
0:10:18.346,000 --> 0:10:22,000
or commit suicide in order to save the honor of the family.

191
0:10:22.716,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Germany established a project to support survivors of ISIS

192
0:10:26.197,000 --> 0:10:3,000
by providing psychosocial support and housing for 1,100 women and children,

193
0:10:31.083,000 --> 0:10:32,000
including Ayda.

194
0:10:32.339,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I visited Ayda several times during my work.

195
0:10:35.111,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I am so proud of her and the other victims.

196
0:10:38.388,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The progress they have made is remarkable.

197
0:10:41.586,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It is really moving to see how many of them,

198
0:10:44.183,000 --> 0:10:45,000
despite their struggles,

199
0:10:45.723,000 --> 0:10:47,000
have benefited from this program.

200
0:10:48.208,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The program includes individual and group counseling,

201
0:10:51.153,000 --> 0:10:53,000
art therapy, music therapy,

202
0:10:53.516,000 --> 0:10:54,000
sport activities,

203
0:10:54.817,000 --> 0:10:55,000
language courses,

204
0:10:56.062,000 --> 0:10:58,000
school and other integration efforts.

205
0:10:58.833,000 --> 0:11:,000
What I observed was that removing the victims

206
0:11:01.252,000 --> 0:11:03,000
from an area of conflict to a country at peace

207
0:11:04.167,000 --> 0:11:06,000
had a positive impact on all of them.

208
0:11:07.727,000 --> 0:11:09,000
This project caught the attention of other countries,

209
0:11:10.442,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and they were interested to help more Yazidis.

210
0:11:14.194,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The Yazidi women and girls still call and text me

211
0:11:17.018,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to tell me about their grades at school,

212
0:11:19.247,000 --> 0:11:2,000
fun trips they've taken,

213
0:11:20.995,000 --> 0:11:22,000
or to inform me about their future dreams,

214
0:11:23.867,000 --> 0:11:26,000
like writing a book about what they have faced with ISIS.

215
0:11:27.191,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Sometimes they are sad

216
0:11:28.49,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and feel the need to talk again about the events.

217
0:11:31.756,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I'm not a psychologist,

218
0:11:33.189,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and I have faced secondary PTSD from their horrific stories.

219
0:11:37.085,000 --> 0:11:39,000
But I keep encouraging them to talk,

220
0:11:39.286,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and I keep listening,

221
0:11:40.767,000 --> 0:11:43,000
because I do not want them to feel alone in their suffering.

222
0:11:44.46,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Through these anecdotes,

223
0:11:45.863,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I see a bigger picture emerging.

224
0:11:48.339,000 --> 0:11:5,000
These women and girls are healing.

225
0:11:50.686,000 --> 0:11:52,000
They are no longer afraid to seek justice.

226
0:11:54.124,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Without hope there can be no justice,

227
0:11:57.501,000 --> 0:12:,000
and without justice there can be no hope.

228
0:12:01.737,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Every 3rd and 15th of August, it's my remembrance day,

229
0:12:04.76,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and I reach out to the Yazidis to let them know that I'm thinking about them.

230
0:12:09.291,000 --> 0:12:1,000
They're always happy when I do that.

231
0:12:11.134,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's an emotional day for them.

232
0:12:13.383,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This past August, I spoke with Ayda.

233
0:12:16.307,000 --> 0:12:17,000
She was so happy to announce

234
0:12:18.257,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that one of her nieces who was abducted with her

235
0:12:21.476,000 --> 0:12:24,000
was finally released out of ISIS hands in Syria

236
0:12:24.5,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and returned to Iraq.

237
0:12:26.208,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Can you believe that?

238
0:12:27.645,000 --> 0:12:28,000
After four years?

239
0:12:29.782,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Today, her biggest wish is for her whole family,

240
0:12:32.867,000 --> 0:12:34,000
now located across three continents,

241
0:12:35.045,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to be reunited.

242
0:12:36.542,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I hope they will.

243
0:12:38.747,000 --> 0:12:4,000
When I think about the survivors I work with,

244
0:12:41.229,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I remember the words of an Egyptian doctor, writer

245
0:12:44.713,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and human rights activist,

246
0:12:46.423,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Nawal El Saadawi.

247
0:12:48.332,000 --> 0:12:5,000
In her book, "Woman at Point Zero,"

248
0:12:51.015,000 --> 0:12:53,000
she wrote, "Life is very hard,

249
0:12:53.953,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and the only people who really live

250
0:12:56.487,000 --> 0:12:58,000
are those who are harder than life itself."

251
0:12:59.82,000 --> 0:13:03,000
These victims have been through unimaginable pain.

252
0:13:04.312,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But with a little help,

253
0:13:05.653,000 --> 0:13:07,000
they show how resilient they are.

254
0:13:08.339,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Each has their own perspective on what kind of justice she seeks,

255
0:13:12.455,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and I believe deeply

256
0:13:13.904,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that a credible justice process is key

257
0:13:16.571,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to how she reclaims her dignity

258
0:13:18.501,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and finds closure with her trauma.

259
0:13:21.257,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Justice is not only about punishing the perpetrator.

260
0:13:24.762,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It's about victims feeling that crimes committed against them

261
0:13:28.277,000 --> 0:13:31,000
have been recorded and recognized by the rule of law.

262
0:13:32.142,000 --> 0:13:34,000
For me, it has been the experience of a lifetime

263
0:13:35.103,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to work with these survivors.

264
0:13:37.339,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Because I share their sorrow,

265
0:13:39.37,000 --> 0:13:41,000
their language and their culture,

266
0:13:41.839,000 --> 0:13:43,000
we connect on the deepest human level.

267
0:13:44.838,000 --> 0:13:47,000
This itself is an act of healing:

268
0:13:48.408,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to be heard, to be seen,

269
0:13:51.039,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to be given compassion instead of condemnation.

270
0:13:54.724,000 --> 0:13:56,000
When we get so close to people in pain,

271
0:13:57.658,000 --> 0:13:59,000
it creates pain for the investigators, too.

272
0:14:01.288,000 --> 0:14:05,000
My work is challenging, heartbreaking and trauma-inducing.

273
0:14:06.282,000 --> 0:14:07,000
But let me tell you why I do it.

274
0:14:08.709,000 --> 0:14:11,000
When I meet the survivors of these mass atrocities,

275
0:14:12.416,000 --> 0:14:15,000
when I hold their hands and look in their eyes,

276
0:14:16.218,000 --> 0:14:19,000
it does not erase my own pain,

277
0:14:19.25,000 --> 0:14:21,000
but it does make it almost worthwhile.

278
0:14:22.038,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And there's nothing I would rather be doing.

279
0:14:25.358,000 --> 0:14:27,000
When I see these brave survivors

280
0:14:27.893,000 --> 0:14:3,000
struggling to connect again to their own self-worth,

281
0:14:31.396,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to their families, to their place in a society that values them,

282
0:14:36.552,000 --> 0:14:38,000
it is an honor to bear witness;

283
0:14:39.357,000 --> 0:14:41,000
it is a privilege to seek justice.

284
0:14:42.704,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And that is healing, too --

285
0:14:45.389,000 --> 0:14:46,000
for all of us.

286
0:14:47.487,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Thank you.

287
0:14:48.662,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Applause)

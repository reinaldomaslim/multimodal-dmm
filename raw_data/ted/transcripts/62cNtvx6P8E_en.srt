1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Can geographic information

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
make you healthy?

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In 2001 I got hit by a train.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My train was a heart attack.

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I found myself in a hospital

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in an intensive-care ward,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
recuperating from emergency surgery.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I suddenly realized something:

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that I was completely in the dark.

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Why now?" "Why here?"

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
"Could my doctor have warned me?"

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Genetics, lifestyle and environment.

16
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's going to sort of contain our risks,

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and if we manage those risks

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.

20
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And you know why I understand that?

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Because my physicians constantly

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
ask me questions about this.

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Have you ever had to fill out those long,

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
legal-size forms in your doctor's office?

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
about your lifestyle and your family history,

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
your medication history, your surgical history,

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
your allergy history ... did I forget any history?

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But this part of the equation I didn't really get,

32
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I don't think my physicians

33
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
really get this part of the equation.

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What does that mean, my environment?

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Well, it can mean a lot of things.

36
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is my life. These are my life places.

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We all have these.

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
How many places have you lived?

40
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Just think about that, you know, wander through

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
your life thinking about this.

42
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.

44
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time

45
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
traveling some place.

46
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So, it's not really simple

47
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
when somebody asks you, "Where do you live, where do you work,

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and where do you spend all your time?

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And where do you expose yourselves to risks

50
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that maybe perhaps you don't even see?"

51
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Well, when I have done this on myself,

52
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I always come to the conclusion

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that I spend about 75 percent of my time

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
relatively in a small number of places.

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And I don't wander far from that place

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for a majority of my time,

57
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
even though I'm an extensive global trekker.

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

60
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,

61
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but this is where I spent my first 19 years

62
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
with my little young lungs.

63
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You know, breathing high concentrations here

64
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and methane gas,

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this.

67
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And if you've been in that part of the country,

68
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.

69
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So then I decided to leave that part of the world,

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and I was going to go to the mid-west.

71
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.

72
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.

73
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene

74
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and benzene.

75
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,

76
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
breathing various concentrations of that.

77
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.

78
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It was insidious and it was really happening.

79
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Then I decided I had to get really smart,

80
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I would take this job in the West Coast.

81
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And I moved to Redlands California.

82
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Very nice, and there

83
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,

84
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.

85
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation.

86
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Alright, this is what it looks like on a good day.

87
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.

88
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So, what's wrong with this picture?

89
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.

90
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:

91
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They never ask me about my place history.

92
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,

93
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"Where have you lived?"

94
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality

95
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of the drinking water that I put in my mouth

96
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
or the food that I ingest into my stomach.

97
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They really don't do that. It's missing.

98
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Look at the kind of data that's available.

99
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This data's from all over the world --

100
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.

101
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now, I've circled the places where I've been.

102
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack

103
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I'd been in the right places. Right?

104
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So, how many people are in the white?

105
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life

106
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in the white space?

107
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Anybody? Boy you're lucky.

108
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
How many have spent it in the red places?

109
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Oh, not so lucky.

110
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
There are thousands of these kinds of maps

111
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that are displayed in atlases

112
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
all over the world.

113
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
They give us some sense of what's going

114
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to be our train wreck.

115
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But none of that's in my medical record.

116
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And it's not in yours either.

117
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So, here's my friend Paul.

118
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked

119
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
every two hours, 24/7,

120
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
365 days out of the year

121
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
for the last two years, everywhere he went.

122
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.

123
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And this is where he has spent most of his time.

124
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
If you really studied that you might have some clues

125
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as to what Paul likes to do.

126
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right.

127
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We can zoom in here, and we suddenly see

128
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.

129
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And all of those black dots are all of the

130
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
toxic release inventories

131
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that are monitored by the EPA.

132
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Did you know that data existed?

133
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
For every community in the United States,

134
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you could have your own personalized map of that.

135
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So, our cell phones can now build a place history.

136
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.

137
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This might be what we end up with.

138
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This is what the physician would have

139
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in front of him and her when we enter that exam room

140
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?

141
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This could be my little assessment.

142
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And he looks at that and he says,

143
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
"Whoa Bill,

144
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
I suggest that maybe you not decide,

145
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
just because you're out here in beautiful California,

146
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and it's warm every day,

147
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that you get out and run at six o'clock at night.

148
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill,

149
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because of this report."

150
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.

151
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians

152
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
about the value of geographical information.

153
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now

154
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that are focused on this.

155
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And they're in the early stages of development.

156
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
These programs need to be supported,

157
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and we need to teach our future

158
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
doctors of the world

159
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the importance of some of the information

160
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I've shared here with you today.

161
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The second thing we need to do

162
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is while we're spending billions and billions

163
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
of dollars all over the world

164
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
building an electronic health record,

165
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we make sure we put a place history

166
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
inside that medical record.

167
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
It not only will be important for the physician;

168
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
it will be important for the researchers

169
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that now will have huge samples to draw upon.

170
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But it will also be useful for us.

171
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I could have made the decision, if I had this information,

172
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
not to move to the ozone capital

173
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.

174
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Or I could negotiate with my employer

175
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to make that decision

176
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in the best interest of myself and my company.

177
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said

178
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
this almost 10 years ago.

179
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Just look at that for a minute.

180
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
That was what the conclusion

181
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about,

182
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
was saying that we can explain the geographic variations

183
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness,

184
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and how our healthcare system actually operates.

185
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That was what he was talking about

186
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
on that quote.

187
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.

188
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So, I'd very much like to see us begin to

189
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.

190
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So with that, I'll leave you that

191
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
in my particular view of view of health:

192
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Geography always matters.

193
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And I believe that geographic information

194
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.

195
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Applause)

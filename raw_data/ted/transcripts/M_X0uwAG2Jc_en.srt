1
0:00:13.12,000 --> 0:00:15,000
As a lover of human anatomy,

2
0:00:15.56,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm so excited that we're finally putting our bodies at the center of focus.

3
0:00:19.6,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Through practices such as preventive medicine,

4
0:00:22.2,000 --> 0:00:23,000
patient empowerment

5
0:00:23.68,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and self-monitoring --

6
0:00:25.28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
down to now obsessing over every single step we take in a day.

7
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
All of this works to promote

8
0:00:31.48,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a healthy connection between ourselves and our bodies.

9
0:00:37.64,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Despite all this focus on the healthy self,

10
0:00:41.04,000 --> 0:00:44,000
general public knowledge of the anatomical self is lacking.

11
0:00:45.8,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Many people don't know the location of their vital organs,

12
0:00:48.539,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or even how they function.

13
0:00:50.32,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And that's because human anatomy

14
0:00:52.8,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is a difficult and time-intensive subject to learn.

15
0:00:56.72,000 --> 0:00:58,000
How many of you here made it through anatomy?

16
0:00:59.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
Wow, good --

17
0:01:01.12,000 --> 0:01:02,000
most of you are in medicine.

18
0:01:03.48,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I, like you, spent countless hours memorizing hundreds of structures.

19
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Something no student of anatomy could do without the help of visuals.

20
0:01:15.48,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Because at the end of the day,

21
0:01:16.959,000 --> 0:01:18,000
whether you remember every little structure or not,

22
0:01:19.64,000 --> 0:01:23,000
these medical illustrations are what makes studying anatomy so intriguing.

23
0:01:24.24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
In looking at them,

24
0:01:25.72,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we're actually viewing a manual of our very selves.

25
0:01:30.28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But what happens when we're done studying?

26
0:01:32.96,000 --> 0:01:35,000
These beautiful illustrations are then shut back

27
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
into the pages of a medical textbook,

28
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:39,000
or an app,

29
0:01:39.24,000 --> 0:01:4,000
referenced only when needed.

30
0:01:41.32,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And for the public,

31
0:01:42.68,000 --> 0:01:44,000
medical illustrations may only be encountered passively

32
0:01:45.56,000 --> 0:01:46,000
on the walls of a doctor's office.

33
0:01:48.28,000 --> 0:01:5,000
From the beginnings of modern medicine,

34
0:01:50.44,000 --> 0:01:51,000
medical illustration,

35
0:01:51.76,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and therefore anatomy,

36
0:01:53.36,000 --> 0:01:56,000
have existed primarily within the realm of medical education.

37
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Yet there's something fascinating happening right now.

38
0:02:01.52,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Artists are breaking anatomy out of the confines of the medical world

39
0:02:05.04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and are thrusting it into the public space.

40
0:02:07.92,000 --> 0:02:09,000
For the past nine years, I have been cataloguing and sharing

41
0:02:10.8,000 --> 0:02:12,000
this rise in anatomical art with the public --

42
0:02:13.32,000 --> 0:02:15,000
all from my perspective as a medical illustrator.

43
0:02:17.24,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But before I get into showing you how artists are reclaiming anatomy today,

44
0:02:21.84,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it's important to understand how art influenced anatomy in the past.

45
0:02:27.08,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, anatomy is by its very nature a visual science,

46
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and the first anatomists to understand this lived during the Renaissance.

47
0:02:34.36,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They relied on artists

48
0:02:36.36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to help advertise their discoveries to their peers in the public.

49
0:02:40.68,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And this drive to not only teach but also to entertain

50
0:02:45.96,000 --> 0:02:49,000
resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations.

51
0:02:51.96,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Anatomy was caught in a struggle between science, art and culture

52
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that lasted for over 500 years.

53
0:03:01.2,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Artists rendered dissected cadavers as alive,

54
0:03:06.88,000 --> 0:03:08,000
posed in these humorous anatomical stripteases.

55
0:03:10.32,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Imagine seeing that in your textbooks today.

56
0:03:14.08,000 --> 0:03:16,000
They also showed them as very much dead --

57
0:03:17.88,000 --> 0:03:18,000
unwillingly stripped of their skin.

58
0:03:21.8,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Disembodied limbs were often posed in literal still lives.

59
0:03:28.52,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And some illustrations even included pop culture references.

60
0:03:32.68,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is Clara,

61
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a famous rhinoceros that was traveling Europe in the mid-1700s,

62
0:03:37.36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
at a time when seeing a rhino was an exciting rarity.

63
0:03:40.4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Including her in this illustration was akin to celebrity sponsorship today.

64
0:03:46.72,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The introduction of color

65
0:03:49.08,000 --> 0:03:52,000
then brought a whole new depth and clarity to anatomy

66
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that made it stunning.

67
0:03:56.36,000 --> 0:03:57,000
By the early 20th century,

68
0:03:57.8,000 --> 0:04:,000
the perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck

69
0:04:01.28,000 --> 0:04:03,000
with the emergence of medical illustrators.

70
0:04:04.12,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They created a universal representation of anatomy --

71
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
something that was neither alive nor dead,

72
0:04:09.88,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that was free from those influences of artistic culture.

73
0:04:14.36,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And this focus on no-frills accuracy

74
0:04:16.92,000 --> 0:04:19,000
was precisely for the benefit of medical education.

75
0:04:20.56,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And this is what we get to study from today.

76
0:04:26.44,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But why is it that medical illustration --

77
0:04:28.92,000 --> 0:04:29,000
both past and present --

78
0:04:30.519,000 --> 0:04:31,000
captures our imaginations?

79
0:04:33.12,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, we are innately tuned into the beauty of the human body.

80
0:04:37.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And medical illustration is still art.

81
0:04:42.24,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Nothing can elicit an emotional response --

82
0:04:44.88,000 --> 0:04:46,000
from joy to complete disgust --

83
0:04:47.48,000 --> 0:04:48,000
more than the human body.

84
0:04:49.4,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And today,

85
0:04:50.64,000 --> 0:04:52,000
artists armed with that emotion,

86
0:04:53.04,000 --> 0:04:55,000
are grasping anatomy from the medical world,

87
0:04:55.76,000 --> 0:05:,000
and are reinvigorating it through art in the most imaginative ways.

88
0:05:01.72,000 --> 0:05:06,000
A perfect example of this is Spanish contemporary artist Fernando Vicente.

89
0:05:07.04,000 --> 0:05:12,000
He takes 19th century anatomical illustrations of the male body

90
0:05:13.08,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and envelops them in a female sensuality.

91
0:05:18.48,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The women in his paintings taunt us to view beyond their surface anatomy,

92
0:05:23.48,000 --> 0:05:25,000
thereby introducing a strong femininity

93
0:05:26.44,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that was previously lacking in the history of anatomical representation.

94
0:05:32.04,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Artistry can also be seen in the repair and recovery of the human body.

95
0:05:37.24,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is an X-ray of a woman who fractured and dislocated her ankle

96
0:05:40.4,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in a roller-skating accident.

97
0:05:42.48,000 --> 0:05:44,000
As a tribute to her trauma,

98
0:05:44.72,000 --> 0:05:47,000
she commissioned Montreal-based architect Federico Carbajal

99
0:05:48.44,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to construct a wire sculpture of her damaged lower leg.

100
0:05:53.36,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Now, notice those bright red screws magnified in the sculpture.

101
0:05:57.68,000 --> 0:06:01,000
These are the actual surgical screws used in reconstructing her ankle.

102
0:06:02.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's medical hardware that's been repurposed as art.

103
0:06:08.76,000 --> 0:06:11,000
People often ask me how I choose the art that I showcase online

104
0:06:12.48,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or feature in gallery shows.

105
0:06:14.44,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And for me it's a balance between the technique

106
0:06:17.12,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and a concept that pushes the boundaries of anatomy as a way to know thyself,

107
0:06:21.88,000 --> 0:06:23,000
which is why the work of Michael Reedy struck me.

108
0:06:25.48,000 --> 0:06:29,000
His serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor.

109
0:06:29.6,000 --> 0:06:32,000
For instance, take a look at her face.

110
0:06:33.84,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Notice those red marks.

111
0:06:36.2,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Michael manifests the consuming insecurity of a skin condition

112
0:06:40.52,000 --> 0:06:41,000
as these maniacal cartoon monsters

113
0:06:42.52,000 --> 0:06:44,000
annoying and out of control in the background.

114
0:06:45.52,000 --> 0:06:46,000
On the mirrored figure,

115
0:06:47.64,000 --> 0:06:49,000
he renders the full anatomy

116
0:06:49.8,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and covers it in glitter,

117
0:06:51.96,000 --> 0:06:52,000
making it look like candy.

118
0:06:54.64,000 --> 0:06:55,000
By doing this,

119
0:06:55.88,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Michael downplays the common perception of anatomy

120
0:06:58.28,000 --> 0:07:01,000
so closely tied to just disease and death.

121
0:07:03.68,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, this next concept might not make much sense,

122
0:07:06.64,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but human anatomy is no longer limited to humans.

123
0:07:10.4,000 --> 0:07:11,000
When you were a child,

124
0:07:11.68,000 --> 0:07:13,000
did you ever wish that your toys could come to life?

125
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Well, Jason Freeny makes those dreams come true

126
0:07:16.4,000 --> 0:07:17,000
with his magical toy dissections.

127
0:07:18.04,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:20.64,000 --> 0:07:22,000
One might think that this would bring a morbid edge

129
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to one's innocent childhood characters,

130
0:07:25.56,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but Jason says of his dissections,

131
0:07:28.08,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"One thing I've never seen in a child's reaction to my work is fear."

132
0:07:33.64,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's always wonder,

133
0:07:35.2,000 --> 0:07:36,000
amazement

134
0:07:36.6,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and wanting to explore.

135
0:07:38.68,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Fear of anatomy and guts is a learned reaction.

136
0:07:44.04,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This anatomization also extends to politically and socially charged objects.

137
0:07:51.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War,"

138
0:07:53.48,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we see a gun dissected to reveal human organs.

139
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But if you look closely,

140
0:07:59.92,000 --> 0:08:,000
you'll notice that it lacks a brain.

141
0:08:02.96,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And if you keep looking, you might also notice

142
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that Noah has so thoughtfully placed the rectum

143
0:08:08.28,000 --> 0:08:09,000
at the business end of that gun barrel.

144
0:08:13.64,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Now, this next artist I've been following for many years,

145
0:08:16.88,000 --> 0:08:18,000
watching him excite the public about anatomy.

146
0:08:21.08,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Danny Quirk is a young artist

147
0:08:23.24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
who paints his subjects in the process of self-dissection.

148
0:08:27.56,000 --> 0:08:29,000
He bends the rules of medical illustration

149
0:08:29.64,000 --> 0:08:31,000
by inserting a very dramatic light and shadow.

150
0:08:32.8,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And this creates a 3-D illusion

151
0:08:35.2,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that lends itself very well to painting directly on the human skin.

152
0:08:41.52,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Danny makes it look as if a person's skin has actually been removed.

153
0:08:46.08,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And this effect --

154
0:08:47.799,000 --> 0:08:49,000
also cool and tattoo-like --

155
0:08:50.96,000 --> 0:08:52,000
easily transitions into a medical illustration.

156
0:08:55.24,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Now Danny is currently traveling the world,

157
0:08:57.32,000 --> 0:09:,000
teaching anatomy to the public via his body paintings,

158
0:09:00.36,000 --> 0:09:02,000
which is why it was so shocking to find out

159
0:09:02.44,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that he was rejected from medical illustration programs.

160
0:09:05.88,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But he's doing just fine.

161
0:09:10.2,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Then there are artists

162
0:09:11.76,000 --> 0:09:14,000
who are extracting anatomy from both the medical world and the art world

163
0:09:15.56,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and are placing it directly on the streets.

164
0:09:18.4,000 --> 0:09:21,000
London-based SHOK-1 paints giant X-rays of pop culture icons.

165
0:09:23.2,000 --> 0:09:27,000
His X-rays show how culture can come to have an anatomy of its own,

166
0:09:27.48,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and conversely how culture can become part of the anatomy of a person.

167
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:33,000
You come to admire his work

168
0:09:33.36,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because reproducing X-rays by hand, let alone with spray paint,

169
0:09:36.44,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is extremely difficult.

170
0:09:38.52,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But then again this is a street artist,

171
0:09:40.44,000 --> 0:09:43,000
who also happens to hold a degree in applied chemistry.

172
0:09:45.12,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Nychos, an Austrian street artist,

173
0:09:47.64,000 --> 0:09:5,000
takes the term "exploded view" to a whole new level,

174
0:09:50.76,000 --> 0:09:53,000
splattering human and animal dissections on walls all over the world.

175
0:09:55.68,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Influenced by comics and heavy metal,

176
0:09:58.32,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Nychos inserts a very youthful and enticing energy into anatomy

177
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that I just love.

178
0:10:06.96,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Street artists believe that art belongs to the public.

179
0:10:10.8,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And this street anatomy is so captivating

180
0:10:13.68,000 --> 0:10:15,000
because it is the furthest removed from the medical world.

181
0:10:16.92,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It forces you to look at it,

182
0:10:18.56,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and confront your own perceptions about anatomy,

183
0:10:21.4,000 --> 0:10:23,000
whether you find it beautiful,

184
0:10:23.68,000 --> 0:10:24,000
gross,

185
0:10:24.92,000 --> 0:10:25,000
morbid

186
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or awe-inspiring, like I do.

187
0:10:28.92,000 --> 0:10:29,000
That it elicits these responses at all

188
0:10:30.88,000 --> 0:10:33,000
is due to our intimate and often changing relationship with it.

189
0:10:36.12,000 --> 0:10:38,000
All of the artists that I showed you here today

190
0:10:38.36,000 --> 0:10:4,000
referenced medical illustrations for their art.

191
0:10:41.04,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But for them,

192
0:10:42.28,000 --> 0:10:44,000
anatomy isn't just something to memorize,

193
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but a base from which to understand the human body on a meaningful level;

194
0:10:50.08,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to depict it in ways that we can relate,

195
0:10:52.48,000 --> 0:10:54,000
whether it be through cartoons,

196
0:10:54.84,000 --> 0:10:55,000
body painting

197
0:10:56.08,000 --> 0:10:57,000
or street art.

198
0:10:57.84,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Anatomical art has the power

199
0:11:00.08,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to reach far beyond the pages of a medical textbook,

200
0:11:03.12,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to ignite an excitement in the public,

201
0:11:05.32,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and reinvigorate an enthusiasm in the medical world,

202
0:11:08.76,000 --> 0:11:13,000
ultimately connecting our innermost selves with our bodies through art.

203
0:11:15.88,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Thank you.

204
0:11:17.12,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Applause)

(Music)

2
0:00:37.117,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Good afternoon.

3
0:00:39.412,000 --> 0:00:43,000
As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.

4
0:00:43.873,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I come to you with a modest proposal

5
0:00:46.325,000 --> 0:00:48,000
for easing the financial burden.

6
0:00:48.857,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This idea came to me while talking to

7
0:00:50.39,000 --> 0:00:52,000
a physicist friend of mine at MIT.

8
0:00:53.362,000 --> 0:00:55,000
He was struggling to explain something to me:

9
0:00:56.051,000 --> 0:01:,000
a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.

10
0:01:00.627,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now he confused me from the very start,

11
0:01:02.534,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because light doesn't cool things down.

12
0:01:04.888,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.

13
0:01:08.337,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The reason that you can see me standing here is because

14
0:01:10.88,000 --> 0:01:13,000
this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,

15
0:01:14.652,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.

16
0:01:18.187,000 --> 0:01:19,000
All of them are different colors,

17
0:01:19.703,000 --> 0:01:2,000
they're rippling with different frequencies,

18
0:01:21.643,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and they're bouncing off every surface, including me,

19
0:01:24.518,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and some of those are flying directly into your eyes,

20
0:01:26.928,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.

21
0:01:30.128,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now a laser is different.

22
0:01:31.783,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,

23
0:01:35.786,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and if you focus them into a beam,

24
0:01:38.493,000 --> 0:01:4,000
what you have is an incredibly useful tool.

25
0:01:40.888,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The control of a laser is so precise

26
0:01:43.024,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that you can perform surgery inside of an eye,

27
0:01:45.698,000 --> 0:01:47,000
you can use it to store massive amounts of data,

28
0:01:48.343,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and you can use it for this beautiful experiment

29
0:01:50.673,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that my friend was struggling to explain.

30
0:01:53.146,000 --> 0:01:56,000
First you trap atoms in a special bottle.

31
0:01:56.401,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms

32
0:01:59.361,000 --> 0:02:01,000
from the noise of the environment.

33
0:02:01.547,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And the atoms themselves are quite violent,

34
0:02:04.03,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,

35
0:02:08.074,000 --> 0:02:1,000
an atom will briefly absorb those photons

36
0:02:10.702,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and tend to slow down.

37
0:02:12.585,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Little by little it gets colder

38
0:02:15.897,000 --> 0:02:19,000
until eventually it approaches absolute zero.

39
0:02:20.41,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,

40
0:02:23.586,000 --> 0:02:26,000
something truly bizarre happens.

41
0:02:27.363,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.

42
0:02:30.185,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.

43
0:02:34.125,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The atoms lose their individual identity,

44
0:02:36.412,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and the rules from the quantum world take over,

45
0:02:39.239,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.

46
0:02:43.334,000 --> 0:02:46,000
For example, if you shine light through a superfluid,

47
0:02:46.786,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it is able to slow photons down

48
0:02:49.811,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to 60 kilometers per hour.

49
0:02:59.585,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Another spooky property is that it flows

50
0:03:02.638,000 --> 0:03:04,000
with absolutely no viscosity or friction,

51
0:03:05.274,000 --> 0:03:07,000
so if you were to take the lid off that bottle,

52
0:03:07.538,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it won't stay inside.

53
0:03:09.633,000 --> 0:03:11,000
A thin film will creep up the inside wall,

54
0:03:12.41,000 --> 0:03:16,000
flow over the top and right out the outside.

55
0:03:16.634,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,

56
0:03:19.591,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,

57
0:03:23.307,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it immediately turns back into normal matter.

58
0:03:25.43,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.

59
0:03:28.996,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And this is the great pleasure of science:

60
0:03:31.357,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.

61
0:03:35.572,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But the experiment is not the end of the story,

62
0:03:37.261,000 --> 0:03:4,000
because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.

63
0:03:40.787,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I have a Ph.D in molecular biology.

64
0:03:43.163,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.

65
0:03:46.696,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,

66
0:03:49.646,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it seemed like the more he said,

67
0:03:52.592,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the less I understood.

68
0:03:55.565,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture

69
0:03:57.936,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of a complex idea, to really capture its essence,

70
0:04:02.015,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the fewer words you use, the better.

71
0:04:05.598,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.

72
0:04:08.917,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I remember thinking, my friend could have explained

73
0:04:10.474,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that entire experiment with a dance.

74
0:04:13.606,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.

75
0:04:17.974,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.

76
0:04:19.863,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.

77
0:04:23.365,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Instead of explaining their research with words,

78
0:04:25.98,000 --> 0:04:27,000
scientists have to explain it with dance.

79
0:04:28.88,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now surprisingly, it seems to work.

80
0:04:31.249,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Dance really can make science easier to understand.

81
0:04:34.521,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But don't take my word for it.

82
0:04:36.317,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Go on the Internet and search for "Dance Your Ph.D."

83
0:04:39.204,000 --> 0:04:42,000
There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.

84
0:04:42.462,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest

85
0:04:44.545,000 --> 0:04:49,000
is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.

86
0:04:49.834,000 --> 0:04:5,000
For example, at the University of Minnesota,

87
0:04:51.714,000 --> 0:04:53,000
there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,

88
0:04:54.219,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and he works with dancers to study how cells move.

89
0:04:57.377,000 --> 0:04:59,000
They do it by changing their shape.

90
0:04:59.786,000 --> 0:05:01,000
When a chemical signal washes up on one side,

91
0:05:02.605,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,

92
0:05:05.73,000 --> 0:05:08,000
because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.

93
0:05:09.011,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.

94
0:05:12.982,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside

95
0:05:16.92,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is really more like chaos inside,

96
0:05:19.349,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,

97
0:05:23.752,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and those fibers are constantly falling apart.

98
0:05:26.597,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But just as quickly as they explode,

99
0:05:29.166,000 --> 0:05:31,000
more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,

100
0:05:31.583,000 --> 0:05:33,000
so it's constantly changing

101
0:05:33.766,000 --> 0:05:35,000
just to remain exactly the same.

102
0:05:36.764,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,

103
0:05:39.934,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but before he does that, he works with dancers

104
0:05:42.709,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.

105
0:05:46.41,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's basically efficient brainstorming,

106
0:05:49.503,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and when I visited David to learn about his research,

107
0:05:51.758,000 --> 0:05:54,000
he used dancers to explain it to me

108
0:05:55.102,000 --> 0:05:59,000
rather than the usual method: PowerPoint.

109
0:05:59.644,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And this brings me to my modest proposal.

110
0:06:01.997,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I think that bad PowerPoint presentations

111
0:06:04.866,000 --> 0:06:06,000
are a serious threat to the global economy.

112
0:06:07.538,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

113
0:06:15.467,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course,

114
0:06:20.346,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.

115
0:06:25.115,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now that assumes half-hour presentations

116
0:06:27.296,000 --> 0:06:29,000
for an average audience of four people

117
0:06:29.353,000 --> 0:06:31,000
with salaries of 35,000 dollars,

118
0:06:31.672,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and it conservatively assumes that

119
0:06:33.632,000 --> 0:06:36,000
about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,

120
0:06:37.564,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and given that there are some apparently

121
0:06:40.143,000 --> 0:06:43,000
30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,

122
0:06:43.415,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that would indeed add up to an annual waste

123
0:06:46.303,000 --> 0:06:49,000
of 100 billion dollars.

124
0:06:49.399,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Of course, that's just the time we're losing

125
0:06:51.767,000 --> 0:06:53,000
sitting through presentations.

126
0:06:53.99,000 --> 0:06:57,000
There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,

127
0:06:58.306,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and like any tool, it can and will be abused.

128
0:07:01.636,000 --> 0:07:03,000
To borrow a concept from my country's CIA,

129
0:07:04.126,000 --> 0:07:07,000
it helps you to soften up your audience.

130
0:07:07.241,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data.

131
0:07:11.489,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It allows you to create the illusion of competence,

132
0:07:15.229,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the illusion of simplicity,

133
0:07:17.989,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and most destructively, the illusion of understanding.

134
0:07:22.716,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt.

135
0:07:26.96,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.

136
0:07:31.945,000 --> 0:07:35,000
One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts.

137
0:07:36.414,000 --> 0:07:38,000
For example, our National Endowment for the Arts,

138
0:07:38.622,000 --> 0:07:4,000
with its $150 million budget,

139
0:07:41.199,000 --> 0:07:44,000
slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt

140
0:07:44.211,000 --> 0:07:47,000
by about one one-thousandth of a percent.

141
0:07:47.572,000 --> 0:07:48,000
One certainly can't argue with those numbers.

142
0:07:49.312,000 --> 0:07:54,000
However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,

143
0:07:54.594,000 --> 0:07:56,000
there will be some drawbacks.

144
0:07:57.266,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.

145
0:08:01.662,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,

146
0:08:04.069,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.

147
0:08:07.188,000 --> 0:08:11,000
All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.

148
0:08:12.095,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,

149
0:08:15.336,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.

150
0:08:19.118,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,

151
0:08:21.011,000 --> 0:08:22,000
let's put them back to work

152
0:08:22.598,000 --> 0:08:25,000
by using them instead of PowerPoint.

153
0:08:25.619,000 --> 0:08:28,000
As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.

154
0:08:29.102,000 --> 0:08:31,000
After all, they are the most perishable of their kind,

155
0:08:31.255,000 --> 0:08:33,000
prone to injury and very slow to heal

156
0:08:33.414,000 --> 0:08:35,000
due to our health care system.

157
0:08:36.231,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds,

158
0:08:39.374,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.

159
0:08:42.988,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Imagine our politicians using dance

160
0:08:45.848,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to explain why we must invade a foreign country

161
0:08:49.626,000 --> 0:08:51,000
or bail out an investment bank.

162
0:08:52.498,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's sure to help.

163
0:08:54.46,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Of course someday, in the deep future,

164
0:08:58.212,000 --> 0:09:,000
a technology of persuasion

165
0:09:00.593,000 --> 0:09:03,000
even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,

166
0:09:04.022,000 --> 0:09:07,000
rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.

167
0:09:07.566,000 --> 0:09:09,000
However, I trust that by that day,

168
0:09:10.142,000 --> 0:09:13,000
we shall have passed this present financial calamity.

169
0:09:13.457,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury

170
0:09:16.823,000 --> 0:09:19,000
of just sitting in an audience

171
0:09:19.943,000 --> 0:09:2,000
with no other purpose

172
0:09:21.783,000 --> 0:09:25,000
than to witness the human form in motion.

173
0:09:26.349,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Music)

174
0:10:37.189,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Applause)

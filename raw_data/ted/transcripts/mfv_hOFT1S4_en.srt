1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
very, very north end of it there,

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
where it's absolutely freezing cold.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I couldn't pick a career.

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
In Ireland the obvious choice is the military,

8
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but to be honest it actually kind of sucks.

9
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
My mother wanted me to be a dentist.

11
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.

12
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I actually went to school in Belfast,

13
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which was where all the action happened.

14
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And this was a pretty common sight.

15
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The school I went to was pretty boring.

16
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
They forced us to learn things like Latin.

17
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The school teachers weren't having much fun,

18
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the sports were very dirty or very painful.

19
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.

20
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And I was actually rowing for my school here

21
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
until this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front

22
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of the entire school.

23
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And that was the finishing post right there.

24
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So this was extremely embarrassing.

26
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But our school at that time got a grant from the government,

27
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ --

28
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and they left the programming manuals lying around.

29
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And so students like myself with nothing to do,

30
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
we would learn how to program it.

31
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Also around this time, at home,

32
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
this was the computer that people were buying.

33
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,

34
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.

35
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Actually I'm just going to pause for one second,

36
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED --

37
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.

38
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So I brought a picture with big hair.

39
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter).

40
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I just want to get that out of the way.

41
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named

42
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Sinclair ZX81.

43
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

44
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And -- you see the picture at the bottom?

45
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.

46
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That's what they thought they had built it for.

47
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The reality is we got the programming manual

48
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
and we started making games for it.

49
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We were programming in BASIC,

50
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which is a pretty awful language for games,

51
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
so we ended up learning Assembly language

52
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
so we could really take control of the hardware.

53
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,

54
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and he's showing his machine.

55
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
You had this same thing in America,

56
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
it was called the Timex Sinclair1000.

57
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination

58
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica."

59
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The graphics were just horrible.

60
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You had to have an even better imagination to play this game,

61
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"Death Rider."

62
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.

63
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They started making their own video games.

64
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,

65
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
so males choose the lucky rabbit.

66
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,

67
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which was quite the leap.

68
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And if you're wondering how much 16K is,

69
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
this eBay logo here is 16K.

70
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And in that amount of memory someone programmed

71
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
a full flight simulation program.

72
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And that's what it looked like.

73
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I spent ages flying this flight simulator,

74
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.

75
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.

76
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.

77
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's

78
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
smiling in this photograph.

79
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So I went on for the next 20 years or so

80
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
making a lot of different games.

81
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Some of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,"

82
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."

83
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Because I was from the United Kingdom,

84
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,

85
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
so they decided to call it hero instead.

86
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I personally preferred the Spanish version,

87
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which was "Tortugas Ninja."

88
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
That was much better.

89
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry

91
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and Hollywood to actually work together on something --

92
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
instead of licensing from each other, to actually work.

93
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,

94
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
so I've done that.

95
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.

96
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It grows every year.

97
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Last year was the biggest year.

98
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.

99
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.

100
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
43 percent of gamers are female.

101
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.

102
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The average age of gamers?

103
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Well, obviously it's for children, right?

104
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Well, no, actually it's 30 years old.

105
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.

106
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So 37 is our target audience.

107
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
All video games are violent.

108
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.

109
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,

110
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
so it's just not true.

111
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Online gaming statistics.

112
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.

113
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.

114
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,

115
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
making the publisher about another 275 million.

116
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The game costs about 80 million dollars to make,

117
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
so basically it pays for itself in about a month.

118
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
A player in a game called "Project Entropia"

119
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.

120
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You have to remember that this is not a real island.

121
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
He didn't actually buy anything, just some data.

122
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But he got great terms on it.

123
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This purchase included mining and hunting rights,

124
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
ownership of all land on the island, and a castle

125
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
with no furniture included.

126
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.

128
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created

129
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
by the gamers themselves.

130
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They found clever ways to trade items

131
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and to sell their accounts to each other

132
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
so that they could make money while they were playing their games.

133
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago

134
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.

135
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I liked this one the best:

136
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.

137
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.

138
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So as far as popularity of games,

139
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
what do you think these people are doing here?

140
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles

141
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.

142
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
That's what the show looks like.

143
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
You would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.

144
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.

145
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And the people that went there absolutely loved it.

146
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
What do you think these people are doing?

147
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games

148
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
against each other.

149
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And this is happening in every city around the world.

150
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is happening in your local cities too,

151
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
you're probably just not aware of it.

152
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago

153
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.

154
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.

155
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But what I want you to do is to try to understand it.

156
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We're on this curve, and the graphics are getting

157
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so ridiculously better.

158
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.

159
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But I want you to try and think about what games could look like

160
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
10 years from now.

161
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So we're going to start that video.

162
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Video: Throughout human history people have played games.

163
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
As man's intellect and technology have evolved

164
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so too have the games he plays.

165
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Music)

166
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Applause)

167
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
David Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,

168
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.

169
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Think about that's where we are right now,

170
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue

171
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to get better.

172
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw

173
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.

174
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
You need to be really an incredible artist.

175
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want

176
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
more fantasy artists that can create places

177
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we've never been to before, or characters that

178
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we've just never seen before.

179
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.

180
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But if you were to go to a game developers conference,

181
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,

182
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
meaning, understanding and feeling.

183
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?

184
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.

185
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I came across a student who's absolutely excellent

186
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
at expressing himself, and this student agreed

187
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that he would not show his video to anybody until

188
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
you here at TED had seen it.

189
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So I'd like to play this video.

190
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.

191
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Video: I, like many of you, live somewhere between

192
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
reality and video games.

193
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Some part of me -- a true living, breathing person --

194
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
has become programmed, electronic and virtual.

195
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy

196
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
has finally begun to crumble.

197
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I'm a video game addict and this is my story.

198
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Music)

199
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
In the year of my birth

200
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.

201
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I played in the backyard, learned to read,

202
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and even ate some of my vegetables.

203
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.

204
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But as was the case for most of my generation,

205
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I spent a lot of time in front of the TV.

206
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,

207
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly

208
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
left their mark on me.

209
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,

210
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive

211
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.

212
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
At some point something clicked.

213
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Music)

214
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
With the combination of simple, interactive stories

215
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo

216
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
became more than just an escape.

217
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.

218
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Music)

219
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I'm a video game addict, and it's not because of

220
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
a certain number of hours I have spent playing,

221
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.

222
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,

223
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and video games had begun to erode my own understanding

224
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
of what is real and what is not.

225
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,

226
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I still crave more.

227
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Music)

228
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally

229
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in what unfolded before me on screen.

230
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Today, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,

231
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.

232
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I am just one of a new generation that is growing up.

233
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
A generation who may experience much more meaning

234
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
through video games than they will through the real world.

235
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap,

236
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real

237
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
as the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.

238
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds

239
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.

240
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Play enough video games and eventually you will

241
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,

242
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.

243
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I know I can.

244
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,

245
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
video games actually allow us to become part of the machine.

246
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,

247
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
downloaded, streaming, HD reality.

248
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We are interacting with our entertainment.

249
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
I have come to expect this level of interaction.

250
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Without it, the problems faced in the real world --

251
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
poverty, war, disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should.

252
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama

253
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of prime time TV.

254
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,

255
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.

256
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.

257
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,

258
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel

259
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
more real than any textbook or any news story.

260
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The people who create these games are smart.

261
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.

262
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.

263
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
A well-designed video game will seamlessly

264
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.

265
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
As one becomes more experienced

266
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
the awareness of physical control melts away.

267
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I know what I want and I do it.

268
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.

269
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.

270
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I know violent video games make my mother worry.

271
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
What troubles me is not that video game violence

272
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
is becoming more and more like real life violence,

273
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
but that real life violence is starting to look more and more

274
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
like a video game.

275
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Music)

276
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
These are all troubles outside of myself.

277
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I, however, have a problem very close to home.

278
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Something has happened to my brain.

279
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Music)

280
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds

281
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
all of our gut instincts, the things we know to do

282
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
before we even think.

283
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,

284
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and all of them are hardwired into our brains.

285
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.

286
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Only in recent years has the technology behind video games

287
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
allowed for a true overlap in stimuli.

288
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics

289
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
in the same cities and doing many of the same things

290
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
we once did in real life, only virtually.

291
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Consider this --

292
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.

293
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
In all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.

294
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.

295
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
The sensory cues are very similar.

296
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time

297
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
doing something on the TV than you have in real life.

298
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,

299
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
this is almost as beautiful as my games are.

300
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
For my virtual worlds are perfect.

301
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.

302
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,

303
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:06,000
but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition

304
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.

305
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success

306
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
brainwashing the masses with video games

307
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
rather than just simply TVs.

308
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain

309
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
completely vulnerable to re-programming.

310
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.

311
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,

312
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing

313
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
in the real world.

314
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
There is a potential to do good as well.

315
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror

316
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
the real world we live in, that game developers realize

317
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
that they have tremendous responsibilities before them.

318
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I'm not sure what the future of video games holds

319
0:17:49.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
for our civilization.

320
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap

321
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
there is a greater and greater potential for other people

322
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
to feel the same way I do.

323
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
What I have only recently come to realize

324
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
is that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion

325
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating

326
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and addictive to me.

327
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
I know that I am losing my grip.

328
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Part of me is just waiting to let go.

329
0:18:20.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,

330
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
or how flat the real world may seem to us,

331
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:29,000
that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us

332
0:18:29.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.

333
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
(Applause)

334
0:18:38.33,000 --> 0:18:39,000
DP: Wow.

335
0:18:39.33,000 --> 0:18:46,000
(Applause)

336
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
I found that video very, very thought provoking,

337
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.

338
0:18:51.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice

339
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:56,000
for me to talk about was graphics and audio.

340
0:18:56.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.

341
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Video games give an awful lot of other things too,

342
0:19:02.33,000 --> 0:19:03,000
and that's why people get so addicted.

343
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
The most important one being fun.

344
0:19:05.33,000 --> 0:19:07,000
The name of this track is "The Magic To Come."

345
0:19:07.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Who is that going to come from?

346
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Is it going to come from the best directors in the world

347
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:11,000
as we thought it probably would?

348
0:19:11.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
I don't think so.

349
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:15,000
I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now

350
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:2,000
that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.

351
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.

352
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
The same with students or highly creative people,

353
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:27,000
writers and people like that.

354
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:3,000
As far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world

355
0:19:30.33,000 --> 0:19:33,000
teaching video game courses.

356
0:19:33.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
That means there's literally thousands of new ideas.

357
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:39,000
Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.

358
0:19:39.33,000 --> 0:19:41,000
There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone

359
0:19:41.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
try and pitch you a really bad video game idea.

360
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:49,000
(Laughter)

361
0:19:49.33,000 --> 0:19:51,000
Chris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.

362
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:54,000
He's out of time.

363
0:19:54.33,000 --> 0:19:56,000
DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.

364
0:19:56.33,000 --> 0:19:58,000
CA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.

365
0:19:58.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
(Laughter)

366
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.

367
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:05,000
The school is closed; they're coming back at midnight

368
0:20:05.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
because they want to pitch their video game ideas.

369
0:20:07.33,000 --> 0:20:08,000
I'm sitting at the front of the class,

370
0:20:08.33,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and they're actually pitching their ideas.

371
0:20:10.33,000 --> 0:20:12,000
So it's hard to get students to come back to class,

372
0:20:12.33,000 --> 0:20:13,000
but it is possible.

373
0:20:13.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.

374
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:19,000
And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience

375
0:20:19.33,000 --> 0:20:21,000
in the video game world?

376
0:20:21.33,000 --> 0:20:24,000
And as I've shown here, we have the audience.

377
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:27,000
She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button

378
0:20:27.33,000 --> 0:20:29,000
and have millions of people ready to play.

379
0:20:29.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
You know, we have the technology.

380
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:33,000
She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't

381
0:20:33.33,000 --> 0:20:35,000
stunning and really immersive.

382
0:20:35.33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.

383
0:20:38.33,000 --> 0:20:4,000
She's never going to know a world where video games

384
0:20:40.33,000 --> 0:20:43,000
aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.

385
0:20:43.33,000 --> 0:20:45,000
I just hope she likes video games.

386
0:20:45.33,000 --> 0:20:46,000
(Laughter)

387
0:20:46.33,000 --> 0:20:47,000
So, my closing thought.

388
0:20:47.33,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Games on the surface seem simple entertainment,

389
0:20:49.33,000 --> 0:20:51,000
but for those that like to look a little deeper,

390
0:20:51.33,000 --> 0:20:54,000
the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers

391
0:20:54.33,000 --> 0:20:56,000
to creative minds that like to think big.

392
0:20:57.33,000 --> 0:20:59,000
Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED?

393
0:20:59.33,000 --> 0:21:,000
Thank you.

394
0:21:00.33,000 --> 0:21:02,000
Chris Anderson: David Perry. That was awesome.

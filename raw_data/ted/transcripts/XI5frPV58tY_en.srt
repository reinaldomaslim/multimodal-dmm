1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We all know the Earth is in trouble.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We have now entered in the 6X,

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the sixth major extinction on this planet.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms --

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" --

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote,

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I think that vote is occurring right now.

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.

12
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The mycelium infuses all landscapes,

13
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.

14
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass.

15
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians.

16
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.

17
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer

18
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium --

19
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
so the mycelium is the mother

20
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees

21
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.

22
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Dusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.

23
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I'm in love with the old-growth forest,

24
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I'm a patriotic American because we have those.

25
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.

26
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And frankly, I face a big obstacle.

27
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
When I mention mushrooms to somebody,

28
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,

29
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
their eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.

30
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.

31
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We call it mycophobia,

32
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.

33
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth.

34
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Day 21, day 23, day 25.

35
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics.

36
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.

37
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists

38
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta --

39
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.

40
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We share in common the same pathogens.

41
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria,

42
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and so our best antibiotics come from fungi.

43
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But here is a mushroom that's past its prime.

44
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
After they sporulate, they do rot.

45
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes

46
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that occur on rotting mushrooms

47
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
are essential for the health of the forest.

48
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They give rise to the trees,

49
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.

50
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And so we see a mushroom here sporulating.

51
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And the spores are germinating,

52
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and the mycelium forms and goes underground.

53
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.

54
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.

55
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.

56
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And notice that as the mycelium grows,

57
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it conquers territory and then it begins the net.

58
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,

59
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I have thousands of electron micrographs,

60
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and when I'm staring at the mycelium,

61
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I realize that they are microfiltration membranes.

62
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.

63
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It inhales oxygen, just like we do.

64
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.

65
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.

66
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,

67
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and as they fuse soils, they absorb water.

68
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
These are little wells.

69
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.

70
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,

71
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but sets up a microbial universe

72
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.

73
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I first proposed, in the early 1990s,

74
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.

75
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.

76
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,

77
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
because of the nodes of crossing --

78
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Internet engineers maybe call them hot points --

79
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.

80
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The mycelium is sentient.

81
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It knows that you are there.

82
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
When you walk across landscapes,

83
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.

84
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet

85
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is an inevitable consequence

86
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of a previously proven, biologically successful model.

87
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,

88
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and we now, being the top organism on this planet,

89
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.

90
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Going way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.

91
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I believe matter begets life;

92
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
life becomes single cells; single cells become strings;

93
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
strings become chains; chains network.

94
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.

95
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.

96
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago,

97
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and plants followed several hundred million years later.

98
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
How is that possible?

99
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,

100
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and many other acids and enzymes,

101
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals

102
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and forming calcium oxalates.

103
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Makes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.

104
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.

105
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So, fungi and mycelium

106
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.

107
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And all sorts of other oxalates

108
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals

109
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.

110
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This was first discovered in 1859.

111
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber.

112
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.

113
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
420 million years ago, this organism existed.

114
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It was called Prototaxites.

115
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Prototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.

116
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.

117
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,

118
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
published an article in the Journal of Geology

119
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,

120
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
a giant mushroom.

121
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.

122
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
All across most land masses.

123
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And these existed for tens of millions of years.

124
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward --

125
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
65 million years ago -- most of you know about it --

126
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we had an asteroid impact.

127
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
The Earth was struck by an asteroid,

128
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.

129
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.

130
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,

131
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because fungi do not need light.

132
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
More recently, at Einstein University,

133
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,

134
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
much like plants use light.

135
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,

136
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I think, is a forgone conclusion,

137
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
at least in my own mind.

138
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.

139
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:

140
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.

141
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.

142
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
How is it that this organism can be so large,

143
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and yet be one cell wall thick,

144
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?

145
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom --

146
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.

147
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We were involved with several experiments.

148
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I'm going to show you six, if I can,

149
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
solutions for helping to save the world.

150
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.

151
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:

152
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;

153
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
one pile was treated with bacteria;

154
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.

155
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The mycelium absorbs the oil.

156
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The mycelium is producing enzymes --

157
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.

158
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.

159
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,

160
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and then, when we returned six weeks later,

161
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
all the tarps were removed,

162
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.

163
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We came back to our pile, it was covered

164
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,

165
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and the color changed to a light form.

166
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons

167
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars.

168
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.

169
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They're very large.

170
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.

171
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.

172
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
They sporulated, the spores attract insects,

173
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.

174
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Birds then came, bringing in seeds,

175
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and our pile became an oasis of life.

176
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,

177
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons --

178
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.

179
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The last image we don't have.

180
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The entire pile was a green berm of life.

181
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
These are gateway species,

182
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.

183
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn --

184
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris,

185
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream

186
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
from a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,

187
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or a factory with chemical toxins,

188
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and it leads to habitat restoration.

189
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,

190
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.

191
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And I'll show you a graph here.

192
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.

193
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,

194
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and 10 to the third power is around 1,000.

195
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species

196
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.

197
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Think of the implications.

198
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris --

199
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.

200
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.

201
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
This is my wife Dusty,

202
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon.

203
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest

204
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.

205
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
as a treatment against consumption.

206
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,

207
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.

208
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
May not seem that large --

209
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
let's get closer.

210
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
This is extremely rare fungus.

211
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out --

212
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.

213
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We found one sample to be able to get into culture.

214
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest

215
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I think is absolutely critical for human health.

216
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.

217
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,

218
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.

219
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And a few years ago,

220
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we received these results.

221
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms

222
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that were highly active against poxviruses.

223
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert

224
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds

225
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.

226
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
10 or greater are considered to be very active.

227
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range.

228
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
There's a vetted press release that you can read --

229
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
it's vetted by DOD --

230
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
if you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox."

231
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.

232
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.

233
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And so, for the first time, I am showing this.

234
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms

235
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
highly active against flu viruses.

236
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Here's the selectivity index numbers --

237
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
against pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses,

238
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
compared to the ribavirin controls,

239
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
we have an extraordinarily high activity.

240
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And we're using a natural extract

241
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.

242
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 --

243
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
as well as flu B viruses.

244
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So then we tried a blend,

245
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,

246
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.

247
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Applause)

248
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I then think that we can make the argument

249
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that we should save the old-growth forest

250
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
as a matter of national defense.

251
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Applause)

252
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi --

253
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
fungi that kill insects.

254
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.

255
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies

256
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
with metarhizium species of a group of fungi

257
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.

258
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I did something that nobody else had done.

259
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.

260
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
These are spores -- this is in their spores.

261
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I was able to morph the culture

262
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
into a non-sporulating form.

263
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars

264
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.

265
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But the insects aren't stupid,

266
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and they would avoid the spores when they came close,

267
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.

268
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,

269
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants

270
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
were making debris fields, every day,

271
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,

272
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
because there's no spores.

273
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
They gave it to the queen.

274
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.

275
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death --

276
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the mycelium is consumed by the ants,

277
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
they become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.

278
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Laughter)

279
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Now after sporulation, the spores repel.

280
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.

281
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.

282
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And so my house came down, I received my first patent

283
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.

284
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold,

285
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we can steer insects to different directions.

286
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
This has huge implications.

287
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.

288
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.

289
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
It covers over 200,000 species.

290
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
This is the most disruptive technology --

291
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry --

292
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that they have ever witnessed.

293
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.

294
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,

295
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,

296
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
prior to sporulation, attract the very insects

297
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that are otherwise repelled by those spores.

298
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.

299
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference --

300
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
you add soil, you add water,

301
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,

302
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
like of the Agarikon mushroom.

303
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.

304
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And then you put tree seeds in here,

305
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and then you end up growing -- potentially --

306
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
an old-growth forest from a cardboard box.

307
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I want to reinvent the delivery system,

308
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and the use of cardboard around the world,

309
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
so they become ecological footprints.

310
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,

311
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
you could make it interactive, zip code specific --

312
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
where people could join together,

313
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and through satellite imaging systems,

314
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
through Virtual Earth or Google Earth,

315
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered

316
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.

317
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes,

318
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community --

319
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
corns, beans and squash and onions.

320
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I took several containers -- my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could --

321
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and I ended up growing a seed garden.

322
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Then you harvest the seeds --

323
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this --

324
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and then you're harvesting the seed garden.

325
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.

326
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
I add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.

327
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Now, three corncobs, no other grain --

328
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
lots of mushrooms begin to form.

329
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank,

330
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and so this population will be shut down.

331
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
But watch what happens here.

332
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
The mushrooms then are harvested,

333
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
but very importantly,

334
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.

335
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?

336
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And we came up with Econol.

337
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary --

338
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.

339
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,

340
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent

341
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
about the generation of fuels.

342
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.

343
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
These are a species that we need to join with.

344
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I think engaging mycelium can help save the world.

345
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Thank you very much.

346
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000

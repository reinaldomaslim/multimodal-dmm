1
0:00:12.52,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It was the spring of 1988

2
0:00:16.6,000 --> 0:00:19,000
when I had the aha moment.

3
0:00:19.8,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was at my first roundtable,

4
0:00:22.36,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and for those of you who don't know,

5
0:00:24.24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the roundtable was a very commonly used phrase on Wall Street

6
0:00:28.2,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to describe the year-end evaluative process

7
0:00:31.44,000 --> 0:00:35,000
for analysts, associates, vice presidents, all the way up to managing directors.

8
0:00:35.92,000 --> 0:00:39,000
That was the process where they were discussed behind closed doors

9
0:00:40.2,000 --> 0:00:42,000
around a table, i.e. the round table,

10
0:00:43.2,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and everyone was put into a category --

11
0:00:45.72,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the top bucket, the middle bucket, the lower bucket --

12
0:00:49.4,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and then that was translated into a bonus range

13
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that would be assigned to each professional.

14
0:00:55.28,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This was my first time there, and as I observed,

15
0:00:58.72,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I saw that there was one person that was responsible

16
0:01:02.04,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for recording the outcome of a conversation.

17
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
There were other people in the room that had the responsibility

18
0:01:08.32,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of presenting the cases of all the candidates.

19
0:01:10.56,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And there were other invited guests who were supposed to comment

20
0:01:14.72,000 --> 0:01:17,000
as a candidate's position was presented.

21
0:01:18.44,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It was interesting to me that those other people

22
0:01:22.12,000 --> 0:01:25,000
were folks who were more senior than the folks that were being discussed

23
0:01:25.88,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and they theoretically had had some interaction with those candidates.

24
0:01:30.24,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, I was really excited to be at this roundtable for the first time,

25
0:01:34.08,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because I knew that my own process would go through this same way,

26
0:01:37.68,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and that my bonus would be decided in the same way,

27
0:01:40.76,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so I wanted to know how it worked,

28
0:01:42.6,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but more importantly,

29
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I wanted to understand how this concept of a meritocracy

30
0:01:47.8,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that every company that I talked to walking out of business school

31
0:01:51.24,000 --> 0:01:52,000
was selling.

32
0:01:52.48,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Every time I talked to a company,

33
0:01:54.12,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they would say, "Our culture, our process, is a meritocracy.

34
0:01:58.32,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The way you get ahead in this organization is that you're smart,

35
0:02:01.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
you put your head down and you work really hard,

36
0:02:03.64,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and you'll go right to the top.

37
0:02:05.28,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So here was my opportunity to see exactly how that worked.

38
0:02:08.64,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So as the process began,

39
0:02:10.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I heard the recorder call the first person's name.

40
0:02:14.12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
"Joe Smith."

41
0:02:15.84,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The person responsible for presenting Joe's case did just that.

42
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Three quarters of the way through, someone interrupted and said,

43
0:02:23.2,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"This is a great candidate, outstanding,

44
0:02:25.48,000 --> 0:02:27,000
has great analytical and quantitative skills.

45
0:02:28.32,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is a superstar."

46
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The recorder then said,

47
0:02:31.68,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"Sounds like Joe should go in the top bucket."

48
0:02:35.44,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Second person, Mary Smith.

49
0:02:37.56,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Halfway through that presentation, someone said, "Solid candidate.

50
0:02:41.4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Nothing really special, but a good pair of hands."

51
0:02:44.44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The recorder said,

52
0:02:45.8,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"Sounds like Mary should go in the middle bucket."

53
0:02:48.44,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And then someone said, "Arnold Smith."

54
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Before the person could present Arnold's case,

55
0:02:54.48,000 --> 0:02:57,000
somebody said, "Disaster. Disaster. This kid doesn't have a clue.

56
0:02:58.32,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Can't do a model."

57
0:02:59.68,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And before the case was presented,

58
0:03:02.2,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the recorder said,

59
0:03:03.52,000 --> 0:03:06,000
"Sounds like Arnold should go in the bottom bucket."

60
0:03:06.76,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It was at that moment that I clutched my pearls --

61
0:03:10.2,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:13.52,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and said, "Who is going to speak for me?"

63
0:03:18.32,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Who is going to speak for me?

64
0:03:20.52,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It was that moment that I realized that this idea of a meritocracy

65
0:03:24.92,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that every organizations sells is really just a myth.

66
0:03:29.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You cannot have a 100 percent meritocratic environment

67
0:03:34.56,000 --> 0:03:38,000
when there is a human element involved in the evaluative equation,

68
0:03:38.96,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because by definition,

69
0:03:40.84,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that makes it subjective.

70
0:03:43.36,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I knew at that moment that somebody would have to be behind closed doors

71
0:03:48.84,000 --> 0:03:5,000
arguing on my behalf,

72
0:03:51.56,000 --> 0:03:53,000
presenting content in such a way

73
0:03:54.56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that other decision makers around that table

74
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:03:59,000
would answer in my best favor.

75
0:04:01.04,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That was a really interesting lesson,

76
0:04:03.96,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and then I said to myself, "Well, who is that person?

77
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
What do you call this person?"

78
0:04:09.04,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And as I thought about the popular business terms at the time,

79
0:04:12.8,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I said, wow, this person can't be a mentor,

80
0:04:16.28,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because a mentor's job is to give you tailored advice,

81
0:04:20.92,000 --> 0:04:23,000
tailored specifically to you and to your career aspirations.

82
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They're the ones who give you the good, the bad and the ugly

83
0:04:28.079,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in a no-holds-barred way.

84
0:04:30.839,000 --> 0:04:34,000
OK. Person can't be a champion or an advocate,

85
0:04:35.04,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because you don't necessarily have to spend any currency

86
0:04:38.64,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to be someone's champion.

87
0:04:40.32,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You don't necessarily get invited to the room

88
0:04:42.92,000 --> 0:04:45,000
behind closed doors if you're an advocate.

89
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It was almost two years later

90
0:04:48.12,000 --> 0:04:51,000
when I realized what this person should be called.

91
0:04:51.84,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I was speaking at the University of Michigan

92
0:04:54.36,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to the MBA candidates,

93
0:04:56.28,000 --> 0:04:58,000
talking about the lessons that I had learned

94
0:04:58.4,000 --> 0:05:,000
after my three short years on Wall Street,

95
0:05:00.48,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and then it came to me.

96
0:05:02.08,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I said, "Oh, this person that is carrying your interest,

97
0:05:05.84,000 --> 0:05:08,000
or as I like to say, carrying your paper into the room,

98
0:05:09.04,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this person who is spending

99
0:05:10.6,000 --> 0:05:13,000
their valuable political and social capital on you,

100
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
this person who is going to pound the table on your behalf,

101
0:05:18.08,000 --> 0:05:2,000
this is a sponsor.

102
0:05:21.6,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This is a sponsor."

103
0:05:24.8,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And then I said to myself,

104
0:05:26.96,000 --> 0:05:28,000
"Well, how do you get a sponsor?

105
0:05:29.52,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And frankly, why do you need one?"

106
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Well, you need a sponsor, frankly,

107
0:05:33.96,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because as you can see,

108
0:05:35.36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there's not one evaluative process that I can think of,

109
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
whether it's in academia, health care, financial services,

110
0:05:42.32,000 --> 0:05:45,000
not one that does not have a human element.

111
0:05:46.12,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So that means it has that measure of subjectivity.

112
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:54,000
There is a measure of subjectivity in who is presenting your case.

113
0:05:54.72,000 --> 0:05:56,000
There is a measure of subjectivity

114
0:05:56.8,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in what they say

115
0:05:58.88,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and how they interpret any objective data that you might have.

116
0:06:02.68,000 --> 0:06:07,000
There is a measure of subjectivity in how they say what they're going to say

117
0:06:08.4,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to influence the outcome.

118
0:06:10.68,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So therefore, you need to make sure that that person who is speaking,

119
0:06:14.96,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that sponsor,

120
0:06:16.44,000 --> 0:06:18,000
has your best interests at heart

121
0:06:18.72,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and has the power to get it, whatever it is for you,

122
0:06:22.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to get it done behind closed doors.

123
0:06:25.24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, I'm asked all the time,

124
0:06:27.92,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"How do you get one?"

125
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Well, frankly, nirvana is when someone sees you in an environment

126
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and decides, "I'm going to make it happen for you.

127
0:06:39.24,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I'm going to make sure that you are successful."

128
0:06:42.04,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But for many of us in this room, we know it doesn't really happen that way.

129
0:06:45.88,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So let me introduce this concept of currency

130
0:06:49.28,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and talk to you about how it impacts your ability to get a sponsor.

131
0:06:54.28,000 --> 0:06:58,000
There are two types of currency in any environment:

132
0:06:58.76,000 --> 0:07:01,000
performance currency and relationship currency.

133
0:07:02.44,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And performance currency is the currency that is generated

134
0:07:06.08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
by your delivering that which was asked of you

135
0:07:09.76,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and a little bit extra.

136
0:07:11.72,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Every time you deliver upon an assignment above people's expectations,

137
0:07:16.4,000 --> 0:07:18,000
you generate performance currency.

138
0:07:18.52,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It works exactly like the stock market.

139
0:07:21.4,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Any time a company says to the street

140
0:07:23.6,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that they will deliver 25 cents a share

141
0:07:25.8,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and that company delivers 40 cents a share,

142
0:07:28.08,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that stock goes up, and so will yours.

143
0:07:31.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Performance currency is valuable for three reasons.

144
0:07:34.08,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Number one, it will get you noticed.

145
0:07:37.48,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It will create a reputation for you.

146
0:07:39.96,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Number two, it will also get you paid and promoted

147
0:07:44.12,000 --> 0:07:46,000
very early on in your career

148
0:07:46.56,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and very early on in any environment.

149
0:07:49.6,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And number three, it may attract a sponsor.

150
0:07:52.6,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Why? Because strong performance currency

151
0:07:55.6,000 --> 0:07:59,000
raises your level of visibility in the environment, as I said earlier,

152
0:07:59.72,000 --> 0:08:02,000
such that a sponsor may be attracted to you.

153
0:08:03.24,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Why? Because everybody loves a star.

154
0:08:07.36,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But if you find yourself in a situation

155
0:08:11.48,000 --> 0:08:13,000
where you don't have a sponsor,

156
0:08:13.72,000 --> 0:08:14,000
here's the good news.

157
0:08:15.24,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Remember that you can exercise your power and ask for one.

158
0:08:20.28,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But here's where the other currency is now most important.

159
0:08:25.32,000 --> 0:08:27,000
That is the relationship currency,

160
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and relationship currency is the currency that is generated

161
0:08:31.76,000 --> 0:08:36,000
by the investments that you make in the people in your environment,

162
0:08:36.96,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the investments that you make in the people in your environment.

163
0:08:41.48,000 --> 0:08:44,000
You cannot ask someone to use their hard-earned

164
0:08:45.44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
personal influential currency on your behalf

165
0:08:48.52,000 --> 0:08:5,000
if you've never had any interaction with them.

166
0:08:51.24,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It is not going to happen.

167
0:08:53.559,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So it is important that you invest the time to connect, to engage

168
0:08:59.04,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and to get to know the people that are in your environment,

169
0:09:02.12,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and more importantly to give them the opportunity to know you.

170
0:09:06.8,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Because once they know you,

171
0:09:08.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
there's a higher probability that when you approach them

172
0:09:12.28,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to ask them to be your sponsor,

173
0:09:14.64,000 --> 0:09:17,000
they will in fact answer in the affirmative.

174
0:09:18.4,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Now, if you're with me and you agree that you have to have a sponsor,

175
0:09:22.28,000 --> 0:09:25,000
let's talk about how you identify a sponsor.

176
0:09:27.04,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Well, if you're looking for a sponsor,

177
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they need to have three primary characteristics.

178
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Number one, they need to have a seat at the decision-making table,

179
0:09:37.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
they need to have exposure to your work

180
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in order to have credibility behind closed doors,

181
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and they need to have some juice,

182
0:09:45.88,000 --> 0:09:47,000
or let me say it differently, they'd better have some power.

183
0:09:48.76,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's really important that they have those three things.

184
0:09:52.24,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And then once you have identified the person,

185
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
how do you ask for one?

186
0:09:57.08,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The script goes like this.

187
0:09:58.76,000 --> 0:10:02,000
"Jim, I'm really interested in getting promoted this year.

188
0:10:03.64,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I've had an amazing year

189
0:10:06.2,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and I cannot show this organization anything else to prove my worthiness

190
0:10:11.76,000 --> 0:10:13,000
or my readiness for this promotion,

191
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but I am aware that somebody has to be behind closed doors

192
0:10:18.24,000 --> 0:10:21,000
arguing on my behalf and pounding the table.

193
0:10:21.28,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You know me, you know my work and you are aware of the client feedback,

194
0:10:25.24,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and I hope that you will feel comfortable arguing on my behalf."

195
0:10:29.36,000 --> 0:10:3,000
If Jim knows you

196
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and you have any kind of a relationship,

197
0:10:33.52,000 --> 0:10:36,000
there's a very high probability that he will answer yes,

198
0:10:36.96,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and if he says yes,

199
0:10:38.32,000 --> 0:10:4,000
he will endeavor to get it done for you.

200
0:10:40.72,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But there's also a shot that Jim might say no,

201
0:10:43.76,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and if he says no, in my opinion,

202
0:10:45.68,000 --> 0:10:47,000
there's only three reasons that he would tell you no.

203
0:10:48.44,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The first is he doesn't think that he has enough exposure to your work

204
0:10:53.04,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to have real credibility behind closed doors

205
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to be impactful and effective on your behalf.

206
0:10:59.8,000 --> 0:11:,000
The second reason he may tell you no

207
0:11:01.8,000 --> 0:11:04,000
is that you think he has the juice to get it done,

208
0:11:05.2,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but he knows that he does not have the power to do it

209
0:11:08.44,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and he is not going to admit that in that conversation with you.

210
0:11:11.72,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Laughter)

211
0:11:12.88,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And the third reason that he would tell you no,

212
0:11:15.56,000 --> 0:11:16,000
he doesn't like you.

213
0:11:16.8,000 --> 0:11:17,000
He doesn't like you.

214
0:11:18.04,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Laughter)

215
0:11:19.2,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And that's something that could happen.

216
0:11:21.52,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But even that will be valuable information for you

217
0:11:25.84,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that will help to inform your next conversation with a sponsor

218
0:11:29.92,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that might make it a little bit more impactful.

219
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I cannot tell you how important it is to have a sponsor.

220
0:11:37.68,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It is the critical relationship in your career.

221
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
A mentor, frankly, is a nice to have,

222
0:11:44.88,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but you can survive a long time in your career without a mentor,

223
0:11:48.92,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but you are not going to ascend in any organization without a sponsor.

224
0:11:54.52,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It is so critical that you should ask yourself regularly,

225
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:12:,000
"Who's carrying my paper into the room?

226
0:12:01.56,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Who is carrying my paper into the room?"

227
0:12:03.96,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And if you can't answer who is carrying your paper into the room,

228
0:12:07.72,000 --> 0:12:1,000
then I will tell you to divert some of your hardworking energies

229
0:12:11.24,000 --> 0:12:14,000
into investing in a sponsor relationship,

230
0:12:14.52,000 --> 0:12:17,000
because it will be critical to your success.

231
0:12:17.72,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And as I close, let me give a word

232
0:12:20.56,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to the would-be sponsors that are in the room.

233
0:12:23.68,000 --> 0:12:26,000
If you have been invited into the room,

234
0:12:26.76,000 --> 0:12:29,000
know that you have a seat at that table,

235
0:12:30.04,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and if you have a seat at the table,

236
0:12:32.52,000 --> 0:12:34,000
you have a responsibility to speak.

237
0:12:35.2,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Don't waste your power worrying about what people are going to say

238
0:12:40.2,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and whether or not they think you might be supporting someone

239
0:12:43.32,000 --> 0:12:45,000
just because they look like you.

240
0:12:45.76,000 --> 0:12:48,000
If somebody is worthy of your currency,

241
0:12:49.88,000 --> 0:12:5,000
spend it.

242
0:12:51.64,000 --> 0:12:54,000
One thing I have learned after several decades on Wall Street

243
0:12:54.72,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is the way to grow your power is to give it away,

244
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
and your voice is at the heart.

245
0:13:00.4,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Applause)

246
0:13:06.36,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And your voice is at the heart of your power.

247
0:13:11.96,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Use it.

248
0:13:13.2,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Thank you very much.

249
0:13:14.44,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause)

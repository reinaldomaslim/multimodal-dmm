2
0:00:12.044,000 --> 0:00:12,000
Is E.T. out there?

3
0:00:13.037,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Well, I work at the SETI Institute.

4
0:00:16.016,000 --> 0:00:17,000
That's almost my name. SETI:

5
0:00:17.251,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

6
0:00:19.658,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In other words, I look for aliens,

7
0:00:21.277,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually

8
0:00:24.945,000 --> 0:00:26,000
look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.

9
0:00:27.706,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.

10
0:00:30.039,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic,

11
0:00:32.799,000 --> 0:00:34,000
ridiculous, maybe even hopeless,

12
0:00:35.049,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think

13
0:00:38.754,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay,

14
0:00:42.568,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into

15
0:00:44.666,000 --> 0:00:46,000
this line of work, if that's what you call it.

16
0:00:47.021,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This thing — whoops, can we go back?

17
0:00:50.029,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Hello, come in, Earth.

18
0:00:52.728,000 --> 0:00:53,000
There we go. All right.

19
0:00:54.079,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory

20
0:00:56.072,000 --> 0:00:59,000
behind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968,

21
0:00:59.508,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I was working there collecting data for my thesis.

22
0:01:02.417,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data,

23
0:01:05.758,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night

24
0:01:08.291,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of the telescopes or even of myself,

25
0:01:11.052,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid

26
0:01:16.286,000 --> 0:01:17,000
within about 30 miles.

27
0:01:18.034,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So here are pictures of myself.

28
0:01:20.043,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The observatory had just acquired a new book,

29
0:01:23.631,000 --> 0:01:24,000
written by a Russian cosmologist

30
0:01:25.381,000 --> 0:01:28,000
by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded

31
0:01:28.999,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and translated and edited by a little-known

32
0:01:31.452,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan.

33
0:01:34.061,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I remember reading that book,

34
0:01:36.058,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and at 3 in the morning I was reading this book

35
0:01:38.066,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and it was explaining how the antennas I was using

36
0:01:40.759,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used

37
0:01:45.706,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to communicate, to send bits of information

38
0:01:48.018,000 --> 0:01:5,000
from one star system to another.

39
0:01:50.61,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone,

40
0:01:52.078,000 --> 0:01:54,000
haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea,

41
0:01:55.009,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact

42
0:01:58.898,000 --> 0:01:59,000
prove that there's somebody out there

43
0:02:00.382,000 --> 0:02:02,000
just using this same technology --

44
0:02:03.098,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job

45
0:02:05.328,000 --> 0:02:06,000
at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say

46
0:02:07.301,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often

47
0:02:11.751,000 --> 0:02:12,000
wondered whether there was any truth in this story,

48
0:02:13.584,000 --> 0:02:14,000
or I was just, you know, misremembering something,

49
0:02:15.088,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine,

50
0:02:17.836,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and sure enough, there you can see

51
0:02:19.435,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that

52
0:02:21.546,000 --> 0:02:23,000
analog calculating device.

53
0:02:24.023,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So it was true.

54
0:02:24.926,000 --> 0:02:26,000
All right. Now, the idea for doing this, it wasn't very old

55
0:02:27.367,000 --> 0:02:28,000
at the time that I made that photo.

56
0:02:29.031,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer

57
0:02:32.509,000 --> 0:02:34,000
by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna

58
0:02:35.005,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars

59
0:02:38.615,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.

60
0:02:42.004,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now, Frank didn't hear anything.

61
0:02:43.6,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force,

62
0:02:46.009,000 --> 0:02:48,000
which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.

63
0:02:48.974,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But Drake's idea here became very popular

64
0:02:51.74,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that —

65
0:02:54.197,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed,

66
0:02:57.613,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we have been doing SETI ever since,

67
0:02:59.468,000 --> 0:03:01,000
not continuously, but ever since.

68
0:03:01.502,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We still haven't heard anything.

69
0:03:03.388,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We still haven't heard anything.

70
0:03:05.066,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth,

71
0:03:06.859,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change

72
0:03:09.659,000 --> 0:03:11,000
rather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,

73
0:03:12.028,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change

74
0:03:14.803,000 --> 0:03:15,000
is that the equipment's getting better.

75
0:03:16.068,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles

76
0:03:19.005,000 --> 0:03:21,000
from whatever seat you're in right now.

77
0:03:21.021,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is something that we're using today

78
0:03:23.026,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten

79
0:03:25.03,000 --> 0:03:26,000
very much better too.

80
0:03:26.5,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.

81
0:03:29.026,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.

82
0:03:31.047,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Some pundit with too much time on his hands

83
0:03:34.536,000 --> 0:03:37,000
has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately

84
0:03:37.543,000 --> 0:03:41,000
100 trillion times better than they were in 1960,

85
0:03:42.038,000 --> 0:03:43,000
100 trillion times better.

86
0:03:43.534,000 --> 0:03:45,000
That's a degree of an improvement that would look good

87
0:03:45.623,000 --> 0:03:47,000
on your report card, okay?

88
0:03:48.03,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But something that's not appreciated by the public is,

89
0:03:50.664,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in fact, that the experiment continues to get better,

90
0:03:53.389,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and, consequently, tends to get faster.

91
0:03:56.037,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot,

92
0:03:57.726,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you lose 10 percent of the audience.

93
0:03:59.364,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I have 12 of these. (Laughter)

94
0:04:01.673,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But what I plotted here is just some metric

95
0:04:06.093,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that shows how fast we're searching.

96
0:04:08.647,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.

97
0:04:10.755,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.

98
0:04:13.042,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But we're going through the haystack no longer

99
0:04:15.753,000 --> 0:04:17,000
with a teaspoon but with a skip loader,

100
0:04:18.045,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because of this increase in speed.

101
0:04:20.016,000 --> 0:04:21,000
In fact, those of you who are still conscious

102
0:04:21.451,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and mathematically competent,

103
0:04:24.011,000 --> 0:04:26,000
will note that this is a semi-log plot.

104
0:04:26.089,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.

105
0:04:30.481,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an

106
0:04:33.214,000 --> 0:04:35,000
overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.

107
0:04:35.533,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They don't really know what exponential means,

108
0:04:37.07,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but this is exponential.

109
0:04:39.081,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,

110
0:04:42.001,000 --> 0:04:44,000
every card-carrying member of the digerati knows

111
0:04:44.005,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that that's Moore's Law.

112
0:04:45.497,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So this means that over the course of the next

113
0:04:48.098,000 --> 0:04:51,000
two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems,

114
0:04:52.01,000 --> 0:04:54,000
a million star systems, looking for signals

115
0:04:54.038,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that would prove somebody's out there.

116
0:04:55.547,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Well, a million star systems, is that interesting?

117
0:04:58.045,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I mean, how many of those star systems have planets?

118
0:05:01.059,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that

119
0:05:03.204,000 --> 0:05:05,000
even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really

120
0:05:05.978,000 --> 0:05:07,000
didn't know it even as recently as six months ago.

121
0:05:08.501,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But now we do. Recent results suggest

122
0:05:11.379,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that virtually every star has planets, and more than one.

123
0:05:15.018,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.

124
0:05:18.344,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch.

125
0:05:20.084,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate

126
0:05:23.018,000 --> 0:05:26,000
of the number of planets in our galaxy,

127
0:05:27.014,000 --> 0:05:29,000
just in our galaxy, by the way,

128
0:05:29.041,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and I remind the non-astronomy majors among you

129
0:05:31.811,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion

130
0:05:34.056,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that we can see with our telescopes.

131
0:05:36.04,000 --> 0:05:37,000
That's a lot of real estate, but of course,

132
0:05:37.563,000 --> 0:05:38,000
most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless,

133
0:05:39.472,000 --> 0:05:41,000
like, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.

134
0:05:41.564,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Neptune's probably not very big in your life.

135
0:05:43.654,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So the question is, what fraction of these planets

136
0:05:48.001,000 --> 0:05:49,000
are actually suitable for life?

137
0:05:49.683,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We don't know the answer to that either,

138
0:05:51.088,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but we will learn that answer this year, thanks to

139
0:05:53.326,000 --> 0:05:54,000
NASA's Kepler Space Telescope,

140
0:05:55.082,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project,

141
0:05:59.104,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets

142
0:06:02.533,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand,

143
0:06:06.569,000 --> 0:06:09,000
one in a hundred, something like that.

144
0:06:09.876,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's

145
0:06:12.016,000 --> 0:06:15,000
one in a thousand, that means that there are

146
0:06:15.127,000 --> 0:06:17,000
at least a billion cousins of the Earth

147
0:06:17.656,000 --> 0:06:18,000
just in our own galaxy.

148
0:06:19.383,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here,

149
0:06:21.636,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know,

150
0:06:25.562,000 --> 0:06:27,000
keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate,

151
0:06:28.041,000 --> 0:06:3,000
plenty of real estate in the universe,

152
0:06:30.054,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's

153
0:06:33.003,000 --> 0:06:36,000
some interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle,

154
0:06:36.038,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and I know you like to think you're a miracle,

155
0:06:38.719,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but if you do science, you learn rather quickly that

156
0:06:40.629,000 --> 0:06:41,000
every time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,

157
0:06:42.512,000 --> 0:06:44,000
so probably not the case.

158
0:06:45.04,000 --> 0:06:47,000
All right, so the bottom line is this:

159
0:06:47.091,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Because of the increase in speed, and because of the

160
0:06:50.054,000 --> 0:06:54,000
vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure

161
0:06:55.005,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.

162
0:06:57.05,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you:

163
0:07:00.021,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years,

164
0:07:02.458,000 --> 0:07:05,000
or I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

165
0:07:06.076,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years,

166
0:07:08.71,000 --> 0:07:09,000
you open up your browser and there's news of a signal,

167
0:07:10.569,000 --> 0:07:11,000
or you get a cup of coffee.

168
0:07:12.32,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that

169
0:07:16.293,000 --> 0:07:18,000
people don't think about, and that is,

170
0:07:18.331,000 --> 0:07:21,000
what happens? Suppose that what I say is true.

171
0:07:22.039,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.

172
0:07:24.404,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Suppose some time in the next two dozen years

173
0:07:25.891,000 --> 0:07:27,000
we pick up a faint line that tells us

174
0:07:28.068,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we have some cosmic company.

175
0:07:29.756,000 --> 0:07:31,000
What is the effect? What's the consequence?

176
0:07:32.051,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now, I might be at ground zero for this.

177
0:07:34.015,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I happen to know what the consequence for me would be,

178
0:07:35.836,000 --> 0:07:37,000
because we've had false alarms. This is 1997,

179
0:07:38.76,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning

180
0:07:41.044,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in Mountain View here, when we were watching

181
0:07:43.053,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal

182
0:07:45.368,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that we thought, "This is the real deal." All right?

183
0:07:48.446,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?

184
0:07:51.814,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call,

185
0:07:56.017,000 --> 0:07:59,000
somebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.

186
0:07:59.021,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Nobody called. I was so nervous

187
0:08:02.191,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around

188
0:08:04.015,000 --> 0:08:06,000
taking photos like this one, just for something to do.

189
0:08:07.005,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down

190
0:08:09.039,000 --> 0:08:11,000
on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night,

191
0:08:11.069,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the phone rings and it's The New York Times.

192
0:08:13.406,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And I think there's a lesson in that, and that lesson is

193
0:08:16.032,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that if we pick up a signal, the media, the media will be on it

194
0:08:19.012,000 --> 0:08:23,000
faster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast.

195
0:08:23.346,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You can be sure of that. No secrecy.

196
0:08:25.024,000 --> 0:08:27,000
That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week,

197
0:08:28.007,000 --> 0:08:3,000
because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window.

198
0:08:30.63,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But what about you? What's it going to do to you?

199
0:08:33.05,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And the answer is that we don't know the answer.

200
0:08:35.057,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We don't know what that's going to do to you,

201
0:08:35.942,000 --> 0:08:38,000
not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.

202
0:08:39.066,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I mean, that would be a bit like

203
0:08:41.894,000 --> 0:08:44,000
asking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris,

204
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a

205
0:08:47.014,000 --> 0:08:5,000
continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to,

206
0:08:50.55,000 --> 0:08:52,000
what will be the consequences for humanity

207
0:08:53.325,000 --> 0:08:54,000
if that turns out to be the case?"

208
0:08:55.071,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer

209
0:08:57.301,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that you might not have understood, but it probably

210
0:09:00.012,000 --> 0:09:02,000
wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict

211
0:09:02.846,000 --> 0:09:03,000
what finding E.T.'s going to mean,

212
0:09:04.605,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we can't predict that either.

213
0:09:05.685,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But here are a couple things I can say.

214
0:09:07.307,000 --> 0:09:11,000
To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.

215
0:09:11.464,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.

216
0:09:13.088,000 --> 0:09:14,000
They're not building transmitters.

217
0:09:14.378,000 --> 0:09:15,000
They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand

218
0:09:16.304,000 --> 0:09:19,000
years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially

219
0:09:19.371,000 --> 0:09:21,000
ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand

220
0:09:21.6,000 --> 0:09:24,000
anything that they're going to say, then you might be able

221
0:09:25.386,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to short-circuit history by getting information from a society

222
0:09:28.476,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that's way beyond our own.

223
0:09:30.05,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is,

224
0:09:33.001,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen,

225
0:09:35.654,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know,

226
0:09:38.027,000 --> 0:09:4,000
giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key

227
0:09:40.496,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to the library of Congress.

228
0:09:41.603,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It would change his day, all right?

229
0:09:44.058,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure

230
0:09:46.053,000 --> 0:09:49,000
going to happen is that it will calibrate us.

231
0:09:49.553,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We will know that we're not that miracle, right,

232
0:09:53.491,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that we're just another duck in a row,

233
0:09:55.053,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's

234
0:09:57.048,000 --> 0:09:59,000
philosophically a very profound thing to learn.

235
0:10:00.002,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We're not a miracle, okay?

236
0:10:03.103,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague,

237
0:10:06.402,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but I think interesting and important,

238
0:10:08.525,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and that is, if you find a signal coming from a more

239
0:10:10.63,000 --> 0:10:12,000
advanced society, because they will be,

240
0:10:12.861,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that will tell you something about our own possibilities,

241
0:10:15.513,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.

242
0:10:20.295,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Because they survived their technology,

243
0:10:22.091,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we could do it too.

244
0:10:23.203,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Normally when you look out into the universe,

245
0:10:25.094,000 --> 0:10:27,000
you're looking back in time. All right?

246
0:10:27.555,000 --> 0:10:29,000
That's interesting to cosmologists.

247
0:10:29.594,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But in this sense, you actually can look into the future,

248
0:10:33.038,000 --> 0:10:35,000
hazily, but you can look into the future.

249
0:10:35.053,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.

250
0:10:40.59,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Now, let me talk a little bit about something that happens

251
0:10:43.022,000 --> 0:10:47,000
even in the meantime, and that is,

252
0:10:47.234,000 --> 0:10:51,000
SETI, I think, is important, because it's exploration, and

253
0:10:52.012,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.

254
0:10:54.464,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about

255
0:10:57.329,000 --> 0:10:59,000
explorers. I find exploration very interesting,

256
0:11:00.044,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan,

257
0:11:03.025,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there,

258
0:11:06.021,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Scott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration.

259
0:11:09.345,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And they're just doing it because they want to explore,

260
0:11:11.584,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity,"

261
0:11:13.7,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity,

262
0:11:17.028,000 --> 0:11:19,000
because, I mean, think of ants.

263
0:11:19.059,000 --> 0:11:2,000
You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another

264
0:11:21.056,000 --> 0:11:23,000
along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants,

265
0:11:23.304,000 --> 0:11:25,000
maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call

266
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.

267
0:11:28.175,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.

268
0:11:30.076,000 --> 0:11:31,000
You gotta get them with your thumb before they

269
0:11:32.074,000 --> 0:11:33,000
find the sugar or something.

270
0:11:33.658,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But those ants, even though most of them get wiped out,

271
0:11:36.063,000 --> 0:11:39,000
those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival

272
0:11:39.355,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of the hive. So exploration is important.

273
0:11:42.929,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I also think that exploration is important in terms of

274
0:11:46.309,000 --> 0:11:5,000
being able to address what I think is a critical

275
0:11:51.179,000 --> 0:11:54,000
lack in our society, and that is the lack of science literacy,

276
0:11:54.38,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the lack of the ability to even understand science.

277
0:11:58.023,000 --> 0:12:,000
Now, look, a lot has been written about the

278
0:12:00.065,000 --> 0:12:03,000
deplorable state of science literacy in this country.

279
0:12:03.463,000 --> 0:12:05,000
You've heard about it.

280
0:12:06.015,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Well, here's one example, in fact.

281
0:12:08.067,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.

282
0:12:10.386,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks

283
0:12:12.515,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them

284
0:12:14.479,000 --> 0:12:15,000
out there, but they're here, right?

285
0:12:16.097,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally

286
0:12:18.396,000 --> 0:12:21,000
abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.

287
0:12:21.512,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Well, that would be interesting if it was true,

288
0:12:24.685,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is

289
0:12:26.564,000 --> 0:12:29,000
very good. That's more, you know, sad than significant.

290
0:12:30.036,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But there are other things that people believe

291
0:12:32.055,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy,

292
0:12:35.466,000 --> 0:12:38,000
or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea

293
0:12:39.017,000 --> 0:12:42,000
by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,

294
0:12:42.048,000 --> 0:12:44,000
all that sort of thing, or global warming.

295
0:12:44.604,000 --> 0:12:47,000
These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity,

296
0:12:48.005,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that you can't trust the scientists.

297
0:12:50.08,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's

298
0:12:52.323,000 --> 0:12:56,000
a critically important problem, and you might say,

299
0:12:56.401,000 --> 0:12:58,000
"Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"

300
0:12:59.03,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't

301
0:13:01.429,000 --> 0:13:02,000
solve the problem, but it can address the problem.

302
0:13:03.092,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It can address the problem by getting young people

303
0:13:06.035,000 --> 0:13:08,000
interested in science. Look, science is hard, it

304
0:13:09.033,000 --> 0:13:12,000
has a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard,

305
0:13:12.086,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and that's the result of 400 years of science, right?

306
0:13:17.021,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century

307
0:13:19.5,000 --> 0:13:21,000
you could become an expert on any field of science

308
0:13:22.09,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in an afternoon by going to a library,

309
0:13:25.004,000 --> 0:13:27,000
if you could find the library, right?

310
0:13:27.025,000 --> 0:13:3,000
In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab,

311
0:13:30.641,000 --> 0:13:32,000
you could make major scientific discoveries

312
0:13:33.388,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in your own home. Right? Because there was all this

313
0:13:35.613,000 --> 0:13:37,000
science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.

314
0:13:38.488,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Now, that's not true anymore.

315
0:13:40.081,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Today, you've got to spend years in grad school

316
0:13:42.509,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and post-doc positions just to figure out what

317
0:13:46.007,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the important questions are.

318
0:13:48.063,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It's hard. There's no doubt about it.

319
0:13:50.058,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson,

320
0:13:52.367,000 --> 0:13:53,000
finding the Higgs boson.

321
0:13:54.276,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets,

322
0:13:56.076,000 --> 0:13:58,000
"Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions

323
0:13:58.414,000 --> 0:14:,000
of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"

324
0:14:01.055,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And I bet the answer you're going to get, is,

325
0:14:03.376,000 --> 0:14:04,000
"Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is,

326
0:14:05.033,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and I don't know if it's important."

327
0:14:06.265,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And probably most of the people wouldn't even know

328
0:14:08.064,000 --> 0:14:1,000
the value of a Swiss franc, okay?

329
0:14:10.511,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.

330
0:14:13.041,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Okay? So that doesn't get people interested in science

331
0:14:15.194,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because they can't comprehend what it's about.

332
0:14:17.07,000 --> 0:14:18,000
SETI, on the other hand, is really simple.

333
0:14:18.687,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to

334
0:14:20.303,000 --> 0:14:22,000
try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that.

335
0:14:23.055,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated,

336
0:14:25.064,000 --> 0:14:27,000
but everybody gets the idea.

337
0:14:27.07,000 --> 0:14:3,000
So that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science.

338
0:14:31.008,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It's exciting because we're naturally interested

339
0:14:33.422,000 --> 0:14:35,000
in other intelligent beings, and I think that's

340
0:14:35.647,000 --> 0:14:36,000
part of our hardwiring.

341
0:14:37.071,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I mean, we're hardwired to be interested

342
0:14:38.631,000 --> 0:14:4,000
in beings that might be, if you will, competitors,

343
0:14:41.432,000 --> 0:14:44,000
or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?

344
0:14:45.015,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that

345
0:14:47.026,000 --> 0:14:49,000
have big teeth. Right?

346
0:14:49.047,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We're interested in things that have big teeth, and you

347
0:14:50.521,000 --> 0:14:52,000
can see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see

348
0:14:53.066,000 --> 0:14:56,000
the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.

349
0:14:56.754,000 --> 0:14:58,000
You notice they make very few programs about gerbils.

350
0:14:59.088,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It's mostly about things that have big teeth.

351
0:15:01.144,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.

352
0:15:04.091,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And not just us. It's also kids.

353
0:15:08.026,000 --> 0:15:11,000
This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a

354
0:15:11.453,000 --> 0:15:14,000
hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science,

355
0:15:14.685,000 --> 0:15:15,000
obviously biology, obviously astronomy,

356
0:15:16.675,000 --> 0:15:19,000
but also geology, also chemistry, various scientific

357
0:15:20.009,000 --> 0:15:24,000
disciplines all can be presented in the guise of,

358
0:15:24.009,000 --> 0:15:25,000
"We're looking for E.T."

359
0:15:25.338,000 --> 0:15:29,000
So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact,

360
0:15:29.795,000 --> 0:15:32,000
it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults,

361
0:15:33.033,000 --> 0:15:35,000
you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.

362
0:15:35.701,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But if you give talks to kids, you know,

363
0:15:38.623,000 --> 0:15:42,000
one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think,

364
0:15:42.775,000 --> 0:15:43,000
"Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go,

365
0:15:44.576,000 --> 0:15:45,000
you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever.

366
0:15:46.368,000 --> 0:15:47,000
They get interested in something.

367
0:15:48.05,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Now it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal,

368
0:15:53.024,000 --> 0:15:55,000
personal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless,

369
0:15:55.047,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that kids get interested in something between the ages

370
0:15:57.52,000 --> 0:15:59,000
of eight and 11. You've got to get them there.

371
0:16:00.056,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So, all right, I give talks to adults, that's fine, but I try

372
0:16:02.676,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and make 10 percent of the talks that I give,

373
0:16:05.001,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I try and make those for kids.

374
0:16:07.078,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I remember when a guy came to our high school, actually,

375
0:16:10.054,000 --> 0:16:12,000
it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade.

376
0:16:13.03,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And he gave some talk. All I remember from it

377
0:16:15.51,000 --> 0:16:16,000
was one word: electronics.

378
0:16:17.085,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It was like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," right,

379
0:16:19.646,000 --> 0:16:21,000
when he said "plastics," whatever that means, plastics.

380
0:16:22.044,000 --> 0:16:23,000
All right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember

381
0:16:24.039,000 --> 0:16:26,000
anything else. In fact, I don't remember anything

382
0:16:26.043,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that my sixth grade teacher said all year,

383
0:16:28.053,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but I remember electronics.

384
0:16:30.067,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And so I got interested in electronics, and you know,

385
0:16:32.719,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.

386
0:16:35.044,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Here I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.

387
0:16:38.022,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Okay? That had a big effect on me.

388
0:16:39.605,000 --> 0:16:4,000
So that's my point, that you can have a big effect

389
0:16:41.317,000 --> 0:16:43,000
on these kids.

390
0:16:44.033,000 --> 0:16:47,000
In fact, this reminds me, I don't know, a couple years ago

391
0:16:47.694,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto

392
0:16:51.02,000 --> 0:16:53,000
where there were about a dozen 11-year-olds

393
0:16:53.033,000 --> 0:16:53,000
that had come to this talk.

394
0:16:54.005,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour.

395
0:16:56.521,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Eleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle

396
0:16:58.795,000 --> 0:17:,000
looking up at me with big eyes, and I started,

397
0:17:01.039,000 --> 0:17:02,000
there was a white board behind me, and I started off

398
0:17:02.695,000 --> 0:17:04,000
by writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said,

399
0:17:05.533,000 --> 0:17:07,000
"All right, now look, this is the number of stars

400
0:17:07.896,000 --> 0:17:09,000
in the visible universe, and this number is so big

401
0:17:10.768,000 --> 0:17:13,000
there's not even a name for it."

402
0:17:14.116,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said,

403
0:17:16.581,000 --> 0:17:17,000
"Well, actually there is a name for it.

404
0:17:18.086,000 --> 0:17:2,000
It's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other." Right?

405
0:17:21.02,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Now, that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude,

406
0:17:25.016,000 --> 0:17:27,000
but there was no doubt about it, these kids were smart.

407
0:17:27.488,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Okay? So I stopped giving the lecture.

408
0:17:29.456,000 --> 0:17:31,000
All they wanted to do was ask questions.

409
0:17:32.039,000 --> 0:17:35,000
In fact, my last comments to these kids, at the end I said,

410
0:17:36.031,000 --> 0:17:38,000
"You know, you kids are smarter

411
0:17:38.063,000 --> 0:17:42,000
than the people I work with." Now — (Laughter)

412
0:17:43.005,000 --> 0:17:44,000
They didn't even care about that.

413
0:17:44.334,000 --> 0:17:46,000
What they wanted was my email address

414
0:17:47.028,000 --> 0:17:5,000
so they could ask me more questions. (Laughter)

415
0:17:51.013,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Let me just say, look, my job is a privilege

416
0:17:54.172,000 --> 0:17:55,000
because we're in a special time.

417
0:17:55.795,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all.

418
0:17:58.58,000 --> 0:17:59,000
In another generation down the line,

419
0:18:00.405,000 --> 0:18:01,000
I think we will have succeeded.

420
0:18:02.021,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So to me, it is a privilege, and when I look in the mirror,

421
0:18:05.502,000 --> 0:18:07,000
the facts are that I really don't see myself.

422
0:18:08.309,000 --> 0:18:09,000
What I see is the generation behind me.

423
0:18:10.073,000 --> 0:18:12,000
These are some kids from the Huff School, fourth graders.

424
0:18:12.099,000 --> 0:18:14,000
I talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.

425
0:18:15.044,000 --> 0:18:19,000
I think that if you can instill some interest in science

426
0:18:19.654,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and how it works, well, that's a payoff

427
0:18:22.613,000 --> 0:18:24,000
beyond easy measure. Thank you very much.

428
0:18:25.056,000 --> 0:18:3,000
(Applause)

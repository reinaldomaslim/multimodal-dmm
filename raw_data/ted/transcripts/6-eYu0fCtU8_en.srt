1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a painter.

2
0:00:14.12,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I make large-scale figurative paintings,

3
0:00:16.72,000 --> 0:00:17,000
which means I paint people

4
0:00:18.84,000 --> 0:00:19,000
like this.

5
0:00:20.84,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But I'm here tonight to tell you about something personal

6
0:00:23.64,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that changed my work and my perspective.

7
0:00:27.52,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's something we all go through,

8
0:00:29.24,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and my hope is that my experience may be helpful to somebody.

9
0:00:34.52,000 --> 0:00:37,000
To give you some background on me, I grew up the youngest of eight.

10
0:00:38.12,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Yes, eight kids in my family.

11
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I have six older brothers and a sister.

12
0:00:42.68,000 --> 0:00:44,000
To give you a sense of what that's like,

13
0:00:45.72,000 --> 0:00:47,000
when my family went on vacation,

14
0:00:47.76,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we had a bus.

15
0:00:49.48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:52.92,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My supermom would drive us all over town

17
0:00:55.68,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to our various after-school activities --

18
0:00:58.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
not in the bus.

19
0:01:00.92,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We had a regular car, too.

20
0:01:03.92,000 --> 0:01:04,000
She would take me to art classes,

21
0:01:05.76,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and not just one or two.

22
0:01:07.04,000 --> 0:01:12,000
She took me to every available art class from when I was eight to 16,

23
0:01:12.64,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because that's all I wanted to do.

24
0:01:14.76,000 --> 0:01:16,000
She even took a class with me in New York City.

25
0:01:18.04,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, being the youngest of eight, I learned a few survival skills.

26
0:01:21.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Rule number one:

27
0:01:23.32,000 --> 0:01:25,000
don't let your big brother see you do anything stupid.

28
0:01:27.6,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So I learned to be quiet and neat

29
0:01:30.12,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and careful to follow the rules and stay in line.

30
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But painting was where I made the rules.

31
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:37,000
That was my private world.

32
0:01:39.56,000 --> 0:01:41,000
By 14, I knew I really wanted to be an artist.

33
0:01:43.88,000 --> 0:01:46,000
My big plan was to be a waitress to support my painting.

34
0:01:48.44,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So I continued honing my skills.

35
0:01:50.32,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I went to graduate school and I got an MFA,

36
0:01:52.48,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and at my first solo show, my brother asked me,

37
0:01:55.8,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"What do all these red dots mean next to the paintings?"

38
0:01:58.8,000 --> 0:02:,000
Nobody was more surprised than me.

39
0:02:01.56,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The red dots meant that the paintings were sold

40
0:02:04.04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and that I'd be able to pay my rent

41
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
with painting.

42
0:02:08.04,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, my apartment had four electrical outlets,

43
0:02:11.4,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and I couldn't use a microwave and a toaster at the same time,

44
0:02:14.72,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but still, I could pay my rent.

45
0:02:17.48,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So I was very happy.

46
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Here's a painting from back around that time.

47
0:02:23.4,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I needed it to be as realistic as possible.

48
0:02:25.56,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It had to be specific and believable.

49
0:02:29.4,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This was the place where I was isolated and in total control.

50
0:02:35.68,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Since then, I've made a career of painting people in water.

51
0:02:39.4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Bathtubs and showers were the perfect enclosed environment.

52
0:02:43.44,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It was intimate and private,

53
0:02:45.2,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and water was this complicated challenge that kept me busy for a decade.

54
0:02:49.44,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I made about 200 of these paintings,

55
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
some of them six to eight feet,

56
0:02:54.44,000 --> 0:02:55,000
like this one.

57
0:02:56.24,000 --> 0:03:,000
For this painting, I mixed flour in with the bathwater to make it cloudy

58
0:03:00.76,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I floated cooking oil on the surface

59
0:03:03.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and stuck a girl in it,

60
0:03:05.12,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and when I lit it up,

61
0:03:06.76,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it was so beautiful I couldn't wait to paint it.

62
0:03:10.08,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I was driven by this kind of impulsive curiosity,

63
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:15,000
always looking for something new to add:

64
0:03:16.52,000 --> 0:03:17,000
vinyl, steam, glass.

65
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I once put all this Vaseline in my head and hair

66
0:03:22.8,000 --> 0:03:23,000
just to see what that would look like.

67
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Don't do that.

68
0:03:26.44,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:30.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So it was going well.

70
0:03:31.84,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I was finding my way.

71
0:03:33.6,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I was eager and motivated

72
0:03:35.8,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and surrounded by artists,

73
0:03:37.88,000 --> 0:03:38,000
always going to openings and events.

74
0:03:40.32,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I was having some success and recognition

75
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I moved into an apartment with more than four outlets.

76
0:03:48.28,000 --> 0:03:49,000
My mom and I would stay up very late

77
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
talking about our latest ideas and inspiring each other.

78
0:03:53.32,000 --> 0:03:54,000
She made beautiful pottery.

79
0:03:56.96,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I have a friend named Bo who made this painting

80
0:03:59.44,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of his wife and I dancing by the ocean,

81
0:04:01.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and he called it "The Light Years."

82
0:04:03.96,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I asked him what that meant, and he said,

83
0:04:06.6,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"Well, that's when you've stepped into adulthood, you're no longer a child,

84
0:04:10.96,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but you're not yet weighed down by the responsibilities of life."

85
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That was it. It was the light years.

86
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:19,000
On October 8, 2011,

87
0:04:20.56,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the light years came to an end.

88
0:04:22.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

89
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It had spread to her bones, and it was in her brain.

90
0:04:30.68,000 --> 0:04:32,000
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.

91
0:04:32.959,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I totally lost it.

92
0:04:35.72,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And when I got myself together and I looked at her,

93
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I realized, this isn't about me.

94
0:04:39.76,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is about figuring out how to help her.

95
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:44,000
My father is a doctor,

96
0:04:44.44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and so we had a great advantage having him in charge,

97
0:04:48.04,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and he did a beautiful job taking care of her.

98
0:04:50.72,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But I, too, wanted to do everything I could to help,

99
0:04:53.52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
so I wanted to try everything.

100
0:04:56.12,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We all did.

101
0:04:57.72,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I researched alternative medicines,

102
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:02,000
diets, juicing, acupuncture.

103
0:05:03.6,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Finally, I asked her,

104
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"Is this what you want me to do?"

105
0:05:07.28,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And she said, "No."

106
0:05:09.36,000 --> 0:05:12,000
She said, "Pace yourself. I'm going to need you later."

107
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
She knew what was happening,

108
0:05:17.92,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and she knew what the doctors

109
0:05:19.36,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the experts and the internet didn't know:

110
0:05:21.88,000 --> 0:05:22,000
how she wanted to go through this.

111
0:05:24.6,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I just needed to ask her.

112
0:05:27.84,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I realized that if I tried to fix it,

113
0:05:29.96,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I would miss it.

114
0:05:32.44,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So I just started to be with her,

115
0:05:34.08,000 --> 0:05:36,000
whatever that meant and whatever situation came up,

116
0:05:37.4,000 --> 0:05:38,000
just really listen to her.

117
0:05:40.32,000 --> 0:05:44,000
If before I was resisting, then now I was surrendering,

118
0:05:45.2,000 --> 0:05:47,000
giving up trying to control the uncontrollable

119
0:05:47.84,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and just being there in it with her.

120
0:05:51.76,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Time slowed down,

121
0:05:53.84,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and the date was irrelevant.

122
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We developed a routine.

123
0:05:59.44,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Early each morning I would crawl into bed with her and sleep with her.

124
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
My brother would come for breakfast

125
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and we'd be so glad to hear his car coming up the driveway.

126
0:06:07.68,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So I'd help her up and take both her hands

127
0:06:11.2,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and help her walk to the kitchen.

128
0:06:13.96,000 --> 0:06:16,000
She had this huge mug she made

129
0:06:17.24,000 --> 0:06:18,000
she loved to drink her coffee out of,

130
0:06:19.8,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and she loved Irish soda bread for breakfast.

131
0:06:23.6,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Afterwards was the shower,

132
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and she loved this part.

133
0:06:26.28,000 --> 0:06:27,000
She loved the warm water,

134
0:06:27.84,000 --> 0:06:3,000
so I made this as indulgent as I could,

135
0:06:31.32,000 --> 0:06:32,000
like a spa.

136
0:06:33.36,000 --> 0:06:34,000
My sister would help sometimes.

137
0:06:35.12,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We had warm towels

138
0:06:37.44,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and slippers ready immediately

139
0:06:39.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
so she never got cold for a second.

140
0:06:42.92,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I'd blow-dry her hair.

141
0:06:45.2,000 --> 0:06:47,000
My brothers would come in the evenings and bring their kids,

142
0:06:48.08,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and that was the highlight of her day.

143
0:06:51.08,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair,

144
0:06:54.08,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and she didn't want to eat so much,

145
0:06:55.8,000 --> 0:07:,000
and she used the tiniest little teacup we could find to drink her coffee.

146
0:07:03.12,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I couldn't support her myself anymore,

147
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
so we hired an aide to help me with the showers.

148
0:07:08.44,000 --> 0:07:1,000
These simple daily activities

149
0:07:11.08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
became our sacred ritual,

150
0:07:13.92,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and we repeated them day after day

151
0:07:15.76,000 --> 0:07:16,000
as the cancer grew.

152
0:07:17.56,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It was humbling and painful

153
0:07:19.72,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and exactly where I wanted to be.

154
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We called this time "the beautiful awful."

155
0:07:28.28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
She died on October 26, 2012.

156
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It was a year and three weeks after her diagnosis.

157
0:07:36.76,000 --> 0:07:37,000
She was gone.

158
0:07:41.52,000 --> 0:07:42,000
My brothers, sister, and father and I

159
0:07:43.52,000 --> 0:07:46,000
all came together in this supportive and attentive way.

160
0:07:47.903,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It was as though our whole family dynamic

161
0:07:49.88,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and all our established roles vanished

162
0:07:51.96,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and we were just all together in this unknown,

163
0:07:54.64,000 --> 0:07:55,000
feeling the same thing

164
0:07:56.52,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and taking care of each other.

165
0:07:59.64,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I'm so grateful for them.

166
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
As someone who spends most of my time alone in a studio working,

167
0:08:08.8,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I had no idea that this kind of connection

168
0:08:11.68,000 --> 0:08:13,000
could be so important, so healing.

169
0:08:14.64,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This was the most important thing.

170
0:08:18.12,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It was what I always wanted.

171
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So after the funeral, it was time for me to go back to my studio.

172
0:08:27.6,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So I packed up my car and I drove back to Brooklyn,

173
0:08:30.44,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and painting is what I've always done, so that's what I did.

174
0:08:34.4,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And here's what happened.

175
0:08:39.12,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me.

176
0:08:45.919,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That safe, very, very carefully rendered safe place

177
0:08:50.919,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that I created in all my other paintings,

178
0:08:53.88,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it was a myth.

179
0:08:55.159,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It didn't work.

180
0:08:57.28,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I was afraid, because I didn't want to paint anymore.

181
0:09:03.12,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So I went into the woods.

182
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I thought, I'll try that, going outside.

183
0:09:08.24,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I got my paints, and I wasn't a landscape painter,

184
0:09:12.08,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but I wasn't really much of any kind of painter at all,

185
0:09:14.72,000 --> 0:09:16,000
so I had no attachment, no expectation,

186
0:09:17.24,000 --> 0:09:2,000
which allowed me to be reckless and free.

187
0:09:20.32,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I actually left one of these wet paintings

188
0:09:22.4,000 --> 0:09:23,000
outside overnight

189
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
next to a light in the woods.

190
0:09:28.2,000 --> 0:09:3,000
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.

191
0:09:32.52,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But I didn't care. It didn't matter. It didn't matter.

192
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I took all these paintings back to my studio,

193
0:09:37.56,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and scraped them, and carved into them,

194
0:09:40.24,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and poured paint thinner on them,

195
0:09:42.76,000 --> 0:09:44,000
put more paint on top, drew on them.

196
0:09:45.08,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I had no plan,

197
0:09:47.32,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but I was watching what was happening.

198
0:09:50.68,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This is the one with all the bugs in it.

199
0:09:53.96,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I wasn't trying to represent a real space.

200
0:09:56.12,000 --> 0:10:,000
It was the chaos and the imperfections that were fascinating me,

201
0:10:00.6,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and something started to happen.

202
0:10:03.68,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I got curious again.

203
0:10:06.32,000 --> 0:10:08,000
This is another one from the woods.

204
0:10:10.32,000 --> 0:10:11,000
There was a caveat now, though.

205
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I couldn't be controlling the paint like I used to.

206
0:10:15.12,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It had to be about implying and suggesting,

207
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
not explaining or describing.

208
0:10:21.76,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And that imperfect, chaotic, turbulent surface

209
0:10:26.04,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is what told the story.

210
0:10:30.24,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I started to be as curious as I was when I was a student.

211
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So the next thing was I wanted to put figures in these paintings, people,

212
0:10:38.12,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and I loved this new environment,

213
0:10:39.92,000 --> 0:10:43,000
so I wanted to have both people and this atmosphere.

214
0:10:45.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
When the idea hit me of how to do this,

215
0:10:47.92,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I got kind of nauseous and dizzy,

216
0:10:50.72,000 --> 0:10:52,000
which is really just adrenaline, probably,

217
0:10:53.6,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but for me it's a really good sign.

218
0:10:56.56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And so now I want to show you what I've been working on.

219
0:10:59.72,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It's something I haven't shown yet, and it's like a preview, I guess,

220
0:11:03.8,000 --> 0:11:04,000
of my upcoming show,

221
0:11:05.08,000 --> 0:11:06,000
what I have so far.

222
0:11:08.28,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Expansive space

223
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
instead of the isolated bathtub.

224
0:11:13.48,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I'm going outside instead of inside.

225
0:11:17.48,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Loosening control,

226
0:11:19.88,000 --> 0:11:21,000
savoring the imperfections,

227
0:11:21.92,000 --> 0:11:22,000
allowing the --

228
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
allowing the imperfections.

229
0:11:27.68,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And in that imperfection,

230
0:11:29.36,000 --> 0:11:3,000
you can find a vulnerability.

231
0:11:31.28,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I could feel my deepest intention, what matters most to me,

232
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that human connection

233
0:11:40.4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that can happen in a space where there's no resisting or controlling.

234
0:11:45.56,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I want to make paintings about that.

235
0:11:50.28,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So here's what I learned.

236
0:11:53.24,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We're all going to have big losses in our lives,

237
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
maybe a job or a career,

238
0:11:59.08,000 --> 0:12:02,000
relationships, love, our youth.

239
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:05,000
We're going to lose our health,

240
0:12:05.76,000 --> 0:12:06,000
people we love.

241
0:12:08.24,000 --> 0:12:1,000
These kinds of losses are out of our control.

242
0:12:10.68,000 --> 0:12:11,000
They're unpredictable,

243
0:12:12.72,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and they bring us to our knees.

244
0:12:15.52,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And so I say, let them.

245
0:12:18.84,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Fall to your knees. Be humbled.

246
0:12:22.92,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Let go of trying to change it

247
0:12:25.28,000 --> 0:12:26,000
or even wanting it to be different.

248
0:12:27.44,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It just is.

249
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And then there's space,

250
0:12:32.64,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and in that space feel your vulnerability,

251
0:12:35.84,000 --> 0:12:36,000
what matters most to you,

252
0:12:37.56,000 --> 0:12:38,000
your deepest intention.

253
0:12:40.64,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And be curious to connect

254
0:12:43.6,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to what and who is really here,

255
0:12:47.44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
awake and alive.

256
0:12:50.12,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's what we all want.

257
0:12:52.8,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Let's take the opportunity to find something beautiful

258
0:12:56.72,000 --> 0:12:58,000
in the unknown, in the unpredictable,

259
0:13:00.76,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and even in the awful.

260
0:13:03.32,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you.

261
0:13:04.56,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Applause)

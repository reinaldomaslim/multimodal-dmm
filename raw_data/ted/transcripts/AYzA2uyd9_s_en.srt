1
0:00:12.18,000 --> 0:00:13,000
In the last couple of years,

2
0:00:13.98,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I have produced what I call "The Dead Mall Series,"

3
0:00:16.74,000 --> 0:00:18,000
32 short films and counting about dead malls.

4
0:00:19.02,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with what a dead mall is,

5
0:00:23.46,000 --> 0:00:25,000
it's basically a shopping mall

6
0:00:25.9,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that has fallen into hard times.

7
0:00:29.02,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So it either has few shops and fewer shoppers,

8
0:00:31.82,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.

9
0:00:37.1,000 --> 0:00:38,000
No sale at Penny's.

10
0:00:38.34,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:40.18,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I started producing this series

12
0:00:42.58,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in early 2015

13
0:00:45.46,000 --> 0:00:47,000
after going through kind of a dark period in my life

14
0:00:47.94,000 --> 0:00:5,000
where I just didn't want to create films anymore.

15
0:00:51.46,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I put my camera away

16
0:00:53.42,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I just stopped.

17
0:00:56.7,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So in 2015, I decided to make a short film about the Owings Mills Mall.

18
0:01:03.3,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986.

19
0:01:06.42,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I should know because I was there on opening day.

20
0:01:10.38,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I was there with my family,

21
0:01:11.74,000 --> 0:01:14,000
along with every other family in Baltimore,

22
0:01:15.82,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and you had to drive around

23
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:18,000
for 45 minutes

24
0:01:19.22,000 --> 0:01:2,000
just to find a parking spot.

25
0:01:21.02,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So if you can imagine,

26
0:01:22.58,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that's not happening at the malls today.

27
0:01:25.3,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My first mall job that I had as a teenager

28
0:01:28.66,000 --> 0:01:32,000
was at a sporting goods store called Herman's World of Sports.

29
0:01:33.22,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Maybe you remember.

30
0:01:34.46,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Singing) Herman's World of Sports.

31
0:01:36.38,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You guys remember that?

32
0:01:37.98,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:38.9,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.

34
0:01:44.22,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I worked in a leather goods store,

35
0:01:46.74,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I also worked in a video store,

36
0:01:51.94,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and not being one who was very fond of the retail arts --

37
0:01:58.14,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:01.38,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I got fired from every single job.

39
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:06.1,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In between these low-paying retail jobs,

41
0:02:11.3,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I did what any normal teenager did

42
0:02:14.06,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in the 1990s.

43
0:02:16.74,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I shoplifted.

44
0:02:19.9,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I'm just kidding.

45
0:02:21.14,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I hung out with my friends at the mall.

46
0:02:23.06,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:24.62,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Everyone's like, "Oh my God, what kind of talk is this?"

48
0:02:28.66,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:32.9,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Hanging out at the mall could be fun, but it could be really lame, too,

50
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
like sharing a cigarette with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat

51
0:02:41.74,000 --> 0:02:44,000
who has put on black lipstick for the night

52
0:02:44.9,000 --> 0:02:47,000
while you're on your break from your crappy minimum wage job.

53
0:02:52.3,000 --> 0:02:53,000
As I stand here today,

54
0:02:54.94,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Owings Mills has been gutted

55
0:02:57.86,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and it's ready for the wrecking ball.

56
0:03:02.3,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The last time I was there, it was in the evening,

57
0:03:04.98,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and it was about three days before they closed the mall for good.

58
0:03:10.54,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And you kind of felt --

59
0:03:11.94,000 --> 0:03:13,000
they never announced the mall was closing,

60
0:03:13.98,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but you had this sort of feeling, this ominous feeling,

61
0:03:16.62,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that something big was going to happen,

62
0:03:19.42,000 --> 0:03:21,000
like it was the end of the road.

63
0:03:21.98,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It was a very creepy walk through the mall.

64
0:03:25.54,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Let me show you.

65
0:03:34.42,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Music)

66
0:03:58.82,000 --> 0:04:,000
So when I started producing "The Dead Mall Series,"

67
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I put the videos up onto YouTube,

68
0:04:03.02,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and while I thought they were interesting,

69
0:04:05.18,000 --> 0:04:09,000
frankly I didn't think others would share the enthusiasm

70
0:04:09.78,000 --> 0:04:12,000
for such a drab and depressing topic.

71
0:04:14.1,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But apparently I was wrong,

72
0:04:15.46,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because a lot of people started to comment.

73
0:04:17.54,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And at first the comments were like --

74
0:04:20.98,000 --> 0:04:23,000
basically like, "Oh my God, that's the mall from my childhood.

75
0:04:24.34,000 --> 0:04:25,000
What happened?"

76
0:04:26.3,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And then I would get comments from people who were like,

77
0:04:29.7,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"There's a dead mall in my town. You should come and film it."

78
0:04:33.099,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So I started to travel around the mid-Atlantic region

79
0:04:37.9,000 --> 0:04:39,000
filming these dead malls.

80
0:04:40.54,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Some were open.

81
0:04:42.66,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Some were abandoned.

82
0:04:44.74,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It was kind of always hard to get into the ones that were abandoned,

83
0:04:48.38,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but I somehow always found a way in.

84
0:04:50.9,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:53.3,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The malls that are still open,

86
0:04:57.38,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they always do this weird thing -- like the dead malls.

87
0:05:00.02,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They'll have three stores left,

88
0:05:01.58,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but they try to spruce it up

89
0:05:03.62,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to make it appear like things are on the up-and-up.

90
0:05:06.98,000 --> 0:05:07,000
For example,

91
0:05:08.86,000 --> 0:05:1,000
you'll have an empty store

92
0:05:10.9,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and they bring the gate down.

93
0:05:12.7,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So at Owings Mills, for example, they put this tarp over the gate.

94
0:05:16.9,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Right?

95
0:05:18.18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And it's got a stock photo

96
0:05:21.78,000 --> 0:05:23,000
of a woman who is so happy

97
0:05:24.46,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and she's holding a blouse,

98
0:05:26.1,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and she's like --

99
0:05:27.34,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:30.94,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And then there's a guy standing next to her, with, like,

101
0:05:33.62,000 --> 0:05:35,000
an espresso cup, and he's like --

102
0:05:35.9,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:38.7,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And it says, "What brings you today?"

104
0:05:43.06,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:44.38,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I wanted to be scared and depressed.

106
0:05:47.58,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Thank you.

107
0:05:51.78,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So the comments just kept pouring in

108
0:05:56.18,000 --> 0:05:57,000
on the videos,

109
0:05:58.14,000 --> 0:06:01,000
from all over the country, and then all over the world.

110
0:06:02.82,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And I started to think, this could really be something,

111
0:06:05.46,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but I had to get creative, because I'm like,

112
0:06:07.78,000 --> 0:06:12,000
how long are people going to sit and watch me waddling through an empty mall?

113
0:06:13.62,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter)

114
0:06:17.22,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So the original episodes I filmed with an iPhone.

115
0:06:21.5,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So I'd walk through the mall with an iPhone, and, you know.

116
0:06:25.78,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Like that.

117
0:06:27.02,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:28.5,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And security -- because malls, they don't like photography --

119
0:06:32.34,000 --> 0:06:35,000
so the security would come up and be like, "Put that away," and I'm like, "OK."

120
0:06:36.1,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So I had to get creative and sneaky,

121
0:06:38.46,000 --> 0:06:41,000
so I started using a hidden camera and different techniques

122
0:06:42.06,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to get the footage that I needed,

123
0:06:43.7,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and basically what I wanted to do

124
0:06:45.86,000 --> 0:06:47,000
was make the video

125
0:06:48.1,000 --> 0:06:5,000
like it was a first-person experience,

126
0:06:50.46,000 --> 0:06:53,000
like you are sitting --

127
0:06:54.42,000 --> 0:06:56,000
put your headphones on watching the screen --

128
0:06:56.58,000 --> 0:06:57,000
it's like, you're there in the video,

129
0:06:58.5,000 --> 0:06:59,000
like a video game, basically.

130
0:07:02.34,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I also started to use music,

131
0:07:04.82,000 --> 0:07:07,000
collaborating with artists who create music called vaporwave.

132
0:07:08.1,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And vaporwave is a music genre

133
0:07:11.06,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that emerged in the early 2010s among internet communities.

134
0:07:15.06,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Here's an example.

135
0:07:16.38,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Music)

136
0:07:48.66,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's by an artist named Disconscious

137
0:07:51.82,000 --> 0:07:53,000
from an album he did called "Hologram Plaza."

138
0:07:54.02,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So if you look that up, you can hear more of those tunes.

139
0:07:57.7,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Vaporwave is more than an art form. It's like a movement.

140
0:08:01.54,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's nihilistic, it's angsty,

141
0:08:04.5,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but it's somehow comforting.

142
0:08:06.7,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The whole aesthetic is a way of dealing with things you can't do anything about,

143
0:08:11.94,000 --> 0:08:16,000
like no jobs, or sitting in your parents' basement eating ramen noodles.

144
0:08:17.1,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Vaporwave came out of this generation's desire to express their hopelessness,

145
0:08:21.3,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the same way that the pre-internet generation did

146
0:08:25.06,000 --> 0:08:27,000
sitting around in the food court.

147
0:08:29.1,000 --> 0:08:3,000
One of my favorite malls

148
0:08:32.58,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I've been to

149
0:08:34.66,000 --> 0:08:37,000
is in Corpus Christi, and it's called the Sunrise Mall.

150
0:08:38.46,000 --> 0:08:39,000
When I was a kid,

151
0:08:40.3,000 --> 0:08:42,000
my favorite thing to do was watch movies,

152
0:08:42.38,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and I used to watch movies over and over and over again.

153
0:08:45.34,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And one of my favorite films was "The Legend of Billie Jean."

154
0:08:51.18,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Now, for those of you who have seen "The Legend of Billie Jean,"

155
0:08:54.22,000 --> 0:08:57,000
you'll know that it's a great film.

156
0:08:57.58,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I love it.

157
0:08:58.82,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And Helen Slater and Christian Slater --

158
0:09:00.749,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and if you didn't know, they are not related.

159
0:09:02.9,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Many people thought that they were brother and sister. They're not.

160
0:09:06.1,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But anyway, Sunrise Mall was used in the film as a filming location.

161
0:09:09.5,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The mall is exactly the same as it was in 1984.

162
0:09:15.06,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We're talking 32 years later. Let me show you.

163
0:09:17.82,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean running across the fountain,

164
0:09:22.34,000 --> 0:09:24,000
being chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends.

165
0:09:26.66,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And she jumps over here.

166
0:09:31.18,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And you can see the shot right here is what it looks like today.

167
0:09:37.58,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It's pretty incredible.

168
0:09:38.86,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I mean, honestly, it's exactly the same.

169
0:09:43.22,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And there they are falling in the fountain,

170
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and she runs up the stairs.

171
0:09:46.62,000 --> 0:09:49,000
This is a nice shot of the whole thing here.

172
0:09:53.369,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Dan Bell: I love that so much.

173
0:09:55.06,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I always think in my head, if I owned a dead mall --

175
0:10:01.58,000 --> 0:10:03,000
why don't they embrace their vintage look?

176
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Put in a bar,

177
0:10:06.66,000 --> 0:10:11,000
like, put vegan food in the food court

178
0:10:11.78,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and invite millennials and hipsters

179
0:10:14.9,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to come and drink and eat,

180
0:10:17.7,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and I guarantee you within three weeks

181
0:10:19.66,000 --> 0:10:23,000
H&M and Levi's will be banging on the door trying to get space.

182
0:10:23.82,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I don't know why they don't do this,

183
0:10:25.58,000 --> 0:10:26,000
but apparently,

184
0:10:26.98,000 --> 0:10:29,000
it's only in my mind, it goes all day.

185
0:10:30.46,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

186
0:10:33.9,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Anyway, in closing --

187
0:10:35.14,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Laughter)

188
0:10:39.18,000 --> 0:10:41,000
When they first asked me to do this talk,

189
0:10:42.46,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I said,

190
0:10:44.46,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"Do you have the right person?"

191
0:10:45.98,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

192
0:10:50.9,000 --> 0:10:53,000
These talks are supposed to be kind of inspiring and --

193
0:10:54.14,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

194
0:11:00.3,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I remembered something, though.

195
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I put my camera down three or four years ago,

196
0:11:08.5,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and it took going to these malls

197
0:11:12.3,000 --> 0:11:13,000
for me to be inspired again.

198
0:11:15.9,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And to see my audience

199
0:11:19.14,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and people from all over the world writing me and saying,

200
0:11:22.06,000 --> 0:11:24,000
"God, I love your videos,"

201
0:11:24.3,000 --> 0:11:25,000
is incredible.

202
0:11:27.02,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I don't know how to even explain it,

203
0:11:28.82,000 --> 0:11:29,000
as an artist,

204
0:11:30.22,000 --> 0:11:31,000
how fulfilling that is.

205
0:11:32.14,000 --> 0:11:34,000
If you would have told me a year ago

206
0:11:35.42,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that I would be standing on this stage

207
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
talking to all of you wonderful people,

208
0:11:41.18,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I would have never believed it.

209
0:11:42.7,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I am humbled

210
0:11:44.14,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and so appreciative.

211
0:11:45.98,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Thank you very much.

212
0:11:47.22,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it,

2
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the problems and the opportunities that we face,

3
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.

4
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist.

5
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before.

6
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now, you've all seen "Inconvenient Truth." This is a little more inconvenient.

7
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Video): Man: ... extremely dangerous questions.

8
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Because, with our present knowledge, we have no idea what would happen.

9
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Even now, man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate

10
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
through the waste products of his civilization.

11
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Due to our release, through factories and automobiles every year,

12
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide --

13
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which helps air absorb heat from the sun --

14
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer.

15
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This is bad?

16
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would

17
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
melt the polar ice caps.

18
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley.

19
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami

20
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
through 150 feet of tropical water.

21
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
For, in weather, we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety

22
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
than even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself.

23
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Larry Brilliant: Should we feel good, or should we feel bad

24
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little?

25
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Well, it depends, really, on what your goals are.

26
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I think, as my goals, I always go back to Gandhi's talisman.

27
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
When Mahatma Gandhi was asked,

28
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one

29
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or the wrong one?" he said, "Consider the face of the poorest,

30
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon,

31
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person.

32
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And if it will be, it's the right thing to do, and if not, rethink it."

33
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
For those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual,

34
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself.

35
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society,

36
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
who are the poorest and the most vulnerable,

37
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism.

38
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But there's also a wonderful case for optimism.

39
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Let's review them both. First of all, the megatrends.

40
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
There's two degrees, or three degrees of climate change baked into the system.

41
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands.

42
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable,

43
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
as will the increasing rise of population.

44
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Even though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb,

45
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and we will not see 20 billion people in this decade, as he had forecast,

46
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
we eat as if we were 20 billion.

47
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And we consume so much that again, a rise of 6.5 billion to 9.5 billion

48
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt

49
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the poorest and the most vulnerable.

50
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That's why they migrate to cities.

51
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That's why in June of this year, we passed, as a species, 51 percent of us living in cities,

52
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and bustees, and slums, and shantytowns.

53
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.

54
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The green revolution never reached Africa.

55
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And with desertification, sandstorms, the Gobi Desert, the Ogaden,

56
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare

57
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago.

58
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So humans are turning more towards animal consumption.

59
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
In Africa last year, Africans ate 600 million wild animals,

60
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat.

61
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses

62
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that have never been charted, the genomic sequences of which we don't know.

63
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of,

64
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases.

65
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.

66
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side

67
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
-- in bioweapons, and in technology that puts us on a collision course

68
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to magnify any anger, hatred or feeling of marginalization.

69
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And in fact, with increasing globalization --

70
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
for which there are big winners and even bigger losers

71
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
-- today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history.

72
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
One percent of us own 40 percent of all the goods and services.

73
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day

74
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
rise to three billion in the next 30 years?

75
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world's goods

76
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and services. Not because they've grown richer,

77
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer.

78
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Last week, Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said,

79
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
"This situation is unprecedented, unequal, unfair and unstable."

80
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So there's lots of reason for pessimism.

81
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Darfur is, at its origin, a resource war.

82
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Last year, there were 85,000 riots in China,

83
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
230 a day, that required police or military intervention.

84
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Most of them were about resources.

85
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We are facing an unprecedented number, scale of disasters.

86
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Some are weather-related, human-rights related, epidemics.

87
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu

88
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
a quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world.

89
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And unlike destabilized world in the past, it will be broadcast to you on YouTube,

90
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones.

91
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
What will that lead to?

92
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
For some, it will lead to anger, religious and sectarian violence and terrorism.

93
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
For others, withdrawal, nihilism, materialism.

94
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
For us, where does it take us, as social activists and entrepreneurs?

95
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
As we look at these trends, do we become despondent, or will we become energized?

96
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Let's look at one case, the case of Bangladesh.

97
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
First, even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today,

98
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
global warming would continue.

99
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines,

100
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today,

101
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the next decades will see rising sea levels.

102
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case

103
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that we can hope for, and it could be 10 times that.

104
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What will that do to Bangladesh? Let's take a look.

105
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So here's Bangladesh.

106
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level.

107
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas.

108
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And we'll watch as global warming makes them melt. More water comes down,

109
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the deforested areas, here in the Tarai, will be unable to absorb the effluent,

110
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water.

111
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now we're looking down south, through the Kali Gandaki.

112
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Many of you, I think, have probably trekked here.

113
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh

114
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water

115
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
coming from the north, and in the seas rising from the south.

116
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh.

117
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And now let's look from the south, looking up, and let's see this in relief.

118
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
A minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas,

119
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this.

120
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
As many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate

121
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
into India and into China.

122
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This is the difficulty that one country faces.

123
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But if you look at the globe, all around the earth, wherever there is low-lying area,

124
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
populated areas near the water,

125
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life.

126
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Sub-Saharan Africa, and even our own San Francisco Bay Area.

127
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We're all in this together.

128
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
This is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know.

129
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Global warming is something that happens to all of us, all at once.

130
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
As are these newly emerging communicable diseases,

131
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
names that you hadn't heard 20 years ago: ebola, lhasa fever, monkey pox.

132
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans,

133
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
we live in each other's viral environment.

134
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Do you remember, 20 years ago, no one had ever heard of West Nile fever?

135
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States

136
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and it marched every year, westwardly.

137
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Do you remember no one had heard of ebola

138
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it?

139
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's just the beginning, unfortunately.

140
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
There have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases

141
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years.

142
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's more than enough reason for pessimism.

143
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But now let's look at the case for optimism. (Laughter)

144
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Enough of the bad news. Human beings have always risen to the challenge.

145
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves.

146
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We've been here before, paralyzed by fear, paralyzed into inaction,

147
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
when some -- probably one of you in this room -- jumped into the breach

148
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility,

149
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
which fought against the nuclear threat,

150
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Medicins Sans Frontieres, that renewed our commitment to disaster relief,

151
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Mohamed ElBaradei, and the tremendous hope and optimism that he

152
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
brought all of us, and our own Muhammad Yunus.

153
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We've seen the eradication of smallpox.

154
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We may see the eradication of polio this year.

155
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Last year, there were only 2,000 cases in the world.

156
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year --

157
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
there are only 35,000 cases left in the world.

158
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
20 years ago, there were three and a half million.

159
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And we've seen a new disease, not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases.

160
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome. (Laughter)

161
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It's an amazing phenomenon.

162
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
All throughout the technology world, we're seeing young people bitten by this

163
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
disease of sudden wealth syndrome.

164
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
But they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did.

165
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They're not waiting until they die to create foundations.

166
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
They're actively guiding their money, their resources, their hearts, their commitments,

167
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to make the world a better place.

168
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Certainly, nothing can give you more optimism than that.

169
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
More reasons to be optimistic:

170
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
in the '60s, and I am a creature of the '60s, there was a movement.

171
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We all felt that we were part of it, that a better world was right around the corner,

172
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice.

173
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Today, there's another kind of movement. It's a movement to save the earth.

174
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
It's just beginning.

175
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Five weeks ago, a group of activists from the business community gathered together

176
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal-fired electrical plants

177
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that would have contributed to destroying the environment.

178
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Six months ago, a group of business activists gathered together to join with the

179
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Republican governor in California to pass AB 32,

180
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
the most far-reaching legislation in environmental history.

181
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness.

182
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Can you imagine? (Laughter)

183
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago

184
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I would not have believed, as the evangelical community

185
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
has understood the desperate situation of global warming.

186
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement.

187
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It is something to be greatly optimistic about.

188
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
The European 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough,

189
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon.

190
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
And on April 14th, there will be Step Up Day, where there will be a thousand

191
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest

192
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming.

193
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And on July 7th, around the world, I learned only yesterday,

194
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
there will be global Live Earth concerts.

195
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air.

196
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Now, that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming

197
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
hurts the poorest and the weakest the most.

198
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
That means that people are beginning the first step,

199
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
which is acting out of their own self-interest.

200
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
But I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller,

201
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys, Google,

202
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
so many other organizations, a beginning of understanding that we need

203
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
to work not just on primary prevention of global warming,

204
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming

205
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
on the poorest and the most vulnerable.

206
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
But for me, I have another reason to be an incurable optimist.

207
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And you've heard so many inspiring stories here, and I heard so many last night

208
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
that I thought I would share a little bit of mine.

209
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
My background is not exactly conventional medical training.

210
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And I lived in a Himalayan monastery, and I studied with a very wise teacher,

211
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny --

212
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
it felt like Yoda -- it is your destiny to go to work for WHO

213
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and to help eradicate smallpox,

214
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
at a time when there was no smallpox program.

215
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists

216
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
because it was the worst disease in history.

217
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
In the last century -- that's the one that was seven years ago --

218
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
half a billion people died from smallpox:

219
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
more than all the wars in history,

220
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world.

221
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
In the Summer of Love, in 1967, two million people, children, died of smallpox.

222
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
It's not ancient history.

223
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
When you read the biblical plague of boils, that was smallpox.

224
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth, whose picture is here, died of smallpox.

225
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
To eradicate smallpox, we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history.

226
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
We visited every house in India, searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses,

227
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
once every month, for nearly two years.

228
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
In a cruel reversal, after we had almost conquered smallpox --

229
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur, the realm of the final inch.

230
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
When we had almost eradicated smallpox, it came back again,

231
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers,

232
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
who could come there and get employment.

233
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox,

234
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
and they went home to die.

235
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And when they did, they took smallpox to 10 other countries

236
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and reignited the epidemic.

237
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And we had to start all over again.

238
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
But, in the end, we succeeded, and the last case of smallpox:

239
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
this little girl, Rahima Banu -- Barisal, in Bangladesh --

240
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
when she coughed or breathed, and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs

241
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus,

242
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror.

243
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
How can that not make you optimistic?

244
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India, and blinded half of

245
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
all of those who were made blind in India, ended.

246
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
And most importantly for us here in this room, a bond was created.

247
0:20:25.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Doctors, health workers, from 30 different countries,

248
0:20:28.16,000 --> 0:20:33,000
of every race, every religion, every color, worked together,

249
0:20:33.16,000 --> 0:20:36,000
fought alongside each other,

250
0:20:36.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
fought against a common enemy, didn't fight against each other.

251
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future?

252
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:48,000
Thank you very much.

253
0:20:48.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
(Applause)

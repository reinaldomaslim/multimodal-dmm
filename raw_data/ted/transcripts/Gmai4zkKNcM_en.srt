1
0:00:12.273,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We are at a remarkable moment in time.

2
0:00:16.298,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We face over the next two decades

3
0:00:19.234,000 --> 0:00:21,000
two fundamental transformations

4
0:00:21.3,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that will determine whether the next 100 years

5
0:00:24.342,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries.

6
0:00:28.527,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Let me illustrate with an example.

7
0:00:31.249,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I first visited Beijing 25 years ago

8
0:00:34.523,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to teach at the People's University of China.

9
0:00:37.549,000 --> 0:00:39,000
China was getting serious about market economics

10
0:00:40.485,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and about university education,

11
0:00:42.824,000 --> 0:00:46,000
so they decided to call in the foreign experts.

12
0:00:47.315,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Like most other people,

13
0:00:48.92,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I moved around Beijing by bicycle.

14
0:00:51.736,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle,

15
0:00:53.93,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it was a safe and easy way to get around.

16
0:00:57.237,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Cycling in Beijing now

17
0:00:58.601,000 --> 0:01:,000
is a completely different prospect.

18
0:01:01.422,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The roads are jammed by cars and trucks.

19
0:01:04.565,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The air is dangerously polluted

20
0:01:06.364,000 --> 0:01:09,000
from the burning of coal and diesel.

21
0:01:09.976,000 --> 0:01:11,000
When I was there last in the spring,

22
0:01:12.114,000 --> 0:01:14,000
there was an advisory for people of my age —

23
0:01:14.892,000 --> 0:01:16,000
over 65 —

24
0:01:17.322,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to stay indoors and not move much.

25
0:01:20.191,000 --> 0:01:21,000
How did this come about?

26
0:01:22.125,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It came from the way in which

27
0:01:24.545,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Beijing has grown as a city.

28
0:01:26.81,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled,

29
0:01:29.27,000 --> 0:01:31,000
from 10 million to 20 million.

30
0:01:31.446,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It's become a sprawling urban area

31
0:01:33.139,000 --> 0:01:37,000
dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy,

32
0:01:37.498,000 --> 0:01:38,000
particularly coal.

33
0:01:39.321,000 --> 0:01:43,000
China burns half the world's coal each year,

34
0:01:43.596,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and that's why, it is a key reason why,

35
0:01:47.51,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it is the world's largest emitter

36
0:01:49.535,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of greenhouse gases.

37
0:01:52.449,000 --> 0:01:54,000
At the same time, we have to recognize

38
0:01:54.563,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that in that period China has grown remarkably.

39
0:01:57.747,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It has become the world's second largest economy.

40
0:02:00.188,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Hundreds of millions of people

41
0:02:01.657,000 --> 0:02:03,000
have been lifted out of poverty.

42
0:02:03.822,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That's really important.

43
0:02:05.903,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But at the same time, the people of China

44
0:02:08.22,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are asking the question:

45
0:02:09.82,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What's the value of this growth

46
0:02:11.4,000 --> 0:02:13,000
if our cities are unlivable?

47
0:02:13.525,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They've analyzed, diagnosed

48
0:02:15.837,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that this is an unsustainable path of growth

49
0:02:19.177,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and development.

50
0:02:21.303,000 --> 0:02:23,000
China's planning to scale back coal.

51
0:02:23.632,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's looking to build its cities in different ways.

52
0:02:29.493,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now, the growth of China

53
0:02:31.326,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change,

54
0:02:35.05,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in the structure of the world economy.

55
0:02:37.817,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Just 25 years ago, the developing countries,

56
0:02:40.539,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the poorer countries of the world,

57
0:02:42.429,000 --> 0:02:45,000
were, notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people,

58
0:02:46.355,000 --> 0:02:47,000
they accounted for only about a third

59
0:02:48.178,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of the world's output.

60
0:02:50.17,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now it's more than half;

61
0:02:51.914,000 --> 0:02:53,000
25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds

62
0:02:54.885,000 --> 0:02:57,000
from the countries that we saw 25 years ago

63
0:02:57.99,000 --> 0:02:58,000
as developing.

64
0:02:59.266,000 --> 0:03:,000
That's a remarkable change.

65
0:03:00.864,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It means that most countries around the world,

66
0:03:03.266,000 --> 0:03:05,000
rich or poor, are going to be facing

67
0:03:05.325,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the two fundamental transformations

68
0:03:07.305,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that I want to talk about and highlight.

69
0:03:10.49,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, the first of these transformations

70
0:03:12.503,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is the basic structural change

71
0:03:15.11,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of the economies and societies

72
0:03:16.85,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that I've already begun to illustrate

73
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:21,000
through the description of Beijing.

74
0:03:22.39,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Fifty percent now in urban areas.

75
0:03:25.349,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.

76
0:03:28.96,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Over the next two decades, we'll see

77
0:03:31.221,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the demand for energy rise by 40 percent,

78
0:03:34.134,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the growth in the economy and in the population

79
0:03:38.108,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is putting increasing pressure on our land,

80
0:03:41.09,000 --> 0:03:44,000
on our water and on our forests.

81
0:03:44.956,000 --> 0:03:47,000
This is profound structural change.

82
0:03:48.241,000 --> 0:03:49,000
If we manage it in a negligent

83
0:03:49.816,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or a shortsighted way,

84
0:03:52.435,000 --> 0:03:55,000
we will create waste, pollution, congestion,

85
0:03:56.301,000 --> 0:03:59,000
destruction of land and forests.

86
0:03:59.851,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated

87
0:04:02.179,000 --> 0:04:05,000
with my numbers — cities, energy, land —

88
0:04:05.902,000 --> 0:04:06,000
if we manage all that badly,

89
0:04:07.781,000 --> 0:04:09,000
then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods

90
0:04:09.862,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of the people around the world

91
0:04:11.673,000 --> 0:04:13,000
would be poor and damaged.

92
0:04:14.666,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And more than that,

93
0:04:16.488,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise,

94
0:04:19.796,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with immense risks to our climate.

95
0:04:23.677,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Concentrations of greenhouse gases

96
0:04:25.724,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in the atmosphere are already

97
0:04:28.642,000 --> 0:04:31,000
higher than they've been for millions of years.

98
0:04:32.276,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If we go on increasing those concentrations,

99
0:04:35.914,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we risk temperatures over the next century or so

100
0:04:39.288,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that we have not seen on this planet

101
0:04:40.905,000 --> 0:04:43,000
for tens of millions of years.

102
0:04:44.11,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We've been around as Homo sapiens —

103
0:04:46.236,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that's a rather generous definition, sapiens —

104
0:04:49.407,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for perhaps a quarter of a million years, a quarter of a million.

105
0:04:52.21,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We risk temperatures we haven't seen

106
0:04:53.441,000 --> 0:04:57,000
for tens of millions of years over a century.

107
0:04:58.18,000 --> 0:05:,000
That would transform the relationship

108
0:05:00.25,000 --> 0:05:04,000
between human beings and the planet.

109
0:05:04.479,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It would lead to changing deserts,

110
0:05:09.13,000 --> 0:05:12,000
changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,

111
0:05:12.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
changing sea levels,

112
0:05:13.558,000 --> 0:05:15,000
hundreds of millions of people,

113
0:05:16.201,000 --> 0:05:19,000
perhaps billions of people who would have to move,

114
0:05:19.43,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and if we've learned anything from history,

115
0:05:21.353,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that means severe and extended conflict.

116
0:05:23.665,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And we couldn't just turn it off.

117
0:05:25.543,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You can't make a peace treaty with the planet.

118
0:05:27.973,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You can't negotiate with the laws of physics.

119
0:05:30.2,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You're in there. You're stuck.

120
0:05:31.915,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Those are the stakes we're playing for,

121
0:05:33.591,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and that's why we have to make this second transformation,

122
0:05:36.313,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the climate transformation,

123
0:05:37.953,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and move to a low-carbon economy.

124
0:05:40.336,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now, the first of these transformations

125
0:05:42.714,000 --> 0:05:43,000
is going to happen anyway.

126
0:05:43.795,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We have to decide whether to do it well or badly,

127
0:05:45.644,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the economic, or structural, transformation.

128
0:05:48.462,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But the second of the transformations,

129
0:05:50.352,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the climate transformations, we have to decide to do.

130
0:05:54.466,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Those two transformations face us

131
0:05:56.685,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in the next two decades.

132
0:05:58.858,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The next two decades are decisive

133
0:06:02.071,000 --> 0:06:04,000
for what we have to do.

134
0:06:04.786,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now, the more I've thought about this,

135
0:06:06.305,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the two transformations coming together,

136
0:06:08.409,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the more I've come to realize

137
0:06:09.956,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that this is an enormous opportunity.

138
0:06:12.908,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It's an opportunity which we can use

139
0:06:15.135,000 --> 0:06:18,000
or it's an opportunity which we can lose.

140
0:06:18.532,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And let me explain through those three key areas

141
0:06:21.255,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that I've identified: cities, energy and land.

142
0:06:23.965,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And let me start with cities.

143
0:06:26.019,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I've already described the problems of Beijing:

144
0:06:30.052,000 --> 0:06:32,000
pollution, congestion, waste and so on.

145
0:06:32.898,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Surely we recognize that in many of our cities

146
0:06:36.588,000 --> 0:06:37,000
around the world.

147
0:06:37.847,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities,

148
0:06:40.772,000 --> 0:06:43,000
you have to think ahead.

149
0:06:43.836,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The cities that are going to be built —

150
0:06:45.25,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and there are many, and many big ones —

151
0:06:47.406,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we have to think of how to design them

152
0:06:48.87,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in a compact way

153
0:06:50.221,000 --> 0:06:53,000
so we can save travel time and we can save energy.

154
0:06:53.664,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The cities that already are there, well established,

155
0:06:57.579,000 --> 0:07:,000
we have to think about renewal and investment in them

156
0:07:00.65,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so that we can connect ourselves much better

157
0:07:03.428,000 --> 0:07:05,000
within those cities, and make it easier,

158
0:07:05.82,000 --> 0:07:08,000
encourage more people, to live closer to the center.

159
0:07:09.411,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We've got examples building around the world

160
0:07:11.821,000 --> 0:07:13,000
of the kinds of ways in which we can do that.

161
0:07:14.113,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia

162
0:07:18.131,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is a very important case of how to move around

163
0:07:20.763,000 --> 0:07:22,000
safely and quickly in a non-polluting way

164
0:07:23.333,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in a city: very frequent buses,

165
0:07:26.528,000 --> 0:07:28,000
strongly protected routes, the same service, really,

166
0:07:29.465,000 --> 0:07:31,000
as an underground railway system,

167
0:07:31.556,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but much, much cheaper

168
0:07:33.367,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and can be done much more quickly,

169
0:07:35.775,000 --> 0:07:36,000
a brilliant idea in many more cities

170
0:07:37.67,000 --> 0:07:39,000
around the world that's developing.

171
0:07:39.706,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, some things in cities do take time.

172
0:07:41.607,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly.

173
0:07:44.66,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Take my hometown, London.

174
0:07:46.764,000 --> 0:07:51,000
In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people

175
0:07:52.052,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and badly damaged the lives of many, many more.

176
0:07:54.746,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And it happened all the time.

177
0:07:56.096,000 --> 0:07:58,000
For those of you live outside London in the U.K.

178
0:07:58.598,000 --> 0:08:,000
will remember it used to be called The Smoke.

179
0:08:00.791,000 --> 0:08:01,000
That's the way London was.

180
0:08:02.467,000 --> 0:08:04,000
By regulating coal, within a few years

181
0:08:04.549,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the problems of smog were rapidly reduced.

182
0:08:07.637,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I remember the smogs well.

183
0:08:09.192,000 --> 0:08:11,000
When the visibility dropped to [less] than

184
0:08:11.915,000 --> 0:08:12,000
a few meters,

185
0:08:13.908,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they stopped the buses and I had to walk.

186
0:08:15.764,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This was the 1950s.

187
0:08:17.822,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I had to walk home three miles from school.

188
0:08:21.72,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Again, breathing was a hazardous activity.

189
0:08:25.289,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But it was changed. It was changed by a decision.

190
0:08:27.967,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Good decisions can bring good results,

191
0:08:31.136,000 --> 0:08:33,000
striking results, quickly.

192
0:08:33.501,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We've seen more: In London, we've introduced the congestion charge,

193
0:08:36.494,000 --> 0:08:38,000
actually quite quickly and effectively,

194
0:08:39.2,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and we've seen great improvements

195
0:08:40.82,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system.

196
0:08:44.782,000 --> 0:08:47,000
You can see that the two transformations I've described,

197
0:08:47.902,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the structural and the climate,

198
0:08:49.858,000 --> 0:08:51,000
come very much together.

199
0:08:52.49,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities,

200
0:08:55.423,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and we have to invest wisely, and if we do,

201
0:08:57.956,000 --> 0:09:01,000
we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,

202
0:09:02.492,000 --> 0:09:04,000
more attractive cities, more productive cities,

203
0:09:05.149,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and stronger community in those cities —

204
0:09:07.916,000 --> 0:09:09,000
public transport, recycling, reusing,

205
0:09:10.164,000 --> 0:09:14,000
all sorts of things that bring communities together.

206
0:09:14.213,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We can do that, but we have to think,

207
0:09:16.07,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we have to invest, we have to plan.

208
0:09:18.35,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Let me turn to energy.

209
0:09:20.521,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Now, energy over the last 25 years

210
0:09:23.743,000 --> 0:09:25,000
has increased by about 50 percent.

211
0:09:25.979,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.

212
0:09:28.596,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Over the next 20 years,

213
0:09:30.254,000 --> 0:09:33,000
perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.

214
0:09:34.03,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We have to invest strongly in energy,

215
0:09:36.564,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we have to use it much more efficiently,

216
0:09:39.838,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and we have to make it clean.

217
0:09:41.526,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We can see how to do that.

218
0:09:42.856,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Take the example of California.

219
0:09:44.76,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It would be in the top 10 countries in the world

220
0:09:47.37,000 --> 0:09:49,000
if it was independent.

221
0:09:49.913,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I don't want to start any —

222
0:09:52.478,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

223
0:09:55.976,000 --> 0:09:56,000
California's a big place.

224
0:09:57.821,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

225
0:09:59.869,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In the next five or six years,

226
0:10:02.61,000 --> 0:10:04,000
they will likely move from

227
0:10:05.324,000 --> 0:10:07,000
around 20 percent in renewables —

228
0:10:07.563,000 --> 0:10:08,000
wind, solar and so on —

229
0:10:09.32,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to over 33 percent,

230
0:10:11.793,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and that would bring California back

231
0:10:14.232,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020

232
0:10:16.765,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to where they were in 1990,

233
0:10:18.722,000 --> 0:10:19,000
a period when the economy in California

234
0:10:20.466,000 --> 0:10:21,000
would more or less have doubled.

235
0:10:21.898,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That's a striking achievement.

236
0:10:23.348,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It shows what can be done.

237
0:10:24.831,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Not just California — the incoming government of India

238
0:10:28.138,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is planning to get solar technology

239
0:10:31.164,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to light up the homes

240
0:10:32.536,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of 400 million people

241
0:10:34.246,000 --> 0:10:36,000
who don't have electricity in India.

242
0:10:36.311,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They've set themselves a target of five years.

243
0:10:38.791,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I think they've got a good chance of doing that.

244
0:10:42.02,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We'll see, but what you're seeing now

245
0:10:44.679,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is people moving much more quickly.

246
0:10:46.99,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Four hundred million, more than the population

247
0:10:48.724,000 --> 0:10:5,000
of the United States.

248
0:10:50.85,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Those are the kinds of ambitions now

249
0:10:52.943,000 --> 0:10:53,000
people are setting themselves

250
0:10:54.649,000 --> 0:10:58,000
in terms of rapidity of change.

251
0:10:59.129,000 --> 0:11:,000
Again, you can see

252
0:11:01.099,000 --> 0:11:02,000
good decisions can bring quick results,

253
0:11:02.88,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and those two transformations, the economy and the structure

254
0:11:05.913,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and the climate and the low carbon,

255
0:11:07.904,000 --> 0:11:09,000
are intimately intertwined.

256
0:11:10.447,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Do the first one well, the structural,

257
0:11:12.269,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the second one on the climate

258
0:11:14.25,000 --> 0:11:17,000
becomes much easier.

259
0:11:17.432,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Look at land,

260
0:11:19.221,000 --> 0:11:21,000
land and particularly forests.

261
0:11:21.809,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Forests are the hosts to valuable

262
0:11:24.869,000 --> 0:11:26,000
plant and animal species.

263
0:11:27.398,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They hold water in the soil

264
0:11:29.746,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,

265
0:11:32.664,000 --> 0:11:35,000
fundamental to the tackling of climate change.

266
0:11:35.733,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But we're losing our forests.

267
0:11:37.965,000 --> 0:11:39,000
In the last decade, we've lost a forest area

268
0:11:40.792,000 --> 0:11:42,000
the size of Portugal,

269
0:11:42.935,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and much more has been degraded.

270
0:11:45.398,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But we're already seeing

271
0:11:47.153,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that we can do so much about that.

272
0:11:49.56,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We can recognize the problem, but we can also

273
0:11:51.597,000 --> 0:11:53,000
understand how to tackle it.

274
0:11:53.711,000 --> 0:11:55,000
In Brazil, the rate of deforestation

275
0:11:56.366,000 --> 0:11:58,000
has been reduced by 70 percent

276
0:11:58.383,000 --> 0:12:,000
over the last 10 years.

277
0:12:00.945,000 --> 0:12:02,000
How? By involving local communities,

278
0:12:03.93,000 --> 0:12:05,000
investing in their agriculture and their economies,

279
0:12:06.751,000 --> 0:12:08,000
by monitoring more carefully,

280
0:12:08.851,000 --> 0:12:11,000
by enforcing the law more strictly.

281
0:12:12.496,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And it's not just stopping deforestation.

282
0:12:14.386,000 --> 0:12:16,000
That's of course of first and fundamental importance,

283
0:12:16.827,000 --> 0:12:19,000
but it's also regrading degraded land,

284
0:12:20.449,000 --> 0:12:24,000
regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.

285
0:12:24.849,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I first went to Ethiopia in 1967.

286
0:12:28.729,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It was desperately poor. In the following years,

287
0:12:31.204,000 --> 0:12:32,000
it suffered devastating famines

288
0:12:32.95,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and profoundly destructive social conflict.

289
0:12:36.806,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Over the last few years, actually more than a few,

290
0:12:39.64,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.

291
0:12:42.565,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It has ambitions to be a middle-income country

292
0:12:44.455,000 --> 0:12:46,000
15 years from now

293
0:12:46.96,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and to be carbon neutral.

294
0:12:49.203,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Again, I think it's a strong ambition

295
0:12:52.251,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but it is a plausible one.

296
0:12:54.546,000 --> 0:12:55,000
You're seeing that commitment there.

297
0:12:55.957,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You're seeing what can be done.

298
0:12:57.223,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Ethiopia is investing in clean energy.

299
0:12:59.788,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's working in the rehabilitation of land.

300
0:13:03.41,000 --> 0:13:05,000
In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia,

301
0:13:05.84,000 --> 0:13:06,000
a wonderful project

302
0:13:07.257,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to plant trees on degraded land

303
0:13:09.44,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and work with local communities

304
0:13:11.06,000 --> 0:13:13,000
on sustainable forest management

305
0:13:13.509,000 --> 0:13:16,000
has led to big increases in living standards.

306
0:13:16.55,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So we can see, from Beijing to London,

307
0:13:20.414,000 --> 0:13:22,000
from California to India,

308
0:13:22.703,000 --> 0:13:25,000
from Brazil to Ethiopia,

309
0:13:25.83,000 --> 0:13:26,000
we do understand

310
0:13:27.439,000 --> 0:13:29,000
how to manage those two transformations,

311
0:13:29.644,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the structural and the climate.

312
0:13:31.573,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We do understand how to manage those well.

313
0:13:35.752,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And technology is changing very rapidly.

314
0:13:38.53,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I don't have to list all those things

315
0:13:40.937,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to an audience like this,

316
0:13:42.828,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but you can see the electric cars,

317
0:13:45.122,000 --> 0:13:48,000
you can see the batteries using new materials.

318
0:13:48.206,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You can see that we can manage remotely now

319
0:13:50.601,000 --> 0:13:53,000
our household appliances on our mobile phones when we're away.

320
0:13:54.156,000 --> 0:13:55,000
You can see better insulation.

321
0:13:55.963,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And there's much more coming.

322
0:13:57.886,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But, and it's a big but,

323
0:14:00.283,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the world as a whole

324
0:14:01.892,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is moving far too slowly.

325
0:14:04.67,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We're not cutting emissions in the way we should.

326
0:14:07.212,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We're not managing those structural transformations

327
0:14:09.923,000 --> 0:14:11,000
as we can.

328
0:14:12.152,000 --> 0:14:15,000
The depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change

329
0:14:15.391,000 --> 0:14:18,000
are not there yet.

330
0:14:18.97,000 --> 0:14:2,000
The depth of understanding

331
0:14:21.101,000 --> 0:14:23,000
of the attractiveness of what we can do

332
0:14:23.586,000 --> 0:14:26,000
is not there yet.

333
0:14:27.25,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We need political pressure to build.

334
0:14:30.748,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We need leaders to step up.

335
0:14:34.28,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We can have better growth,

336
0:14:37.779,000 --> 0:14:41,000
better climate, a better world.

337
0:14:41.986,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We can make,

338
0:14:43.798,000 --> 0:14:45,000
by managing those two transformations well,

339
0:14:46.578,000 --> 0:14:5,000
the next 100 years the best of centuries.

340
0:14:50.866,000 --> 0:14:51,000
If we make a mess of it,

341
0:14:52.093,000 --> 0:14:55,000
we, you and me, if we make a mess of it,

342
0:14:55.24,000 --> 0:14:57,000
if we don't manage those transformations properly,

343
0:14:57.713,000 --> 0:14:59,000
it will be, the next 100 years

344
0:15:00.604,000 --> 0:15:02,000
will be the worst of centuries.

345
0:15:03.335,000 --> 0:15:04,000
That's the major conclusion

346
0:15:05.227,000 --> 0:15:08,000
of the report on the economy and climate

347
0:15:08.358,000 --> 0:15:11,000
chaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico,

348
0:15:12.227,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and I co-chaired that with him,

349
0:15:14.407,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and we handed that report yesterday

350
0:15:16.36,000 --> 0:15:18,000
here in New York, in the United Nations Building

351
0:15:19.35,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to the Secretary-General of the U.N.,

352
0:15:20.822,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Ban Ki-moon.

353
0:15:22.088,000 --> 0:15:26,000
We know that we can do this.

354
0:15:26.193,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Now, two weeks ago,

355
0:15:29.575,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I became a grandfather for the fourth time.

356
0:15:32.975,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Our daughter —

357
0:15:35.107,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) —

358
0:15:45.71,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York

359
0:15:48.621,000 --> 0:15:51,000
two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa.

360
0:15:51.626,000 --> 0:15:55,000
(Applause)

361
0:15:58.87,000 --> 0:16:,000
Two weeks old.

362
0:16:01.838,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye

363
0:16:07.525,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and tell them that we understood the issues,

364
0:16:11.272,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities,

365
0:16:14.59,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and still we failed to act?

366
0:16:18.831,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Surely not. Let's make the next 100 years

367
0:16:22.31,000 --> 0:16:23,000
the best of centuries.

368
0:16:24.116,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Applause)

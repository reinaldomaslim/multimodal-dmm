1
0:00:13.4,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello.

2
0:00:14.64,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My name is Matthew Williams,

3
0:00:16.6,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I am a champion.

4
0:00:19.52,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I have won medals in three different sports

5
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and national games in Canada,

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
competed at the international level in basketball

7
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and was proud to represent Canada

8
0:00:31.76,000 --> 0:00:32,000
on the world stage.

9
0:00:33.4,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Applause)

10
0:00:39.04,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating,

11
0:00:43.28,000 --> 0:00:45,000
work with top quality coaches

12
0:00:45.68,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and mental performance consultants

13
0:00:48.2,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to be at my best in my sport.

14
0:00:52.64,000 --> 0:00:55,000
By the way, all that is through Special Olympics.

15
0:00:56.6,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Does that change the way you think of me

16
0:00:58.92,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and my accomplishments?

17
0:01:03.24,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The world does not see all people like me as champions.

18
0:01:07.72,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Not long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away.

19
0:01:14.24,000 --> 0:01:19,000
There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968,

20
0:01:19.4,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but in too many cases,

21
0:01:21.56,000 --> 0:01:23,000
people with intellectual disabilities

22
0:01:24.4,000 --> 0:01:27,000
are invisible to the wider population.

23
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:33,000
People use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.

24
0:01:35.12,000 --> 0:01:38,000
That's the word "retard" or "retarded"

25
0:01:38.2,000 --> 0:01:4,000
used in a derogatory manner.

26
0:01:41.4,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.

27
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case.

28
0:01:51.88,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way

29
0:01:55.92,000 --> 0:02:,000
many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities,

30
0:02:01.68,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or, too often,

31
0:02:03.28,000 --> 0:02:04,000
how they don't see them at all.

32
0:02:06.48,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Did you know the World Games happened this year?

33
0:02:10.2,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities

34
0:02:16.12,000 --> 0:02:2,000
from 165 countries who competed in LA.

35
0:02:20.96,000 --> 0:02:25,000
There was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies,

36
0:02:26.28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN.

37
0:02:31.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Did you even know that happened?

38
0:02:35.6,000 --> 0:02:37,000
What do you think of when you see someone like me?

39
0:02:39.76,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I am here today to challenge you

40
0:02:42.56,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to look at us as equals.

41
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes

42
0:02:51.36,000 --> 0:02:53,000
with intellectual disabilities

43
0:02:53.76,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the perceptions of everyone watching.

44
0:02:58.2,000 --> 0:03:,000
For those of you who aren't familiar,

45
0:03:00.32,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.

46
0:03:06.8,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics.

47
0:03:12.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We offer high-quality, year round sports programs

48
0:03:16.08,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for people with intellectual disabilities

49
0:03:19.28,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that changes lives and perceptions.

50
0:03:24.44,000 --> 0:03:26,000
This movement has changed my life

51
0:03:27.08,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and those of so many others.

52
0:03:29.8,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And it has changed the way

53
0:03:31.72,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.

54
0:03:37.48,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.

55
0:03:43.28,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.

56
0:03:48.88,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The older I got, the more I felt

57
0:03:51.6,000 --> 0:03:54,000
it was harder to keep up with everyone else,

58
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I was angry and frustrated.

59
0:03:59.8,000 --> 0:04:02,000
For a while, I did not play any sports,

60
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:04,000
didn't have many friends

61
0:04:05.24,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and felt left out and sad.

62
0:04:10.08,000 --> 0:04:14,000
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities

63
0:04:14.52,000 --> 0:04:16,000
were hidden away from society.

64
0:04:18.88,000 --> 0:04:21,000
No one thought they could participate in sports,

65
0:04:22.08,000 --> 0:04:25,000
let alone be a valued member of society.

66
0:04:26.88,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden,

67
0:04:30.64,000 --> 0:04:33,000
a scientist at the University of Toronto,

68
0:04:33.959,000 --> 0:04:36,000
was studying the effects of regular exercise

69
0:04:37.64,000 --> 0:04:42,000
on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities.

70
0:04:43.84,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Using rigorous scientific research,

71
0:04:47.12,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Dr. Hayden and other researchers

72
0:04:49.88,000 --> 0:04:5,000
came to the conclusion

73
0:04:51.8,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate

74
0:04:55.84,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that caused their fitness levels to suffer.

75
0:05:00.4,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities

76
0:05:04.8,000 --> 0:05:06,000
could benefit from fitness programs

77
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and sports competition opportunities.

78
0:05:11.88,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver,

79
0:05:16.88,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the founder of Special Olympics,

80
0:05:19.2,000 --> 0:05:2,000
persevered,

81
0:05:20.68,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right

82
0:05:24.12,000 --> 0:05:26,000
four and a half million times over.

83
0:05:27.68,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Applause)

84
0:05:33.36,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Before I joined Special Olympics,

85
0:05:35.6,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I was nervous

86
0:05:37.12,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because I was young, shy, not confident

87
0:05:41.36,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and didn't have many friends.

88
0:05:44.6,000 --> 0:05:47,000
When I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging,

89
0:05:48.32,000 --> 0:05:51,000
supportive, and let me be myself

90
0:05:51.64,000 --> 0:05:52,000
without being judged.

91
0:05:54.88,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now, I am a basketball player and speed skater

92
0:05:59.12,000 --> 0:06:02,000
who has competed at provincial, national games,

93
0:06:02.96,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA,

94
0:06:07.68,000 --> 0:06:1,000
where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team

95
0:06:11.52,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to compete at World Games.

96
0:06:13.96,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Applause)

97
0:06:21.76,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe,

98
0:06:26.2,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and I've heard so many similar stories.

99
0:06:29.84,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Being Special Olympics athletes

100
0:06:32.12,000 --> 0:06:34,000
restores our pride and dignity.

101
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs.

102
0:06:42.4,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Studies have shown that, on average,

103
0:06:45.44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
men with intellectual disabilities

104
0:06:48.12,000 --> 0:06:51,000
die 13 years younger than men without,

105
0:06:51.64,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and women with intellectual disabilities

106
0:06:54.6,000 --> 0:06:56,000
die 20 years younger than women without.

107
0:06:58.96,000 --> 0:07:,000
Special Olympics keeps us healthy

108
0:07:01.44,000 --> 0:07:02,000
by getting us active

109
0:07:03.24,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and participating in sport.

110
0:07:05.92,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Also, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.

111
0:07:12.84,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Special Olympics also provides free health screening

112
0:07:16.36,000 --> 0:07:2,000
for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor

113
0:07:20.88,000 --> 0:07:21,000
or accessing health care.

114
0:07:25.48,000 --> 0:07:27,000
At the 2015 World Summer Games,

115
0:07:28.24,000 --> 0:07:32,000
my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team.

116
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The day before our game,

117
0:07:35.84,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening,

118
0:07:41.52,000 --> 0:07:43,000
where seven of 10 members

119
0:07:43.88,000 --> 0:07:45,000
were given hearing aids for free

120
0:07:46.4,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and got to hear clearly for the first time.

121
0:07:50.4,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Applause)

122
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The change in them was amazing.

123
0:08:02.04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They were more excited, happy and confident,

124
0:08:06.24,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because their coach could vocally communicate with them.

125
0:08:09.64,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And they were emotional

126
0:08:11.44,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because they could hear the sounds of the basketball,

127
0:08:14.32,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the sounds of the whistle

128
0:08:16.32,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and the cheering fans in the stands --

129
0:08:19.12,000 --> 0:08:21,000
sounds that we take for granted.

130
0:08:23.64,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport.

131
0:08:28.96,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field.

132
0:08:34.68,000 --> 0:08:36,000
This year, research findings showed

133
0:08:37.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that nearly half of the adults in the US

134
0:08:40.6,000 --> 0:08:44,000
don't know a single person with an intellectual disability,

135
0:08:45.52,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and the 44 percent of Americans

136
0:08:48.08,000 --> 0:08:52,000
who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities

137
0:08:52.52,000 --> 0:08:56,000
are significantly less accepting and positive.

138
0:08:58.04,000 --> 0:09:,000
Then there's the r-word,

139
0:09:00.2,000 --> 0:09:03,000
proving that people with intellectual disabilities

140
0:09:03.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
are still invisible

141
0:09:05.32,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to far too many people.

142
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
People use it as a casual term or an insult.

143
0:09:12.56,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It was tweeted more than nine million times last year,

144
0:09:16.28,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and it is deeply hurtful

145
0:09:18.32,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet.

146
0:09:24.64,000 --> 0:09:26,000
People don't think it's insulting,

147
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but it is.

148
0:09:29.68,000 --> 0:09:34,000
As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote

149
0:09:35.08,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in an open letter to a political pundit

150
0:09:38.52,000 --> 0:09:4,000
who used the r-word as an insult,

151
0:09:42.08,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"Come join us someday at Special Olympics.

152
0:09:45.12,000 --> 0:09:48,000
See if you walk away with your heart unchanged."

153
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Applause)

154
0:09:59.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games,

155
0:10:03.96,000 --> 0:10:04,000
people lined up for hours

156
0:10:05.92,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to get into the final night of powerlifting competition.

157
0:10:09.96,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett,

158
0:10:14.36,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the Newfoundland Moose,

159
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
deadlifted 655 pounds

160
0:10:19.68,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and lifted 611 pounds in the squat --

161
0:10:23.96,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Applause)

162
0:10:31.28,000 --> 0:10:34,000
setting huge new records for Special Olympics.

163
0:10:36.12,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland --

164
0:10:40.92,000 --> 0:10:43,000
not just Special Olympics, all powerlifters.

165
0:10:45.92,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Jackie was a huge star in LA,

166
0:10:48.76,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts

167
0:10:53.36,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and were wowed by his performance.

168
0:10:57.48,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities

169
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:04,000
could do anything like that.

170
0:11:06.88,000 --> 0:11:12,000
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum

171
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games

172
0:11:17.68,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and cheer athletes from 165 countries

173
0:11:21.48,000 --> 0:11:22,000
around the world.

174
0:11:23.84,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Far from being hidden away,

175
0:11:26.08,000 --> 0:11:28,000
we were cheered and celebrated.

176
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Special Olympics teaches athletes

177
0:11:33.76,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to be confident and proud of themselves.

178
0:11:37.76,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Special Olympics teaches the world

179
0:11:40.2,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that people with intellectual disabilities

180
0:11:43.04,000 --> 0:11:45,000
deserve respect and inclusion.

181
0:11:46.36,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

182
0:11:54.52,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport,

183
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:11:59,000
great coaches,

184
0:12:00.56,000 --> 0:12:01,000
respect and dignity,

185
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:04,000
better health,

186
0:12:04.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.

187
0:12:08.2,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Applause)

188
0:12:15.32,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I am no longer hidden, bullied

189
0:12:18.32,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and I am here doing a TED Talk.

190
0:12:21.04,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Applause)

191
0:12:56.24,000 --> 0:13:,000
The world is a different place because of Special Olympics,

192
0:13:01.6,000 --> 0:13:02,000
but there is still farther to go.

193
0:13:04.32,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability,

194
0:13:08.44,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I hope you will see their ability.

195
0:13:11.48,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The next time someone uses the r-word near you,

196
0:13:14.64,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I hope you will tell them how much it hurts.

197
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.

198
0:13:23.6,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

199
0:13:27.24,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I would like to leave you with one final thought.

200
0:13:31.32,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Nelson Mandela said,

201
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
"Sports has the power to change the world."

202
0:13:37.04,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Special Olympics is changing the world

203
0:13:39.92,000 --> 0:13:42,000
by transforming four and a half million athletes

204
0:13:43.52,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and giving us a place to be confident,

205
0:13:46.32,000 --> 0:13:47,000
meet friends,

206
0:13:47.92,000 --> 0:13:48,000
not be judged

207
0:13:49.6,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and get to feel like and be champions.

208
0:13:53.4,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Thank you very much.

209
0:13:54.8,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Applause)

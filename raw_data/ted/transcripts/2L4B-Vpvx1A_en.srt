1
0:00:12.705,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So imagine, you're in the supermarket,

2
0:00:15.355,000 --> 0:00:16,000
you're buying some groceries,

3
0:00:16.936,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and you get given the option

4
0:00:18.561,000 --> 0:00:21,000
for a plastic or a paper shopping bag.

5
0:00:22.196,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Which one do you choose if you want to do

6
0:00:24.386,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the right thing by the environment?

7
0:00:26.802,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Most people do pick the paper.

8
0:00:28.683,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Okay, let's think of why.

9
0:00:29.911,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's brown to start with.

10
0:00:31.604,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Therefore, it must be good for the environment.

11
0:00:33.08,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's biodegradable. It's reusable.

12
0:00:35.598,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In some cases, it's recyclable.

13
0:00:37.548,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So when people are looking at the plastic bag,

14
0:00:40.342,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it's likely they're thinking of something like this,

15
0:00:43.272,000 --> 0:00:45,000
which we all know is absolutely terrible,

16
0:00:45.655,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and we should be avoiding at all expenses

17
0:00:47.871,000 --> 0:00:49,000
these kinds of environmental damages.

18
0:00:50.226,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But people are often not thinking

19
0:00:52.439,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of something like this,

20
0:00:54.457,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which is the other end of the spectrum.

21
0:00:57.035,000 --> 0:00:59,000
When we produce materials,

22
0:00:59.802,000 --> 0:01:,000
we need to extract them from the environment,

23
0:01:01.432,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts.

24
0:01:05.336,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You see, what happens is, when we need

25
0:01:07.512,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to make complex choices,

26
0:01:09.489,000 --> 0:01:11,000
us humans like really simple solutions,

27
0:01:11.91,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and so we often ask for simple solutions.

28
0:01:14.526,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And I work in design.

29
0:01:15.999,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I advise designers

30
0:01:17.51,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and innovators around sustainability,

31
0:01:19.775,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and everyone always says to me, "Oh Leyla,

32
0:01:21.329,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I just want the eco-materials."

33
0:01:23.251,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I say, "Well, that's very complex,

34
0:01:25.535,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and we'll have to spend four hours talking about

35
0:01:27.364,000 --> 0:01:28,000
what exactly an eco-material means,

36
0:01:29.279,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because everything at some point

37
0:01:31.199,000 --> 0:01:32,000
comes from nature,

38
0:01:33.144,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and it's how you use the material

39
0:01:35.239,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that dictates the environmental impact.

40
0:01:38.28,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So what happens is, we have to rely

41
0:01:40.069,000 --> 0:01:42,000
on some sort of intuitive framework

42
0:01:42.127,000 --> 0:01:43,000
when we make decisions.

43
0:01:43.702,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So I like to call that intuitive framework

44
0:01:46.032,000 --> 0:01:48,000
our environmental folklore.

45
0:01:48.627,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's either the little voice at the back of your head,

46
0:01:51.384,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or it's that gut feeling you get

47
0:01:53.656,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when you've done the right thing,

48
0:01:55.236,000 --> 0:01:56,000
so when you've picked the paper bag

49
0:01:56.784,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.

50
0:01:59.899,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And environmental folklore is a really important thing

51
0:02:02.858,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because we're trying to do the right thing.

52
0:02:05.306,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But how do we know if we're actually

53
0:02:07.65,000 --> 0:02:09,000
reducing the net environmental impacts

54
0:02:09.973,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that our actions as individuals and as professionals

55
0:02:13.314,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and as a society are actually having

56
0:02:15.482,000 --> 0:02:17,000
on the natural environment?

57
0:02:18.187,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So the thing about environmental folklore is

58
0:02:20.03,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it tends to be based on our experiences,

59
0:02:22.085,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the things we've heard from other people.

60
0:02:23.816,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It doesn't tend to be based on any scientific framework.

61
0:02:26.456,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And this is really hard, because we live

62
0:02:28.123,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in incredibly complex systems.

63
0:02:30.143,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We have the human systems

64
0:02:31.863,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of how we communicate and interrelate

65
0:02:33.629,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and have our whole constructed society,

66
0:02:36.144,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We have the industrial systems, which is essentially the entire economy,

67
0:02:40.037,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and then all of that has to operate

68
0:02:41.89,000 --> 0:02:42,000
within the biggest system,

69
0:02:43.415,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and, I would argue, the most important,

70
0:02:45.507,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the ecosystem.

71
0:02:47.163,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And you see, the choices that we make

72
0:02:49.025,000 --> 0:02:5,000
as an individual,

73
0:02:50.458,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but the choices that we make

74
0:02:51.769,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in every single job that we have,

75
0:02:53.928,000 --> 0:02:55,000
no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order,

76
0:02:56.548,000 --> 0:02:59,000
has an impact on all of these systems.

77
0:02:59.599,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the thing is that we have to find ways

78
0:03:01.934,000 --> 0:03:02,000
if we're actually going to address sustainability

79
0:03:03.873,000 --> 0:03:06,000
of interlocking those complex systems

80
0:03:07.021,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and making better choices that result

81
0:03:09.965,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in net environmental gains.

82
0:03:12.549,000 --> 0:03:13,000
What we need to do is we need to learn

83
0:03:14.197,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to do more with less.

84
0:03:16.273,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We have an increasing population,

85
0:03:18.164,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and everybody likes their mobile phones,

86
0:03:19.998,000 --> 0:03:21,000
especially in this situation here.

87
0:03:22.113,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face.

88
0:03:26.168,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And that's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in.

89
0:03:29.366,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So essentially, everything that is created

90
0:03:32.053,000 --> 0:03:34,000
goes through a series of life cycle stages,

91
0:03:34.564,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and we use this scientific process

92
0:03:36.426,000 --> 0:03:37,000
called life cycle assessment,

93
0:03:38.15,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,

94
0:03:40.891,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in order to have a clearer picture of how

95
0:03:44.438,000 --> 0:03:47,000
everything that we do in the technical part of those systems

96
0:03:48.244,000 --> 0:03:49,000
affects the natural environment.

97
0:03:50.025,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So we go all the way back

98
0:03:51.995,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to the extraction of raw materials,

99
0:03:54.198,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and then we look at manufacturing,

100
0:03:56.015,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we look at packaging and transportation,

101
0:03:57.874,000 --> 0:03:58,000
use, and end of life,

102
0:03:59.524,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and at every single one of these stages,

103
0:04:02.441,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the things that we do

104
0:04:03.96,000 --> 0:04:04,000
have an interaction with the natural environment,

105
0:04:05.791,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and we can monitor how that interaction

106
0:04:08.279,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is actually affecting the systems and services

107
0:04:12.009,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that make life on Earth possible.

108
0:04:13.924,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And through doing this,

109
0:04:15.56,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we've learned some absolutely fascinating things.

110
0:04:19.85,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And we've busted a bunch of myths.

111
0:04:21.563,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.

112
0:04:26.551,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's used a lot in marketing,

113
0:04:28.284,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation

114
0:04:30.284,000 --> 0:04:31,000
when we're talking about sustainability,

115
0:04:32.217,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and that's the word biodegradability.

116
0:04:34.663,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now biodegradability is a material property;

117
0:04:39.611,000 --> 0:04:42,000
it is not a definition of environmental benefits.

118
0:04:42.859,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Allow me to explain.

119
0:04:44.762,000 --> 0:04:45,000
When something natural,

120
0:04:46.454,000 --> 0:04:47,000
something that's made from a cellulose fiber

121
0:04:48.415,000 --> 0:04:51,000
like a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,

122
0:04:51.943,000 --> 0:04:53,000
or even a piece of paper,

123
0:04:54.231,000 --> 0:04:55,000
when something natural ends up

124
0:04:56.045,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in the natural environment, it degrades normally.

125
0:04:58.668,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Its little carbon molecules that it stored up

126
0:05:00.532,000 --> 0:05:02,000
as it was growing are naturally released

127
0:05:02.669,000 --> 0:05:04,000
back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,

128
0:05:05.249,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but this is a net situation.

129
0:05:07.223,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Most natural things

130
0:05:08.588,000 --> 0:05:09,000
don't actually end up in nature.

131
0:05:10.195,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Most of the things, the waste that we produce, end up in landfill.

132
0:05:13.609,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Landfill is a different environment.

133
0:05:16.008,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In landfill, those same carbon molecules

134
0:05:18.451,000 --> 0:05:19,000
degrade in a different way,

135
0:05:19.969,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because a landfill is anaerobic.

136
0:05:21.881,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.

137
0:05:25.299,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Those same molecules, they become methane,

138
0:05:27.647,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and methane is a 25 times more potent

139
0:05:30.565,000 --> 0:05:32,000
greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

140
0:05:33.418,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So our old lettuces and products

141
0:05:36.171,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that we have thrown out that are made

142
0:05:37.75,000 --> 0:05:38,000
out of biodegradable materials,

143
0:05:39.32,000 --> 0:05:4,000
if they end up in landfill,

144
0:05:41.055,000 --> 0:05:43,000
contribute to climate change.

145
0:05:43.081,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You see, there are facilities now

146
0:05:44.473,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that can actually capture that methane

147
0:05:46.177,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and generate power,

148
0:05:47.615,000 --> 0:05:49,000
displacing the need for fossil fuel power,

149
0:05:50.406,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but we need to be smart about this.

150
0:05:51.871,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We need to identify how we can start to leverage

151
0:05:55.036,000 --> 0:05:57,000
these types of things that are already happening

152
0:05:57.34,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and start to design systems and services

153
0:05:59.208,000 --> 0:06:,000
that alleviate these problems.

154
0:06:01.091,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Because right now, what people do is they turn around and they say,

155
0:06:04.336,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper

156
0:06:06.895,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because that is better for the environment."

157
0:06:08.822,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But if you're throwing it in the bin,

158
0:06:10.24,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and your local landfill facility

159
0:06:11.703,000 --> 0:06:13,000
is just a normal one,

160
0:06:14.124,000 --> 0:06:18,000
then we're having what's called a double negative.

161
0:06:19.03,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I'm a product designer by trade.

162
0:06:22.194,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I then did social science.

163
0:06:23.386,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And so I'm absolutely fascinated

164
0:06:24.803,000 --> 0:06:25,000
by consumer goods and how the consumer goods

165
0:06:26.802,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that we have kind of become immune to

166
0:06:28.924,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that fill our lives

167
0:06:30.162,000 --> 0:06:31,000
have an impact on the natural environment.

168
0:06:31.97,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And these guys are, like, serial offenders,

169
0:06:34.583,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room

170
0:06:36.446,000 --> 0:06:37,000
has a refrigerator.

171
0:06:38.076,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now America has this amazing ability

172
0:06:39.708,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to keep growing refrigerators.

173
0:06:41.717,000 --> 0:06:42,000
In the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot

174
0:06:43.695,000 --> 0:06:44,000
on average, the standard size

175
0:06:45.543,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of a refrigerator.

176
0:06:47.172,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And the problem is, they're so big now,

177
0:06:49.631,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it's easier for us to buy more food

178
0:06:51.825,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that we can't eat or find.

179
0:06:53.816,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator

180
0:06:55.442,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that have been there for years, all right?

181
0:06:57.652,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And so what happens is, we waste more food.

182
0:07:00.288,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And as I was just explaining, food waste is a problem.

183
0:07:03.633,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent

184
0:07:06.995,000 --> 0:07:08,000
of food purchased for the home is wasted.

185
0:07:09.57,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Half of the world's produced food is wasted.

186
0:07:13.905,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.

187
0:07:16.558,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.

188
0:07:21.095,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And I blame it on the refrigerator,

189
0:07:23.099,000 --> 0:07:24,000
well, especially in Western cultures,

190
0:07:24.627,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because it makes it easier.

191
0:07:26.477,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I mean, there's a lot of complex systems going on here.

192
0:07:28.869,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I don't want to make it so simplistic.

193
0:07:30.807,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this,

194
0:07:33.757,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and one of the features of it

195
0:07:35.615,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is the crisper drawer.

196
0:07:37.577,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You all got crisper drawers?

197
0:07:39.078,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The drawer that you put your lettuces in?

198
0:07:41.013,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Lettuces have a habit of going soggy

199
0:07:42.933,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in the crisper drawers, don't they?

200
0:07:44.729,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Yeah? Soggy lettuces?

201
0:07:46.139,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In the U.K., this is such a problem

202
0:07:48.139,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that there was a government report a few years ago

203
0:07:49.837,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that actually said the second biggest offender

204
0:07:52.857,000 --> 0:07:54,000
of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.

205
0:07:55.274,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.

206
0:07:57.692,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Okay? So this is a problem, people.

207
0:07:59.905,000 --> 0:08:01,000
These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out

208
0:08:02.015,000 --> 0:08:03,000
left, right and center because the crisper drawers

209
0:08:03.887,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are not designed to actually keep things crisp.

210
0:08:06.646,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Okay. You need a tight environment.

211
0:08:08.855,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You need, like, an airless environment

212
0:08:10.985,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally.

213
0:08:13.71,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer

214
0:08:15.662,000 --> 0:08:16,000
with a slightly better seal.

215
0:08:17.37,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Anyway, I'm clearly obsessed.

216
0:08:19.457,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Don't ever invite me over because I'll just start going through your refrigerator

217
0:08:22.182,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and looking at all sorts of things like that.

218
0:08:23.7,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But essentially, this is a big problem.

219
0:08:25.619,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system,

220
0:08:28.578,000 --> 0:08:31,000
not only do we have that impact I just explained at the end of life,

221
0:08:32.114,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but we actually have had to grow that lettuce.

222
0:08:34.77,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.

223
0:08:38.041,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We've had to clear land.

224
0:08:39.459,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,

225
0:08:41.616,000 --> 0:08:43,000
fertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.

226
0:08:43.74,000 --> 0:08:45,000
All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce

227
0:08:45.828,000 --> 0:08:46,000
get lost from the system,

228
0:08:47.54,000 --> 0:08:49,000
which makes it a far bigger environmental impact

229
0:08:50.151,000 --> 0:08:53,000
than the loss of the energy from the fridge.

230
0:08:53.835,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So we need to design things like this far better

231
0:08:57.1,000 --> 0:09:,000
if we're going to start addressing serious environmental problems.

232
0:09:00.281,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We could start with the crisper drawer and the size.

233
0:09:01.932,000 --> 0:09:02,000
For those of you in the room who do design fridges,

234
0:09:03.684,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that would be great.

235
0:09:05.177,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The problem is, imagine if we

236
0:09:08.275,000 --> 0:09:1,000
actually started to reconsider how we designed things.

237
0:09:10.925,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,

238
0:09:14.532,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but we actually haven't really changed the design

239
0:09:16.63,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of them that much since the 1950s.

240
0:09:19.301,000 --> 0:09:22,000
A little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,

241
0:09:22.526,000 --> 0:09:23,000
cold boxes that we store stuff in.

242
0:09:24.448,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So imagine if we actually really started

243
0:09:26.268,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to identify these problems and use that

244
0:09:29.013,000 --> 0:09:32,000
as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant

245
0:09:32.95,000 --> 0:09:35,000
design solutions that will solve those problems.

246
0:09:36.303,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is design-led system change,

247
0:09:38.528,000 --> 0:09:41,000
design dictating the way in which the system

248
0:09:42.238,000 --> 0:09:44,000
can be far more sustainable.

249
0:09:45.003,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Forty percent food waste is a major problem.

250
0:09:47.097,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that.

251
0:09:51.162,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Another item that I find fascinating

252
0:09:53.513,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is the electric tea kettle,

253
0:09:54.766,000 --> 0:09:55,000
which I found out that

254
0:09:56.159,000 --> 0:09:59,000
you don't do tea kettles in this country, really, do you?

255
0:09:59.41,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But that's really big in the U.K.

256
0:10:01.498,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Ninety-seven percent of households

257
0:10:03.731,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.

258
0:10:06.663,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So they're very popular.

259
0:10:08.27,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm

260
0:10:11.07,000 --> 0:10:13,000
or a designer, and they were designing one of these,

261
0:10:13.322,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and they wanted to do it eco,

262
0:10:14.561,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they'd usually ask me two things.

263
0:10:16.479,000 --> 0:10:19,000
They'd say, "Leyla, how do I make it technically efficient?"

264
0:10:19.523,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Because obviously energy's a problem with this product.

265
0:10:22.811,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Or, "How do I make it green materials?

266
0:10:25.876,000 --> 0:10:27,000
How do I make the materials green

267
0:10:28.786,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in the manufacturing?"

268
0:10:30.608,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Would you ask me those questions?

269
0:10:32.411,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They seem logical, right? Yeah.

270
0:10:35.21,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Well I'd say, "You're looking at the wrong problems."

271
0:10:37.769,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Because the problem is with use.

272
0:10:39.927,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's with how people use the product.

273
0:10:42.602,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Sixty-five percent of Brits

274
0:10:44.437,000 --> 0:10:46,000
admit to over-filling their kettle

275
0:10:46.781,000 --> 0:10:48,000
when they only need one cup of tea.

276
0:10:49.367,000 --> 0:10:51,000
All of this extra water that's being boiled

277
0:10:52.11,000 --> 0:10:55,000
requires energy, and it's been calculated

278
0:10:56.078,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that in one day of extra energy use

279
0:10:59.116,000 --> 0:11:,000
from boiling kettles

280
0:11:00.659,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is enough to light all of the streetlights

281
0:11:03.301,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in England for a night.

282
0:11:05.924,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But this is the thing.

283
0:11:08.042,000 --> 0:11:09,000
This is what I call a product-person failure.

284
0:11:09.956,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But we've got a product-system failure going on with these little guys,

285
0:11:12.702,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and they're so ubiquitous, you don't even notice they're there.

286
0:11:15.612,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And this guy over here, though, he does. He's named Simon.

287
0:11:18.825,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Simon works for the national electricity company in the U.K.

288
0:11:22.132,000 --> 0:11:24,000
He has a very important job of monitoring

289
0:11:24.274,000 --> 0:11:26,000
all of the electricity coming into the system

290
0:11:26.713,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to make sure there is enough

291
0:11:28.126,000 --> 0:11:29,000
so it powers everybody's homes.

292
0:11:30.054,000 --> 0:11:32,000
He's also watching television.

293
0:11:32.158,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The reason is because there's a unique

294
0:11:34.131,000 --> 0:11:35,000
phenomenon that happens in the U.K.

295
0:11:35.949,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the moment that very popular TV shows end.

296
0:11:39.987,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The minute the ad break comes on,

297
0:11:42.225,000 --> 0:11:43,000
this man has to rush

298
0:11:44.062,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to buy nuclear power from France,

299
0:11:47.118,000 --> 0:11:49,000
because everybody turns their kettles on

300
0:11:50.007,000 --> 0:11:52,000
at the same time.

301
0:11:52.072,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Laughter)

302
0:11:54.318,000 --> 0:11:59,000
1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.

303
0:12:00.303,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So imagine if you designed kettles,

304
0:12:03.872,000 --> 0:12:05,000
you actually found a way to solve these system failures,

305
0:12:06.612,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because this is a huge amount of pressure

306
0:12:09.277,000 --> 0:12:1,000
on the system,

307
0:12:10.668,000 --> 0:12:13,000
just because the product hasn't thought about the problem

308
0:12:14.104,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that it's going to have when it exists in the world.

309
0:12:15.967,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Now, I looked at a number of kettles available on the market,

310
0:12:18.635,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and found the minimum fill lines,

311
0:12:20.657,000 --> 0:12:21,000
so the little piece of information that tells you

312
0:12:22.423,000 --> 0:12:23,000
how much you need to put in there,

313
0:12:23.98,000 --> 0:12:25,000
was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water

314
0:12:26.899,000 --> 0:12:29,000
just to make one cup of tea.

315
0:12:30.332,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So this kettle here is an example of one where

316
0:12:32.617,000 --> 0:12:34,000
it actually has two reservoirs.

317
0:12:35.155,000 --> 0:12:37,000
One's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.

318
0:12:37.34,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The user actually has to push that button

319
0:12:39.665,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to get their hot water boiled,

320
0:12:41.233,000 --> 0:12:42,000
which means, because we're all lazy,

321
0:12:42.999,000 --> 0:12:43,000
you only fill exactly what you need.

322
0:12:44.841,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And this is what I call behavior-changing products:

323
0:12:47.165,000 --> 0:12:49,000
products, systems or services

324
0:12:49.277,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that intervene and solve these problems up front.

325
0:12:53.136,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Now, this is a technology arena,

326
0:12:55.786,000 --> 0:12:57,000
so obviously these things are quite popular,

327
0:12:57.847,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but I think if we're going to keep

328
0:12:59.815,000 --> 0:13:01,000
designing, buying and using and throwing out

329
0:13:02.401,000 --> 0:13:03,000
these kinds of products at the rate we currently do,

330
0:13:04.313,000 --> 0:13:06,000
which is astronomically high,

331
0:13:06.562,000 --> 0:13:07,000
there are seven billion people

332
0:13:08.396,000 --> 0:13:09,000
who live in the world right now.

333
0:13:09.806,000 --> 0:13:11,000
There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions

334
0:13:11.993,000 --> 0:13:14,000
as of last year.

335
0:13:15.659,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Every single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones

336
0:13:19.181,000 --> 0:13:2,000
roll off production lines,

337
0:13:20.434,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and some companies report their production rate

338
0:13:22.505,000 --> 0:13:24,000
as being greater than the human birth rate.

339
0:13:24.855,000 --> 0:13:27,000
One hundred fifty-two million phones were thrown out in the U.S. last year;

340
0:13:27.985,000 --> 0:13:28,000
only 11 percent were recycled.

341
0:13:29.869,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I'm from Australia. We have a population of 22 million -- don't laugh --

342
0:13:33.227,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and it's been reported that 22 million phones

343
0:13:36.3,000 --> 0:13:38,000
are in people's drawers.

344
0:13:38.907,000 --> 0:13:41,000
We need to find ways of solving the problems around this,

345
0:13:42.628,000 --> 0:13:44,000
because these things are so complicated.

346
0:13:45.525,000 --> 0:13:48,000
They have so much locked up inside them.

347
0:13:48.831,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Gold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now

348
0:13:52.594,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones

349
0:13:56.211,000 --> 0:13:59,000
than it is out of a ton of gold ore?

350
0:13:59.439,000 --> 0:14:01,000
There's a number of highly complex and valuable

351
0:14:01.829,000 --> 0:14:02,000
materials embodied inside these things,

352
0:14:03.43,000 --> 0:14:05,000
so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,

353
0:14:05.888,000 --> 0:14:07,000
because this is otherwise what happens.

354
0:14:08.052,000 --> 0:14:09,000
This is a community in Ghana,

355
0:14:09.726,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and e-waste is reported, or electronic waste

356
0:14:11.984,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is reported by the U.N.

357
0:14:13.96,000 --> 0:14:16,000
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked.

358
0:14:16.992,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This is how they get the gold

359
0:14:18.306,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and the other valuable materials out.

360
0:14:19.84,000 --> 0:14:2,000
They burn the electronic waste

361
0:14:21.778,000 --> 0:14:23,000
in open spaces.

362
0:14:23.809,000 --> 0:14:26,000
These are communities, and this is happening all over the world.

363
0:14:26.944,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And because we don't see the ramifications

364
0:14:29.491,000 --> 0:14:3,000
of the choices that we make as designers,

365
0:14:31.32,000 --> 0:14:33,000
as businesspeople, as consumers,

366
0:14:33.79,000 --> 0:14:34,000
then these kinds of externalities happen,

367
0:14:35.403,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and these are people's lives.

368
0:14:37.705,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So we need to find smarter, more systems-based,

369
0:14:42.153,000 --> 0:14:44,000
innovative solutions to these problems,

370
0:14:45.069,000 --> 0:14:48,000
if we're going to start to live sustainably within this world.

371
0:14:48.845,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone,

372
0:14:52.818,000 --> 0:14:53,000
your new one because you replaced your old one --

373
0:14:54.508,000 --> 0:14:56,000
after 15 to 18 months is the average time

374
0:14:56.883,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that people replace their phones, by the way —

375
0:14:58.987,000 --> 0:15:,000
so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient

376
0:15:01.972,000 --> 0:15:03,000
mobile phone replacing, then we should

377
0:15:04.21,000 --> 0:15:06,000
be looking at closing the loop on these systems.

378
0:15:06.259,000 --> 0:15:07,000
The people who produce these phones,

379
0:15:08.17,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and some of which I'm sure are in the room right now,

380
0:15:09.999,000 --> 0:15:11,000
could potentially look at doing what we call closed-loop systems,

381
0:15:12.677,000 --> 0:15:13,000
or product system services,

382
0:15:14.245,000 --> 0:15:16,000
so identifying that there is a market demand

383
0:15:16.507,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and that market demand's not going to go anywhere,

384
0:15:18.324,000 --> 0:15:21,000
so you design the product to solve the problem.

385
0:15:21.377,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Design for disassembly, design for light-weighting.

386
0:15:23.716,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We heard some of those kinds of strategies

387
0:15:26.082,000 --> 0:15:28,000
being used in the Tesla Motors car today.

388
0:15:28.941,000 --> 0:15:3,000
These kinds of approaches are not hard,

389
0:15:31.053,000 --> 0:15:32,000
but understanding the system

390
0:15:32.911,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and then looking for viable, market-driven

391
0:15:36.442,000 --> 0:15:37,000
consumer demand alternatives

392
0:15:38.425,000 --> 0:15:4,000
is how we can start radically altering

393
0:15:40.976,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the sustainability agenda,

394
0:15:42.783,000 --> 0:15:43,000
because I hate to break it to you all:

395
0:15:44.654,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Consumption is the biggest problem.

396
0:15:47.457,000 --> 0:15:52,000
But design is one of the best solutions.

397
0:15:52.719,000 --> 0:15:54,000
These kinds of products are everywhere.

398
0:15:54.903,000 --> 0:15:56,000
By identifying alternative ways of doing things,

399
0:15:57.571,000 --> 0:15:58,000
we can actually start to innovate,

400
0:15:59.166,000 --> 0:16:,000
and I say actually start to innovate.

401
0:16:00.559,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.

402
0:16:03.044,000 --> 0:16:05,000
But in the regards to using sustainability

403
0:16:05.398,000 --> 0:16:07,000
as a parameter, as a criteria

404
0:16:08.085,000 --> 0:16:12,000
for fueling systems-based solutions,

405
0:16:12.302,000 --> 0:16:14,000
because as I've just demonstrated with these simple products,

406
0:16:15.207,000 --> 0:16:18,000
they're participating in these major problems.

407
0:16:18.598,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So we need to look across the entire life

408
0:16:20.753,000 --> 0:16:21,000
of the things that we do.

409
0:16:22.375,000 --> 0:16:23,000
If you just had paper or plastic --

410
0:16:24.09,000 --> 0:16:26,000
obviously reusable is far more beneficial --

411
0:16:26.854,000 --> 0:16:29,000
then the paper is worse,

412
0:16:30.325,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and the paper is worse because it weighs

413
0:16:32.371,000 --> 0:16:34,000
four to 10 times more than the plastic,

414
0:16:34.475,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and when we actually compare, from a life cycle perspective,

415
0:16:36.842,000 --> 0:16:38,000
a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,

416
0:16:39.532,000 --> 0:16:4,000
the paper is far better,

417
0:16:41.178,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag

418
0:16:43.718,000 --> 0:16:46,000
to carry your groceries home is not done with a kilo of each material.

419
0:16:47.333,000 --> 0:16:48,000
It's done with a very small amount of plastic

420
0:16:49.302,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and quite a lot more paper.

421
0:16:50.995,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Because functionality defines environmental impact,

422
0:16:53.953,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco-materials.

423
0:16:56.786,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I say, there's only a few materials that you should completely avoid.

424
0:16:59.831,000 --> 0:17:,000
The rest of them, it's all about application,

425
0:17:01.73,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and at the end of the day, everything we design and produce in the economy

426
0:17:04.749,000 --> 0:17:06,000
or buy as consumers is done so for function.

427
0:17:07.089,000 --> 0:17:09,000
We want something, therefore we buy it.

428
0:17:09.206,000 --> 0:17:12,000
So breaking things back down and delivering

429
0:17:12.362,000 --> 0:17:15,000
smartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions

430
0:17:16.361,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that take into consideration the entire system

431
0:17:19.158,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and the entire life of the thing, everything,

432
0:17:22.253,000 --> 0:17:24,000
all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life,

433
0:17:25.089,000 --> 0:17:27,000
we can start to actually find really innovative solutions.

434
0:17:27.891,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing

435
0:17:29.961,000 --> 0:17:32,000
that a designer said to me recently who I work with, a senior designer.

436
0:17:33.818,000 --> 0:17:36,000
I said, "How come you're not doing sustainability? I know you know this."

437
0:17:36.916,000 --> 0:17:4,000
And he said, "Well, recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client,

438
0:17:40.928,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and turned and he said to me,

439
0:17:42.869,000 --> 0:17:43,000
'I know it's going to cost less,

440
0:17:44.634,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I know it's going to sell more,

441
0:17:46.252,000 --> 0:17:5,000
but we're not pioneers, because pioneers have arrows in their backs.'"

442
0:17:50.725,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I think we've got a roomful of pioneers,

443
0:17:52.942,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and I hope there are far more pioneers out there, because we need to solve these problems.

444
0:17:56.027,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Thank you.

445
0:17:57.434,000 --> 0:18:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.744,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I have the feeling that we can all agree

2
0:00:15.851,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that we're moving towards a new

3
0:00:18.078,000 --> 0:00:2,000
model of the state and society.

4
0:00:20.943,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But, we're absolutely clueless as to what this is

5
0:00:25.424,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or what it should be.

6
0:00:27.11,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It seems like we need to have

7
0:00:29.137,000 --> 0:00:32,000
a conversation about democracy

8
0:00:32.139,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in our day and age.

9
0:00:34.494,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Let's think about it this way:

10
0:00:36.99,000 --> 0:00:39,000
We are 21st-century citizens, doing our

11
0:00:40.976,000 --> 0:00:46,000
very, very best to interact with 19th century-designed institutions

12
0:00:47.072,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that are based on an information technology of the 15th century.

13
0:00:52.395,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Let's have a look at some of the

14
0:00:53.806,000 --> 0:00:55,000
characteristics of this system.

15
0:00:56.242,000 --> 0:00:59,000
First of all, it's designed for an information technology

16
0:00:59.747,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that's over 500 years old.

17
0:01:02.846,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And the best possible system

18
0:01:05.082,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that could be designed for it

19
0:01:06.617,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is one where the few make daily decisions

20
0:01:10.841,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in the name of the many.

21
0:01:12.275,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And the many get to vote once every couple of years.

22
0:01:17.81,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In the second place, the costs of

23
0:01:19.159,000 --> 0:01:21,000
participating in this system are

24
0:01:21.451,000 --> 0:01:22,000
incredibly high.

25
0:01:22.658,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You either have to have a fair bit of money

26
0:01:25.7,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and influence, or you have to devote your entire

27
0:01:30.052,000 --> 0:01:31,000
life to politics.

28
0:01:31.89,000 --> 0:01:32,000
You have to become a party member

29
0:01:33.83,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and slowly start working up the ranks

30
0:01:37.448,000 --> 0:01:4,000
until maybe, one day, you'll get to sit at a table

31
0:01:41.364,000 --> 0:01:43,000
where a decision is being made.

32
0:01:43.933,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And last but not least,

33
0:01:45.749,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the language of the system —

34
0:01:47.669,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it's incredibly cryptic.

35
0:01:49.518,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's done for lawyers, by lawyers,

36
0:01:52.702,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and no one else can understand.

37
0:01:55.548,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So, it's a system where we can

38
0:01:58.223,000 --> 0:01:59,000
choose our authorities,

39
0:02:00.158,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but we are completely left out on how those authorities

40
0:02:03.994,000 --> 0:02:05,000
reach their decisions.

41
0:02:06.845,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So, in a day where a new information technology

42
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
allows us to participate globally in any conversation,

43
0:02:16.456,000 --> 0:02:19,000
our barriers of information are completely lowered

44
0:02:19.609,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we can, more than ever before,

45
0:02:23.088,000 --> 0:02:26,000
express our desires and our concerns.

46
0:02:26.766,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Our political system remains the same

47
0:02:29.519,000 --> 0:02:32,000
for the past 200 years

48
0:02:33.135,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and expects us to be contented with being simply passive recipients

49
0:02:38.918,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of a monologue.

50
0:02:40.661,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So, it's really not surprising that

51
0:02:43.104,000 --> 0:02:46,000
this kind of system is only able to produce

52
0:02:46.446,000 --> 0:02:47,000
two kinds of results:

53
0:02:48.378,000 --> 0:02:51,000
silence or noise.

54
0:02:52.047,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Silence, in terms of citizens not engaging,

55
0:02:55.836,000 --> 0:02:57,000
simply not wanting to participate.

56
0:02:58.732,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There's this commonplace [idea] that I truly, truly dislike,

57
0:03:02.01,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally

58
0:03:06.069,000 --> 0:03:09,000
apathetic. That we shun commitment.

59
0:03:09.175,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But, can you really blame us

60
0:03:10.702,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for not jumping at the opportunity of going

61
0:03:13.576,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to the middle of the city in the middle

62
0:03:15.595,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of a working day to attend, physically,

63
0:03:18.944,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a public hearing that has no impact

64
0:03:22.364,000 --> 0:03:23,000
whatsoever?

65
0:03:24.304,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Conflict is bound to happen between a system

66
0:03:28.692,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that no longer represents, nor has any dialogue capacity,

67
0:03:34.887,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and citizens that are increasingly used

68
0:03:37.965,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to representing themselves.

69
0:03:40.311,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And, then we find noise:

70
0:03:42.615,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico Italy, France, Spain, the United States,

71
0:03:48.994,000 --> 0:03:49,000
they're all democracies.

72
0:03:50.853,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Their citizens have access to

73
0:03:52.765,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the ballot boxes. But they still feel the need,

74
0:03:57.021,000 --> 0:04:02,000
they need to take to the streets in order to be heard.

75
0:04:02.531,000 --> 0:04:06,000
To me, it seems like the 18th-century

76
0:04:07.022,000 --> 0:04:1,000
slogan that was the basis for the formation

77
0:04:10.082,000 --> 0:04:13,000
of our modern democracies, "No taxation

78
0:04:13.734,000 --> 0:04:15,000
without representation,"

79
0:04:16.037,000 --> 0:04:23,000
can now be updated to "No representation without a conversation."

80
0:04:23.168,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We want our seat at the table.

81
0:04:27.704,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And rightly so.

82
0:04:30.01,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But in order to be part of this conversation,

83
0:04:32.39,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we need to know what we want to do next,

84
0:04:35.901,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because political action is being able

85
0:04:39.108,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to move from agitation

86
0:04:41.429,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to construction.

87
0:04:43.293,000 --> 0:04:46,000
My generation has been incredibly good at

88
0:04:47.13,000 --> 0:04:49,000
using new networks and technologies

89
0:04:49.751,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to organize protests,

90
0:04:52.266,000 --> 0:04:54,000
protests that were able to successfully

91
0:04:54.684,000 --> 0:04:55,000
impose agendas,

92
0:04:56.643,000 --> 0:04:59,000
roll back extremely pernicious legislation,

93
0:05:00.066,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and even overthrow authoritarian governments.

94
0:05:03.267,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And we should be immensely

95
0:05:05.263,000 --> 0:05:07,000
proud of this.

96
0:05:07.622,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But, we also must admit that we

97
0:05:09.47,000 --> 0:05:11,000
haven't been good at using those

98
0:05:11.958,000 --> 0:05:13,000
same networks and technologies

99
0:05:14.846,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to successfully articulate an alternative to what we're seeing

100
0:05:20.244,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed

101
0:05:25.061,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to make it happen.

102
0:05:27.079,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And so the risk that we face

103
0:05:29.575,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is that we can create these huge power vacuums

104
0:05:33.208,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that will very quickly get filled up by de facto

105
0:05:37.295,000 --> 0:05:39,000
powers, like the military or highly

106
0:05:40.176,000 --> 0:05:42,000
motivated and already organized groups

107
0:05:43.075,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that generally lie on the extremes.

108
0:05:46.745,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But our democracy is neither

109
0:05:48.697,000 --> 0:05:5,000
just a matter of voting once every

110
0:05:51.466,000 --> 0:05:52,000
couple of years.

111
0:05:52.721,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But it's not either the ability to bring millions onto the streets.

112
0:05:58.657,000 --> 0:06:,000
So the question I'd like to raise here,

113
0:06:01.478,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and I do believe it's the most important question we need to answer,

114
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:06,000
is this one:

115
0:06:06.357,000 --> 0:06:09,000
If Internet is the new printing press,

116
0:06:10.036,000 --> 0:06:14,000
then what is democracy for the Internet era?

117
0:06:14.872,000 --> 0:06:16,000
What institutions do we want to build

118
0:06:17.822,000 --> 0:06:2,000
for the 21st-century society?

119
0:06:21.781,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I don't have the answer, just in case.

120
0:06:25.007,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I don't think anyone does.

121
0:06:26.441,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But I truly believe we can't afford to ignore this question anymore.

122
0:06:31.456,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So, I'd like to share our experience

123
0:06:33.393,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and what we've learned so far

124
0:06:35.119,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and hopefully contribute two cents

125
0:06:37.542,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to this conversation.

126
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Two years ago, with a group of friends from Argentina,

127
0:06:43.438,000 --> 0:06:47,000
we started thinking, "how can we get our representatives,

128
0:06:47.487,000 --> 0:06:48,000
our elected representatives,

129
0:06:49.371,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to represent us?"

130
0:06:53.719,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Marshall McLuhan once said that politics

131
0:06:57.724,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools.

132
0:07:02.419,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So the question that motivated us was,

133
0:07:04.933,000 --> 0:07:07,000
can we try and solve some of today's problems

134
0:07:08.827,000 --> 0:07:12,000
with the tools that we use every single day of our lives?

135
0:07:12.929,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Our first approach was to design and develop

136
0:07:15.879,000 --> 0:07:18,000
a piece of software called DemocracyOS.

137
0:07:19.13,000 --> 0:07:22,000
DemocracyOS is an open-source web application

138
0:07:22.255,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that is designed to become a bridge

139
0:07:25.453,000 --> 0:07:28,000
between citizens and their elected representatives

140
0:07:28.531,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to make it easier for us to participate from our everyday lives.

141
0:07:34.239,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So first of all, you can get informed so every new

142
0:07:37.578,000 --> 0:07:39,000
project that gets introduced in Congress

143
0:07:40.254,000 --> 0:07:43,000
gets immediately translated and explained

144
0:07:43.383,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in plain language on this platform.

145
0:07:46.318,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But we all know that social change

146
0:07:49.614,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is not going to come from just knowing

147
0:07:52.372,000 --> 0:07:53,000
more information,

148
0:07:53.644,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but from doing something with it.

149
0:07:56.143,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So better access to information

150
0:07:58.362,000 --> 0:08:,000
should lead to a conversation

151
0:08:00.693,000 --> 0:08:01,000
about what we're going to do next,

152
0:08:02.544,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and DemocracyOS allows for that.

153
0:08:04.626,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Because we believe that democracy is

154
0:08:06.912,000 --> 0:08:08,000
not just a matter of stacking up

155
0:08:08.957,000 --> 0:08:1,000
preferences, one on top of each other,

156
0:08:11.776,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but that our healthy and robust public debate

157
0:08:15.484,000 --> 0:08:19,000
should be, once again, one of its fundamental values.

158
0:08:19.541,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So DemocracyOS is about persuading and being persuaded.

159
0:08:23.743,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It's about reaching a consensus

160
0:08:26.474,000 --> 0:08:29,000
as much as finding a proper way

161
0:08:29.771,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of channeling our disagreement.

162
0:08:32.496,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And finally, you can vote

163
0:08:34.486,000 --> 0:08:38,000
how you would like your elected representative to vote.

164
0:08:38.586,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And if you do not feel comfortable

165
0:08:40.026,000 --> 0:08:42,000
voting on a certain issue,

166
0:08:42.14,000 --> 0:08:43,000
you can always delegate your vote

167
0:08:44.024,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to someone else, allowing

168
0:08:45.767,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for a dynamic and emerging social leadership.

169
0:08:51.346,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It suddenly became very easy for us

170
0:08:52.729,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to simply compare these results

171
0:08:55.444,000 --> 0:08:56,000
with how our representatives were

172
0:08:57.148,000 --> 0:08:58,000
voting in Congress.

173
0:08:58.551,000 --> 0:09:,000
But, it also became very evident that

174
0:09:00.984,000 --> 0:09:03,000
technology was not going to do the trick.

175
0:09:04.942,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What we needed to do to was to find

176
0:09:06.821,000 --> 0:09:08,000
actors that were able to

177
0:09:09.441,000 --> 0:09:11,000
grab this distributed knowledge

178
0:09:12.345,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in society and use it to make better and more fair decisions.

179
0:09:18.409,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So we reached out to traditional political parties

180
0:09:21.697,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and we offered them DemocracyOS.

181
0:09:23.892,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We said, "Look, here you have a platform that you can use to build

182
0:09:28.216,000 --> 0:09:31,000
a two-way conversation with your constituencies."

183
0:09:32.124,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And yes, we failed.

184
0:09:34.687,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We failed big time.

185
0:09:37.683,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We were sent to play outside like little kids.

186
0:09:42.009,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Amongst other things, we were called naive.

187
0:09:44.405,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And I must be honest: I think, in hindsight, we were.

188
0:09:48.201,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Because the challenges that we face, they're not

189
0:09:50.667,000 --> 0:09:52,000
technological, they're cultural.

190
0:09:53.552,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Political parties were never willing

191
0:09:55.946,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to change the way they make their decisions.

192
0:09:59.95,000 --> 0:10:,000
So it suddenly became a bit obvious

193
0:10:01.678,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that if we wanted to move forward with this idea,

194
0:10:05.094,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we needed to do it ourselves.

195
0:10:08.035,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And so we took quite a leap of faith,

196
0:10:10.044,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and in August last year, we founded

197
0:10:12.869,000 --> 0:10:14,000
our own political party,

198
0:10:14.965,000 --> 0:10:15,000
El Partido de la Red,

199
0:10:16.078,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or the Net Party, in the city of Buenos Aires.

200
0:10:20.25,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And taking an even bigger leap of faith,

201
0:10:23.927,000 --> 0:10:27,000
we ran for elections in October last year

202
0:10:28.173,000 --> 0:10:29,000
with this idea:

203
0:10:29.769,000 --> 0:10:31,000
if we want a seat in Congress,

204
0:10:32.366,000 --> 0:10:34,000
our candidate, our representatives

205
0:10:34.384,000 --> 0:10:37,000
were always going to vote according to

206
0:10:37.758,000 --> 0:10:4,000
what citizens decided on DemocracyOS.

207
0:10:41.267,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Every single project that got introduced

208
0:10:44.119,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in Congress, we were going vote

209
0:10:45.846,000 --> 0:10:49,000
according to what citizens decided on an online platform.

210
0:10:50.588,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It was our way of hacking the political system.

211
0:10:54.238,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We understood that if we wanted

212
0:10:56.164,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to become part of the conversation,

213
0:10:58.513,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to have a seat at the table,

214
0:11:00.185,000 --> 0:11:03,000
we needed to become valid stakeholders,

215
0:11:03.894,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and the only way of doing it is to play by the system rules.

216
0:11:08.116,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But we were hacking it in the sense that

217
0:11:11.105,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we were radically changing the way a political party

218
0:11:15.193,000 --> 0:11:16,000
makes its decisions.

219
0:11:16.612,000 --> 0:11:19,000
For the first time, we were making our decisions

220
0:11:20.115,000 --> 0:11:22,000
together with those who we were

221
0:11:22.868,000 --> 0:11:26,000
affecting directly by those decisions.

222
0:11:27.247,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It was a very, very bold move for a two-month-old party

223
0:11:30.985,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in the city of Buenos Aires.

224
0:11:32.664,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But it got attention.

225
0:11:34.239,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We got 22,000 votes, that's 1.2 percent of the votes,

226
0:11:38.952,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and we came in second for the local options.

227
0:11:43.128,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So, even if that wasn't enough to win a

228
0:11:45.328,000 --> 0:11:47,000
seat in Congress, it was enough

229
0:11:47.454,000 --> 0:11:5,000
for us to become part of the conversation,

230
0:11:50.637,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to the extent that next month,

231
0:11:54.208,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Congress, as an institution, is launching

232
0:11:57.229,000 --> 0:11:59,000
for the first time in Argentina's history,

233
0:12:00.097,000 --> 0:12:02,000
a DemocracyOS to discuss,

234
0:12:02.519,000 --> 0:12:05,000
with the citizens, three pieces of legislation:

235
0:12:06.189,000 --> 0:12:08,000
two on urban transportation and

236
0:12:08.296,000 --> 0:12:1,000
one on the use of public space.

237
0:12:11.288,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Of course, our elected representatives are not

238
0:12:14.077,000 --> 0:12:16,000
saying, "Yes, we're going to vote

239
0:12:16.094,000 --> 0:12:18,000
according to what citizens decide,"

240
0:12:18.667,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but they're willing to try.

241
0:12:20.693,000 --> 0:12:23,000
They're willing to open up a new space

242
0:12:23.923,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for citizen engagement and hopefully

243
0:12:26.568,000 --> 0:12:29,000
they'll be willing to listen as well.

244
0:12:29.824,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Our political system can be transformed,

245
0:12:33.888,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and not by subverting it, by destroying it,

246
0:12:37.566,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but by rewiring it with the tools that

247
0:12:41.185,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Internet affords us now.

248
0:12:43.937,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But a real challenge is to find, to design

249
0:12:48.324,000 --> 0:12:51,000
to create, to empower those connectors

250
0:12:51.753,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that are able to innovate, to transform

251
0:12:55.572,000 --> 0:12:57,000
noise and silence into signal

252
0:12:58.24,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and finally bring our democracies

253
0:13:00.178,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to the 21st century.

254
0:13:02.506,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I'm not saying it's easy.

255
0:13:05.237,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But in our experience, we actually stand a chance

256
0:13:08.82,000 --> 0:13:1,000
of making it work.

257
0:13:11.154,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And in my heart, it's most definitely

258
0:13:14.286,000 --> 0:13:15,000
worth trying.

259
0:13:15.567,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Thank you.

260
0:13:16.799,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Applause)

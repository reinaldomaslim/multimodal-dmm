1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I have been teaching for a long time,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and in doing so

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that I really wish more people would understand

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
about the potential of students.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In 1931, my grandmother --

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
bottom left for you guys over here --

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
graduated from the eighth grade.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
She went to school to get the information

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because that's where the information lived.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and she needed to go there to get the information,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
because that's how you learned.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Fast-forward a generation:

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And he again had to travel to the school

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to get the information from the teacher,

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and take it with him,

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because that is how information was being transported

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
from teacher to student and then used in the world.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
When I was a kid,

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It was purchased the year I was born,

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and it was extraordinary,

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The information was inside my house

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and it was awesome.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This was different

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
than either generation had experienced before,

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and it changed the way I interacted with information

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
even at just a small level.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But the information was closer to me.

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I could get access to it.

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In the time that passes

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
between when I was a kid in high school

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and when I started teaching,

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we really see the advent of the Internet.

40
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Right about the time that the Internet gets going

41
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as an educational tool,

42
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I take off from Wisconsin

43
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,

44
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
where I had an opportunity to teach

45
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in a lovely, small-town,

46
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
rural Kansas school district,

47
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
where I was teaching my favorite subject,

48
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
American government.

49
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,

50
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
loved the political system.

51
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Kids in the 12th grade:

52
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
not exactly all that enthusiastic

53
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
about the American government system.

54
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.

55
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I put in front of them an authentic experience

56
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that allowed them to learn for themselves.

57
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.

58
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I posed a problem in front of them,

59
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.

60
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
They produced flyers. They called offices.

61
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.

62
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
They produced an election forum booklet

63
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.

64
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
They invited everyone into the school

65
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
for an evening of conversation

66
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
about government and politics

67
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and whether or not the streets were done well,

68
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and really had this robust experiential learning.

69
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The older teachers -- more experienced --

70
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
looked at me and went,

71
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."

72
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

73
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
"She doesn't know what she's in for."

74
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But I knew that the kids would show up,

75
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I believed it,

76
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.

77
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And that night, all 90 kids --

78
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.

79
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I had to just sit and watch.

80
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.

81
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It meant something to them.

82
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And they will step up.

83
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,

84
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,

85
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
this time with middle school students.

86
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.

87
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.

88
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Again, "thrilled" to learn.

89
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But what was interesting

90
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,

91
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
was I had this really

92
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with

93
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in a truly public school,

94
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.

95
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And one opportunity

96
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,

97
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which is the gentleman

98
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.

99
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.

100
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.

101
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.

102
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The problem then becomes

103
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide

104
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and deal with the subject in a way

105
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that is responsible and respectful,

106
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and they know what to do with it.

107
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina

108
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
as an example of a gentleman

109
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
who singularly used his life to do something positive.

110
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I then challenged the kids to identify

111
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,

112
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that they could identify that had done a similar thing.

113
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.

114
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's the first time we'd done this.

115
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,

116
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.

117
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It was the most awesome moment of revelation

118
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that when you ask kids to use their own voice

119
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and ask them to speak for themselves,

120
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
what they're willing to share.

121
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The last question of the assignment is:

122
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
how do you plan to use your life

123
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to positively impact other people?

124
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The things that kids will say

125
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
when you ask them and take the time to listen

126
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is extraordinary.

127
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.

128
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy,

129
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute

130
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the school district of Philadelphia.

131
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We are a nine through 12 public school,

132
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but we do school quite differently.

133
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I moved there primarily

134
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to be part of a learning environment

135
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,

136
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and that really wanted to investigate

137
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
what was possible

138
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
when you are willing to let go

139
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
of some of the paradigms of the past,

140
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school

141
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,

142
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and to a moment when we have information surplus.

143
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So what do you do when the information is all around you?

144
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Why do you have kids come to school

145
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
if they no longer have to come there to get the information?

146
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,

147
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,

148
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
taking them home, getting access to information.

149
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
when you've given the tool

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to acquire information to students,

152
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
is that you have to be comfortable with this idea

153
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of allowing kids to fail

154
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
as part of the learning process.

155
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We deal right now in the educational landscape

156
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
with an infatuation

157
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
with the culture of one right answer

158
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,

159
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and I am here to share with you:

160
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
it is not learning.

161
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,

162
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to tell kids to never be wrong.

163
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
To ask them to always have the right answer

164
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
doesn't allow them to learn.

165
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So we did this project,

166
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.

167
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I almost never show them off

168
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because of the issue of the idea of failure.

169
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
My students produced these info-graphics

170
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year

171
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
responding to the oil spill.

172
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing

173
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
of the info-graphics that existed

174
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in a lot of mass media,

175
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,

176
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and produce one for themselves

177
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of a different man-made disaster from American history.

178
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And they had certain criteria to do it.

179
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They were a little uncomfortable with it,

180
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.

181
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They can talk -- they're very smooth,

182
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and they can write very, very well,

183
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way

184
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
was a little uncomfortable for them.

185
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.

186
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Go create. Go figure it out.

187
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Let's see what we can do.

188
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the student that persistently

189
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.

190
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This was done in like two or three days.

191
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.

192
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"

193
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And they immediately went, "There it is."

194
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Didn't read anything. "There it is."

195
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"

196
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.

197
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.

198
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And I said, "Go read it."

199
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."

200
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And then we went to another one --

201
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --

202
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,

203
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,

204
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
or whether or not it was what I could create.

205
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It asked them to create for themselves,

206
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and it allowed them to fail,

207
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
process, learn from.

208
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,

209
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
they will do better this time,

210
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
because learning

211
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
has to include an amount of failure,

212
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because failure is instructional

213
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in the process.

214
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
There are a million pictures

215
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that I could click through here,

216
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --

217
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of students learning,

218
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of what learning can look like

219
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in a landscape where we let go of the idea

220
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that kids have to come to school to get the information,

221
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.

222
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Ask them really interesting questions.

223
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
They will not disappoint.

224
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Ask them to go to places,

225
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to see things for themselves,

226
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to actually experience the learning,

227
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to play, to inquire.

228
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This is one of my favorite photos,

229
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because this was taken on Tuesday,

230
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
when I asked the students to go to the polls.

231
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,

232
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.

233
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But this is learning too,

234
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.

235
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The main point

236
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
is that, if we continue to look at education

237
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
as if it's about coming to school

238
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to get the information

239
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and not about experiential learning,

240
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
empowering student voice and embracing failure,

241
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we're missing the mark.

242
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And everything that everybody is talking about today

243
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
isn't possible if we keep having an educational system

244
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that does not value these qualities,

245
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
because we won't get there with a standardized test,

246
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.

247
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We know how to do this better,

248
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and it's time to do better.

249
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

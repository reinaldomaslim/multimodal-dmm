1
0:00:18.599,000 --> 0:00:19,000
People love their automobiles.

2
0:00:20.242,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They allow us to go where we want to when we want to.

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They're a form of entertainment,

4
0:00:24.969,000 --> 0:00:26,000
they're a form of art,

5
0:00:26.994,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a pride of ownership.

6
0:00:28.7,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Songs are written about cars.

7
0:00:30.393,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Prince wrote a great song: "Little Red Corvette."

8
0:00:32.752,000 --> 0:00:35,000
He didn't write "Little Red Laptop Computer" or "Little Red Dirt Devil."

9
0:00:36.226,000 --> 0:00:37,000
He wrote about a car.

10
0:00:37.444,000 --> 0:00:38,000
One of my favorites has always been:

11
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,"

12
0:00:41.329,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because that was my vehicle when I was in college.

13
0:00:44.709,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The fact is, when we do our market research around the world,

14
0:00:48.142,000 --> 0:00:51,000
we see there's a nearly universal aspiration on the part of people

15
0:00:52.159,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to own an automobile --

16
0:00:53.337,000 --> 0:00:57,000
750 million people in the world today own a car.

17
0:00:58.127,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And you say, boy, that's a lot.

18
0:00:59.696,000 --> 0:01:,000
But you know what?

19
0:01:00.876,000 --> 0:01:02,000
That's just 12 percent of the population.

20
0:01:03.035,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We really have to ask the question:

21
0:01:05.193,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Can the world sustain that number of automobiles?

22
0:01:07.936,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years,

23
0:01:11.828,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it looks like the world car park could grow

24
0:01:15.148,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles.

25
0:01:18.107,000 --> 0:01:21,000
If you park those end to end and wrap them around the Earth,

26
0:01:21.806,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that would stretch around the Earth 125 times.

27
0:01:25.176,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now, we've made great progress with automobile technology

28
0:01:28.486,000 --> 0:01:29,000
over the last 100 years.

29
0:01:30.151,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Cars are dramatically cleaner, dramatically safer, more efficient

30
0:01:34.012,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and radically more affordable than they were 100 years ago.

31
0:01:37.736,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But the fact remains:

32
0:01:39.329,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same.

33
0:01:43.829,000 --> 0:01:47,000
If we were to reinvent the automobile today, rather than 100 years ago,

34
0:01:48.121,000 --> 0:01:51,000
knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product

35
0:01:51.95,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and about the technologies that exist today,

36
0:01:54.433,000 --> 0:01:55,000
what would we do?

37
0:01:55.652,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We wanted something that was really affordable.

38
0:01:57.916,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The fuel cell looked great:

39
0:01:59.623,000 --> 0:02:,000
one-tenth as many moving parts,

40
0:02:01.368,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a fuel-cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine,

41
0:02:04.517,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and it emits just water.

42
0:02:05.746,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law

43
0:02:08.132,000 --> 0:02:09,000
with electronic controls and software,

44
0:02:09.997,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected.

45
0:02:13.06,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine,

46
0:02:16.964,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the fuel cell,

47
0:02:18.144,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and hydrogen as the energy carrier.

48
0:02:20.152,000 --> 0:02:21,000
First was Autonomy.

49
0:02:21.685,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head.

50
0:02:24.766,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We embodied all of the key components of a fuel-cell propulsion system.

51
0:02:28.83,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We then had Autonomy drivable with Hy-Wire,

52
0:02:31.525,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and we showed Hy-Wire here at this conference last year.

53
0:02:34.83,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Hy-Wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell,

54
0:02:38.017,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and we have followed up that now with Sequel.

55
0:02:40.83,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And Sequel truly is a real car.

56
0:02:42.83,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So if we could run the video --

57
0:02:45.189,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Futuristic music)

58
0:02:53.11,000 --> 0:02:55,000
[Reinventing the Automobile]

59
0:03:32.124,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Video) It truly is my great pleasure to introduce Sequel.

60
0:03:52.125,000 --> 0:03:54,000
[Acceleration]

61
0:03:56.506,000 --> 0:03:58,000
[Cruising]

62
0:04:00.463,000 --> 0:04:02,000
[Steering]

63
0:04:04.527,000 --> 0:04:07,000
[Braking]

64
0:04:11.147,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But the real key question I'm sure that's on your mind:

65
0:04:13.924,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Where is the hydrogen going to come from?

66
0:04:15.924,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And secondly, when are these kinds of cars going to be available?

67
0:04:19.114,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So let me talk about hydrogen first.

68
0:04:21.338,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources:

69
0:04:24.98,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it can come from fossil fuels,

70
0:04:26.767,000 --> 0:04:28,000
it can come from any way that you can create electricity,

71
0:04:29.552,000 --> 0:04:3,000
including renewables.

72
0:04:31.212,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And it can come from biofuels.

73
0:04:33.027,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And that's quite exciting.

74
0:04:34.569,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength

75
0:04:38.845,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in creating the hydrogen.

76
0:04:40.168,000 --> 0:04:42,000
A lot of hydrogen is produced today in the world.

77
0:04:42.544,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline --

78
0:04:44.852,000 --> 0:04:45,000
which I find is somewhat ironic.

79
0:04:46.683,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's produced in the fertilizer industry;

80
0:04:49.314,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it's produced in the chemical manufacturing industry.

81
0:04:52.56,000 --> 0:04:53,000
That hydrogen is being made

82
0:04:53.973,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because there's a good business reason for its use.

83
0:04:56.662,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But it tells us that we know how to create it,

84
0:04:59.25,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we know how to create it cost-effectively,

85
0:05:01.547,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we know how to handle it safely.

86
0:05:03.838,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We did an analysis

87
0:05:05.059,000 --> 0:05:07,000
where you would have a station in each city

88
0:05:07.679,000 --> 0:05:1,000
with each of the 100 largest cities in the United States,

89
0:05:10.83,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and located the stations

90
0:05:12.83,000 --> 0:05:14,000
so you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time.

91
0:05:15.83,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We put one every 25 miles on the freeway,

92
0:05:18.163,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and it turns out that translates into about 12,000 stations.

93
0:05:22.192,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And at a million dollars each, that would be about 12 billion dollars.

94
0:05:25.581,000 --> 0:05:26,000
That's a lot of money.

95
0:05:26.83,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But if you built the Alaskan pipeline today,

96
0:05:28.949,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that's half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost.

97
0:05:32.054,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But the real exciting vision that we see, truly, is home refueling,

98
0:05:36.078,000 --> 0:05:39,000
much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cell phone.

99
0:05:39.727,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen.

100
0:05:42.79,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We think it's a question of not whether, but a question of when.

101
0:05:46.83,000 --> 0:05:47,000
What we've targeted for ourselves --

102
0:05:48.63,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and we're making great progress toward this goal --

103
0:05:51.179,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells,

104
0:05:54.695,000 --> 0:05:55,000
designed and validated,

105
0:05:56.441,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine.

106
0:05:59.41,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine,

107
0:06:02.441,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and doing it in terms of affordability at scale volumes,

108
0:06:05.506,000 --> 0:06:07,000
its performance and its durability.

109
0:06:07.929,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So that's what we're driving to for 2010.

110
0:06:10.644,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We haven't seen anything yet in our development work

111
0:06:13.146,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that says that isn't possible.

112
0:06:14.646,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We actually think the future is going to be event-driven.

113
0:06:17.79,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So since we can't predict the future,

114
0:06:19.791,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future.

115
0:06:22.83,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I'm very, very intrigued

116
0:06:24.274,000 --> 0:06:28,000
by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle 90 percent of the time:

117
0:06:28.829,000 --> 0:06:3,000
they're parked all around us.

118
0:06:31.052,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They're usually parked within 100 feet of the people that own them.

119
0:06:34.427,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, if you take the power-generating capability of an automobile

120
0:06:38.23,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States,

121
0:06:41.483,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it turns out that the power in four percent of the automobiles

122
0:06:46.1,000 --> 0:06:48,000
equals that of the electric grid of the US.

123
0:06:48.687,000 --> 0:06:5,000
That's a huge power-generating capability,

124
0:06:51.612,000 --> 0:06:53,000
a mobile power-generating capability.

125
0:06:53.742,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity

126
0:06:56.743,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked

127
0:06:59.545,000 --> 0:07:,000
to generate electricity for the grid.

128
0:07:01.546,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We talked about swarm networks earlier.

129
0:07:03.695,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Talk about the ultimate swarm -- having all of the processors

130
0:07:07.096,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and all of the cars when they're sitting idle

131
0:07:09.264,000 --> 0:07:12,000
being part of a global grid for computing capability.

132
0:07:12.79,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We find that premise quite exciting.

133
0:07:15.475,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The automobile becomes, then, an appliance --

134
0:07:17.737,000 --> 0:07:18,000
not in a commodity sense,

135
0:07:19.037,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but an appliance, mobile power, mobile platform

136
0:07:21.83,000 --> 0:07:23,000
for information and computing and communication,

137
0:07:24.469,000 --> 0:07:26,000
as well as a form of transportation.

138
0:07:26.83,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And the key to all of this is to make it affordable,

139
0:07:29.481,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to make it exciting,

140
0:07:30.656,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it.

141
0:07:33.821,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And again, this is a pretty big march to take here.

142
0:07:36.83,000 --> 0:07:37,000
A lot of people say:

143
0:07:38.007,000 --> 0:07:39,000
How do you sleep at night

144
0:07:39.225,000 --> 0:07:41,000
when you're wrestling with a problem of that magnitude?

145
0:07:41.868,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I tell them I sleep like a baby: I wake up crying every two hours.

146
0:07:45.056,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:46.223,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Actually, the theme of this conference, I think,

148
0:07:48.545,000 --> 0:07:5,000
has hit on one of the major keys to pull that off,

149
0:07:50.943,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and that's relationships and working together.

150
0:07:53.157,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Thank you very much.

151
0:07:54.351,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

152
0:07:57.686,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Chris Anderson: Larry, Larry -- wait, wait, wait. Larry, wait one sec.

153
0:08:03.292,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I've got so many questions I could ask you.

154
0:08:05.698,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I just want to ask one.

155
0:08:07.659,000 --> 0:08:08,000
You know, I could be wrong about this,

156
0:08:09.537,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but my sense is that in the public mind today,

157
0:08:13.185,000 --> 0:08:19,000
GM is not viewed as as serious about some of these environmental ideas

158
0:08:19.61,000 --> 0:08:22,000
as some of your Japanese competitors, maybe even as Ford.

159
0:08:24.128,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Are you serious about it,

160
0:08:25.549,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and not just, you know, when the consumers want it,

161
0:08:29.83,000 --> 0:08:31,000
when the regulators force us to do it, we will go there?

162
0:08:32.494,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Will you guys really try and show leadership on this?

163
0:08:35.02,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Larry Burns: Absolutely. We're absolutely serious.

164
0:08:37.432,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We're into this over a billion dollars already,

165
0:08:39.713,000 --> 0:08:41,000
so I would hope people would think we're serious

166
0:08:42.024,000 --> 0:08:43,000
when we're spending that kind of money.

167
0:08:44.033,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And secondly, it's a fundamental business proposition.

168
0:08:47.065,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I'll be honest with you;

169
0:08:48.245,000 --> 0:08:5,000
we're into it for business growth opportunities.

170
0:08:50.57,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We can't grow our business unless we solve these problems.

171
0:08:53.334,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues

172
0:08:56.738,000 --> 0:08:57,000
if we don't solve the problems.

173
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And there's a simple principle of strategy that says:

174
0:09:00.78,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Do unto yourself before others do unto you.

175
0:09:02.853,000 --> 0:09:04,000
If we can see this possible future, others can, too.

176
0:09:05.782,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And we want to be the first one to create it, Chris.

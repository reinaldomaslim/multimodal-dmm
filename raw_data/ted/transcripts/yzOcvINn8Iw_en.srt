1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The fragrance that you will smell, you will never be able to smell this way again.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It’s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which you can find in any store in the nation.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Except here it’s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker,

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I'm most grateful to them for this.

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And it’s been split up in successive bits and a chord.

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So what you’re smelling now is the top note.

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I will show it to you.

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K.

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The lush heart note, Melaleuca bark note -- which does not contain any Melaleuca bark,

13
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because it’s totally forbidden.

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And after that, the complete fragrance.

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now what you are smelling is a combination of --

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I asked how many molecules there were in there, and nobody would tell me.

17
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So I put it through a G.C., a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office,

18
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it’s about 400.

19
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So what you’re smelling is several hundred molecules

20
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
floating through the air, hitting your nose.

21
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And do not get the impression that this is very subjective.

22
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK?

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person.

24
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It’s not really true.

25
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And perfumery shows you that can’t be true,

26
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because if it were like that it wouldn’t be an art, OK?

27
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now, while the smell wafts over you, let me tell you the history of an idea.

28
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Everything that you’re smelling in here

29
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is made up of atoms that come from what I call

30
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the Upper East Side of the periodic table -- a nice, safe neighborhood.

31
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You really don’t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery.

33
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Some people have tried in the 1920s

34
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to add things from the bad parts, and it didn’t really work.

35
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
These are the five atoms from which just about everything

36
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that you’re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of.

37
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning,

38
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the cut-grass green, what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms --

39
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and this would be called a green note,

40
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because it smells of something green, like cut grass.

41
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly

42
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education.

43
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This has six carbon atoms, so "hexa," hexene-1-ol.

44
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end,

45
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
so it’s "ol," and that’s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.

46
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Once you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.

47
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.

48
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
If you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms --

49
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that’s what it looks like when you have it on your computer --

50
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but actually it’s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain

51
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.

52
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?

53
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.

54
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But the first theory is: it must be the shape.

55
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And that’s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that

56
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
almost everything else in biology works by shape.

57
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it’s all, you know,

58
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell.

59
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I will try and explain to you what’s wrong with this notion.

60
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations.

61
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, this is a totally insane idea.

62
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor,

63
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses,

64
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and I’ll explain to you why this was the case.

65
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right --

66
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I’m working on it.

67
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Here’s how shape works in normal receptors.

68
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here,

69
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way

70
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
by binding in certain parts.

71
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein

72
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
cause the motion. This is a shape-based idea.

73
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, what’s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide.

74
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The way --I expect everybody to memorize these compounds.

75
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is one page of work from a chemist’s workbook, OK?

76
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Working for a fragrance company.

77
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
He’s making 45 molecules, and he’s looking for a sandalwood,

78
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
something that smells of sandalwood.

79
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Because there’s a lot of money in sandalwoods.

80
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And of these 45 molecules, only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood.

81
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And he puts an exclamation mark, OK? This is an awful lot of work.

82
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly,

83
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits.

84
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So this is a profoundly inefficient process.

85
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And my definition of a theory is, it’s not just something

86
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that you teach people; it’s labor saving.

87
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
A theory is something that enables you to do less work.

88
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact

89
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well.

90
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. It smells of cut grass.

91
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?

92
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Now, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.

93
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
If it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar.

94
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
This is -- in other words, we never get the O-H --

95
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we never mistake it for an S-H, OK?

96
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Like, at no concentration, even pure, you know,

97
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
if you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn’t smell of rotten eggs.

98
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Conversely, there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka.

99
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It’s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition.

100
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste

101
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
for biology, and he says, "That’s easy! The things are a different color!"

102
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Laughter)

103
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has

104
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
some sort of interest in it. These molecules, as you saw in the beginning,

105
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other.

106
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
In fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies

107
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.

108
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range.

109
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
S-H, quite a different frequency.

110
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Now, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you

111
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this:

112
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK?

113
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, Fact B: nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H.

114
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
If you look on this, imagine a piano keyboard.

115
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The S-H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard

116
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that has been, so to speak, damaged,

117
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and there are no neighboring notes, nothing is close to it.

118
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You have a unique smell, a unique vibration.

119
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So I went searching when I started in this game

120
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility

121
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to this whole crazy story.

122
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule,

123
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that would have that vibration and that -- the obvious prediction

124
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur.

125
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
If it didn’t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things.

126
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now, after searching high and low for several months,

127
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane

128
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
which has exactly the same vibration.

129
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Now the good news is, Boranes you can get hold of.

130
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The bad news is they’re rocket fuels.

131
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air,

132
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK?

133
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

134
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment,

135
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and they wouldn’t have liked it at my college.

136
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
However, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.

137
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And it really does have the same -- if you calculate,

138
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
if you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.

139
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Now, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature,

140
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
there’s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone

141
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.

142
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And in an enormous 40-page paper in German he says, at one point --

143
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
my wife is German and she translated it for me --

144
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and at one point he says, "ganz widerlich Geruch,"

145
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
an "absolutely repulsive smell," which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide.

146
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur

147
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
had been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997, 1998.

148
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now, the slight fly in the ointment is this: that

149
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
if we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose.

150
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now, this is a spectroscope, OK, on my laboratory bench.

151
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose,

152
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this.

153
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And this is the main objection to the theory.

154
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
OK, great, we smell vibrations. How? All right?

155
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something,

156
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
which is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists.

157
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

158
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
This is a joke. I’m a biologist, OK?

159
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So it’s a joke against myself.

160
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company,

161
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money

162
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
on fundamental research, discovered a way

163
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale.

164
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense,

165
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
just a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling.

166
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, I could do the dance of electron tunneling,

167
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but I’ve done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here’s how it works.

168
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Electrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps,

169
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can’t jump.

170
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Unlike us, they won’t fall off the cliff.

171
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
OK. Now. If something absorbs the energy, the electron can travel.

172
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So here you have a system, you have something --

173
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and there’s plenty of that stuff in biology --

174
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
some substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump,

175
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration

176
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
does the reaction happen, OK?

177
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.

178
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology.

179
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In other words, I’ve taken off-the-shelf components,

180
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and I’ve made a spectroscope.

181
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
What’s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind,

182
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is that then it tells you that the nose,

183
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses.

184
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Of course, it doesn’t matter, because it could also be that they’re not.

185
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But it has a certain --

186
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

187
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
-- it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people

188
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
who read too much 19th-century German literature.

189
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And then a magnificent thing happened:

190
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I left academia and joined the real world of business,

191
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and a company was created around my ideas

192
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to make new molecules using my method,

193
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
along the lines of, let’s put someone else’s money where your mouth is.

194
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And one of the first things that happened was

195
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we started going around to fragrance companies

196
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
asking for what they needed, because, of course,

197
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
if you could calculate smell, you don’t need chemists.

198
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right,

199
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
OK? So you can try a thousand molecules,

200
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend,

201
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one.

202
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And so that’s a direct path to making new odorants.

203
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And one of the first things that happened was

204
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
we went to see some perfumers in France --

205
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and here’s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression --

206
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and one of them says, "You cannot make a coumarin."

207
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
He says to me, "I bet you cannot make a coumarin."

208
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now, coumarin is a very common thing, a material,

209
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America.

210
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK?

211
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It’s the molecule that has made men’s fragrances

212
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
smell the way they do since 1881, to be exact.

213
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And the problem is it’s a carcinogen.

214
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So nobody likes particularly to -- you know, aftershave with carcinogens.

215
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Laughter)

216
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
There are some reckless people, but it’s not worth it, OK?

217
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations.

218
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum

219
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
of coumarin, and you smooth it out,

220
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is.

221
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules,

222
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
related or unrelated, that have the same vibrations.

223
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And we actually, in this case, I’m sorry to say,

224
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
it happened -- it was serendipitous.

225
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist

226
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and he said, look, I’ve just found this such a beautiful reaction,

227
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that even if this compound doesn’t smell of coumarin,

228
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I want to do it, it’s just such a nifty,

229
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
one step -- I mean, chemists have weird minds --

230
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
one step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely

231
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
crystalline compound. Let us try it.

232
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And I said, first of all, let me do the calculation on that compound, bottom right,

233
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
which is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule.

234
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Calculate the vibrations, the purple spectrum is that new fellow,

235
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the white one is the old one.

236
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin.

237
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin.

238
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And this is our new baby, called tonkene.

239
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
You see, when you’re a scientist, you’re always selling ideas.

240
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And people are very resistant to ideas, and rightly so.

241
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Why should new ideas be accepted?

242
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers

243
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and it smells like coumarin, and it isn’t coumarin,

244
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and you’ve found it in three weeks,

245
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
this focuses everybody’s mind wonderfully.

246
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Laughter)

247
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Applause)

248
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
And people often ask me, is your theory accepted?

249
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know -- there’s three attitudes:

250
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
You’re right, and I don’t know why, which is the most rational one at this point.

251
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
You’re right, and I don’t care how you do it, in a sense;

252
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
you bring me the molecules, you know.

253
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And: You’re completely wrong, and I’m sure you’re completely wrong.

254
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
OK? Now, we’re dealing with people who only want results,

255
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and this is the commercial world.

256
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And they tell us that even if we do it by astrology, they’re happy.

257
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But we’re not actually doing it by astrology.

258
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But for the last three years, I’ve had what I consider to be

259
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
the best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby --

260
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
which is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things --

261
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
plus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry

262
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
at the service of something that actually works.

263
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Thank you very much.

264
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Applause)

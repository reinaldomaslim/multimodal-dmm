1
0:00:12.564,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My job is to design, build and study robots that communicate with people.

2
0:00:17.231,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But this story doesn't start with robotics at all, it starts with animation.

3
0:00:20.874,000 --> 0:00:22,000
When I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,"

4
0:00:23.267,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I was amazed by how much emotion they could put

5
0:00:25.997,000 --> 0:00:27,000
into something as trivial as a desk lamp.

6
0:00:29.477,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I mean, look at them -- at the end of this movie,

7
0:00:31.846,000 --> 0:00:33,000
you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture.

8
0:00:34.649,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:35.954,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I said, I have to learn how to do this.

10
0:00:38.006,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So I made a really bad career decision.

11
0:00:40.257,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:41.475,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And that's what my mom was like when I did it.

13
0:00:43.692,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:45.857,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company

15
0:00:49.302,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I moved to New York to study animation.

16
0:00:51.618,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And there I lived

17
0:00:52.793,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates.

18
0:00:55.635,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I'm not using this phrase metaphorically --

19
0:00:57.683,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room.

20
0:01:00.436,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Whenever they did news stories about building violations in New York,

21
0:01:03.702,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they would put the report in front of our building,

22
0:01:06.142,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as kind of, like, a backdrop to show how bad things are.

23
0:01:08.903,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Anyway, during the day, I went to school

24
0:01:10.864,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation.

25
0:01:14.315,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I learned two surprising lessons.

26
0:01:16.524,000 --> 0:01:2,000
One of them was that when you want to arouse emotions,

27
0:01:21.038,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it doesn't matter so much how something looks;

28
0:01:23.237,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it's all in the motion, in the timing of how the thing moves.

29
0:01:26.816,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And the second was something one of our teachers told us.

30
0:01:30.03,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."

31
0:01:32.662,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And he said, "As an animator, you're not a director -- you're an actor."

32
0:01:36.895,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So, if you want to find the right motion for a character,

33
0:01:39.942,000 --> 0:01:41,000
don't think about it -- go use your body to find it.

34
0:01:42.411,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Stand in front of a mirror, act it out in front of a camera --

35
0:01:45.368,000 --> 0:01:47,000
whatever you need -- and then put it back in your character.

36
0:01:48.696,000 --> 0:01:51,000
A year later I found myself at MIT in the Robotic Life Group.

37
0:01:51.932,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It was one of the first groups researching the relationships

38
0:01:54.814,000 --> 0:01:55,000
between humans and robots.

39
0:01:56.152,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I still had this dream to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.

40
0:02:00.132,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But I found that robots didn't move at all in this engaging way

41
0:02:03.148,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that I was used to from my animation studies.

42
0:02:05.347,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Instead, they were all -- how should I put it --

43
0:02:07.835,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they were all kind of robotic.

44
0:02:09.313,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:11.211,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I thought, what if I took whatever I learned in animation school,

46
0:02:14.971,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and used that to design my robotic desk lamp.

47
0:02:17.598,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I went and designed frame by frame

48
0:02:19.667,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible.

49
0:02:24.199,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop --

50
0:02:27.932,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and I'm actually redesigning the robot,

51
0:02:29.992,000 --> 0:02:3,000
so, unbeknownst to itself,

52
0:02:31.82,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me.

53
0:02:34.419,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:36.449,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light,

55
0:02:39.712,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and more of a helpful, kind of quiet apprentice

56
0:02:42.754,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere.

57
0:02:45.947,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And when, for example, I'm looking for a battery that I can't find,

58
0:02:49.306,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in a subtle way, it'll show me where the battery is.

59
0:02:53.872,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So you can see my confusion here.

60
0:02:56.442,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I'm not an actor.

61
0:03:00.585,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure

62
0:03:03.642,000 --> 0:03:05,000
can, at one point, just by the way it moves,

63
0:03:05.753,000 --> 0:03:07,000
seem gentle and caring and in the other case,

64
0:03:07.921,000 --> 0:03:09,000
seem violent and confrontational.

65
0:03:10.316,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And it's the same structure, just the motion is different.

66
0:03:19.419,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Actor: "You want to know something? Well, you want to know something?

67
0:03:24.015,000 --> 0:03:25,000
He was already dead!

68
0:03:25.928,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Just laying there, eyes glazed over!"

69
0:03:29.854,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:30.899,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But, moving in a graceful way is just one building block

71
0:03:33.979,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of this whole structure called human-robot interaction.

72
0:03:36.598,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I was, at the time, doing my PhD, I was working on human-robot teamwork,

73
0:03:40.075,000 --> 0:03:42,000
teams of humans and robots working together.

74
0:03:42.161,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I was studying the engineering,

75
0:03:43.82,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the psychology, the philosophy of teamwork,

76
0:03:46.376,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and at the same time,

77
0:03:47.551,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation,

78
0:03:50.069,000 --> 0:03:52,000
with a good friend of mine, who's actually here.

79
0:03:52.345,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And in that situation, we can easily imagine robots

80
0:03:54.773,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in the near future being there with us.

81
0:03:56.697,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It was after a Passover Seder.

82
0:03:58.411,000 --> 0:04:,000
We were folding up a lot of folding chairs,

83
0:04:00.49,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm.

84
0:04:03.172,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Everybody did their own part, we didn't have to divide our tasks.

85
0:04:06.306,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We didn't have to communicate verbally about this --

86
0:04:08.776,000 --> 0:04:09,000
it all just happened.

87
0:04:09.989,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I thought, humans and robots don't look at all like this.

88
0:04:12.893,000 --> 0:04:15,000
When humans and robots interact, it's much more like a chess game:

89
0:04:16.048,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the human does a thing, the robot analyzes whatever the human did,

90
0:04:19.193,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the robot decides what to do next, plans it and does it.

91
0:04:21.86,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Then the human waits, until it's their turn again.

92
0:04:24.239,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So it's much more like a chess game, and that makes sense,

93
0:04:26.994,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists.

94
0:04:30.129,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's all about information, analysis, decision-making and planning.

95
0:04:33.581,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player,

96
0:04:37.335,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and more like a doer

97
0:04:39.152,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that just clicks and works together.

98
0:04:41.177,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So I made my second horrible career choice:

99
0:04:44.57,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I decided to study acting for a semester.

100
0:04:47.147,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I took off from the PhD, I went to acting classes.

101
0:04:50.09,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I actually participated in a play --

102
0:04:52.152,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I hope there’s no video of that around still.

103
0:04:54.478,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:55.54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I got every book I could find about acting,

105
0:04:57.858,000 --> 0:05:,000
including one from the 19th century that I got from the library.

106
0:05:01.011,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And I was really amazed, because my name was the second name on the list --

107
0:05:04.648,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the previous name was in 1889.

108
0:05:06.672,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:07.711,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And this book was kind of waiting for 100 years

110
0:05:09.984,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to be rediscovered for robotics.

111
0:05:12.34,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And this book shows actors

112
0:05:13.94,000 --> 0:05:15,000
how to move every muscle in the body

113
0:05:16.202,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to match every kind of emotion that they want to express.

114
0:05:18.942,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But the real revelation was when I learned about method acting.

115
0:05:21.992,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It became very popular in the 20th century.

116
0:05:24.269,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And method acting said

117
0:05:25.444,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you don't have to plan every muscle in your body;

118
0:05:27.768,000 --> 0:05:29,000
instead, you have to use your body to find the right movement.

119
0:05:30.737,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions

120
0:05:33.641,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and kind of think with your body to find the right expression --

121
0:05:36.703,000 --> 0:05:37,000
improvise, play off your scene partner.

122
0:05:38.602,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And this came at the same time

123
0:05:40.071,000 --> 0:05:43,000
as I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology,

124
0:05:43.201,000 --> 0:05:46,000
called embodied cognition, which also talks about the same ideas.

125
0:05:46.477,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We use our bodies to think;

126
0:05:48.016,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move,

127
0:05:50.997,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but our bodies feed back into our brain

128
0:05:52.939,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to generate the way that we behave.

129
0:05:55.128,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And it was like a lightning bolt.

130
0:05:56.748,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I went back to my office,

131
0:05:57.986,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I wrote this paper, which I never really published,

132
0:06:00.415,000 --> 0:06:02,000
called "Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence."

133
0:06:02.971,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And I even took another month

134
0:06:04.376,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to do what was then the first theater play

135
0:06:06.844,000 --> 0:06:07,000
with a human and a robot acting together.

136
0:06:08.821,000 --> 0:06:1,000
That's what you saw before with the actors.

137
0:06:12.564,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And I thought:

138
0:06:13.739,000 --> 0:06:15,000
How can we make an artificial intelligence model --

139
0:06:16.7,000 --> 0:06:17,000
a computer, computational model --

140
0:06:18.707,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that will model some of these ideas of improvisation,

141
0:06:21.238,000 --> 0:06:22,000
of taking risks, of taking chances,

142
0:06:23.092,000 --> 0:06:24,000
even of making mistakes?

143
0:06:24.643,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates.

144
0:06:27.28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So I worked for quite a long time on these models

145
0:06:29.908,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and I implemented them on a number of robots.

146
0:06:32.327,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Here you can see a very early example

147
0:06:34.652,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence

148
0:06:38.255,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to try to match my movements as closely as possible.

149
0:06:40.742,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's sort of like a game.

150
0:06:42.53,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Let's look at it.

151
0:06:47.652,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You can see when I psych it out, it gets fooled.

152
0:06:51.698,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And it's a little bit like what you might see actors do

153
0:06:54.317,000 --> 0:06:55,000
when they try to mirror each other

154
0:06:55.975,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to find the right synchrony between them.

155
0:06:58.364,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And then, I did another experiment,

156
0:07:00.22,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp,

157
0:07:04.303,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence.

158
0:07:07.921,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So, I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot.

159
0:07:12.543,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The robot is the same lamp that you saw,

160
0:07:14.519,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and I put two brains in it.

161
0:07:15.882,000 --> 0:07:16,000
For one half of the people,

162
0:07:17.633,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I put in a brain that's kind of the traditional,

163
0:07:20.593,000 --> 0:07:21,000
calculated robotic brain.

164
0:07:21.846,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It waits for its turn, it analyzes everything, it plans.

165
0:07:24.51,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Let's call it the calculated brain.

166
0:07:26.216,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The other got more the stage actor, risk-taker brain.

167
0:07:29.487,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Let's call it the adventurous brain.

168
0:07:31.633,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know.

169
0:07:34.594,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them.

170
0:07:36.91,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost 20 minutes,

171
0:07:40.852,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and they had to work together,

172
0:07:42.352,000 --> 0:07:44,000
somehow simulating, like, a factory job

173
0:07:44.929,000 --> 0:07:46,000
of repetitively doing the same thing.

174
0:07:47.445,000 --> 0:07:5,000
What I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot.

175
0:07:50.8,000 --> 0:07:51,000
They thought it was more intelligent,

176
0:07:52.601,000 --> 0:07:54,000
more committed, a better member of the team,

177
0:07:54.731,000 --> 0:07:56,000
contributed to the success of the team more.

178
0:07:56.82,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They even called it "he" and "she,"

179
0:07:58.552,000 --> 0:08:,000
whereas people with the calculated brain

180
0:08:00.697,000 --> 0:08:02,000
called it "it," and nobody ever called it "he" or "she."

181
0:08:03.876,000 --> 0:08:06,000
When they talked about it after the task, with the adventurous brain,

182
0:08:07.193,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they said, "By the end, we were good friends and high-fived mentally."

183
0:08:11.397,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Whatever that means.

184
0:08:12.714,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:14.644,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Sounds painful.

186
0:08:16.021,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Whereas the people with the calculated brain

187
0:08:18.783,000 --> 0:08:2,000
said it was just like a lazy apprentice.

188
0:08:21.165,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more,

189
0:08:23.934,000 --> 0:08:25,000
which is almost what people expect robots to do,

190
0:08:26.307,000 --> 0:08:29,000
so I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots

191
0:08:29.886,000 --> 0:08:32,000
than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing.

192
0:08:34.027,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And in a way, I thought, maybe it's time --

193
0:08:36.066,000 --> 0:08:38,000
just like method acting changed the way people thought

194
0:08:39.052,000 --> 0:08:4,000
about acting in the 19th century,

195
0:08:40.672,000 --> 0:08:43,000
from going from the very calculated, planned way of behaving,

196
0:08:43.773,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to a more intuitive, risk-taking, embodied way of behaving --

197
0:08:47.295,000 --> 0:08:5,000
maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution.

198
0:08:51.994,000 --> 0:08:54,000
A few years later, I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,

199
0:08:55.617,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians.

200
0:08:58.465,000 --> 0:09:,000
And I thought, music: that's the perfect place

201
0:09:00.849,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to look at teamwork, coordination, timing, improvisation --

202
0:09:05.016,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and we just got this robot playing marimba.

203
0:09:07.483,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And the marimba, for everybody like me,

204
0:09:09.763,000 --> 0:09:11,000
it was this huge, wooden xylophone.

205
0:09:12.526,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And when I was looking at this,

206
0:09:14.613,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I looked at other works in human-robot improvisation --

207
0:09:17.635,000 --> 0:09:19,000
yes, there are other works in human-robot improvisation --

208
0:09:20.406,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and they were also a little bit like a chess game.

209
0:09:22.779,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The human would play,

210
0:09:23.954,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the robot analyzed what was played,

211
0:09:26.151,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and would improvise their own part.

212
0:09:28.254,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So, this is what musicians called a call-and-response interaction,

213
0:09:31.416,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence.

214
0:09:35.187,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But I thought, if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play

215
0:09:38.464,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and in the teamwork studies,

216
0:09:40.232,000 --> 0:09:43,000
maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band.

217
0:09:43.906,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Everybody's riffing off each other, nobody is stopping for a moment.

218
0:09:48.198,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And so I tried to do the same things, this time with music,

219
0:09:51.096,000 --> 0:09:53,000
where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play,

220
0:09:53.954,000 --> 0:09:56,000
it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play,

221
0:09:56.995,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and does what my jazz teacher when I was 17 taught me.

222
0:09:59.558,000 --> 0:10:,000
She said, when you improvise,

223
0:10:00.979,000 --> 0:10:03,000
sometimes you don't know what you're doing, and you still do it.

224
0:10:04.019,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing,

225
0:10:07.369,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but is still doing it.

226
0:10:08.614,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So let's look at a few seconds from this performance,

227
0:10:11.149,000 --> 0:10:13,000
where the robot listens to the human musician

228
0:10:13.3,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and improvises.

229
0:10:14.489,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And then, look how the human musician also responds

230
0:10:17.488,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to what the robot is doing

231
0:10:18.785,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and picking up from its behavior,

232
0:10:21.453,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with.

233
0:10:25.433,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Music)

234
0:11:07.618,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Music ends)

235
0:11:11.134,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Applause)

236
0:11:16.892,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Being a musician is not just about making notes,

237
0:11:19.166,000 --> 0:11:21,000
otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show.

238
0:11:21.538,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Musicians also communicate with their bodies,

239
0:11:23.684,000 --> 0:11:25,000
with other band members, with the audience,

240
0:11:25.725,000 --> 0:11:27,000
they use their bodies to express the music.

241
0:11:27.763,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And I thought, we already have a robot musician on stage,

242
0:11:30.484,000 --> 0:11:32,000
why not make it be a full-fledged musician?

243
0:11:32.82,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I started designing a socially expressive head

244
0:11:35.518,000 --> 0:11:36,000
for the robot.

245
0:11:36.885,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The head doesn’t actually touch the marimba,

246
0:11:38.979,000 --> 0:11:39,000
it just expresses what the music is like.

247
0:11:40.962,000 --> 0:11:42,000
These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta

248
0:11:43.482,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that was dangerously located exactly halfway

249
0:11:46.049,000 --> 0:11:47,000
between my lab and my home.

250
0:11:47.884,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So I spent, I would say, on average, three to four hours a day there.

251
0:11:51.846,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I think.

252
0:11:53.057,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Laughter)

253
0:11:54.917,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out

254
0:11:57.823,000 --> 0:11:59,000
not just what a robotic musician would look like,

255
0:12:00.217,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but especially what a robotic musician would move like,

256
0:12:02.866,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing --

257
0:12:06.292,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment.

258
0:12:10.141,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot, which was nice.

259
0:12:14.668,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance,

260
0:12:17.296,000 --> 0:12:19,000
this time with a socially expressive head.

261
0:12:19.36,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And notice one thing --

262
0:12:21.184,000 --> 0:12:22,000
how the robot is really showing us

263
0:12:22.879,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the beat it's picking up from the human,

264
0:12:24.809,000 --> 0:12:27,000
while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing.

265
0:12:28.76,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And also how it changes the way it moves

266
0:12:30.704,000 --> 0:12:31,000
as soon as it starts its own solo.

267
0:12:32.68,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Music)

268
0:12:36.6,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Now it's looking at me, showing that it's listening.

269
0:12:39.644,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Music)

270
0:13:01.181,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Now look at the final chord of the piece again.

271
0:13:04.126,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And this time the robot communicates with its body

272
0:13:07.067,000 --> 0:13:09,000
when it's busy doing its own thing,

273
0:13:09.204,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and when it's ready to coordinate the final chord with me.

274
0:13:14.079,000 --> 0:13:16,000
(Music)

275
0:13:21.783,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Music ending)

276
0:13:26.103,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Final chord)

277
0:13:27.128,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

278
0:13:32.906,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Thanks.

279
0:13:34.085,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I hope you see

280
0:13:35.69,000 --> 0:13:39,000
how much this part of the body that doesn't touch the instrument

281
0:13:40.11,000 --> 0:13:42,000
actually helps with the musical performance.

282
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And at some point -- we are in Atlanta,

283
0:13:45.193,000 --> 0:13:48,000
so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point --

284
0:13:48.467,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot.

285
0:13:53.284,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat.

286
0:13:57.356,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Notice two things:

287
0:13:58.531,000 --> 0:14:01,000
one, how irresistible it is to join the robot while it's moving its head.

288
0:14:02.164,000 --> 0:14:04,000
You kind of want to move your own head when it does it.

289
0:14:04.791,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And second, even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone,

290
0:14:08.401,000 --> 0:14:11,000
as soon as the robot turns to him, he turns back.

291
0:14:11.535,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So even though it's just in the periphery of his vision,

292
0:14:14.195,000 --> 0:14:16,000
in the corner of his eye, it's very powerful.

293
0:14:16.339,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And the reason is that we can't ignore

294
0:14:18.197,000 --> 0:14:2,000
physical things moving in our environment.

295
0:14:20.245,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We are wired for that.

296
0:14:21.439,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So if you have a problem --

297
0:14:23.107,000 --> 0:14:27,000
maybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much --

298
0:14:27.806,000 --> 0:14:29,000
you might want to have a robot there to get their attention.

299
0:14:30.664,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Laughter)

300
0:14:31.689,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Music)

301
0:14:46.113,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Music ends)

302
0:14:50.138,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Applause)

303
0:14:57.633,000 --> 0:15:,000
Just to introduce the last robot that we've worked on,

304
0:15:01.491,000 --> 0:15:03,000
it came out of something surprising that we found:

305
0:15:03.865,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Some point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent,

306
0:15:07.047,000 --> 0:15:08,000
able to improvise and listen,

307
0:15:08.473,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing.

308
0:15:12.903,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They really liked that the robot was enjoying the music.

309
0:15:15.608,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Laughter)

310
0:15:16.633,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And they didn't say the robot was moving to the music,

311
0:15:19.202,000 --> 0:15:2,000
they said "enjoying" the music.

312
0:15:20.714,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And we thought, why don't we take this idea,

313
0:15:22.864,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and I designed a new piece of furniture.

314
0:15:25.629,000 --> 0:15:27,000
This time it wasn't a desk lamp, it was a speaker dock,

315
0:15:28.225,000 --> 0:15:3,000
one of those things you plug your smartphone in.

316
0:15:30.889,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And I thought,

317
0:15:32.063,000 --> 0:15:35,000
what would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you,

318
0:15:35.587,000 --> 0:15:37,000
but would actually enjoy it, too?

319
0:15:37.657,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And so again, here are some animation tests from an early stage.

320
0:15:41.842,000 --> 0:15:42,000
(Laughter)

321
0:15:43.835,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And this is what the final product looked like.

322
0:15:58.247,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Music)

323
0:16:18.848,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Music ends)

324
0:16:21.461,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So, a lot of bobbing heads.

325
0:16:24.105,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Applause)

326
0:16:27.74,000 --> 0:16:28,000
A lot of bobbing heads in the audience,

327
0:16:29.654,000 --> 0:16:31,000
so we can still see robots influence people.

328
0:16:32.386,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And it's not just fun and games.

329
0:16:35.195,000 --> 0:16:37,000
I think one of the reasons I care so much

330
0:16:37.42,000 --> 0:16:39,000
about robots that use their body to communicate

331
0:16:39.677,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and use their body to move is --

332
0:16:41.407,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding --

333
0:16:44.821,000 --> 0:16:46,000
is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot

334
0:16:47.638,000 --> 0:16:48,000
at some point in your life.

335
0:16:49.254,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Somewhere in your future, there will be a robot in your life.

336
0:16:52.211,000 --> 0:16:53,000
If not in yours, your children's lives.

337
0:16:54.103,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And I want these robots to be more fluent, more engaging, more graceful

338
0:16:59.117,000 --> 0:17:,000
than currently they seem to be.

339
0:17:00.87,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And for that I think maybe robots need to be less like chess players

340
0:17:04.181,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and more like stage actors and more like musicians.

341
0:17:06.846,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise.

342
0:17:09.683,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Maybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do.

343
0:17:12.731,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them,

344
0:17:16.103,000 --> 0:17:17,000
because in the end, we are human.

345
0:17:18.015,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And maybe as humans, robots that are a little less than perfect

346
0:17:21.593,000 --> 0:17:22,000
are just perfect for us.

347
0:17:23.348,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Thank you.

348
0:17:24.531,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Applause)

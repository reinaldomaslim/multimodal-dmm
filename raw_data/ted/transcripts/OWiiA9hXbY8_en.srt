1
0:00:12.787,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Have you ever watched a flock of birds work together?

2
0:00:18.49,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Thousands of animals, flying in perfect synchrony:

3
0:00:24.142,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Isn't it fascinating?

4
0:00:27.2,000 --> 0:00:32,000
What I find remarkable is that these birds would not be able to do that

5
0:00:32.357,000 --> 0:00:34,000
if they all would have to follow one leader.

6
0:00:36.185,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Their reaction speed would simply be too low.

7
0:00:40.07,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Instead, scientists believe that these birds are aligned on

8
0:00:44.618,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a few simple rules,

9
0:00:47.353,000 --> 0:00:51,000
allowing every single bird to make autonomous decisions

10
0:00:52.069,000 --> 0:00:54,000
while still flying in perfect synchrony.

11
0:00:55.275,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Their alignment enables their autonomy,

12
0:00:59.003,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and their autonomy makes them fast and flexible.

13
0:01:04.309,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, what does this have to do with any one of us?

14
0:01:09.248,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Well, it's one way of illustrating what I believe to be the most important change

15
0:01:15.418,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that is needed in ways of working today.

16
0:01:19.123,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The world is getting faster and more complex,

17
0:01:22.245,000 --> 0:01:24,000
so we need a new way of working,

18
0:01:24.622,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a way that creates alignment around purpose,

19
0:01:28.396,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that takes out bureaucracy

20
0:01:30.289,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and that truly empowers people to make decisions faster.

21
0:01:35.591,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But the question is:

22
0:01:37.474,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In order to get there,

23
0:01:40.101,000 --> 0:01:42,000
what are we willing to give up?

24
0:01:44.087,000 --> 0:01:46,000
A few years ago, I was working with a bank

25
0:01:47.021,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that wanted to embark on a digital transformation.

26
0:01:50.342,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They wanted their offering to be simpler, more intuitive, more relevant.

27
0:01:55.913,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, I'm not sure how many of you have seen a bank from the inside,

28
0:02:01.078,000 --> 0:02:04,000
so let me try to illustrate what many traditional banks look like.

29
0:02:05.857,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You see lots of people in suits

30
0:02:08.968,000 --> 0:02:11,000
taking elevators to go to their department,

31
0:02:12.229,000 --> 0:02:16,000
marketers sitting with marketers, engineers with engineers, etc.

32
0:02:17.526,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You see meetings with 20 people

33
0:02:19.86,000 --> 0:02:21,000
where nothing gets decided.

34
0:02:22.266,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Great ideas? They end up in PowerPoint parking lots.

35
0:02:26.978,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And there are endless handovers between departments.

36
0:02:31.658,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Getting anything done can take forever.

37
0:02:35.988,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So this bank knew that in order to transform,

38
0:02:39.432,000 --> 0:02:41,000
they would have to improve their time to market

39
0:02:42.096,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by drastically changing their ways of working as well.

40
0:02:46.89,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But how?

41
0:02:49.071,000 --> 0:02:52,000
To get some inspiration, we decided to go and have a look at companies

42
0:02:52.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that seem to be more innovative,

43
0:02:54.777,000 --> 0:02:57,000
like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos.

44
0:02:59.24,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And I remember how we were walking the halls at one of these companies

45
0:03:02.863,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in December 2014,

46
0:03:04.878,000 --> 0:03:06,000
a management consultant and a team of bankers.

47
0:03:08.337,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We felt like strangers in a strange land,

48
0:03:10.977,000 --> 0:03:12,000
surrounded by beanbags and hoodies

49
0:03:13.125,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and lots of smart, creative employees.

50
0:03:16.262,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So then we asked, "How is your company organized?"

51
0:03:19.808,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And we expected to get an org chart.

52
0:03:22.018,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But instead, they used strange drawings

53
0:03:25.53,000 --> 0:03:28,000
with funny names like "squads" and "chapters" and "tribes"

54
0:03:29.283,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to explain how they were organized.

55
0:03:31.779,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So then we tried to translate that to our own world.

56
0:03:35.518,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We asked, "How many people are working for you?"

57
0:03:39.858,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"It depends."

58
0:03:41.533,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"Who do you report to?"

59
0:03:43.97,000 --> 0:03:44,000
"It depends."

60
0:03:45.94,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"Who decides on your priorities?"

61
0:03:48.919,000 --> 0:03:49,000
"It depends."

62
0:03:50.785,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You can imagine our surprise.

63
0:03:52.597,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We were asking for what we thought were some of the basic principles

64
0:03:55.981,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of organizations,

65
0:03:57.178,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and their answer was, "It depends."

66
0:04:01.404,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now, over the course of that day,

67
0:04:03.037,000 --> 0:04:05,000
we gained a better understanding of their model.

68
0:04:05.572,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They believed in the power of small, autonomous teams.

69
0:04:09.514,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Their teams were like mini-start-ups.

70
0:04:11.463,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They had product people and IT engineers in the same team

71
0:04:15.093,000 --> 0:04:18,000
so they could design, build and test ideas with customers

72
0:04:18.799,000 --> 0:04:2,000
independently of others in the company.

73
0:04:21.439,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They did not need handovers between departments.

74
0:04:24.065,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They had all the skills needed right there in the team.

75
0:04:29.033,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, at the end of that day, we had a session

76
0:04:31.919,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to reflect on what we had learned.

77
0:04:34.644,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And we had started to like their model,

78
0:04:36.573,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so we were already thinking of how to apply some of these ideas to a bank.

79
0:04:42.106,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But then, one of the hosts, a guy who had not said a word all day,

80
0:04:46.296,000 --> 0:04:47,000
he suddenly said,

81
0:04:48.083,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"So I see you like our model.

82
0:04:50.059,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But I have one question for you:

83
0:04:52.941,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What are you willing to give up?"

84
0:04:56.989,000 --> 0:04:57,000
What were we willing to give up?

85
0:04:59.627,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We did not have an answer immediately, but we knew he was right.

86
0:05:03.574,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Change is not only about embracing the new;

87
0:05:06.392,000 --> 0:05:09,000
it's about giving up on some of the old as well.

88
0:05:11.013,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now, over the past five years,

89
0:05:13.102,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I have worked with companies all over the world

90
0:05:15.551,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to change their ways of working.

91
0:05:17.658,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And clearly, every company has their own skeptics

92
0:05:21.003,000 --> 0:05:23,000
about why this is not going to work for them.

93
0:05:24.581,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"Our product is more complex,"

94
0:05:26.595,000 --> 0:05:29,000
or "They don't have the legacy IT like we do,"

95
0:05:29.772,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or "Regulators just won't allow this in our industry."

96
0:05:34.323,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But for this bank and also for the other companies

97
0:05:37.157,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that I have worked with afterwards,

98
0:05:38.865,000 --> 0:05:4,000
change was possible.

99
0:05:41.771,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Within a year, we completely blew up the old silos

100
0:05:45.424,000 --> 0:05:47,000
between marketing, product, channels and IT.

101
0:05:48.438,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Three thousand employees were reorganized into 350 multidisciplinary teams.

102
0:05:55.241,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So instead of product people sitting just with product people

103
0:05:58.332,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and engineers with engineers,

104
0:06:00.241,000 --> 0:06:04,000
a product person and an engineer were now members of the same team.

105
0:06:04.927,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You could be a member of a team responsible for account opening

106
0:06:08.072,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or for the mobile banking app, etc.

107
0:06:12.668,000 --> 0:06:14,000
At the go-live date of that new organization,

108
0:06:15.691,000 --> 0:06:18,000
some people were shaking hands for the very first time,

109
0:06:19.844,000 --> 0:06:23,000
only to find out that they had been sitting two minutes away from each other

110
0:06:24.13,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but they were sending each other emails and status reports for the last 10 years.

111
0:06:29.815,000 --> 0:06:3,000
You would hear someone saying,

112
0:06:31.269,000 --> 0:06:34,000
"Ah, so you're the guy that I was always chasing for answers."

113
0:06:34.677,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

114
0:06:36.058,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But now, they're having coffee together every day.

115
0:06:40.199,000 --> 0:06:43,000
If the product guy has an idea, he can just raise it

116
0:06:43.254,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to get input from the engineer who is sitting right next to him.

117
0:06:47.722,000 --> 0:06:5,000
They can decide to test with customers immediately --

118
0:06:51.377,000 --> 0:06:54,000
no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape,

119
0:06:54.974,000 --> 0:06:56,000
just getting stuff done.

120
0:06:58.806,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now, getting there is not easy.

121
0:07:01.636,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And as it turns out,

122
0:07:03.274,000 --> 0:07:04,000
"What are you willing to give up?"

123
0:07:04.974,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is exactly the right question to ask.

124
0:07:08.761,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Autonomous decision-making requires multidisciplinary teams.

125
0:07:13.458,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Instead of decisions going up and down the organization,

126
0:07:16.578,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we want the team to decide.

127
0:07:18.429,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But to do so, we need all the skills and expertise for that decision

128
0:07:22.627,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in the team.

129
0:07:24.225,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And this brings difficult trade-offs.

130
0:07:27.077,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Can we physically co-locate our people who are working in different buildings,

131
0:07:30.998,000 --> 0:07:32,000
different cities or even different countries today?

132
0:07:33.504,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Or should we invest in better videoconferencing?

133
0:07:36.51,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And how do we ensure consistency in the way we do things

134
0:07:40.167,000 --> 0:07:41,000
across these teams?

135
0:07:42.092,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We still need some kind of management matrix.

136
0:07:46.487,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now, all these changes to structure and process and procedure --

137
0:07:52.24,000 --> 0:07:53,000
they are not easy.

138
0:07:54.515,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But in the end,

139
0:07:56.476,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I found that the most difficult thing to change

140
0:07:59.83,000 --> 0:08:,000
is our own behavior.

141
0:08:02.961,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Let me try to illustrate.

142
0:08:05.216,000 --> 0:08:09,000
If we want these teams to be fast, flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up,

143
0:08:09.543,000 --> 0:08:12,000
they have to be empowered and autonomous.

144
0:08:13.321,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But this means we cannot have leaders commanding their people what to do,

145
0:08:17.464,000 --> 0:08:18,000
when to do, how to do.

146
0:08:19.314,000 --> 0:08:2,000
No micromanagers.

147
0:08:21.749,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But it also means that each employee needs to become a leader,

148
0:08:26.594,000 --> 0:08:28,000
regardless of their formal title.

149
0:08:28.77,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's about all of us stepping up to take initiative.

150
0:08:34.208,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now obviously, we also cannot afford

151
0:08:37.139,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to have all these teams running in different directions,

152
0:08:40.257,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because that would certainly lead to chaos.

153
0:08:43.704,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So we need alignment and autonomy at the same time,

154
0:08:48.506,000 --> 0:08:49,000
just like a flock of birds.

155
0:08:51.594,000 --> 0:08:53,000
In an organizational setting,

156
0:08:53.895,000 --> 0:08:54,000
this requires new behaviors,

157
0:08:55.689,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and with each new behavior,

158
0:08:57.819,000 --> 0:08:59,000
there is giving up on something old as well.

159
0:09:01.751,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Leaders have to make sure that everyone in the organization

160
0:09:05.777,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is aligned around the overall purpose -- the why --

161
0:09:08.969,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and the overall priorities -- the what.

162
0:09:11.281,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But then they have to let go and trust their teams

163
0:09:15.113,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to make the right decisions on how to get there.

164
0:09:19.633,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Now, creating alignment requires open and transparent communication.

165
0:09:24.992,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But you know how they say that information is a source of power?

166
0:09:29.189,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Well, for some managers,

167
0:09:30.933,000 --> 0:09:34,000
sharing information may feel as if they're giving up that source of power.

168
0:09:36.237,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And it's not just managers.

169
0:09:38.312,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The teams need to communicate openly and transparently as well.

170
0:09:42.315,000 --> 0:09:45,000
In these companies, the teams typically work in short sprints,

171
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and at the end of every sprint, they organize a demo session

172
0:09:49.253,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to share the output of what they've done, transparently.

173
0:09:53.587,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And every day,

174
0:09:55.261,000 --> 0:09:57,000
each member of the team gives an update

175
0:09:57.54,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of what they are working on individually.

176
0:10:01.225,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now, all this transparency can be uncomfortable for people,

177
0:10:06.016,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because suddenly, there is no place to hide anymore.

178
0:10:09.999,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Everything we do is transparent for everyone.

179
0:10:14.867,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So, alignment is not easy,

180
0:10:17.096,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and providing autonomy is not so obvious, either.

181
0:10:21.157,000 --> 0:10:22,000
One executive at another company

182
0:10:23.151,000 --> 0:10:27,000
likes to explain how he used to be a master of milestone-tracking.

183
0:10:28.238,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now, today, to know how things are going,

184
0:10:32.139,000 --> 0:10:34,000
instead of looking at status reports,

185
0:10:34.229,000 --> 0:10:38,000
he needs to walk down to the team floors to attend one of their sessions.

186
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And instead of telling people what to do,

187
0:10:40.696,000 --> 0:10:41,000
he looks for ways to help them.

188
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:44,000
That is radical change

189
0:10:44.794,000 --> 0:10:47,000
for someone who used to be a master of milestone-tracking.

190
0:10:49.777,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But in the old world, this executive said,

191
0:10:52.362,000 --> 0:10:54,000
"I only had the illusion of control.

192
0:10:54.927,000 --> 0:10:59,000
In reality, many projects would run over time and over budget, anyway.

193
0:11:00.5,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Now I have much more transparency,

194
0:11:02.766,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and I can course-correct much earlier if needed."

195
0:11:07.228,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And middle managers need to change as well.

196
0:11:10.201,000 --> 0:11:13,000
First of all, without the handovers and the PowerPoint,

197
0:11:13.291,000 --> 0:11:15,000
there's less of a need for middle managers.

198
0:11:15.863,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And in the old world, there was this idea of thinkers and doers.

199
0:11:19.752,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Employees would just follow orders.

200
0:11:22.554,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But now, instead of only managing other people,

201
0:11:26.388,000 --> 0:11:29,000
middle managers were expected to become player-coaches.

202
0:11:30.408,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So imagine, for the last 10 years,

203
0:11:33.372,000 --> 0:11:35,000
you have just been telling other people what to do,

204
0:11:36.159,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but now you're expected to do things yourself again.

205
0:11:40.554,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Clearly, this model is not for everyone,

206
0:11:42.555,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and some great people leave the company.

207
0:11:45.609,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But the result is a new culture

208
0:11:47.531,000 --> 0:11:48,000
with less hierarchy.

209
0:11:50.813,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And all of this is hard work.

210
0:11:54.272,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But it's worth it.

211
0:11:55.83,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The companies that I worked with,

212
0:11:57.684,000 --> 0:12:01,000
they were used to deploying new product features a few times per year.

213
0:12:02.007,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now they have releases every few weeks,

214
0:12:05.03,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and without the handovers and the red tape,

215
0:12:07.513,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the whole organization becomes more efficient.

216
0:12:10.296,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And finally, if you walk the halls of these companies today,

217
0:12:13.95,000 --> 0:12:15,000
you just feel a new energy.

218
0:12:16.166,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It feels as if you're walking the halls of a very large start-up.

219
0:12:21.448,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Now, to be fair, these companies, they cannot claim victory yet.

220
0:12:25.931,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But at least with this new model,

221
0:12:28.056,000 --> 0:12:31,000
they are much better prepared to respond to change.

222
0:12:33.209,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The world is getting faster and more complex,

223
0:12:36.345,000 --> 0:12:38,000
so we need to reboot our way of working.

224
0:12:39.382,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And the hardest part of that change is not in structure

225
0:12:42.802,000 --> 0:12:44,000
or process or procedure,

226
0:12:45.451,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and it's also not just senior executives taking charge.

227
0:12:49.394,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Leaders will be all of those in the organization

228
0:12:52.187,000 --> 0:12:53,000
who embrace the change.

229
0:12:54.2,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We all have to lead the change.

230
0:12:57.732,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So the question is:

231
0:13:00.03,000 --> 0:13:02,000
What are you willing to give up?

232
0:13:03.503,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you.

233
0:13:04.699,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Applause)

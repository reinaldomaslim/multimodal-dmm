1
0:00:15.625,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What I want to talk to you about today

2
0:00:17.656,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is some of the problems that the military of the Western world --

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Australia, United States, the UK and so on --

4
0:00:25.021,000 --> 0:00:28,000
face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with

5
0:00:28.175,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the modern world at this time.

6
0:00:30.103,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If you think about the sorts of things

7
0:00:31.951,000 --> 0:00:34,000
we've sent Australian military personnel to in recent years,

8
0:00:35.072,000 --> 0:00:37,000
we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan,

9
0:00:37.489,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands,

10
0:00:40.681,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and so on.

11
0:00:41.858,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And a lot of these deployments

12
0:00:43.318,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that we're sending military personnel to these days

13
0:00:46.476,000 --> 0:00:47,000
aren't traditional wars.

14
0:00:48.613,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In fact, a lot of the jobs we're asking military personnel to do

15
0:00:52.724,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in those situations

16
0:00:53.899,000 --> 0:00:56,000
are ones that, in their own countries -- Australia, the US and so on --

17
0:00:57.499,000 --> 0:00:59,000
would actually be done by police officers.

18
0:00:59.892,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So there's a bunch of problems that come up

19
0:01:01.944,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for military personnel in these situations,

20
0:01:03.976,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because they're doing things they haven't really been trained for.

21
0:01:07.251,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries

22
0:01:12.087,000 --> 0:01:15,000
are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for.

23
0:01:15.766,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, there's a bunch of reasons why we send military personnel,

24
0:01:19.453,000 --> 0:01:2,000
rather than police, to do these jobs.

25
0:01:21.675,000 --> 0:01:23,000
If Australia had to send 1,000 people tomorrow

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to West Papua, for example,

27
0:01:27.059,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we don't have 1,000 police officers hanging around that could go tomorrow,

28
0:01:30.91,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and we do have 1,000 soldiers that could go.

29
0:01:33.511,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So when we have to send someone, we send the military --

30
0:01:36.195,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they're there, they're available,

31
0:01:37.796,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and heck, they're used to going off and doing these things

32
0:01:40.553,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and living by themselves

33
0:01:41.82,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and not having all this extra support.

34
0:01:43.682,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So they are able to do it in that sense.

35
0:01:46.366,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But they aren't trained the same way police officers are,

36
0:01:49.22,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and they're certainly not equipped the way police officers are,

37
0:01:52.24,000 --> 0:01:54,000
so this has raised a bunch of problems for them

38
0:01:54.456,000 --> 0:01:55,000
when dealing with these issues.

39
0:01:55.966,000 --> 0:01:58,000
One particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in,

40
0:01:59.348,000 --> 0:02:,000
is the question of whether,

41
0:02:00.999,000 --> 0:02:03,000
when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs,

42
0:02:04.063,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we ought to be equipping them differently;

43
0:02:06.117,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and in particular, whether we ought to be giving them access

44
0:02:09.006,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to some of the nonlethal weapons that police have.

45
0:02:11.446,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Since they're doing some of the same jobs,

46
0:02:13.549,000 --> 0:02:15,000
maybe they should have some of those things.

47
0:02:15.631,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And there's a range of places you'd think those things would be really useful.

48
0:02:19.354,000 --> 0:02:21,000
For example, when you've got military checkpoints.

49
0:02:21.961,000 --> 0:02:23,000
If people are approaching these checkpoints

50
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the military personnel are unsure if this person's hostile or not,

51
0:02:27.649,000 --> 0:02:29,000
say this person approaching here, and they say,

52
0:02:30.027,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"Is this a suicide bomber or not?

53
0:02:31.647,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Is something hidden under their clothes?

54
0:02:33.637,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What's going to happen?"

55
0:02:34.815,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They don't know if the person is hostile or not.

56
0:02:37.091,000 --> 0:02:4,000
If the person doesn't follow directions, they may end up shooting them,

57
0:02:40.502,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and then find out afterwards either, yes, we shot the right person,

58
0:02:43.741,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or, no, this was just an innocent person

59
0:02:45.71,000 --> 0:02:47,000
who didn't understand what was going on.

60
0:02:47.866,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So if they had nonlethal weapons, then they would say,

61
0:02:50.496,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"We can use them in that sort of situation.

62
0:02:52.547,000 --> 0:02:53,000
If we shoot someone who wasn't hostile,

63
0:02:54.459,000 --> 0:02:55,000
at least we haven't killed them."

64
0:02:56.332,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Another situation: this photo is from one of the missions

65
0:02:59.611,000 --> 0:03:,000
in the Balkans in the late 1990s.

66
0:03:02.025,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This situation is a little bit different,

67
0:03:04.026,000 --> 0:03:05,000
where maybe they know someone is hostile;

68
0:03:06.011,000 --> 0:03:07,000
they've got someone shooting at them

69
0:03:07.753,000 --> 0:03:09,000
or doing something else that's clearly hostile,

70
0:03:09.974,000 --> 0:03:1,000
throwing rocks, whatever.

71
0:03:11.23,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But if they respond,

72
0:03:12.405,000 --> 0:03:14,000
there's a range of other people around who are innocent people,

73
0:03:15.422,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who might also get hurt.

74
0:03:16.601,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It'd be collateral damage

75
0:03:17.852,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that the military often doesn't want to talk about.

76
0:03:20.593,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So again, they'd say, "With access to nonlethal weapons,

77
0:03:23.376,000 --> 0:03:24,000
if we've got someone we know is hostile,

78
0:03:25.333,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we can do something to deal with them,

79
0:03:27.19,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and know that if we hit anyone else,

80
0:03:28.976,000 --> 0:03:29,000
at least we're not going to kill them."

81
0:03:31.351,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Another suggestion has been,

82
0:03:32.811,000 --> 0:03:34,000
since we're putting so many robots in the field,

83
0:03:35.122,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we can see the time coming

84
0:03:36.416,000 --> 0:03:38,000
where they're actually going to send robots out in the field

85
0:03:39.308,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that are autonomous.

86
0:03:40.486,000 --> 0:03:43,000
They'll make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot,

87
0:03:43.989,000 --> 0:03:44,000
without a human in the loop.

88
0:03:45.355,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So the suggestion is,

89
0:03:46.691,000 --> 0:03:49,000
if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this,

90
0:03:49.829,000 --> 0:03:53,000
maybe it would be a good idea if they were armed with nonlethal weapons,

91
0:03:54.111,000 --> 0:03:57,000
so if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person,

92
0:03:57.248,000 --> 0:03:59,000
again, they haven't actually killed them.

93
0:03:59.892,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now, there's a whole range of different sorts of nonlethal weapons,

94
0:04:03.132,000 --> 0:04:04,000
some of which are available now,

95
0:04:04.757,000 --> 0:04:05,000
some of which they're developing.

96
0:04:06.373,000 --> 0:04:08,000
You've got traditional things like pepper spray,

97
0:04:08.675,000 --> 0:04:09,000
OC spray up at the top there,

98
0:04:10.18,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or Tasers over here.

99
0:04:12.058,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser,

100
0:04:15.234,000 --> 0:04:17,000
intended to just blind the person momentarily

101
0:04:17.873,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and disorient them.

102
0:04:19.507,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You've got nonlethal shotgun rounds

103
0:04:21.523,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones.

104
0:04:24.966,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And this one in the middle here, the large truck,

105
0:04:27.573,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is called the Active Denial System,

106
0:04:29.967,000 --> 0:04:31,000
something the US military is working on at the moment.

107
0:04:32.611,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's essentially a big microwave transmitter.

108
0:04:36.054,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray.

109
0:04:39.207,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It goes out to a really long distance,

110
0:04:41.86,000 --> 0:04:43,000
compared to any of these other sorts of things.

111
0:04:44.123,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Anybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat,

112
0:04:47.973,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and just wants to get out of the way.

113
0:04:50.108,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven,

114
0:04:52.756,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but it basically is boiling the water molecules

115
0:04:55.662,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in the very surface level of your skin.

116
0:04:57.638,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So you feel this massive heat,

117
0:04:59.408,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and you go, "I want to get out of the way."

118
0:05:01.844,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And they think this will be really useful

119
0:05:03.848,000 --> 0:05:06,000
in places where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area,

120
0:05:07.017,000 --> 0:05:08,000
if the crowd is being hostile.

121
0:05:08.49,000 --> 0:05:1,000
If we need to keep people away from a particular place,

122
0:05:11.125,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we can do that with these sorts of things.

123
0:05:13.62,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So there's a whole range of different nonlethal weapons

124
0:05:16.681,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we could give military personnel,

125
0:05:18.645,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and there's a whole range of situations

126
0:05:20.576,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where they're looking at them and saying,

127
0:05:22.553,000 --> 0:05:23,000
"These things would be really useful."

128
0:05:24.412,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But as I said,

129
0:05:25.84,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the military and the police are very different.

130
0:05:28.853,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

131
0:05:29.909,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Yes, you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize

132
0:05:32.664,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that they might be very different.

133
0:05:34.456,000 --> 0:05:35,000
In particular,

134
0:05:35.75,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the attitude to the use of force

135
0:05:37.454,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and the way they're trained to use force

136
0:05:39.546,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is especially different.

137
0:05:42.236,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The police --

138
0:05:43.86,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and knowing because I've actually helped to train police --

139
0:05:46.896,000 --> 0:05:48,000
police, particularly in Western jurisdictions at least,

140
0:05:49.658,000 --> 0:05:52,000
are trained to De-escalate force,

141
0:05:53.525,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to try and avoid using force wherever possible,

142
0:05:56.494,000 --> 0:06:,000
and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort.

143
0:06:01.701,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Military personnel are being trained for war.

144
0:06:04.86,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So they're trained that, as soon as things go bad,

145
0:06:07.971,000 --> 0:06:09,000
their first response is lethal force.

146
0:06:11.66,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine --

147
0:06:14.752,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:15.808,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you can start shooting at people.

149
0:06:19.013,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So their attitudes

150
0:06:20.86,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to the use of lethal force are very different,

151
0:06:23.277,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and I think it's fairly obvious

152
0:06:24.92,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that their attitude to the use of nonlethal weapons

153
0:06:27.86,000 --> 0:06:3,000
would also be very different from what it is with the police.

154
0:06:31.437,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And since we've already had so many problems

155
0:06:33.562,000 --> 0:06:35,000
with police use of nonlethal weapons in various ways,

156
0:06:36.207,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I thought it would be a good idea to look at some of those things

157
0:06:39.309,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and relate it to the military context.

158
0:06:41.154,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I was very surprised when I started to do this to see that, in fact,

159
0:06:44.86,000 --> 0:06:47,000
even the people who advocated the use of nonlethal weapons by the military

160
0:06:48.515,000 --> 0:06:49,000
hadn't actually done that.

161
0:06:49.86,000 --> 0:06:5,000
They generally seemed to think,

162
0:06:51.413,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"Why would we care what's happened with the police?

163
0:06:53.989,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We're looking at something different,"

164
0:06:55.835,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and didn't seem to recognize

165
0:06:57.271,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they were looking at pretty much the same stuff.

166
0:06:59.742,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So I started to investigate some of those issues,

167
0:07:02.55,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and have a look at the way police use nonlethal weapons

168
0:07:06.327,000 --> 0:07:07,000
when they're introduced,

169
0:07:07.509,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things

170
0:07:10.86,000 --> 0:07:12,000
when they actually do introduce them.

171
0:07:12.911,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And of course, being Australian,

172
0:07:15.494,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I started looking at stuff in Australia, knowing from my own experience

173
0:07:19.286,000 --> 0:07:22,000
of various times when nonlethal weapons have been introduced in Australia.

174
0:07:23.126,000 --> 0:07:26,000
One of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray --

175
0:07:26.616,000 --> 0:07:28,000
oleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray --

176
0:07:29.153,000 --> 0:07:3,000
by Australian police,

177
0:07:31.109,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and seeing what had happened when that had been introduced,

178
0:07:33.944,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and those sorts of issues.

179
0:07:35.447,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And one study that I found, a particularly interesting one,

180
0:07:38.577,000 --> 0:07:39,000
was in Queensland,

181
0:07:40.498,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray

182
0:07:43.947,000 --> 0:07:45,000
before they actually introduced it more broadly.

183
0:07:46.992,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I went and had a look at some of the figures here.

184
0:07:49.865,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now, when they introduced OC spray in Queensland,

185
0:07:52.396,000 --> 0:07:53,000
they were really explicit.

186
0:07:53.992,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The police minister's and a heap of public statements were made about it.

187
0:07:57.512,000 --> 0:08:,000
They were saying, "This is explicitly intended to give police an option

188
0:08:00.929,000 --> 0:08:02,000
between shouting and shooting.

189
0:08:04.118,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is something they can use instead of a firearm

190
0:08:06.86,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone."

191
0:08:10.153,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So I looked at all of the police shooting figures.

192
0:08:12.86,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And you can't actually find them very easily

193
0:08:14.98,000 --> 0:08:15,000
for individual Australian states;

194
0:08:16.86,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I could only find these.

195
0:08:18.4,000 --> 0:08:2,000
This is from an Australian Institute of Criminology report.

196
0:08:21.223,000 --> 0:08:23,000
You can see, in the fine print at the top:

197
0:08:23.255,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"Police shooting deaths" means not just people shot by police,

198
0:08:26.504,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police.

199
0:08:29.558,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But these are the figures across the entire country,

200
0:08:32.033,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland said,

201
0:08:35.161,000 --> 0:08:36,000
"Yes, this is where we're going to give

202
0:08:37.079,000 --> 0:08:39,000
all police officers across the entire state

203
0:08:39.243,000 --> 0:08:4,000
access to OC spray."

204
0:08:40.77,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it,

205
0:08:43.86,000 --> 0:08:45,000
every year for a number of years.

206
0:08:45.955,000 --> 0:08:46,000
There was a spike a few years before,

207
0:08:47.86,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but that wasn't actually Queensland.

208
0:08:49.726,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Anyone know where that was?

209
0:08:51.381,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Wasn't Port Arthur, no.

210
0:08:53.026,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Victoria? Yes, correct.

211
0:08:55.128,000 --> 0:08:56,000
That spike was all Victoria.

212
0:08:57.129,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

213
0:08:58.304,000 --> 0:09:,000
So it wasn't that Queensland had a particular problem

214
0:09:00.892,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with deaths from police shootings and so on.

215
0:09:03.611,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So, six shootings across the whole country,

216
0:09:06.048,000 --> 0:09:08,000
fairly consistently over the years before.

217
0:09:08.109,000 --> 0:09:1,000
The next two years were the years they studied -- 2001, 2002.

218
0:09:11.085,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Anyone want to take a stab at the number of times,

219
0:09:14.021,000 --> 0:09:15,000
given how they've introduced this,

220
0:09:15.701,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period?

221
0:09:19.193,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Hundreds? One? Three?

222
0:09:21.685,000 --> 0:09:22,000
A thousand is getting better.

223
0:09:25.731,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force --

224
0:09:29.741,000 --> 0:09:31,000
an alternative between shouting and shooting.

225
0:09:32.479,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I'm going to go out on a limb here

226
0:09:34.48,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and say that if Queensland police didn't have OC spray,

227
0:09:37.792,000 --> 0:09:39,000
they wouldn't have shot 2,226 people

228
0:09:40.597,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in those two years.

229
0:09:41.992,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Laughter)

230
0:09:44.482,000 --> 0:09:47,000
In fact, if you have a look at the studies they were looking at,

231
0:09:47.705,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the material they were collecting and examining,

232
0:09:51.011,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15 percent of cases

233
0:09:55.647,000 --> 0:09:56,000
where OC spray was used.

234
0:09:58.079,000 --> 0:10:,000
It was routinely being used in this period,

235
0:10:00.741,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and, of course, still is routinely used --

236
0:10:02.884,000 --> 0:10:04,000
because there were no complaints about it,

237
0:10:05.29,000 --> 0:10:08,000
not within the context of this study, anyway --

238
0:10:08.412,000 --> 0:10:11,000
it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent,

239
0:10:12.248,000 --> 0:10:13,000
who were potentially violent,

240
0:10:13.975,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and also quite frequently used

241
0:10:16.316,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to deal with people who were simply passively noncompliant.

242
0:10:21.482,000 --> 0:10:23,000
This person is not doing anything violent,

243
0:10:23.591,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but they just won't do what we want them to.

244
0:10:25.7,000 --> 0:10:27,000
They're not obeying the directions we're giving them,

245
0:10:28.237,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray -- that'll speed them up.

246
0:10:31.413,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Everything will work out better that way.

247
0:10:33.964,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This was something explicitly introduced

248
0:10:36.392,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to be an alternative to firearms,

249
0:10:38.248,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but it's being routinely used

250
0:10:40.249,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems.

251
0:10:43.726,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Now one of the particular issues that comes up

252
0:10:46.074,000 --> 0:10:48,000
with military use of nonlethal weapons --

253
0:10:48.86,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and people actually say, "There might be some problems" --

254
0:10:51.803,000 --> 0:10:54,000
there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on.

255
0:10:55.221,000 --> 0:11:,000
One of those problems is: nonlethal weapons may be used indiscriminately.

256
0:11:00.396,000 --> 0:11:03,000
One of the fundamental principles of military use of force

257
0:11:03.641,000 --> 0:11:04,000
is that you have to be discriminate;

258
0:11:05.433,000 --> 0:11:07,000
you have to be careful about who you're shooting at.

259
0:11:08.21,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So one of the problems suggested with nonlethal weapons

260
0:11:10.86,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is that they might be used indiscriminately --

261
0:11:13.075,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that you would use them against a whole range of people,

262
0:11:15.735,000 --> 0:11:17,000
because you don't have to worry so much anymore.

263
0:11:18.064,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And in fact, one particular instance where I think that actually happens

264
0:11:21.699,000 --> 0:11:23,000
was the Dubrovka Theater siege in Moscow in 2002,

265
0:11:24.581,000 --> 0:11:27,000
which probably a lot of you, unlike most of my students at ADFA,

266
0:11:27.62,000 --> 0:11:28,000
are old enough to remember.

267
0:11:29.237,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So, Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater.

268
0:11:32.022,000 --> 0:11:35,000
They were holding something like 700 people hostage.

269
0:11:35.354,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They'd released a bunch of people,

270
0:11:37.008,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but they still had about 700 people hostage.

271
0:11:39.398,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And the Russian military police special forces, "Spetsnaz,"

272
0:11:44.86,000 --> 0:11:45,000
came in and stormed the theater.

273
0:11:46.86,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas.

274
0:11:50.327,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And it turned out that lots of the hostages died

275
0:11:54.953,000 --> 0:11:55,000
as a result of inhaling the gas.

276
0:11:57.741,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It was used indiscriminately.

277
0:11:59.86,000 --> 0:12:01,000
They pumped the whole theater full of the gas.

278
0:12:02.749,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And it's no surprise that people died,

279
0:12:05.463,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because you don't know how much gas each person is going to inhale,

280
0:12:08.86,000 --> 0:12:11,000
what position they'll fall in when they become unconscious, and so on.

281
0:12:12.779,000 --> 0:12:15,000
There were, in fact, only a couple of people who got shot

282
0:12:15.86,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in this episode.

283
0:12:17.86,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So when they had a look at it afterward,

284
0:12:19.86,000 --> 0:12:21,000
there were only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot,

285
0:12:22.826,000 --> 0:12:24,000
by the hostage takers or by the police forces

286
0:12:25.726,000 --> 0:12:27,000
trying to deal with the situation.

287
0:12:27.756,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Virtually everybody that got killed

288
0:12:29.487,000 --> 0:12:31,000
got killed from inhaling the gas.

289
0:12:32.383,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The final toll of hostages is a little unclear,

290
0:12:35.735,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but it's certainly a few more than that,

291
0:12:37.687,000 --> 0:12:39,000
because other people died over the next few days.

292
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So this was one problem they talked about,

293
0:12:42.071,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that it might be used indiscriminately.

294
0:12:43.959,000 --> 0:12:45,000
A second problem people sometimes talk about

295
0:12:46.228,000 --> 0:12:47,000
with military use of nonlethal weapons --

296
0:12:48.22,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and it's actually why, in the chemical weapons convention,

297
0:12:51.123,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it's very clear that you can't use riot-control agents

298
0:12:53.72,000 --> 0:12:54,000
as weapons of warfare --

299
0:12:55.033,000 --> 0:12:59,000
is that it's seen that sometimes nonlethal weapons might be used

300
0:12:59.086,000 --> 0:13:,000
not as an alternative to lethal force,

301
0:13:01.031,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but as a lethal force multiplier:

302
0:13:03.974,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that you use nonlethal weapons first,

303
0:13:05.939,000 --> 0:13:07,000
so your lethal weapons will actually be more effective.

304
0:13:09.417,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The people you'll be shooting at won't be able to get out of the way.

305
0:13:12.797,000 --> 0:13:15,000
They won't be aware of what's happening, and you can kill them better.

306
0:13:16.214,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And that's exactly what happened here.

307
0:13:18.951,000 --> 0:13:21,000
The hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas

308
0:13:22.031,000 --> 0:13:23,000
were not taken into custody;

309
0:13:23.473,000 --> 0:13:24,000
they were simply shot in the head.

310
0:13:26.791,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So this nonlethal weapon was being used in this case

311
0:13:30.86,000 --> 0:13:32,000
as a lethal force multiplier,

312
0:13:33.86,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to make killing more effective in this particular situation.

313
0:13:38.7,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Another problem I want to quickly mention

314
0:13:41.105,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is that there's a whole heap of problems

315
0:13:43.359,000 --> 0:13:46,000
with the way people are actually taught to use nonlethal weapons,

316
0:13:46.86,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and get trained about them and then tested and so on.

317
0:13:49.417,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Because they're tested in nice, safe environments,

318
0:13:52.316,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and are taught to use them in nice, safe environments --

319
0:13:54.977,000 --> 0:13:57,000
like this, where you can see exactly what's going on.

320
0:13:58.286,000 --> 0:14:,000
The person spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove

321
0:14:01.085,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to make sure they don't get contaminated, and so on.

322
0:14:03.551,000 --> 0:14:04,000
But they're never used like that.

323
0:14:05.186,000 --> 0:14:07,000
They're used out in the real world,

324
0:14:07.378,000 --> 0:14:09,000
like in Texas, like this:

325
0:14:09.736,000 --> 0:14:11,000
["Police Taser Great-Grandmother During Traffic Stop"]

326
0:14:12.35,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I confess, this particular case was one that piqued my interest in this.

327
0:14:15.86,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It happened while I was working as a research fellow

328
0:14:18.332,000 --> 0:14:19,000
at the US Naval Academy.

329
0:14:19.544,000 --> 0:14:21,000
News reports started coming up about this situation,

330
0:14:22.545,000 --> 0:14:24,000
where this woman was arguing with a police officer.

331
0:14:24.969,000 --> 0:14:25,000
She wasn't violent.

332
0:14:26.376,000 --> 0:14:28,000
In fact, he was probably six inches taller than me,

333
0:14:29.313,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and she was about this tall.

334
0:14:31.632,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And eventually she said to him,

335
0:14:33.363,000 --> 0:14:35,000
"Well, I'm going to get back in my car."

336
0:14:35.488,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And he says, "If you get back in your car, I'm going to tase you."

337
0:14:38.654,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And she says, "Oh, go ahead. Tase me." And so he does.

338
0:14:41.798,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And it's all captured by the video camera

339
0:14:43.837,000 --> 0:14:45,000
running in the front of the police car.

340
0:14:47.436,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So, she's 72.

341
0:14:50.332,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And it's seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her.

342
0:14:53.81,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And there are other examples of the same sorts of things,

343
0:14:56.959,000 --> 0:14:57,000
where you think,

344
0:14:58.149,000 --> 0:15:01,000
"Is this really an appropriate way to use nonlethal weapons?"

345
0:15:01.503,000 --> 0:15:03,000
"Police Chief Fires Taser into 14 year old Girl's Head."

346
0:15:04.159,000 --> 0:15:06,000
"She was running away. What else was I suppose to do?"

347
0:15:06.747,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Laughter)

348
0:15:08.993,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Or Florida:

349
0:15:10.953,000 --> 0:15:12,000
"Police Taser 6-year-old Boy at Elementary School."

350
0:15:13.787,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And they clearly learned a lot from it, because in the same district:

351
0:15:17.548,000 --> 0:15:19,000
"Police Review Policy After Children Shocked:

352
0:15:20.213,000 --> 0:15:22,000
2nd Child Shocked by Taser Stun Gun Within Weeks."

353
0:15:22.944,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Same police district.

354
0:15:24.928,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Another child within weeks of Tasering the six-year-old boy.

355
0:15:28.137,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States,

356
0:15:31.646,000 --> 0:15:32,000
it happened in Canada as well:

357
0:15:33.488,000 --> 0:15:34,000
["Mounties Zap 11-year-old Boy"]

358
0:15:35.058,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And a colleague sent me this one from London:

359
0:15:37.192,000 --> 0:15:38,000
["Arrested Man, 82, Shot with Taser"]

360
0:15:39.086,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But my personal favorite, I have to confess, does come from the US:

361
0:15:43.521,000 --> 0:15:46,000
"Officers Taser 86-year-old Disabled Woman in her Bed."

362
0:15:46.837,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Laughter)

363
0:15:49.067,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I checked the reports on this one.

364
0:15:51.195,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I looked at it. I was really surprised.

365
0:15:53.293,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Apparently, she took up a more threatening position in her bed.

366
0:15:57.485,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Laughter)

367
0:15:59.199,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I kid you not, that's exactly what it said:

368
0:16:01.272,000 --> 0:16:03,000
"She took up a more threatening position in her bed."

369
0:16:04.626,000 --> 0:16:05,000
OK.

370
0:16:05.966,000 --> 0:16:06,000
But I'd remind you --

371
0:16:07.435,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I'm talking about military uses of nonlethal weapons,

372
0:16:09.975,000 --> 0:16:1,000
so why is this relevant?

373
0:16:11.157,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Because police are actually more restrained in the use of force

374
0:16:14.403,000 --> 0:16:15,000
than the military are.

375
0:16:15.894,000 --> 0:16:17,000
They're trained to be more restrained in the use of force

376
0:16:18.604,000 --> 0:16:19,000
than the military are.

377
0:16:19.798,000 --> 0:16:21,000
They're trained to think more, to try and De-escalate.

378
0:16:22.364,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So if you have these problems with police officers

379
0:16:24.735,000 --> 0:16:25,000
with nonlethal weapons,

380
0:16:25.925,000 --> 0:16:26,000
what on earth would make you think

381
0:16:27.592,000 --> 0:16:29,000
it's going to be better with military personnel?

382
0:16:30.734,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The last thing that I would like to say:

383
0:16:34.032,000 --> 0:16:35,000
When I'm talking to the police

384
0:16:35.493,000 --> 0:16:37,000
about what a perfect nonlethal weapon would look like,

385
0:16:38.057,000 --> 0:16:4,000
they almost inevitably say the same thing.

386
0:16:40.095,000 --> 0:16:42,000
They say, "It's got to be something that's nasty enough

387
0:16:42.801,000 --> 0:16:44,000
that people don't want to be hit with this weapon.

388
0:16:45.265,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So if you threaten to use it,

389
0:16:46.692,000 --> 0:16:47,000
people are going to comply with it.

390
0:16:49.756,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But it's also going to be something

391
0:16:51.688,000 --> 0:16:53,000
that doesn't leave any lasting effects."

392
0:16:56.294,000 --> 0:16:57,000
In other words,

393
0:16:57.475,000 --> 0:17:,000
your perfect nonlethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse.

394
0:17:01.101,000 --> 0:17:04,000
What would these guys have done if they'd had access to Tasers,

395
0:17:04.674,000 --> 0:17:07,000
or to a manned, portable version of the Active Denial System --

396
0:17:08.959,000 --> 0:17:1,000
a small heat ray that you can use on people

397
0:17:11.447,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and not worry about.

398
0:17:13.803,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So I think yes,

399
0:17:15.484,000 --> 0:17:18,000
there may be ways that nonlethal weapons will be great in these situations,

400
0:17:19.058,000 --> 0:17:2,000
but there's also a whole heap of problems

401
0:17:21.041,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that need to be considered as well.

402
0:17:22.963,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Thanks very much.

403
0:17:24.147,000 --> 0:17:26,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:14,000
About six months into my career as a therapist,

2
0:00:15.6,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was working at a drug and alcohol rehab facility.

3
0:00:18.92,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I got a call from one of the nurses down at the detox unit.

4
0:00:22.52,000 --> 0:00:24,000
She asked me to come down and assess one of the new patients

5
0:00:25.4,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that had arrived earlier in the day.

6
0:00:27.28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So I went down to the unit and had the pleasure of meeting Anne.

7
0:00:30.72,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Anne's a transgender female, and as her and I started talking,

8
0:00:34.2,000 --> 0:00:37,000
she was sharing with me about what brought her into treatment,

9
0:00:37.24,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but I could hear this fear in her voice,

10
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I could see this worry in her eyes,

11
0:00:41.92,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and she began to tell me that she didn't fear coming into rehab

12
0:00:44.92,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and having to give up drugs and alcohol.

13
0:00:47.32,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Her fear was that the doctors that were going to be treating her

14
0:00:50.36,000 --> 0:00:51,000
would not treat her as her female self.

15
0:00:53.36,000 --> 0:00:56,000
She then told me about this ongoing pain that she has experienced her whole life

16
0:00:57.2,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of being assigned male but knowing she's female.

17
0:00:59.68,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And what she meant by that is, when she was born,

18
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the doctor held her up to her parents

19
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and based on her genitalia said,

20
0:01:07.08,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"It's a boy."

21
0:01:08.84,000 --> 0:01:09,000
She always knew she wasn't a boy.

22
0:01:11.92,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Many years passed and the feelings that she was feeling

23
0:01:14.56,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and holding all this in grew and grew,

24
0:01:16.599,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and she knew she had to come out to her family.

25
0:01:18.92,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And when she did, it didn't go over so well.

26
0:01:21.6,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Her parents said, "Absolutely not. You're not a girl.

27
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This is not how we raised you. We don't know what you're thinking.

28
0:01:27.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Get out."

29
0:01:29.56,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So Anne then found herself on the streets and in and out of homeless shelters,

30
0:01:33.28,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and it's here where she started using drugs and alcohol

31
0:01:36.48,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to numb this pain she felt inside.

32
0:01:39.72,000 --> 0:01:42,000
She told me about her journey of being in and out of hospitals and rehabs

33
0:01:43.24,000 --> 0:01:44,000
trying to get sober,

34
0:01:44.52,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and when she did, the health care providers and doctors

35
0:01:47.48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
wouldn't use the correct female name or pronouns.

36
0:01:50.56,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This caused her pain.

37
0:01:53.12,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You see, when I was studying to become a therapist,

38
0:01:55.56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I wasn't taught how to work with transgender patients.

39
0:01:59.12,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I had no idea these would be the patients I'd be working with.

40
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But the more I worked with Anne and other patients like Anne,

41
0:02:06.12,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I began to see my mission evolve,

42
0:02:08.44,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and that was to make sure that the transgender community

43
0:02:11.52,000 --> 0:02:12,000
got their health care needs met.

44
0:02:14.32,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The more I looked into this, I saw how this very real fear

45
0:02:18.48,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of violence, discrimination and this lack of acceptance

46
0:02:22.28,000 --> 0:02:26,000
caused so many of these patients to turn to alcohol and drugs.

47
0:02:26.44,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I also heard these horror stories

48
0:02:29.04,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of when these patients were seeking medical care

49
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and how they were treated,

50
0:02:33.44,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and how a lot of their medical needs were ignored.

51
0:02:37.48,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now let me tell you about Leah.

52
0:02:39.56,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I had the pleasure of meeting Leah a few years back.

53
0:02:42.76,000 --> 0:02:45,000
She's a female and she has a wife and a child.

54
0:02:46.92,000 --> 0:02:48,000
See, Leah was also assigned male at birth

55
0:02:49.88,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and she knew since she was a young child that she was not a male,

56
0:02:53.72,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that she was a female.

57
0:02:55.72,000 --> 0:02:58,000
She hid it from herself and from everyone she knew,

58
0:02:58.88,000 --> 0:03:,000
especially from her wife, until the age of 50.

59
0:03:01.52,000 --> 0:03:02,000
She couldn't take it anymore.

60
0:03:02.96,000 --> 0:03:04,000
She was like, I can't keep living like this.

61
0:03:05.08,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I gotta get honest.

62
0:03:06.32,000 --> 0:03:08,000
She was extremely scared to tell her wife.

63
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:1,000
What if her wife said,

64
0:03:10.28,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"This is unacceptable, I want a divorce, get out"?

65
0:03:14.08,000 --> 0:03:17,000
To her surprise, her wife was accepting.

66
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
She said, "I love you regardless of who you are.

67
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I want to help you in every way I can."

68
0:03:22.96,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So she talked with her wife,

69
0:03:24.32,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and she made the decision that she wanted to medically transition,

70
0:03:28.52,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and she was interested in being assessed for hormone replacement therapy,

71
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:33,000
otherwise known as HRT.

72
0:03:34.32,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So she made an appointment with her doctor.

73
0:03:37.56,000 --> 0:03:39,000
She arrived on the day of her appointment early.

74
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
She filled out all the paperwork,

75
0:03:41.8,000 --> 0:03:43,000
put the name correctly down there and waited patiently.

76
0:03:46.12,000 --> 0:03:49,000
A little bit of time passed and a nurse called her back to the exam room.

77
0:03:50.4,000 --> 0:03:52,000
When she got back there, she took a deep breath,

78
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the doctor and the nurse walked in.

79
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
She extended her hand to the doctor and said, "Hi, I'm Leah."

80
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The doctor looked at her, didn't shake her hand and said,

81
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"Why are you here?"

82
0:04:05.6,000 --> 0:04:06,000
She took another deep breath and said,

83
0:04:09.04,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"Well, I'm a transgender female.

84
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I've known this my whole life, I've hid it from everyone,

85
0:04:13.72,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but I can't do it anymore.

86
0:04:15.04,000 --> 0:04:17,000
My wife's supportive, I can financially afford it,

87
0:04:17.84,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I've got to make these changes.

88
0:04:19.36,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Please consider me, and let's evaluate me for HRT."

89
0:04:23.6,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The doctor said, "We can't do anything today.

90
0:04:25.76,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You need to go get an HIV test."

91
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
She couldn't believe it.

92
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
She was furious.

93
0:04:32.399,000 --> 0:04:33,000
She was angry. She was disappointed.

94
0:04:35.04,000 --> 0:04:38,000
If her doctor treated her this way, how would the rest of the world treat her?

95
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:4,000
First, he wouldn't shake her hand,

96
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and second, when he heard she was transgender,

97
0:04:44.48,000 --> 0:04:47,000
all he cared about was getting an HIV test and ending the appointment.

98
0:04:47.8,000 --> 0:04:49,000
He didn't even ask her any other questions.

99
0:04:50.52,000 --> 0:04:52,000
See, I can understand where Leah's coming from,

100
0:04:53.28,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because the years that I've worked with the community,

101
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I hear myths every single day that aren't true at all.

102
0:04:59.48,000 --> 0:05:,000
A couple of those are:

103
0:05:01.44,000 --> 0:05:05,000
every transgender person wants to transition with medication or surgery;

104
0:05:06.08,000 --> 0:05:08,000
transgender people are mentally ill, this is a disorder;

105
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and: these people aren't real men and women.

106
0:05:12.48,000 --> 0:05:13,000
These are all myths and untrue.

107
0:05:15.24,000 --> 0:05:18,000
As this community expands and grows older,

108
0:05:18.28,000 --> 0:05:21,000
it is imperative that all health care providers be trained

109
0:05:21.44,000 --> 0:05:23,000
on how to take care of their health care needs.

110
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Back in 2015, a survey was done

111
0:05:26.68,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and found that 72 percent of health care providers

112
0:05:30.24,000 --> 0:05:32,000
did not feel well-informed

113
0:05:32.68,000 --> 0:05:34,000
on the health care needs of the LGBT community.

114
0:05:37.12,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There's a huge gap in the education and training.

115
0:05:40.88,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Today, in this talk,

116
0:05:42.36,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I want to offer a new way of thinking for three groups of people:

117
0:05:45.56,000 --> 0:05:49,000
doctors, the transgender community and, well, the rest of us.

118
0:05:49.88,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But before we do, I want to cover a couple of definitions

119
0:05:52.64,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that's going to help you wrap your head around gender identity a little bit more.

120
0:05:56.52,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So I hope you've got your paper and pen. Get ready to take some notes.

121
0:06:00.2,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So let's start out with this idea of a binary system.

122
0:06:03.52,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And what this means is,

123
0:06:04.8,000 --> 0:06:06,000
before, we always thought there was only two, male and female.

124
0:06:07.76,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Get it? Binary? Right?

125
0:06:09.44,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So we've come to find out that this isn't true.

126
0:06:12.68,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Gender identity is a spectrum

127
0:06:15.48,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with maleness on one side

128
0:06:17.44,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and femaleness over here on the other side.

129
0:06:19.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This spectrum of identities

130
0:06:22.32,000 --> 0:06:25,000
include identities such as gender-nonconforming,

131
0:06:25.72,000 --> 0:06:26,000
gender-affirming,

132
0:06:27.04,000 --> 0:06:28,000
gender-nonbinary,

133
0:06:28.36,000 --> 0:06:3,000
two-spirited, three-spirited,

134
0:06:30.64,000 --> 0:06:31,000
as well as people that are intersex.

135
0:06:33.12,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The term transgender is this umbrella term

136
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that encompasses all these different types of identities.

137
0:06:39.88,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But for today's talk, I want you to think about transgender

138
0:06:42.72,000 --> 0:06:45,000
as someone who is assigned a sex at birth that doesn't match

139
0:06:46.28,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with who they are as a person and their sense of self.

140
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, this is very different than biological sex.

141
0:06:51.44,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So gender identity is sense of self.

142
0:06:53.84,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So think of it as what's between your ears:

143
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
sense of self, who you are.

144
0:06:59.04,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This is very different than biological sex, right?

145
0:07:01.8,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Hormones, genitalia, chromosomes:

146
0:07:03.76,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that's what's between our legs.

147
0:07:07.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, you may be thinking, "Dr. Kristie, I have never questioned who I am.

148
0:07:10.8,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I know I'm a man, or I know I'm a woman."

149
0:07:13.52,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I get it. You know who you are.

150
0:07:16.2,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This is how many transgender individuals feel.

151
0:07:18.56,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They just know who they are

152
0:07:20.24,000 --> 0:07:22,000
with that same conviction.

153
0:07:24.32,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's important to know that there are many different types of identities,

154
0:07:27.8,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and I identify as a cisgender female.

155
0:07:30.84,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now, for all y'all out there that like to know how to spell things,

156
0:07:34.04,000 --> 0:07:36,000
cis is spelled "c-i-s."

157
0:07:36.76,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's the Latin term for "on the same side of."

158
0:07:39.72,000 --> 0:07:4,000
When I was born,

159
0:07:41.2,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the doctor held me up to my parents and said,

160
0:07:43.32,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"It's a girl."

161
0:07:44.6,000 --> 0:07:46,000
All this, based on my genitalia.

162
0:07:46.68,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Even though I grew up in a small farm town in Georgia,

163
0:07:49.48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
very much a tomboy,

164
0:07:52.72,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I never questioned that I was a female.

165
0:07:54.76,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I've always known I was a girl,

166
0:07:56.32,000 --> 0:07:58,000
regardless of how I was as a kid.

167
0:07:58.76,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now, this is very different than someone who's transgender.

168
0:08:01.6,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now, trans is a Latin term for "on the other side of" --

169
0:08:05.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
think about transcontinental airlines,

170
0:08:07.64,000 --> 0:08:08,000
across, on the other side of --

171
0:08:09.52,000 --> 0:08:12,000
someone that's assigned a sex at birth

172
0:08:12.56,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and they identify on the other side of the spectrum.

173
0:08:15.68,000 --> 0:08:19,000
A transgender male is someone who was assigned female at birth,

174
0:08:19.72,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but their sense of self, who they are, how they live their life,

175
0:08:23.08,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is as a male.

176
0:08:24.64,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And the opposite is, as we talked earlier,

177
0:08:26.72,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a transgender female, someone that's assigned male at birth

178
0:08:29.56,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but lives their live and sense of self as a female.

179
0:08:32.64,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It's also important to point out here

180
0:08:34.48,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that not everyone that has a nonbinary identity

181
0:08:37.52,000 --> 0:08:38,000
identifies with the term "transgender."

182
0:08:40.68,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Just so nobody gets confused, I want to point out sexual identity,

183
0:08:44.28,000 --> 0:08:45,000
or orientation.

184
0:08:45.84,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That is simply who we're attracted to,

185
0:08:48.6,000 --> 0:08:5,000
physically, emotionally, sexually, spiritually.

186
0:08:52.64,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It's got nothing to do with gender identity.

187
0:08:54.76,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So just for a quick recap, before we continue on:

188
0:08:57.12,000 --> 0:08:58,000
gender identity between the ears,

189
0:08:58.84,000 --> 0:09:01,000
biological sex, just think of it between your legs,

190
0:09:02.04,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and then sexual identity, well, sometimes we use our heart,

191
0:09:04.88,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but it's here.

192
0:09:06.32,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Three very different identity spectrums.

193
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now, the average medical student

194
0:09:13.32,000 --> 0:09:18,000
spends about five hours learning about the LGBT health-related needs

195
0:09:18.64,000 --> 0:09:19,000
while they're in medical school.

196
0:09:20.48,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Now, this is despite us knowing that there are unique health risks

197
0:09:24.32,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to this community.

198
0:09:27.32,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And there's an estimated 10 million American adults

199
0:09:31.12,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that identify as LGBT.

200
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Most doctors that work with transgender patients,

201
0:09:36.44,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they learn trial by fire.

202
0:09:39.28,000 --> 0:09:41,000
That means they figure it out as they go along,

203
0:09:41.52,000 --> 0:09:43,000
or the patient ends up spending their time

204
0:09:43.84,000 --> 0:09:45,000
trying to teach the doctor how to take care of them.

205
0:09:47.2,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Many doctors don't feel comfortable asking about gender identities.

206
0:09:50.72,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Some don't feel like it's relevant at all to their medical care

207
0:09:54.04,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and others just don't want to say the wrong thing.

208
0:09:58.4,000 --> 0:10:,000
Many doctors who say something inappropriate

209
0:10:00.84,000 --> 0:10:01,000
or they say something negative,

210
0:10:02.36,000 --> 0:10:05,000
they may not be coming from a malicious or mean place,

211
0:10:05.96,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they may have never been trained on how to care for these individuals.

212
0:10:09.8,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But this can't be accepted as a norm anymore either.

213
0:10:14.08,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So what happens to a transgender male --

214
0:10:17.52,000 --> 0:10:2,000
for a quick recap, that's someone who is assigned female at birth

215
0:10:20.6,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but lives their life as a male --

216
0:10:22.24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
what happens when this transgender male goes for their yearly gynecological visit?

217
0:10:28.44,000 --> 0:10:3,000
How that doctor treats that patient

218
0:10:31.24,000 --> 0:10:33,000
will set the whole tone for the office.

219
0:10:33.52,000 --> 0:10:37,000
If that doctor treats that male with the correct pronouns, correct name,

220
0:10:38.12,000 --> 0:10:4,000
gives dignity and respect,

221
0:10:40.36,000 --> 0:10:42,000
it's highly likely that the rest of the staff will too.

222
0:10:44.08,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So that's a little bit about my thoughts on doctors,

223
0:10:46.56,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and now let's move on to the transgender community.

224
0:10:49.28,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I'm here talking about fear,

225
0:10:51.56,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but y'all know who is really fearful, right?

226
0:10:54.72,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's the transgender community.

227
0:10:57.12,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Earlier I shared the story about Anne

228
0:10:58.96,000 --> 0:11:,000
and how she was so worried about going into treatment

229
0:11:01.48,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and not being respected as her female self,

230
0:11:03.56,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and then Leah who was scared about how her doctor would react,

231
0:11:06.5,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and the second that he didn't shake her hand

232
0:11:08.6,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and ordered that HIV test, her fears came true.

233
0:11:12.68,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The transgender community needs to be empowered

234
0:11:15.36,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to speak up for their health care needs.

235
0:11:18.08,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The days of remaining silent and taking whatever treatment you can get are over.

236
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
If you don't speak up for your health care needs,

237
0:11:25.88,000 --> 0:11:26,000
no one's going to do it for you.

238
0:11:29.08,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So what about the rest of us?

239
0:11:32.04,000 --> 0:11:34,000
A lot of y'all, maybe in the next week or a couple of months,

240
0:11:34.96,000 --> 0:11:36,000
are going to have a doctor's appointment, right?

241
0:11:37.24,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So let's say you go to your doctor's appointment

242
0:11:39.6,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and when it's over,

243
0:11:40.96,000 --> 0:11:42,000
you feel worse than you did when you got there.

244
0:11:44.8,000 --> 0:11:46,000
What if you felt dismissed by the doctor,

245
0:11:47.2,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that they ignored your needs,

246
0:11:48.84,000 --> 0:11:5,000
or you even felt judged?

247
0:11:52.36,000 --> 0:11:56,000
That's what happens for many of the 1.4 million transgender adults

248
0:11:56.96,000 --> 0:11:57,000
here in the US

249
0:11:58.24,000 --> 0:12:,000
if they're lucky enough to get an appointment.

250
0:12:01.88,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Now, you may be thinking, "Why is this important to me?

251
0:12:04.88,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I'm not transgender. I don't know anybody that's transgender.

252
0:12:07.8,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Why should I even care?"

253
0:12:10.08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Think of it this way.

254
0:12:11.68,000 --> 0:12:13,000
A transgender individual is human,

255
0:12:14.32,000 --> 0:12:15,000
just like you and me.

256
0:12:16.48,000 --> 0:12:18,000
They deserve competent and trained health care providers,

257
0:12:19.48,000 --> 0:12:2,000
just like you and me.

258
0:12:22.12,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So let me ask, if you don't mind raising your hand:

259
0:12:24.64,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Do you know or have you met anyone who is transgender,

260
0:12:28.4,000 --> 0:12:32,000
gender-nonconforming, agender, intersex, two-spirited, three-spirited?

261
0:12:32.76,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Thank y'all so much. Lovely. Thank y'all.

262
0:12:35.84,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Every one of y'all who did not raise your hand,

263
0:12:38.36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in the very near future

264
0:12:40.68,000 --> 0:12:41,000
you will get the opportunity to meet

265
0:12:42.44,000 --> 0:12:45,000
someone that falls into one of these identities, I guarantee it.

266
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The number of this community is increasing.

267
0:12:49.48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
That's not because it's a fad or the new thing to do.

268
0:12:53.12,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It's safer to come out.

269
0:12:55.68,000 --> 0:12:57,000
There's more awareness. There's more visibility.

270
0:12:58.68,000 --> 0:13:01,000
There's more safety, so people are speaking up about their true self

271
0:13:01.92,000 --> 0:13:02,000
like never before.

272
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That's why it's so important that our health care system get on board

273
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and make sure that our doctors and health care providers are trained

274
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to approach these patients with dignity and respect,

275
0:13:15.28,000 --> 0:13:16,000
just like we expect.

276
0:13:18.64,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I remember being in my 11th grade literature class,

277
0:13:21.08,000 --> 0:13:23,000
with one of my favorite teachers, Mr. McClain,

278
0:13:23.28,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and he shared this quote by Heraclitus that sticks with me to this day.

279
0:13:26.92,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Y'all may have even heard it.

280
0:13:28.6,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's, "The only thing that is constant is that things will change."

281
0:13:34.6,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Familiar, right?

282
0:13:36.64,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Every single one of us face changes in our lives,

283
0:13:39.8,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and often when we're faced with these changes,

284
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
we've got some difficult decisions to make.

285
0:13:45.32,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Will we remain in fear, stay stuck

286
0:13:48.96,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and not grow?

287
0:13:50.64,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Or, will we face fear with bravery,

288
0:13:55.04,000 --> 0:13:57,000
evolve, take the opportunity to grow?

289
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Every one of us face new things.

290
0:14:01.88,000 --> 0:14:02,000
What will you do?

291
0:14:03.92,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Will you remain in fear,

292
0:14:06.2,000 --> 0:14:07,000
or will you grow?

293
0:14:09.04,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I invite each of you, doctors, the transgender community

294
0:14:12.72,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and you and I,

295
0:14:14.08,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to face fear together

296
0:14:15.8,000 --> 0:14:17,000
as we walk into this brave new world.

297
0:14:18.56,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Thank you.

298
0:14:19.8,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Applause)

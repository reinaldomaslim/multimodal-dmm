2
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Science.

3
0:00:14.76,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The very word for many of you conjures unhappy memories of boredom

4
0:00:18.2,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in high school biology or physics class.

5
0:00:21.12,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But let me assure that what you did there

6
0:00:24.24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
had very little to do with science.

7
0:00:26.44,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That was really the "what" of science.

8
0:00:28.76,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It was the history of what other people had discovered.

9
0:00:32.72,000 --> 0:00:34,000
What I'm most interested in as a scientist

10
0:00:35.08,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is the "how" of science.

11
0:00:37.24,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Because science is knowledge in process.

12
0:00:41.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We make an observation, guess an explanation for that observation,

13
0:00:44.56,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and then make a prediction that we can test

14
0:00:46.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
with an experiment or other observation.

15
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
A couple of examples.

16
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:53,000
First of all, people noticed that the Earth was below, the sky above,

17
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and both the Sun and the Moon seemed to go around them.

18
0:00:58.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Their guessed explanation

19
0:01:00.28,000 --> 0:01:03,000
was that the Earth must be the center of the universe.

20
0:01:04.24,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The prediction: everything should circle around the Earth.

21
0:01:08.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This was first really tested

22
0:01:09.8,000 --> 0:01:11,000
when Galileo got his hands on one of the first telescopes,

23
0:01:12.64,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and as he gazed into the night sky,

24
0:01:15.04,000 --> 0:01:18,000
what he found there was a planet, Jupiter,

25
0:01:18.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with four moons circling around it.

26
0:01:23.76,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He then used those moons to follow the path of Jupiter

27
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and found that Jupiter also was not going around the Earth

28
0:01:31.92,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but around the Sun.

29
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So the prediction test failed.

30
0:01:38.4,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And this led to the discarding of the theory

31
0:01:40.52,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that the Earth was the center of the universe.

32
0:01:42.72,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Another example: Sir Isaac Newton noticed that things fall to the Earth.

33
0:01:46.84,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The guessed explanation was gravity,

34
0:01:50.52,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the prediction that everything should fall to the Earth.

35
0:01:53.68,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But of course, not everything does fall to the Earth.

36
0:01:58.2,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So did we discard gravity?

37
0:02:00.92,000 --> 0:02:04,000
No. We revised the theory and said, gravity pulls things to the Earth

38
0:02:05.36,000 --> 0:02:09,000
unless there is an equal and opposite force in the other direction.

39
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This led us to learn something new.

40
0:02:12.92,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We began to pay more attention to the bird and the bird's wings,

41
0:02:16.2,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and just think of all the discoveries

42
0:02:18.6,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that have flown from that line of thinking.

43
0:02:21.639,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So the test failures, the exceptions, the outliers

44
0:02:26.8,000 --> 0:02:3,000
teach us what we don't know and lead us to something new.

45
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is how science moves forward. This is how science learns.

46
0:02:35.84,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Sometimes in the media, and even more rarely,

47
0:02:38.12,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but sometimes even scientists will say

48
0:02:40.56,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that something or other has been scientifically proven.

49
0:02:43.88,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But I hope that you understand that science never proves anything

50
0:02:48.48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
definitively forever.

51
0:02:51.52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Hopefully science remains curious enough

52
0:02:55.36,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to look for

53
0:02:56.8,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and humble enough to recognize

54
0:02:58.8,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when we have found

55
0:03:00.32,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the next outlier,

56
0:03:02.04,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the next exception,

57
0:03:03.56,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which, like Jupiter's moons,

58
0:03:05.88,000 --> 0:03:07,000
teaches us what we don't actually know.

59
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
We're going to change gears here for a second.

60
0:03:11.72,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,

61
0:03:13.68,000 --> 0:03:15,000
means a lot of different things to different people,

62
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but most of our public discourse on medicine

63
0:03:18.44,000 --> 0:03:2,000
really turns it into an engineering problem.

64
0:03:21.24,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We have the hallways of Congress,

65
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and the boardrooms of insurance companies that try to figure out how to pay for it.

66
0:03:27.68,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The ethicists and epidemiologists

67
0:03:29.32,000 --> 0:03:31,000
try to figure out how best to distribute medicine,

68
0:03:32.04,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and the hospitals and physicians are absolutely obsessed

69
0:03:34.72,000 --> 0:03:35,000
with their protocols and checklists,

70
0:03:36.68,000 --> 0:03:39,000
trying to figure out how best to safely apply medicine.

71
0:03:40.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
These are all good things.

72
0:03:42.96,000 --> 0:03:44,000
However, they also all assume

73
0:03:45.72,000 --> 0:03:46,000
at some level

74
0:03:47.72,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that the textbook of medicine is closed.

75
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We start to measure the quality of our health care

76
0:03:53.68,000 --> 0:03:55,000
by how quickly we can access it.

77
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It doesn't surprise me that in this climate,

78
0:03:58.36,000 --> 0:04:,000
many of our institutions for the provision of health care

79
0:04:01.2,000 --> 0:04:03,000
start to look a heck of a lot like Jiffy Lube.

80
0:04:03.72,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:06.32,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The only problem is that when I graduated from medical school,

82
0:04:10.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I didn't get one of those little doohickeys

83
0:04:12.36,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that your mechanic has to plug into your car

84
0:04:14.76,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and find out exactly what's wrong with it,

85
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because the textbook of medicine

86
0:04:19.28,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is not closed.

87
0:04:21.32,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Medicine is science.

88
0:04:23.56,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Medicine is knowledge in process.

89
0:04:27.28,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We make an observation,

90
0:04:28.68,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we guess an explanation of that observation,

91
0:04:30.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and then we make a prediction that we can test.

92
0:04:33.48,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, the testing ground of most predictions in medicine

93
0:04:37.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is populations.

94
0:04:38.64,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And you may remember from those boring days in biology class

95
0:04:42.24,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that populations tend to distribute

96
0:04:44.44,000 --> 0:04:45,000
around a mean

97
0:04:45.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
as a Gaussian or a normal curve.

98
0:04:47.56,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Therefore, in medicine,

99
0:04:49.24,000 --> 0:04:52,000
after we make a prediction from a guessed explanation,

100
0:04:52.48,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we test it in a population.

101
0:04:55.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
That means that what we know in medicine,

102
0:04:58.28,000 --> 0:05:,000
our knowledge and our know-how,

103
0:05:00.56,000 --> 0:05:02,000
comes from populations

104
0:05:02.84,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but extends only as far

105
0:05:05.64,000 --> 0:05:06,000
as the next outlier,

106
0:05:07.4,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the next exception,

107
0:05:08.64,000 --> 0:05:09,000
which, like Jupiter's moons,

108
0:05:10.4,000 --> 0:05:12,000
will teach us what we don't actually know.

109
0:05:14.08,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now, I am a surgeon

110
0:05:15.44,000 --> 0:05:17,000
who looks after patients with sarcoma.

111
0:05:17.88,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.

112
0:05:20.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's the cancer of flesh and bones.

113
0:05:23.24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I would tell you that every one of my patients is an outlier,

114
0:05:27.6,000 --> 0:05:28,000
is an exception.

115
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
There is no surgery I have ever performed for a sarcoma patient

116
0:05:33.24,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that has ever been guided by a randomized controlled clinical trial,

117
0:05:37.52,000 --> 0:05:4,000
what we consider the best kind of population-based evidence in medicine.

118
0:05:42.4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
People talk about thinking outside the box,

119
0:05:44.72,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but we don't even have a box in sarcoma.

120
0:05:47.48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
What we do have as we take a bath in the uncertainty

121
0:05:50.84,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and unknowns and exceptions and outliers that surround us in sarcoma

122
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is easy access to what I think are those two most important values

123
0:05:59.56,000 --> 0:06:,000
for any science:

124
0:06:01.12,000 --> 0:06:03,000
humility and curiosity.

125
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Because if I am humble and curious,

126
0:06:06.32,000 --> 0:06:08,000
when a patient asks me a question,

127
0:06:08.64,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and I don't know the answer,

128
0:06:10.92,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I'll ask a colleague

129
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
who may have a similar albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.

130
0:06:15.2,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We'll even establish international collaborations.

131
0:06:17.92,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Those patients will start to talk to each other through chat rooms

132
0:06:21.08,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and support groups.

133
0:06:22.8,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's through this kind of humbly curious communication

134
0:06:26.4,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that we begin to try and learn new things.

135
0:06:31.24,000 --> 0:06:33,000
As an example, this is a patient of mine

136
0:06:33.32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
who had a cancer near his knee.

137
0:06:35.48,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Because of humbly curious communication

138
0:06:37.88,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in international collaborations,

139
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
we have learned that we can repurpose the ankle to serve as the knee

140
0:06:44.56,000 --> 0:06:46,000
when we have to remove the knee with the cancer.

141
0:06:46.84,000 --> 0:06:48,000
He can then wear a prosthetic and run and jump and play.

142
0:06:50.36,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This opportunity was available to him

143
0:06:53.4,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because of international collaborations.

144
0:06:56.2,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It was desirable to him

145
0:06:57.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because he had contacted other patients who had experienced it.

146
0:07:01.92,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And so exceptions and outliers in medicine

147
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
teach us what we don't know, but also lead us to new thinking.

148
0:07:11.08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now, very importantly,

149
0:07:12.96,000 --> 0:07:15,000
all the new thinking that outliers and exceptions lead us to in medicine

150
0:07:16.84,000 --> 0:07:19,000
does not only apply to the outliers and exceptions.

151
0:07:20.92,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It is not that we only learn from sarcoma patients

152
0:07:24.12,000 --> 0:07:25,000
ways to manage sarcoma patients.

153
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Sometimes, the outliers

154
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and the exceptions

155
0:07:30.72,000 --> 0:07:33,000
teach us things that matter quite a lot to the general population.

156
0:07:35.36,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Like a tree standing outside a forest,

157
0:07:37.24,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the outliers and the exceptions draw our attention

158
0:07:41.28,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and lead us into a much greater sense of perhaps what a tree is.

159
0:07:45.64,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We often talk about losing the forests for the trees,

160
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but one also loses a tree

161
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:51,000
within a forest.

162
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But the tree that stands out by itself

163
0:07:54.88,000 --> 0:07:56,000
makes those relationships that define a tree,

164
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:08:,000
the relationships between trunk and roots and branches,

165
0:08:01.64,000 --> 0:08:02,000
much more apparent.

166
0:08:03.36,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Even if that tree is crooked

167
0:08:05.08,000 --> 0:08:07,000
or even if that tree has very unusual relationships

168
0:08:08.08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
between trunk and roots and branches,

169
0:08:10.4,000 --> 0:08:12,000
it nonetheless draws our attention

170
0:08:13.12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and allows us to make observations

171
0:08:15.04,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that we can then test in the general population.

172
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I told you that sarcomas are rare.

173
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They make up about one percent of all cancers.

174
0:08:23.28,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You also probably know that cancer is considered a genetic disease.

175
0:08:27.84,000 --> 0:08:3,000
By genetic disease we mean that cancer is caused by oncogenes

176
0:08:31.2,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that are turned on in cancer

177
0:08:32.6,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and tumor suppressor genes that are turned off to cause cancer.

178
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
You might think that we learned about oncogenes

179
0:08:38.6,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and tumor suppressor genes from common cancers

180
0:08:40.84,000 --> 0:08:41,000
like breast cancer and prostate cancer

181
0:08:42.84,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and lung cancer,

182
0:08:44.36,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but you'd be wrong.

183
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We learned about oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes

184
0:08:48.919,000 --> 0:08:49,000
for the first time

185
0:08:50.159,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in that itty-bitty little one percent of cancers called sarcoma.

186
0:08:54.76,000 --> 0:08:56,000
In 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize

187
0:08:57.36,000 --> 0:08:59,000
for realizing that chickens

188
0:08:59.4,000 --> 0:09:02,000
had a transmissible form of sarcoma.

189
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Thirty years later, Harold Varmus and Mike Bishop discovered

190
0:09:06.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
what that transmissible element was.

191
0:09:08.68,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It was a virus

192
0:09:10.28,000 --> 0:09:11,000
carrying a gene,

193
0:09:11.72,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the src oncogene.

194
0:09:13.88,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now, I will not tell you that src is the most important oncogene.

195
0:09:17.56,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I will not tell you

196
0:09:18.8,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that src is the most frequently turned on oncogene in all of cancer.

197
0:09:22.32,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But it was the first oncogene.

198
0:09:25.96,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The exception, the outlier

199
0:09:28.32,000 --> 0:09:3,000
drew our attention and led us to something

200
0:09:31.52,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that taught us very important things about the rest of biology.

201
0:09:36.88,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now, TP53 is the most important tumor suppressor gene.

202
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It is the most frequently turned off tumor suppressor gene

203
0:09:43.76,000 --> 0:09:44,000
in almost every kind of cancer.

204
0:09:46.36,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But we didn't learn about it from common cancers.

205
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We learned about it when doctors Li and Fraumeni

206
0:09:51.12,000 --> 0:09:52,000
were looking at families,

207
0:09:52.72,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and they realized that these families

208
0:09:54.76,000 --> 0:09:56,000
had way too many sarcomas.

209
0:09:57.92,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I told you that sarcoma is rare.

210
0:09:59.72,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Remember that a one in a million diagnosis,

211
0:10:02.92,000 --> 0:10:04,000
if it happens twice in one family,

212
0:10:05.08,000 --> 0:10:07,000
is way too common in that family.

213
0:10:08.64,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The very fact that these are rare

214
0:10:11.36,000 --> 0:10:12,000
draws our attention

215
0:10:13.76,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and leads us to new kinds of thinking.

216
0:10:17.48,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Now, many of you may say,

217
0:10:18.96,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and may rightly say,

218
0:10:20.52,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that yeah, Kevin, that's great,

219
0:10:22.44,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but you're not talking about a bird's wing.

220
0:10:24.52,000 --> 0:10:27,000
You're not talking about moons floating around some planet Jupiter.

221
0:10:28.52,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is a person.

222
0:10:30.08,000 --> 0:10:33,000
This outlier, this exception, may lead to the advancement of science,

223
0:10:33.36,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but this is a person.

224
0:10:36.28,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And all I can say

225
0:10:37.92,000 --> 0:10:39,000
is that I know that all too well.

226
0:10:41.76,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I have conversations with these patients with rare and deadly diseases.

227
0:10:45.8,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I write about these conversations.

228
0:10:47.76,000 --> 0:10:49,000
These conversations are terribly fraught.

229
0:10:50.08,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They're fraught with horrible phrases

230
0:10:51.92,000 --> 0:10:54,000
like "I have bad news" or "There's nothing more we can do."

231
0:10:55.76,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Sometimes these conversations turn on a single word:

232
0:10:59.76,000 --> 0:11:,000
"terminal."

233
0:11:04.92,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Silence can also be rather uncomfortable.

234
0:11:09.36,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Where the blanks are in medicine

235
0:11:11.96,000 --> 0:11:12,000
can be just as important

236
0:11:13.84,000 --> 0:11:15,000
as the words that we use in these conversations.

237
0:11:17.08,000 --> 0:11:18,000
What are the unknowns?

238
0:11:18.64,000 --> 0:11:2,000
What are the experiments that are being done?

239
0:11:21.68,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Do this little exercise with me.

240
0:11:23.4,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Up there on the screen, you see this phrase, "no where."

241
0:11:26.64,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Notice where the blank is.

242
0:11:28.68,000 --> 0:11:31,000
If we move that blank one space over

243
0:11:32.64,000 --> 0:11:33,000
"no where"

244
0:11:34.24,000 --> 0:11:36,000
becomes "now here,"

245
0:11:36.96,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the exact opposite meaning,

246
0:11:38.88,000 --> 0:11:4,000
just by shifting the blank one space over.

247
0:11:43.68,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I'll never forget the night

248
0:11:45.28,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that I walked into one of my patients' rooms.

249
0:11:48.28,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I had been operating long that day

250
0:11:49.96,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but I still wanted to come and see him.

251
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
He was a boy I had diagnosed with a bone cancer a few days before.

252
0:11:55.84,000 --> 0:11:58,000
He and his mother had been meeting with the chemotherapy doctors

253
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:11:59,000
earlier that day,

254
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and he had been admitted to the hospital to begin chemotherapy.

255
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It was almost midnight when I got to his room.

256
0:12:05.36,000 --> 0:12:07,000
He was asleep, but I found his mother

257
0:12:07.56,000 --> 0:12:08,000
reading by flashlight

258
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
next to his bed.

259
0:12:10.64,000 --> 0:12:12,000
She came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes.

260
0:12:14.28,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It turned out that what she had been reading

261
0:12:16.4,000 --> 0:12:18,000
was the protocol that the chemotherapy doctors

262
0:12:18.6,000 --> 0:12:19,000
had given her that day.

263
0:12:20.2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
She had memorized it.

264
0:12:23.2,000 --> 0:12:26,000
She said, "Dr. Jones, you told me

265
0:12:26.76,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that we don't always win

266
0:12:28.96,000 --> 0:12:29,000
with this type of cancer,

267
0:12:31.68,000 --> 0:12:34,000
but I've been studying this protocol, and I think I can do it.

268
0:12:35.96,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I think I can comply with these very difficult treatments.

269
0:12:39.56,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I'm going to quit my job. I'm going to move in with my parents.

270
0:12:42.56,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I'm going to keep my baby safe."

271
0:12:47.32,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I didn't tell her.

272
0:12:49.84,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I didn't stop to correct her thinking.

273
0:12:53.68,000 --> 0:12:55,000
She was trusting in a protocol

274
0:12:55.96,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that even if complied with,

275
0:12:59.2,000 --> 0:13:01,000
wouldn't necessarily save her son.

276
0:13:03.96,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I didn't tell her.

277
0:13:06.36,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I didn't fill in that blank.

278
0:13:09.08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But a year and a half later

279
0:13:11.08,000 --> 0:13:13,000
her boy nonetheless died of his cancer.

280
0:13:15.4,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Should I have told her?

281
0:13:17.36,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Now, many of you may say, "So what?

282
0:13:19.64,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I don't have sarcoma.

283
0:13:20.92,000 --> 0:13:21,000
No one in my family has sarcoma.

284
0:13:22.84,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And this is all fine and well,

285
0:13:24.32,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but it probably doesn't matter in my life."

286
0:13:27.04,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And you're probably right.

287
0:13:28.32,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Sarcoma may not matter a whole lot in your life.

288
0:13:33.04,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But where the blanks are in medicine

289
0:13:35.4,000 --> 0:13:36,000
does matter in your life.

290
0:13:38.52,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I didn't tell you one dirty little secret.

291
0:13:40.84,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I told you that in medicine, we test predictions in populations,

292
0:13:45.24,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but I didn't tell you,

293
0:13:46.52,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and so often medicine never tells you

294
0:13:48.76,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that every time an individual

295
0:13:51.64,000 --> 0:13:53,000
encounters medicine,

296
0:13:53.76,000 --> 0:13:57,000
even if that individual is firmly embedded in the general population,

297
0:13:59.36,000 --> 0:14:01,000
neither the individual nor the physician knows

298
0:14:01.76,000 --> 0:14:03,000
where in that population the individual will land.

299
0:14:05.04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Therefore, every encounter with medicine

300
0:14:07.76,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is an experiment.

301
0:14:09.92,000 --> 0:14:11,000
You will be a subject

302
0:14:11.96,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in an experiment.

303
0:14:14.56,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And the outcome will be either a better or a worse result for you.

304
0:14:20.32,000 --> 0:14:22,000
As long as medicine works well,

305
0:14:22.36,000 --> 0:14:25,000
we're fine with fast service,

306
0:14:25.4,000 --> 0:14:28,000
bravado, brimmingly confident conversations.

307
0:14:29.72,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But when things don't work well,

308
0:14:31.4,000 --> 0:14:32,000
sometimes we want something different.

309
0:14:34.52,000 --> 0:14:37,000
A colleague of mine removed a tumor from a patient's limb.

310
0:14:38.92,000 --> 0:14:39,000
He was concerned about this tumor.

311
0:14:40.76,000 --> 0:14:43,000
In our physician conferences, he talked about his concern

312
0:14:43.8,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that this was a type of tumor

313
0:14:45.24,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that had a high risk for coming back in the same limb.

314
0:14:48.68,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But his conversations with the patient

315
0:14:50.68,000 --> 0:14:52,000
were exactly what a patient might want:

316
0:14:52.8,000 --> 0:14:53,000
brimming with confidence.

317
0:14:54.08,000 --> 0:14:57,000
He said, "I got it all and you're good to go."

318
0:14:57.12,000 --> 0:14:58,000
She and her husband were thrilled.

319
0:14:58.88,000 --> 0:15:02,000
They went out, celebrated, fancy dinner, opened a bottle of champagne.

320
0:15:04.04,000 --> 0:15:06,000
The only problem was a few weeks later,

321
0:15:06.36,000 --> 0:15:09,000
she started to notice another nodule in the same area.

322
0:15:09.48,000 --> 0:15:13,000
It turned out he hadn't gotten it all, and she wasn't good to go.

323
0:15:13.64,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But what happened at this juncture absolutely fascinates me.

324
0:15:17.2,000 --> 0:15:18,000
My colleague came to me and said,

325
0:15:18.84,000 --> 0:15:2,000
"Kevin, would you mind looking after this patient for me?"

326
0:15:22.24,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I said, "Why, you know the right thing to do as well as I do.

327
0:15:25.48,000 --> 0:15:26,000
You haven't done anything wrong."

328
0:15:27.12,000 --> 0:15:31,000
He said, "Please, just look after this patient for me."

329
0:15:33.2,000 --> 0:15:34,000
He was embarrassed --

330
0:15:34.76,000 --> 0:15:35,000
not by what he had done,

331
0:15:37.154,000 --> 0:15:38,000
but by the conversation that he had had,

332
0:15:39.76,000 --> 0:15:4,000
by the overconfidence.

333
0:15:42.6,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So I performed a much more invasive surgery

334
0:15:45.24,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and had a very different conversation with the patient afterwards.

335
0:15:48.4,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I said, "Most likely I've gotten it all

336
0:15:50.76,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and you're most likely good to go,

337
0:15:53.2,000 --> 0:15:56,000
but this is the experiment that we're doing.

338
0:15:57.04,000 --> 0:15:59,000
This is what you're going to watch for.

339
0:15:59.08,000 --> 0:16:,000
This is what I'm going to watch for.

340
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And we're going to work together to find out if this surgery will work

341
0:16:04.96,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to get rid of your cancer."

342
0:16:06.92,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I can guarantee you, she and her husband

343
0:16:08.88,000 --> 0:16:1,000
did not crack another bottle of champagne after talking to me.

344
0:16:13.6,000 --> 0:16:15,000
But she was now a scientist,

345
0:16:16.48,000 --> 0:16:19,000
not only a subject in her experiment.

346
0:16:21.96,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And so I encourage you

347
0:16:23.6,000 --> 0:16:26,000
to seek humility and curiosity

348
0:16:27.08,000 --> 0:16:28,000
in your physicians.

349
0:16:28.76,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Almost 20 billion times each year,

350
0:16:31.76,000 --> 0:16:34,000
a person walks into a doctor's office,

351
0:16:35.72,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and that person becomes a patient.

352
0:16:39.32,000 --> 0:16:42,000
You or someone you love will be that patient sometime very soon.

353
0:16:43.84,000 --> 0:16:44,000
How will you talk to your doctors?

354
0:16:46.64,000 --> 0:16:47,000
What will you tell them?

355
0:16:48.76,000 --> 0:16:49,000
What will they tell you?

356
0:16:52.6,000 --> 0:16:54,000
They cannot tell you

357
0:16:54.84,000 --> 0:16:55,000
what they do not know,

358
0:16:57.56,000 --> 0:17:,000
but they can tell you when they don't know

359
0:17:02.28,000 --> 0:17:03,000
if only you'll ask.

360
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So please, join the conversation.

361
0:17:08.2,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Thank you.

362
0:17:09.44,000 --> 0:17:11,000
(Applause)

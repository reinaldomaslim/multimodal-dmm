1
0:00:00.53,000 --> 0:00:07,000
from the biggest issues of the day to

2
0:00:04.259,000 --> 0:00:14,000
the deepest issues of soul wonder

3
0:00:08.33,000 --> 0:00:14,000
insight ideas it's time for Ted

4
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
we truly are living in an extraordinary

5
0:00:31.359,000 --> 0:00:36,000
time space itself is stretching it's

6
0:00:34.09,000 --> 0:00:4,000
expanding we cannot vote fear of failure

7
0:00:37.18,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and make amazing new fruits we are a

8
0:00:40.93,000 --> 0:00:46,000
brilliant and creative species this

9
0:00:43.36,000 --> 0:00:46,000
could be our finest hour

10
0:00:56.21,000 --> 0:01:01,000
as a kid I used to lie up in the pit the

11
0:00:58.8,000 --> 0:01:04,000
stars and just wonder about why things

12
0:01:01.98,000 --> 0:01:07,000
are the way they are and Ted's an

13
0:01:05.28,000 --> 0:01:1,000
attempt to answer that question why do

14
0:01:08.28,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we humans find ourselves in a universe

15
0:01:10.619,000 --> 0:01:14,000
with a particular amount of dark energy

16
0:01:12.659,000 --> 0:01:16,000
we've measured instead of any of the

17
0:01:15.21,000 --> 0:01:2,000
other possibilities that are out there

18
0:01:17.25,000 --> 0:01:23,000
what I want to show you next it's a

19
0:01:20.34,000 --> 0:01:28,000
music video 9 robots play six different

20
0:01:23.789,000 --> 0:01:29,000
instruments when you're in the presence

21
0:01:29.31,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of a great speaker you're almost

22
0:01:30.78,000 --> 0:01:34,000
hypnotized by levels they just bring you

23
0:01:32.85,000 --> 0:01:37,000
along on their journey we need to think

24
0:01:35.34,000 --> 0:01:51,000
big we need to invent our way out

25
0:01:37.97,000 --> 0:01:54,000
working together it just kind of feeds

26
0:01:52.05,000 --> 0:01:57,000
into the idea that I've always smell

27
0:01:55.34,000 --> 0:01:59,000
you come to Ted and in your brain just

28
0:01:57.38,000 --> 0:02:01,000
melts with the activity I went to the

29
0:01:59.689,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Psychopaths tossing calls and I am now a

30
0:02:01.969,000 --> 0:02:06,000
certified psychopath spotter we're

31
0:02:04.7,000 --> 0:02:08,000
talking a 900-page book in which a hoard

32
0:02:07.069,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of tiny people emerge from the mouth of

33
0:02:09.11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
a sleeping girl and cause a German

34
0:02:10.849,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Shepherd to Explo

35
0:02:15.319,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so much of Ted is what people can see an

36
0:02:19.83,000 --> 0:02:23,000
experience and learn that's not

37
0:02:22.08,000 --> 0:02:27,000
available anywhere else we're inviting

38
0:02:24.75,000 --> 0:02:29,000
people to turn their genes into their

39
0:02:27.39,000 --> 0:02:32,000
own unique music track it is a form of

40
0:02:30.36,000 --> 0:02:34,000
visual note-taking sort of capturing the

41
0:02:32.67,000 --> 0:02:42,000
essence of the different speakers and

42
0:02:35.069,000 --> 0:02:45,000
what they're saying of the multi-verse I

43
0:02:42.9,000 --> 0:02:47,000
just love how spontaneous it is never

44
0:02:45.9,000 --> 0:02:47,000
know what's gonna come next

45
0:02:49.459,000 --> 0:02:55,000
he's full full of us full of our mom's

46
0:02:53.989,000 --> 0:02:57,000
not about being scarce it's about

47
0:02:56.22,000 --> 0:03:06,000
accessibility taking that which was

48
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:03:08,000
scarce and making it abundant you know

49
0:03:06.42,000 --> 0:03:11,000
what the big secret about Ted is very

50
0:03:09.329,000 --> 0:03:13,000
few people here are afraid to fail and

51
0:03:11.459,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that's what this conference to me is

52
0:03:13.47,000 --> 0:03:17,000
about it's about solving the problems of

53
0:03:16.079,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the world and using really creative

54
0:03:18.15,000 --> 0:03:21,000
solutions to do so the conversations

55
0:03:20.819,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that I've had

56
0:03:21.77,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the ways that I've been pushed and

57
0:03:23.3,000 --> 0:03:27,000
challenged I'm definitely thinking more

58
0:03:25.46,000 --> 0:03:29,000
globally than I was before all of our

59
0:03:28.22,000 --> 0:03:3,000
survival is tied to the survival of

60
0:03:30.35,000 --> 0:03:33,000
everyone

61
0:03:31.1,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we cannot be full evolved human beings

62
0:03:33.74,000 --> 0:03:39,000
until we care about humanity it's all

63
0:03:36.17,000 --> 0:03:42,000

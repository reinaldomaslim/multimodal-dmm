1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED.

2
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
CA: Have you met anyone interesting?

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.

5
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,

6
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because I had an apology to make to her.

7
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --

8
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:49,000
she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.

9
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I went home to my wife that night

10
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,

11
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
massive, big wedding ring on my finger.

12
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler

13
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and get it cut off.

14
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So -- (Laughter) --

15
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so apologies to Goldie.

16
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
CA: That's pretty good.

17
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So, we're going to put up some slides

18
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of some of your companies here.

19
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You've started one or two in your time.

20
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records --

21
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.

22
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?

23
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:

24
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
you must not talk about your own business, and this,

25
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and now you ask me.

26
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,

27
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
since you asked the question.

28
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
CA: It depends what the answer is though.

30
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:49,000
RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,

31
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:5,000
you can really run any companies.

32
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,

33
0:01:54,000 --> 0:02:,000
inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.

34
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive

35
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and I love taking on, you know, the status quo

36
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and trying to turn it upside down.

37
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So I've seen life as one long learning process.

38
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline

39
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,

40
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create

41
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.

42
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.

43
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:37,000
CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,

44
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.

45
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.

46
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,

47
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records

48
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,

49
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and his view was that you were trading, you know,

50
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the world's fourth biggest record company

51
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.

52
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Why did you do that?

53
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:13,000
RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.

54
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I think if you start a business without financial backing,

55
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.

56
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.

57
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They were trying to put our airline out of business,

58
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.

59
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down

60
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
unless I chipped in a chip.

61
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,

62
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,

63
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.

64
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,

65
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:,000
for that as well.

66
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:06,000
RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.

67
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.

68
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lot

69
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.

70
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
What does the brand stand for in your head?

71
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,

72
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they --

73
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?

74
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
RB: No, but I was going to move on this.

75
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.

76
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
As I say, we go in and shake up other industries,

77
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I think, you know, we do it differently

78
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and I think that industries are not quite the same

79
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
as a result of Virgin attacking the market.

80
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:5,000
CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done

81
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.

82
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?

83
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
RB: We couldn't find any customers.

85
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

86
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Applause)

87
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
CA: I was actually also curious why --

88
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.

89
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?

90
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Ain't virgin no longer, or something.

91
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.

92
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,

93
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
you know, you can deal with them.

94
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But about three months after the launch of the condom company,

95
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I had a letter, a complaint,

96
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.

97
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.

98
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,

99
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby

100
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:51,000
asking if I'd be godfather, which I became.

101
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So, it all worked out well.

102
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.

103
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
RB: I should have.

104
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:59,000
CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.

105
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I mean, what are the numbers on this?

106
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I mean, how big is the group overall?

107
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
How much -- what's the total revenue?

108
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.

109
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:09,000
CA: And how many employees?

110
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
RB: About 55,000.

111
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various times

112
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.

113
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
What was that? Was that real?

114
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.

115
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:32,000
No, I mean, I think --

116
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:33,000
CA: But is that your hair?

117
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
RB: No.

118
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
CA: What was that one?

119
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:4,000
RB: Dropping in for tea.

120
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:41,000
CA: OK.

121
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which --

123
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we --

124
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
it was a TEDster event there, I think.

125
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?

126
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:56,000
RB: It's a tough job, isn't it?

128
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
CA: I mean, it is a tough job.

129
0:06:58,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:03,000
When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well

131
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here,

132
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it's very strange.

133
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:11,000
RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but --

134
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:12,000
CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about --

135
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know --

136
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,

137
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy"

138
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.

139
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --

140
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?

142
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
RB: Of course.

143
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:39,000
CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.

144
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think?

145
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:51,000
RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'

146
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expected

147
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.

148
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.

149
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.

150
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?

151
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
RB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.

152
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard

153
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.

154
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But nowhere else anyway.

155
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...

156
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:29,000
RB: No. I suppose if you're having problems

157
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
getting a booking in a restaurant or something,

158
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that might be worth using it.

159
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.

160
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.

161
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.

162
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,

163
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video)

164
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?

165
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:02,000
RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 months

166
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and then we do 12 months extensive testing.

167
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And then 24 months from now,

168
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:12,000
people will be able to take a ride into space.

169
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?

170
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:22,000
RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it:

171
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.

172
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And basically, he's just taken an eye

173
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and the space station will be one giant eye,

174
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so when you're in space,

175
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.

176
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.

177
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.

178
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
CA: But you didn't have him design the engine?

179
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
RB: Philippe is quite erratic,

180
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:59,000
so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.

181
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:01,000
CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.

182
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:02,000
RB: Yeah? No, he is a --

183
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
CA: Well, some people found it wonderful,

184
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
some people found it completely bizarre.

185
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But, I personally found it wonderful.

186
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ...

187
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:19,000
CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.

188
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Have you ever regretted that?

189
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:23,000
RB: Many times.

190
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.

191
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so --

192
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.

193
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So in those moments,

194
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:43,000
you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or --

195
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
CA: What was the closest you got to --

196
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?

197
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:54,000
RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was,

198
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
each one, actually, I think we came close.

199
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:,000
And, I mean, first of all we --

200
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:04,000
nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,

201
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:11,000
so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,

202
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and we weren't quite sure,

203
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
when a balloon actually got into the jet stream,

204
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:21,000
whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.

205
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,

206
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon --

207
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,

208
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,

209
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and it just took off.

210
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.

211
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And we were just crossing every finger,

212
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:53,000
praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.

213
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know --

214
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
something seemed to go wrong every time,

215
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me

216
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:12,000
jumped, and left me holding on for dear life.

217
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Laughter)

218
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ...

219
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:22,000
RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,

220
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...

221
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.

222
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:35,000
RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,

223
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,

224
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:43,000
trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which --

225
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.

226
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But, anyway, we managed to survive it.

227
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?

228
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:55,000
RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,

229
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,

230
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.

231
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried

232
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to make sure that I was making the right decision.

233
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,

234
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:14,000
looked down at those clouds again,

235
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
climbed back into the capsule again.

236
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.

237
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,

238
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:27,000
it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?

239
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,

240
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.

241
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And the balloon hit the sea

242
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.

243
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and --

244
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
CA: What did you write to your family?

245
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:52,000
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:

246
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
just I love you very much. And

247
0:13:55,000 --> 0:14:,000
I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which --

248
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
just in case anything had happened.

249
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:07,000
But fortunately, they never had to use it.

250
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:13,000
CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.

251
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:19,000
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls,

252
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:23,000
you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.

253
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy

254
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:32,000
doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.

255
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:37,000
How much was the PR value part of this?

256
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:44,000
RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,

257
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:49,000
the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,

258
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and crashing into the seas.

259
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

260
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
CA: They have a point, Richard.

261
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:02,000
RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,

262
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:04,000
you know, come on, Richard,

263
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.

264
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Laughter)

265
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
CA: To do all this,

266
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:13,000
you must have been a genius from the get-go, right?

267
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
RB: Well, I won't contradict that.

268
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Laughter)

269
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:22,000
CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.

270
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school?

271
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.

272
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I certainly would have failed IQ tests.

273
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.

274
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.

275
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:56,000
As somebody who's dyslexic,

276
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
you also have some quite bizarre situations.

277
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know,

278
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,

279
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.

280
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And so the board meetings have been fascinating.

281
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:16,000
(Laughter)

282
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And so, it's like, good news or bad news?

283
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.

284
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:24,000
CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?

285
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Laughter)

286
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --

287
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
(Laughter) --

288
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I've got it right.

289
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
CA: No, trust me, it's gross.

290
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Laughter)

291
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:42,000
RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,

292
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
"Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram.

293
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Here's a net in the sea,

294
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.

295
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,

296
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:56,000
everything else is eaten."

297
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And I finally worked it all out.

298
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:,000
(Laughter)

299
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
(Applause)

300
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:05,000
CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being,

301
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:07,000
you know, doing pretty miserably academically,

302
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:1,000
but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.

303
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader,

304
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:16,000
but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...

305
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:26,000
RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was,

306
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
yeah, I was fortunately good at sport,

307
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and so at least I had something to excel at, at school.

308
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.

309
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I mean, there's the story about your mother

310
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:42,000
allegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."

311
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Did this really happen?

312
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:45,000
RB: She was, you know,

313
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:48,000
she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.

314
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:52,000
So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,

315
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:56,000
such as pushing us out of the car,

316
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and telling us to find our own way to Granny's,

317
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:02,000
about five miles before we actually got there.

318
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:05,000
And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.

319
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And we were never allowed to watch television and the like.

320
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:09,000
CA: But is there a risk here?

321
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,

322
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.

323
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think

324
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:2,000
they're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,

325
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:22,000
we're going to raise a generation of privileged ...

326
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:25,000
RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,

327
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:32,000
you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.

328
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:38,000
So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.

329
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:41,000
CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...

330
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Your headmaster said to you --

331
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:46,000
I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school --

332
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:49,000
he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,

333
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and I'm not sure which.

334
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Which of those happened first?

335
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:55,000
(Laughter)

336
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:59,000
RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.

337
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:05,000
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.

338
0:19:05,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act

339
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.

340
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:17,000
On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which --

341
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:21,000
we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.

342
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:24,000
And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.

343
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:25,000
And there's an ancient law that says

344
0:19:25,000 --> 0:19:29,000
you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.

345
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:32,000
So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us

346
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:34,000
if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.

347
0:19:34,000 --> 0:19:36,000
We changed it to social diseases

348
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:38,000
and people came along with acne and spots,

349
0:19:38,000 --> 0:19:4,000
but nobody came with VD any more.

350
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.

351
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:48,000
And then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"

352
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:55,000
the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested

353
0:19:55,000 --> 0:19:58,000
for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.

354
0:19:58,000 --> 0:20:02,000
And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.

355
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:07,000
And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert

356
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:11,000
to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.

357
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:13,000
And so I rang up Nottingham University,

358
0:20:13,000 --> 0:20:15,000
and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.

359
0:20:15,000 --> 0:20:2,000
And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.

360
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:24,000
It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."

361
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:27,000
(Laughter)

362
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:31,000
And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."

363
0:20:31,000 --> 0:20:33,000
And so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"

364
0:20:33,000 --> 0:20:35,000
And he said he'd be delighted. And I said --

365
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:37,000
and he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"

366
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:39,000
And I said, "Yes, definitely. Please."

367
0:20:39,000 --> 0:20:41,000
(Laughter)

368
0:20:41,000 --> 0:20:42,000
CA: That's great.

369
0:20:42,000 --> 0:20:44,000
RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually

370
0:20:44,000 --> 0:20:46,000
"Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."

371
0:20:46,000 --> 0:20:48,000
(Laughter)

372
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:5,000
And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...

373
0:20:51,000 --> 0:20:52,000
(Laughter)

374
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:54,000
CA: That is outrageous.

375
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:57,000
(Applause)

376
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:02,000
So seriously, is there a dark side?

377
0:21:02,000 --> 0:21:04,000
A lot of people would say there's no way

378
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:07,000
that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses

379
0:21:07,000 --> 0:21:1,000
without knifing a few people in the back,

380
0:21:1,000 --> 0:21:12,000
you know, doing some ugly things.

381
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:14,000
You've been accused of being ruthless.

382
0:21:14,000 --> 0:21:16,000
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.

383
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:2,000
Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?

384
0:21:2,000 --> 0:21:23,000
RB: I don't actually think that the stereotype

385
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:28,000
of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,

386
0:21:28,000 --> 0:21:3,000
generally speaking, works.

387
0:21:3,000 --> 0:21:32,000
I think if you treat people well,

388
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:37,000
people will come back and come back for more.

389
0:21:37,000 --> 0:21:4,000
And I think all you have in life is your reputation

390
0:21:4,000 --> 0:21:44,000
and it's a very small world.

391
0:21:45,000 --> 0:21:49,000
And I actually think that the best way

392
0:21:49,000 --> 0:21:56,000
of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,

393
0:21:56,000 --> 0:22:,000
and I like to think that's how we run Virgin.

394
0:22:01,000 --> 0:22:05,000
CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending --

395
0:22:05,000 --> 0:22:07,000
you keep getting caught up in these new projects,

396
0:22:07,000 --> 0:22:1,000
but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.

397
0:22:1,000 --> 0:22:12,000
You get excited by an idea and, kapow!

398
0:22:12,000 --> 0:22:15,000
I mean, do you think about life balance?

399
0:22:15,000 --> 0:22:17,000
How do your family feel about

400
0:22:17,000 --> 0:22:19,000
each time you step into something big and new?

401
0:22:2,000 --> 0:22:24,000
RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,

402
0:22:24,000 --> 0:22:27,000
so from the time the kids were very young,

403
0:22:27,000 --> 0:22:3,000
you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.

404
0:22:31,000 --> 0:22:37,000
And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.

405
0:22:37,000 --> 0:22:4,000
Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,

406
0:22:4,000 --> 0:22:44,000
we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can --

407
0:22:44,000 --> 0:22:48,000
so I can take them there and we can bring friends,

408
0:22:48,000 --> 0:22:5,000
and we can play together,

409
0:22:5,000 --> 0:22:54,000
but I can also keep in touch with what's going on.

410
0:22:54,000 --> 0:22:56,000
CA: You started talking in recent years

411
0:22:56,000 --> 0:22:58,000
about this term capitalist philanthropy.

412
0:22:58,000 --> 0:23:,000
What is that?

413
0:23:,000 --> 0:23:04,000
RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.

414
0:23:04,000 --> 0:23:09,000
You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.

415
0:23:09,000 --> 0:23:11,000
But the problem with capitalism is

416
0:23:11,000 --> 0:23:14,000
extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,

417
0:23:14,000 --> 0:23:19,000
and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.

418
0:23:19,000 --> 0:23:23,000
And I think it's important that the individuals,

419
0:23:23,000 --> 0:23:28,000
who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing

420
0:23:28,000 --> 0:23:3,000
for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,

421
0:23:3,000 --> 0:23:36,000
but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs

422
0:23:36,000 --> 0:23:39,000
or to tackle issues around the world.

423
0:23:4,000 --> 0:23:43,000
CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,

424
0:23:43,000 --> 0:23:46,000
want to turn your resources toward?

425
0:23:47,000 --> 0:23:5,000
RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.

426
0:23:5,000 --> 0:23:57,000
I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind

427
0:23:57,000 --> 0:24:01,000
and we are putting a lot of time and energy into,

428
0:24:01,000 --> 0:24:05,000
A, trying to come up with alternative fuels

429
0:24:05,000 --> 0:24:14,000
and, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize

430
0:24:14,000 --> 0:24:18,000
in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,

431
0:24:18,000 --> 0:24:21,000
in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions

432
0:24:21,000 --> 0:24:24,000
cut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.

433
0:24:24,000 --> 0:24:28,000
We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way

434
0:24:28,000 --> 0:24:31,000
of extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.

435
0:24:31,000 --> 0:24:34,000
And we just -- you know, there weren't really people

436
0:24:34,000 --> 0:24:38,000
working on that before, so we wanted people to try to --

437
0:24:38,000 --> 0:24:41,000
all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,

438
0:24:41,000 --> 0:24:43,000
and also to try to extract the methane

439
0:24:43,000 --> 0:24:46,000
out of the Earth's atmosphere as well.

440
0:24:46,000 --> 0:24:51,000
And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms

441
0:24:51,000 --> 0:24:53,000
saying they want to give it a go.

442
0:24:53,000 --> 0:24:56,000
And so we only need one, so we're hopeful.

443
0:24:56,000 --> 0:25:,000
CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?

444
0:25:,000 --> 0:25:04,000
RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something called

445
0:25:04,000 --> 0:25:06,000
the war room, which is maybe the wrong word.

446
0:25:06,000 --> 0:25:1,000
We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war room

447
0:25:1,000 --> 0:25:14,000
to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,

448
0:25:14,000 --> 0:25:17,000
all the different social problems in Africa,

449
0:25:17,000 --> 0:25:21,000
and try to look at best practices.

450
0:25:21,000 --> 0:25:24,000
So, for instance,

451
0:25:24,000 --> 0:25:27,000
there's a doctor in Africa that's found that

452
0:25:27,000 --> 0:25:33,000
if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,

453
0:25:33,000 --> 0:25:4,000
that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.

454
0:25:4,000 --> 0:25:45,000
And so disseminating that information to

455
0:25:45,000 --> 0:25:47,000
around the rest of Africa is important.

456
0:25:47,000 --> 0:25:5,000
CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.

457
0:25:5,000 --> 0:25:55,000
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West

458
0:25:55,000 --> 0:25:59,000
get so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea,

459
0:25:59,000 --> 0:26:02,000
getting stuff done, and they believe profoundly

460
0:26:02,000 --> 0:26:04,000
in their ability to make a difference in the world.

461
0:26:04,000 --> 0:26:07,000
Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,

462
0:26:07,000 --> 0:26:1,000
we've got to fix this problem and we can do it,

463
0:26:1,000 --> 0:26:13,000
I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da --

464
0:26:13,000 --> 0:26:17,000
here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation

465
0:26:17,000 --> 0:26:22,000
and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?

466
0:26:22,000 --> 0:26:29,000
RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually --

467
0:26:29,000 --> 0:26:31,000
we're working with the government on it.

468
0:26:31,000 --> 0:26:35,000
I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting

469
0:26:35,000 --> 0:26:4,000
HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,

470
0:26:4,000 --> 0:26:46,000
of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,

471
0:26:46,000 --> 0:26:49,000
it's a way of working with him, with his government.

472
0:26:49,000 --> 0:26:51,000
It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,

473
0:26:51,000 --> 0:26:54,000
they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.

474
0:26:54,000 --> 0:26:56,000
It's got to be consistent.

475
0:26:56,000 --> 0:27:02,000
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how

476
0:27:02,000 --> 0:27:06,000
and help governments approach things slightly differently.

477
0:27:06,000 --> 0:27:09,000
For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africa

478
0:27:09,000 --> 0:27:11,000
where we're going to be giving

479
0:27:11,000 --> 0:27:13,000
free antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment

480
0:27:13,000 --> 0:27:16,000
and free malaria treatment.

481
0:27:16,000 --> 0:27:19,000
But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,

482
0:27:19,000 --> 0:27:23,000
so that people pay for some other aspects.

483
0:27:23,000 --> 0:27:27,000
CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,

484
0:27:27,000 --> 0:27:3,000
or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven by

485
0:27:3,000 --> 0:27:33,000
some sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,

486
0:27:33,000 --> 0:27:38,000
for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.

487
0:27:38,000 --> 0:27:39,000
What would you say to them?

488
0:27:39,000 --> 0:27:41,000
RB: Well, I think that everybody --

489
0:27:41,000 --> 0:27:45,000
people do things for a whole variety of different reasons

490
0:27:45,000 --> 0:27:47,000
and I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,

491
0:27:47,000 --> 0:27:5,000
I will want to feel that I've made a difference

492
0:27:5,000 --> 0:27:52,000
to other people's lives.

493
0:27:52,000 --> 0:27:55,000
And that may be a selfish thing to think,

494
0:27:55,000 --> 0:27:57,000
but it's the way I've been brought up.

495
0:27:57,000 --> 0:27:59,000
I think if I'm in a position to

496
0:27:59,000 --> 0:28:02,000
radically change other people's lives for the better,

497
0:28:02,000 --> 0:28:04,000
I should do so.

498
0:28:04,000 --> 0:28:05,000
CA: How old are you?

499
0:28:05,000 --> 0:28:06,000
RB: I'm 56.

500
0:28:06,000 --> 0:28:11,000
CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him

501
0:28:11,000 --> 0:28:17,000
and I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by

502
0:28:17,000 --> 0:28:22,000
this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.

503
0:28:22,000 --> 0:28:26,000
50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom

504
0:28:26,000 --> 0:28:28,000
and a search for legacy.

505
0:28:28,000 --> 0:28:3,000
I mean, it seems like you're still

506
0:28:3,000 --> 0:28:32,000
a little bit in the growth phases,

507
0:28:32,000 --> 0:28:34,000
you're still doing these incredible new plans.

508
0:28:34,000 --> 0:28:36,000
How much do you think about legacy,

509
0:28:36,000 --> 0:28:38,000
and what would you like your legacy to be?

510
0:28:41,000 --> 0:28:44,000
RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.

511
0:28:44,000 --> 0:28:5,000
I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101,

512
0:28:5,000 --> 0:28:53,000
so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.

513
0:28:54,000 --> 0:29:,000
No, I just want to live life to its full.

514
0:29:,000 --> 0:29:02,000
You know, if I can make a difference,

515
0:29:02,000 --> 0:29:04,000
I hope to be able to make a difference.

516
0:29:04,000 --> 0:29:07,000
And I think one of the positive things at the moment is

517
0:29:07,000 --> 0:29:11,000
you've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,

518
0:29:11,000 --> 0:29:13,000
who are good friends.

519
0:29:13,000 --> 0:29:16,000
And, thank God, you've got two people

520
0:29:16,000 --> 0:29:2,000
who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.

521
0:29:2,000 --> 0:29:23,000
If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,

522
0:29:23,000 --> 0:29:25,000
it would be very worrying.

523
0:29:25,000 --> 0:29:28,000
And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.

524
0:29:28,000 --> 0:29:3,000
And I think it's important

525
0:29:3,000 --> 0:29:34,000
that people in that kind of position do make a difference.

526
0:29:34,000 --> 0:29:35,000
CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,

527
0:29:35,000 --> 0:29:38,000
I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of --

528
0:29:38,000 --> 0:29:4,000
I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless

529
0:29:4,000 --> 0:29:44,000
and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.

530
0:29:44,000 --> 0:29:46,000
And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,

531
0:29:46,000 --> 0:29:48,000
well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.

532
0:29:48,000 --> 0:29:51,000
So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,

533
0:29:51,000 --> 0:29:53,000
and for coming to TED today. Thank you.

534
0:29:53,000 --> 0:29:54,000
Thank you so much.

535
0:29:54,000 --> 0:30:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.586,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy

2
0:00:14.649,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and its relationship with technology.

3
0:00:18.823,000 --> 0:00:2,000
We tend to think of business strategy

4
0:00:21.718,000 --> 0:00:22,000
as being a rather abstract body

5
0:00:23.681,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of essentially economic thought,

6
0:00:25.396,000 --> 0:00:26,000
perhaps rather timeless.

7
0:00:27.026,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm going to argue that, in fact,

8
0:00:28.966,000 --> 0:00:3,000
business strategy has always been premised

9
0:00:31.521,000 --> 0:00:33,000
on assumptions about technology,

10
0:00:33.94,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that those assumptions are changing,

11
0:00:35.913,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and, in fact, changing quite dramatically,

12
0:00:38.63,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and that therefore what that will drive us to

13
0:00:41.702,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is a different concept of what we mean

14
0:00:44.605,000 --> 0:00:46,000
by business strategy.

15
0:00:47.043,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Let me start, if I may,

16
0:00:48.524,000 --> 0:00:5,000
with a little bit of history.

17
0:00:51.294,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The idea of strategy in business

18
0:00:53.038,000 --> 0:00:56,000
owes its origins to two intellectual giants:

19
0:00:56.338,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG,

20
0:00:58.472,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and Michael Porter, professor at the Harvard Business School.

21
0:01:02.244,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Henderson's central idea was what you might call

22
0:01:05.076,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass

23
0:01:08.067,000 --> 0:01:1,000
against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.

24
0:01:10.936,000 --> 0:01:11,000
What Henderson recognized was that,

25
0:01:12.729,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in the business world,

26
0:01:14.125,000 --> 0:01:16,000
there are many phenomena which are characterized

27
0:01:16.78,000 --> 0:01:18,000
by what economists would call increasing returns --

28
0:01:18.815,000 --> 0:01:19,000
scale, experience.

29
0:01:20.178,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The more you do of something,

30
0:01:22.052,000 --> 0:01:24,000
disproportionately the better you get.

31
0:01:24.449,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And therefore he found a logic for investing

32
0:01:27.412,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in such kinds of overwhelming mass

33
0:01:30.154,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in order to achieve competitive advantage.

34
0:01:32.707,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And that was the first introduction

35
0:01:34.775,000 --> 0:01:36,000
of essentially a military concept of strategy

36
0:01:37.439,000 --> 0:01:39,000
into the business world.

37
0:01:40.421,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Porter agreed with that premise,

38
0:01:43.156,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but he qualified it.

39
0:01:44.707,000 --> 0:01:46,000
He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well,

40
0:01:47.696,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but businesses actually have multiple steps to them.

41
0:01:51.571,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They have different components,

42
0:01:53.144,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and each of those components might be driven

43
0:01:55.676,000 --> 0:01:56,000
by a different kind of strategy.

44
0:01:57.461,000 --> 0:01:59,000
A company or a business might actually be advantaged

45
0:01:59.789,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in some activities but disadvantaged in others.

46
0:02:03.267,000 --> 0:02:05,000
He formed the concept of the value chain,

47
0:02:05.368,000 --> 0:02:08,000
essentially the sequence of steps with which

48
0:02:08.438,000 --> 0:02:11,000
a, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component,

49
0:02:11.59,000 --> 0:02:12,000
becomes assembled into a finished product,

50
0:02:12.953,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and then is distributed, for example,

51
0:02:15.594,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and he argued that advantage accrued

52
0:02:18.01,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to each of those components,

53
0:02:19.551,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and that the advantage of the whole

54
0:02:21.265,000 --> 0:02:23,000
was in some sense the sum or the average

55
0:02:23.396,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of that of its parts.

56
0:02:25.744,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And this idea of the value chain was predicated

57
0:02:28.321,000 --> 0:02:3,000
on the recognition that

58
0:02:30.889,000 --> 0:02:33,000
what holds a business together is transaction costs,

59
0:02:34.535,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that in essence you need to coordinate,

60
0:02:36.83,000 --> 0:02:38,000
organizations are more efficient at coordination

61
0:02:39.405,000 --> 0:02:4,000
than markets, very often,

62
0:02:41.067,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and therefore the nature and role and boundaries

63
0:02:44.123,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.

64
0:02:47.962,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It was on those two ideas,

65
0:02:50.526,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Henderson's idea of increasing returns

66
0:02:53.912,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to scale and experience,

67
0:02:55.46,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and Porter's idea of the value chain,

68
0:02:57.883,000 --> 0:02:58,000
encompassing heterogenous elements,

69
0:02:59.796,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that the whole edifice of business strategy

70
0:03:03.131,000 --> 0:03:05,000
was subsequently erected.

71
0:03:05.908,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now what I'm going to argue is

72
0:03:08.337,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.

73
0:03:14.051,000 --> 0:03:16,000
First of all, let's think about transaction costs.

74
0:03:16.605,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There are really two components to transaction costs.

75
0:03:19.002,000 --> 0:03:21,000
One is about processing information, and the other is about communication.

76
0:03:21.872,000 --> 0:03:24,000
These are the economics of processing and communicating

77
0:03:25.153,000 --> 0:03:27,000
as they have evolved over a long period of time.

78
0:03:27.627,000 --> 0:03:3,000
As we all know from so many contexts,

79
0:03:30.637,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they have been radically transformed

80
0:03:32.893,000 --> 0:03:34,000
since the days when Porter and Henderson

81
0:03:35.205,000 --> 0:03:37,000
first formulated their theories.

82
0:03:37.299,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In particular, since the mid-'90s,

83
0:03:39.365,000 --> 0:03:4,000
communications costs have actually been falling

84
0:03:41.233,000 --> 0:03:42,000
even faster than transaction costs,

85
0:03:43.224,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which is why communication, the Internet,

86
0:03:45.783,000 --> 0:03:49,000
has exploded in such a dramatic fashion.

87
0:03:50.398,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, those falling transaction costs

88
0:03:52.568,000 --> 0:03:53,000
have profound consequences,

89
0:03:54.544,000 --> 0:03:55,000
because if transaction costs are the glue

90
0:03:56.337,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that hold value chains together, and they are falling,

91
0:03:58.759,000 --> 0:03:59,000
there is less to economize on.

92
0:04:00.401,000 --> 0:04:02,000
There is less need for vertically integrated organization,

93
0:04:03.333,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and value chains at least can break up.

94
0:04:06.211,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They needn't necessarily, but they can.

95
0:04:08.71,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In particular, it then becomes possible for

96
0:04:10.85,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a competitor in one business

97
0:04:12.616,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to use their position in one step of the value chain

98
0:04:15.941,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in order to penetrate or attack

99
0:04:17.773,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or disintermediate the competitor in another.

100
0:04:20.937,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That is not just an abstract proposition.

101
0:04:23.598,000 --> 0:04:24,000
There are many very specific stories

102
0:04:25.277,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of how that actually happened.

103
0:04:27.049,000 --> 0:04:3,000
A poster child example was the encyclopedia business.

104
0:04:30.542,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The encyclopedia business

105
0:04:31.991,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in the days of leatherbound books

106
0:04:34.093,000 --> 0:04:35,000
was basically a distribution business.

107
0:04:35.797,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen.

108
0:04:38.251,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,

109
0:04:40.877,000 --> 0:04:43,000
new technologies made the distribution of knowledge

110
0:04:44.293,000 --> 0:04:46,000
many orders of magnitude cheaper,

111
0:04:46.572,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the encyclopedia industry collapsed.

112
0:04:49.286,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's now, of course, a very familiar story.

113
0:04:52.118,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This, in fact, more generally was the story

114
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
of the first generation of the Internet economy.

115
0:04:56.669,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It was about falling transaction costs

116
0:04:58.869,000 --> 0:04:59,000
breaking up value chains

117
0:05:00.344,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and therefore allowing disintermediation,

118
0:05:02.973,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or what we call deconstruction.

119
0:05:05.31,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One of the questions I was occasionally asked was,

120
0:05:07.627,000 --> 0:05:09,000
well, what's going to replace the encyclopedia

121
0:05:10.143,000 --> 0:05:12,000
when Britannica no longer has a business model?

122
0:05:12.794,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And it was a while before the answer became manifest.

123
0:05:14.96,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now, of course, we know what it is: it's the Wikipedia.

124
0:05:17.747,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution.

125
0:05:20.97,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced.

126
0:05:23.374,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia

127
0:05:25.614,000 --> 0:05:27,000
created by its users.

128
0:05:28.141,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And this, in fact, defines what you might call

129
0:05:30.021,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the second decade of the Internet economy,

130
0:05:32.509,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the decade in which the Internet as a noun

131
0:05:35.869,000 --> 0:05:36,000
became the Internet as a verb.

132
0:05:37.776,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It became a set of conversations,

133
0:05:39.645,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the era in which user-generated content and social networks

134
0:05:43.721,000 --> 0:05:45,000
became the dominant phenomenon.

135
0:05:46.412,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now what that really meant

136
0:05:48.31,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in terms of the Porter-Henderson framework

137
0:05:51.684,000 --> 0:05:54,000
was the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale.

138
0:05:55.075,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It turned out that tens of thousands

139
0:05:57.413,000 --> 0:06:,000
of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia

140
0:06:00.496,000 --> 0:06:01,000
could do just as good a job,

141
0:06:02.042,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and certainly a much cheaper job,

142
0:06:03.733,000 --> 0:06:05,000
than professionals in a hierarchical organization.

143
0:06:06.712,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So basically what was happening was that one layer

144
0:06:09.169,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of this value chain was becoming fragmented,

145
0:06:12.063,000 --> 0:06:13,000
as individuals could take over

146
0:06:13.907,000 --> 0:06:16,000
where organizations were no longer needed.

147
0:06:17.194,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But there's another question that obviously this graph poses,

148
0:06:19.826,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which is, okay, we've gone through two decades --

149
0:06:22.109,000 --> 0:06:24,000
does anything distinguish the third?

150
0:06:24.787,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And what I'm going to argue is that indeed

151
0:06:26.902,000 --> 0:06:27,000
something does distinguish the third,

152
0:06:28.407,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it maps exactly on to the kind of

153
0:06:30.853,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Porter-Henderson logic that we've been talking about.

154
0:06:33.321,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And that is, about data.

155
0:06:35.908,000 --> 0:06:36,000
If we go back to around 2000,

156
0:06:37.577,000 --> 0:06:39,000
a lot of people were talking about the information revolution,

157
0:06:39.936,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data

158
0:06:42.237,000 --> 0:06:44,000
was growing, indeed growing quite fast.

159
0:06:44.511,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.

160
0:06:47.369,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We go forward to 2007,

161
0:06:49.187,000 --> 0:06:52,000
not only had the world's stock of data exploded,

162
0:06:52.372,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but there'd been this massive substitution

163
0:06:54.892,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of digital for analog.

164
0:06:56.907,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And more important even than that,

165
0:06:58.776,000 --> 0:06:59,000
if you look more carefully at this graph,

166
0:07:00.516,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what you will observe is that about a half

167
0:07:02.536,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of that digital data

168
0:07:04.15,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is information that has an I.P. address.

169
0:07:06.536,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's on a server or it's on a P.C.

170
0:07:09.387,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But having an I.P. address means that it

171
0:07:11.194,000 --> 0:07:13,000
can be connected to any other data

172
0:07:13.364,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that has an I.P. address.

173
0:07:15.227,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It means it becomes possible

174
0:07:16.873,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to put together half of the world's knowledge

175
0:07:19.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in order to see patterns,

176
0:07:21.612,000 --> 0:07:23,000
an entirely new thing.

177
0:07:23.969,000 --> 0:07:24,000
If we run the numbers forward to today,

178
0:07:25.937,000 --> 0:07:26,000
it probably looks something like this.

179
0:07:27.363,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We're not really sure.

180
0:07:28.531,000 --> 0:07:3,000
If we run the numbers forward to 2020,

181
0:07:30.559,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.

182
0:07:33.459,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present.

183
0:07:37.799,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication

184
0:07:42.194,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in the stock of information that is connected

185
0:07:45.167,000 --> 0:07:47,000
via an I.P. address.

186
0:07:47.395,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, if the number of connections that we can make

187
0:07:50.856,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is proportional to the number of pairs of data points,

188
0:07:53.996,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data

189
0:07:56.459,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is a ten-thousandfold multiplication

190
0:07:58.562,000 --> 0:07:59,000
in the number of patterns

191
0:08:00.127,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that we can see in that data,

192
0:08:02.204,000 --> 0:08:04,000
this just in the last 10 or 11 years.

193
0:08:04.864,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This, I would submit, is a sea change,

194
0:08:07.688,000 --> 0:08:09,000
a profound change in the economics

195
0:08:09.772,000 --> 0:08:1,000
of the world that we live in.

196
0:08:11.723,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The first human genome,

197
0:08:12.887,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that of James Watson,

198
0:08:14.453,000 --> 0:08:17,000
was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year 2000,

199
0:08:18.373,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and it took about 200 million dollars

200
0:08:20.55,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and about 10 years of work to map

201
0:08:22.531,000 --> 0:08:24,000
just one person's genomic makeup.

202
0:08:24.946,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Since then, the costs of mapping the genome have come down.

203
0:08:27.551,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In fact, they've come down in recent years

204
0:08:29.438,000 --> 0:08:3,000
very dramatically indeed,

205
0:08:31.112,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to the point where the cost is now below 1,000 dollars,

206
0:08:33.558,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015

207
0:08:36.509,000 --> 0:08:37,000
it will be below 100 dollars --

208
0:08:38.24,000 --> 0:08:41,000
a five or six order of magnitude drop

209
0:08:41.436,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in the cost of genomic mapping

210
0:08:43.381,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in just a 15-year period,

211
0:08:45.804,000 --> 0:08:47,000
an extraordinary phenomenon.

212
0:08:48.199,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, in the days when mapping a genome

213
0:08:52.604,000 --> 0:08:55,000
cost millions, or even tens of thousands,

214
0:08:55.613,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it was basically a research enterprise.

215
0:08:57.591,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Scientists would gather some representative people,

216
0:09:00.133,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and they would see patterns, and they would try

217
0:09:01.347,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and make generalizations about human nature and disease

218
0:09:04.237,000 --> 0:09:05,000
from the abstract patterns they find

219
0:09:05.828,000 --> 0:09:08,000
from these particular selected individuals.

220
0:09:09.288,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But when the genome can be mapped for 100 bucks,

221
0:09:12.121,000 --> 0:09:14,000
99 dollars while you wait,

222
0:09:14.469,000 --> 0:09:16,000
then what happens is, it becomes retail.

223
0:09:16.659,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It becomes above all clinical.

224
0:09:18.516,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You go the doctor with a cold,

225
0:09:19.728,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and if he or she hasn't done it already,

226
0:09:21.662,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the first thing they do is map your genome,

227
0:09:23.9,000 --> 0:09:24,000
at which point what they're now doing

228
0:09:25.555,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is not starting from some abstract knowledge of genomic medicine

229
0:09:30.084,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and trying to work out how it applies to you,

230
0:09:32.148,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but they're starting from your particular genome.

231
0:09:34.717,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Now think of the power of that.

232
0:09:36.157,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Think of where that takes us

233
0:09:37.946,000 --> 0:09:39,000
when we can combine genomic data

234
0:09:40.892,000 --> 0:09:41,000
with clinical data

235
0:09:42.381,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with data about drug interactions

236
0:09:44.34,000 --> 0:09:46,000
with the kind of ambient data that devices

237
0:09:46.629,000 --> 0:09:47,000
like our phone and medical sensors

238
0:09:48.388,000 --> 0:09:49,000
will increasingly be collecting.

239
0:09:50.246,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Think what happens when we collect all of that data

240
0:09:52.707,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and we can put it together

241
0:09:54.18,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.

242
0:09:56.668,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,

243
0:09:59.579,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but this will drive a revolution in medicine.

244
0:10:02.02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Fabulous, lots of people talk about this.

245
0:10:04.34,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention.

246
0:10:06.779,000 --> 0:10:09,000
How is that model of colossal sharing

247
0:10:10.063,000 --> 0:10:12,000
across all of those kinds of databases

248
0:10:12.709,000 --> 0:10:14,000
compatible with the business models

249
0:10:15.201,000 --> 0:10:17,000
of institutions and organizations and corporations

250
0:10:17.815,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that are involved in this business today?

251
0:10:20.112,000 --> 0:10:22,000
If your business is based on proprietary data,

252
0:10:22.888,000 --> 0:10:25,000
if your competitive advantage is defined by your data,

253
0:10:25.931,000 --> 0:10:28,000
how on Earth is that company or is that society

254
0:10:29.451,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in fact going to achieve the value

255
0:10:31.549,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that's implicit in the technology? They can't.

256
0:10:34.554,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So essentially what's happening here,

257
0:10:36.601,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and genomics is merely one example of this,

258
0:10:39.245,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is that technology is driving

259
0:10:41.559,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the natural scaling of the activity

260
0:10:44.128,000 --> 0:10:46,000
beyond the institutional boundaries within which

261
0:10:47.055,000 --> 0:10:49,000
we have been used to thinking about it,

262
0:10:49.213,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries

263
0:10:51.376,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in terms of which business strategy

264
0:10:53.63,000 --> 0:10:56,000
as a discipline is formulated.

265
0:10:57.085,000 --> 0:11:,000
The basic story here is that what used to be

266
0:11:00.571,000 --> 0:11:03,000
vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition

267
0:11:04.233,000 --> 0:11:06,000
among essentially similar kinds of competitors

268
0:11:07.024,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is evolving, by one means or another,

269
0:11:09.483,000 --> 0:11:12,000
from a vertical structure to a horizontal one.

270
0:11:12.844,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Why is that happening?

271
0:11:14.559,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting

272
0:11:17.064,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and because scale is polarizing.

273
0:11:18.992,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The plummeting of transaction costs

274
0:11:20.734,000 --> 0:11:22,000
weakens the glue that holds value chains together,

275
0:11:23.372,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and allows them to separate.

276
0:11:25.04,000 --> 0:11:26,000
The polarization of scale economies

277
0:11:26.975,000 --> 0:11:29,000
towards the very small -- small is beautiful --

278
0:11:30.101,000 --> 0:11:32,000
allows for scalable communities

279
0:11:32.769,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to substitute for conventional corporate production.

280
0:11:35.886,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The scaling in the opposite direction,

281
0:11:37.89,000 --> 0:11:39,000
towards things like big data,

282
0:11:39.923,000 --> 0:11:4,000
drive the structure of business

283
0:11:41.332,000 --> 0:11:43,000
towards the creation of new kinds of institutions

284
0:11:44.055,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that can achieve that scale.

285
0:11:46.033,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But either way, the typically vertical structure

286
0:11:48.791,000 --> 0:11:51,000
gets driven to becoming more horizontal.

287
0:11:51.795,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The logic isn't just about big data.

288
0:11:54.21,000 --> 0:11:57,000
If we were to look, for example, at the telecommunications industry,

289
0:11:57.536,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you can tell the same story about fiber optics.

290
0:11:59.911,000 --> 0:12:01,000
If we look at the pharmaceutical industry,

291
0:12:02.047,000 --> 0:12:03,000
or, for that matter, university research,

292
0:12:03.94,000 --> 0:12:04,000
you can say exactly the same story

293
0:12:05.614,000 --> 0:12:06,000
about so-called "big science."

294
0:12:07.353,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And in the opposite direction,

295
0:12:08.888,000 --> 0:12:1,000
if we look, say, at the energy sector,

296
0:12:11.085,000 --> 0:12:13,000
where all the talk is about how households

297
0:12:13.945,000 --> 0:12:16,000
will be efficient producers of green energy

298
0:12:17.529,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and efficient conservers of energy,

299
0:12:20.157,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.

300
0:12:22.037,000 --> 0:12:23,000
That is the fragmentation of scale

301
0:12:23.907,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because the very small can substitute

302
0:12:26.261,000 --> 0:12:28,000
for the traditional corporate scale.

303
0:12:28.855,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Either way, what we are driven to

304
0:12:30.646,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is this horizontalization of the structure of industries,

305
0:12:34.017,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and that implies fundamental changes

306
0:12:36.607,000 --> 0:12:38,000
in how we think about strategy.

307
0:12:38.669,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It means, for example, that we need to think

308
0:12:40.701,000 --> 0:12:42,000
about strategy as the curation

309
0:12:43.248,000 --> 0:12:45,000
of these kinds of horizontal structure,

310
0:12:45.893,000 --> 0:12:46,000
where things like business definition

311
0:12:47.533,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and even industry definition

312
0:12:49.095,000 --> 0:12:51,000
are actually the outcomes of strategy,

313
0:12:51.897,000 --> 0:12:54,000
not something that the strategy presupposes.

314
0:12:55.078,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It means, for example, we need to work out

315
0:12:58.234,000 --> 0:13:,000
how to accommodate collaboration

316
0:13:00.591,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and competition simultaneously.

317
0:13:02.457,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Think about the genome.

318
0:13:03.543,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We need to accommodate the very large

319
0:13:05.321,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and the very small simultaneously.

320
0:13:07.456,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And we need industry structures

321
0:13:09.399,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that will accommodate very, very different motivations,

322
0:13:12.341,000 --> 0:13:14,000
from the amateur motivations of people in communities

323
0:13:14.974,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to maybe the social motivations

324
0:13:16.947,000 --> 0:13:18,000
of infrastructure built by governments,

325
0:13:19.283,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or, for that matter, cooperative institutions

326
0:13:21.908,000 --> 0:13:23,000
built by companies that are otherwise competing,

327
0:13:24.4,000 --> 0:13:26,000
because that is the only way that they can get to scale.

328
0:13:27.394,000 --> 0:13:28,000
These kinds of transformations

329
0:13:29.371,000 --> 0:13:32,000
render the traditional premises of business strategy obsolete.

330
0:13:33.096,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They drive us into a completely new world.

331
0:13:35.665,000 --> 0:13:36,000
They require us, whether we are

332
0:13:37.086,000 --> 0:13:39,000
in the public sector or the private sector,

333
0:13:39.853,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to think very fundamentally differently

334
0:13:42.153,000 --> 0:13:43,000
about the structure of business,

335
0:13:43.973,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.

336
0:13:47.427,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Thank you.

337
0:13:50.24,000 --> 0:13:52,000

1
0:00:12.747,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'd like to start my performance by saying 90 percent of everything is crap.

2
0:00:18.923,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:20.149,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's called Sturgeon's law, and what that means

4
0:00:22.426,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is that the majority of anything is always bad.

5
0:00:29.447,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I have a giraffe here.

6
0:00:31.226,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back

7
0:00:33.51,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing.

8
0:00:38.474,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Sir, you caught the giraffe.

9
0:00:41.655,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I have a playing card in my hand.

10
0:00:44.806,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Freely name any card in the deck.

11
0:00:49.577,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Audience member: 10 of hearts.

12
0:00:51.229,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Helder Guimarães: 10 of hearts.

13
0:00:52.916,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You could have named any card in the deck,

14
0:00:55.019,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but you said the 10 of hearts.

15
0:00:57.901,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Ninety percent of everything is crap,

16
0:00:59.83,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so there's this to prove that Sturgeon was correct.

17
0:01:03.703,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:05.218,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Applause)

19
0:01:09.011,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:13.404,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Sir, this is not your show.

21
0:01:16.597,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:20.933,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay?

23
0:01:24.962,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Jesus.

24
0:01:26.793,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:28.884,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Crazy people.

26
0:01:30.636,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Well, the truth is,

27
0:01:34.015,000 --> 0:01:38,000
why is the majority of everything bad?

28
0:01:38.828,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And my answer is: I think we stop thinking too soon.

29
0:01:43.011,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I'll give you a clear little example,

30
0:01:45.031,000 --> 0:01:49,000
something that people used to do around the turn of the century --

31
0:01:49.164,000 --> 0:01:51,000
not this century, the other one.

32
0:01:51.57,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The idea was to take a piece of paper

33
0:01:54.574,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand,

34
0:01:59.802,000 --> 0:02:,000
in my case, the left hand.

35
0:02:01.657,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Something that would look like this.

36
0:02:13.858,000 --> 0:02:16,000
By the way you reacted, I can see your lack of interest.

37
0:02:17.467,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:19.105,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But that's okay, I understand why.

39
0:02:21.116,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We stop thinking too soon.

40
0:02:22.792,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But if we give it a little bit more thought,

41
0:02:24.928,000 --> 0:02:25,000
like a paper clip.

42
0:02:26.296,000 --> 0:02:31,000
A paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting.

43
0:02:31.876,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Not only that, if instead of using my hand with the fingers,

44
0:02:34.867,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I use my hand closed into a fist,

45
0:02:36.945,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that makes this even a little bit more interesting.

46
0:02:40.319,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Not only that, but I will impose myself a time limit of one second,

47
0:02:45.21,000 --> 0:02:5,000
something that would look like this.

48
0:02:52.17,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now -- no, no, no.

49
0:02:54.231,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Sturgeon may be correct.

50
0:02:57.698,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But he doesn't have to be correct forever.

51
0:02:59.996,000 --> 0:03:,000
Things can always change.

52
0:03:01.214,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Sir, what was the card?

53
0:03:03.291,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The 10 of hearts?

54
0:03:05.41,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There's this to prove that things can always change --

55
0:03:10.573,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the 10 of hearts.

56
0:03:12.839,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Applause)

57
0:03:15.998,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Secrets are important.

58
0:03:19.846,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And secrets are valuable.

59
0:03:22.406,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And this is the best secret I've ever experienced.

60
0:03:26.89,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It starts with a deck of cards onto the table,

61
0:03:29.981,000 --> 0:03:32,000
an old man and a claim,

62
0:03:33.139,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

63
0:03:37.34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It doesn't matter who the man was,

64
0:03:39.028,000 --> 0:03:44,000
all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head:

65
0:03:44.642,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

66
0:03:48.476,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, during all this time,

67
0:03:50.111,000 --> 0:03:52,000
he was holding a small notebook

68
0:03:52.451,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages

69
0:03:55.262,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and look at something.

70
0:03:56.865,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But I was not really paying attention to the book

71
0:04:00.489,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before,

72
0:04:05.076,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

73
0:04:08.52,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Now sir, you have the giraffe.

74
0:04:10.215,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Go ahead, throw it in any direction

75
0:04:11.905,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so that you can find someone else at random.

76
0:04:15.025,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Perfect. Sir, you're going to play my role in this story.

77
0:04:19.157,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The old man turned to me and he said,

78
0:04:21.281,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"You could pick a red card or a black card."

79
0:04:23.678,000 --> 0:04:24,000
My answer was ...

80
0:04:25.069,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Audience member 2: The black card.

81
0:04:26.719,000 --> 0:04:27,000
HG: Indeed!

82
0:04:28.03,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It was a black card.

83
0:04:30.194,000 --> 0:04:32,000
He said, "It could be a club or a spade,"

84
0:04:32.707,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and my answer was ...

85
0:04:34.46,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Audience member 2: Spade.

86
0:04:36.384,000 --> 0:04:39,000
HG: Indeed! It was a spade.

87
0:04:39.819,000 --> 0:04:42,000
He said, "It could be a high spade or a low spade."

88
0:04:42.954,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And my answer was ...

89
0:04:44.819,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Audience member 2: A high spade.

90
0:04:46.517,000 --> 0:04:48,000
HG: Indeed! It was a high spade.

91
0:04:49.197,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Since it's a high spade, it could be a nine, a 10,

92
0:04:51.65,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a jack, king, queen or the ace of spades.

93
0:04:54.573,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And my answer was ...

94
0:04:56.418,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Audience member 2: The king.

95
0:04:58.159,000 --> 0:05:01,000
HG: The king of spades, indeed.

96
0:05:02.275,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now sir, let's be fair.

97
0:05:03.417,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You selected black, you selected spade,

98
0:05:06.421,000 --> 0:05:08,000
you selected the high spade, and you selected -- sorry?

99
0:05:09.011,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Audience member 2: King. HG: King of spades.

100
0:05:11.13,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Did you feel I influenced you in any decision?

101
0:05:13.801,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Audience member 2: No, I just felt your energy.

102
0:05:16.089,000 --> 0:05:17,000
HG: But it was a free choice, correct?

103
0:05:17.931,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Because if not, we could start all over again.

104
0:05:20.094,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But it was really fair? Audience member 2: Absolutely.

105
0:05:22.639,000 --> 0:05:25,000
HG: Now, the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question,

106
0:05:25.958,000 --> 0:05:28,000
a number between one and 52.

107
0:05:29.024,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And the first number I thought of was ...

108
0:05:31.479,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Audience member 2: 17.

109
0:05:32.841,000 --> 0:05:36,000
HG: Indeed! It was the 17.

110
0:05:36.918,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The old man only said one more thing:

111
0:05:39.977,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"This is the end."

112
0:05:42.796,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And I knew exactly what that meant.

113
0:05:46.984,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I knew that he was going to touch the deck.

114
0:05:50.749,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Everything that you're about to see is exactly as it looked.

115
0:05:57.177,000 --> 0:06:,000
He took the deck out of the box.

116
0:06:00.748,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Nothing in the box.

117
0:06:03.726,000 --> 0:06:12,000
He counted, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."

118
0:06:13.827,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The tension was building.

119
0:06:16.092,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:19.758,000 --> 0:06:27,000
"11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17."

121
0:06:29.077,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And on the 17, instead of the king of spades,

122
0:06:33.556,000 --> 0:06:37,000
something appeared in the middle of the deck,

123
0:06:37.607,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that later, I would realize was actually a secret.

124
0:06:43.903,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The old man stood up, he left.

125
0:06:46.743,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I never saw him again.

126
0:06:49.53,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But he left his notebook

127
0:06:52.462,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that was there from the beginning.

128
0:06:55.031,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And when I picked it up,

129
0:06:57.566,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that was the best secret I've ever experienced.

130
0:07:04.23,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We are defined by the secrets we keep

131
0:07:08.401,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and by the secrets we share.

132
0:07:10.552,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And this was his way of sharing a secret with me.

133
0:07:15.417,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Applause)

134
0:07:24.43,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Crazy shit! Now --

135
0:07:26.398,000 --> 0:07:28,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:30.166,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I believe that amazing things happen all the time.

137
0:07:36.575,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I really do.

138
0:07:38.242,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And the reason why we don't see them as often,

139
0:07:41.42,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it's because we don't place ourselves in a position

140
0:07:44.366,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to search for those amazing things.

141
0:07:47.748,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But what if we decided to search for those amazing things,

142
0:07:52.502,000 --> 0:07:57,000
for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing?

143
0:07:58.742,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So you have the giraffe,

144
0:08:00.355,000 --> 0:08:04,000
go ahead, throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random.

145
0:08:06.838,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Sir, I'm going to ask you,

146
0:08:09.861,000 --> 0:08:14,000
do you have, with you, a United States $1 bill?

147
0:08:15.197,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Audience member 3: I think so.

148
0:08:16.835,000 --> 0:08:18,000
HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!

149
0:08:19.473,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

150
0:08:22.177,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Let's make sure you have it.

151
0:08:24.001,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Do you have it?

152
0:08:25.291,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Audience member 3: Yes. HG: Yes! Perfect.

153
0:08:27.565,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now, I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do.

154
0:08:30.539,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I have a dollar bill here to explain.

155
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I want you to take the dollar bill,

156
0:08:34.069,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and fold the Washington part inside, like this.

157
0:08:37.599,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So you get this kind of big square, okay?

158
0:08:40.579,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now, I want you to take the bill and fold it like this, lengthwise,

159
0:08:44.535,000 --> 0:08:45,000
so it becomes like a rectangle,

160
0:08:46.054,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and then again -- really fold it, really crease it --

161
0:08:48.573,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and when you have it,

162
0:08:50.057,000 --> 0:08:53,000
please fold the bill again into a little square like this

163
0:08:53.533,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and let me know when you have it.

164
0:08:56.708,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Do you have it? Perfect.

165
0:08:57.936,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now, I'm going to approach,

166
0:09:00.301,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and before we start,

167
0:09:01.8,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I want to make sure that we do this in very, very serious conditions.

168
0:09:05.097,000 --> 0:09:1,000
First of all, I want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip.

169
0:09:10.692,000 --> 0:09:13,000
First of all, take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill.

170
0:09:14.149,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And this is the reason why:

171
0:09:15.875,000 --> 0:09:17,000
later, I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage

172
0:09:18.506,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and I don't want you to think,

173
0:09:20.024,000 --> 0:09:22,000
oh, while I was distracted by Helder,

174
0:09:22.479,000 --> 0:09:24,000
someone came onstage and swapped the bill.

175
0:09:24.558,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So I want to make sure it's exactly the same bill.

176
0:09:27.033,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now not only that, I want you to take the paper clip

177
0:09:29.532,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and put it around the bill.

178
0:09:31.732,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill,

179
0:09:34.338,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it

180
0:09:37.617,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and see what I don't want to see.

181
0:09:39.28,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Is that fair?

182
0:09:40.441,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now you can give me the marker back.

183
0:09:42.228,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And just like that, very clearly,

184
0:09:44.488,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I want to make sure that we place this in full view

185
0:09:47.507,000 --> 0:09:52,000
from the beginning of this experience

186
0:09:52.693,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and to make sure that everyone is going to see it,

187
0:09:55.174,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we're going to actually have a camera man onstage.

188
0:09:58.939,000 --> 0:10:,000
Yes, perfect, so that you can see.

189
0:10:01.249,000 --> 0:10:03,000
That's your signature? Yes? Perfect.

190
0:10:03.579,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Now, we're going to use also the deck and a glass for this.

191
0:10:11.151,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And we're going to put ourselves in a position

192
0:10:13.969,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to search for an amazing coincidence.

193
0:10:16.853,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Do you mind, can you help me with this?

194
0:10:18.793,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle.

195
0:10:21.447,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And do you mind, can you take some cards and shuffle?

196
0:10:23.993,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You can take some cards and shuffle.

197
0:10:26.024,000 --> 0:10:28,000
You can shuffle cards in a variety of ways.

198
0:10:28.102,000 --> 0:10:29,000
You can shuffle cards like this.

199
0:10:29.634,000 --> 0:10:31,000
You can shuffle cards in a more messed up way,

200
0:10:31.815,000 --> 0:10:32,000
something like this.

201
0:10:32.87,000 --> 0:10:34,000
You can shuffle cards in the American way.

202
0:10:34.913,000 --> 0:10:37,000
As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it.

203
0:10:38.246,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But the important part is after shuffling the cards,

204
0:10:40.698,000 --> 0:10:42,000
always remember to cut and complete the cards.

205
0:10:42.951,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Do you mind doing that for me, sir?

206
0:10:44.663,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Please cut and complete.

207
0:10:45.859,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And when you have it, place the cards up in the air.

208
0:10:48.521,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And you too, cut and complete and up in the air.

209
0:10:50.784,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Up in the air.

210
0:10:52.025,000 --> 0:10:56,000
A deck of cards cut and shuffled by one, two, three, four and five people.

211
0:10:56.403,000 --> 0:11:,000
Now, very clearly, I'm going to gather the deck together.

212
0:11:02.494,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And just like that.

213
0:11:06.163,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone.

214
0:11:15.955,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I'm going to try.

215
0:11:25.49,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I have some cards that maybe,

216
0:11:29.689,000 --> 0:11:31,000
maybe they don't mean anything.

217
0:11:32.904,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But maybe that's because we are not paying close attention.

218
0:11:36.734,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Because maybe, maybe they mean a lot.

219
0:11:40.317,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Before we start, sir, you gave me a dollar bill.

220
0:11:43.766,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Is that your signature?

221
0:11:45.649,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Audience member 3: Yes it is.

222
0:11:47.069,000 --> 0:11:51,000
HG: I want you to see very clearly

223
0:11:51.174,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that I'm going to open your bill

224
0:11:54.431,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and reveal a small secret that we created.

225
0:11:59.228,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number.

226
0:12:05.357,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Madam, can you take the dollar bill?

227
0:12:09.296,000 --> 0:12:1,000
In the serial number, there is a letter.

228
0:12:11.242,000 --> 0:12:14,000
What is the first number after the letter?

229
0:12:14.485,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Audience member 4: Seven.

230
0:12:15.985,000 --> 0:12:16,000
HG: Seven.

231
0:12:17.884,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Seven.

232
0:12:20.529,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But, that's maybe just one coincidence.

233
0:12:23.509,000 --> 0:12:25,000
What is the second number? Audience member 4: Nine.

234
0:12:26.131,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So after the seven, we have a nine.

235
0:12:31.155,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And after the nine?

236
0:12:32.506,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Audience member 4: Two.

237
0:12:33.613,000 --> 0:12:35,000
HG: The two. And after the two?

238
0:12:35.633,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Audience member 4: Three.

239
0:12:36.875,000 --> 0:12:37,000
HG: Three, and after?

240
0:12:38.518,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Audience member 4: Three. HG: Three.

241
0:12:40.484,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Audience member 4: Seven. HG: Seven.

242
0:12:42.54,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Audience member 4: Four. HG: Four.

243
0:12:44.274,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Audience member 4: Two. HG: Two, and?

244
0:12:46.788,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Audience member 4: Q.

245
0:12:48.718,000 --> 0:12:51,000
HG: Q like in queen?

246
0:12:52.59,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Applause)

247
0:12:54.28,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The queen of clubs!

248
0:12:55.59,000 --> 0:12:58,000
All the cards in order, just for you.

249
0:12:59.42,000 --> 0:13:,000
And that's my show.

250
0:13:00.716,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Thank you very much and have a nice night.

251
0:13:03.623,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Applause)

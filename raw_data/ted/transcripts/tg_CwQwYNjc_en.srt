1
0:00:12.644,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'd like for you to take a moment to imagine this with me.

2
0:00:17.964,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You're a little girl of five years old.

3
0:00:21.889,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Sitting in front of a mirror,

4
0:00:23.642,000 --> 0:00:24,000
you ask yourself,

5
0:00:26.215,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"Do I exist?"

6
0:00:29.074,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In this space, there is very little context,

7
0:00:31.75,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and so you move into a different one,

8
0:00:34.338,000 --> 0:00:35,000
one filled with people.

9
0:00:36.944,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Surely, now you know you're not a figment of your own imagination.

10
0:00:41.043,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You breathe their air.

11
0:00:43.205,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You see them,

12
0:00:44.659,000 --> 0:00:45,000
so they must see you.

13
0:00:47.168,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And yet, you still can't help but wonder:

14
0:00:52.3,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Do I only exist when people speak to me?

15
0:00:57.616,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?

16
0:01:00.821,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But through various artworks that reflect upon our society,

17
0:01:05.353,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I came to understand how a young black girl can grow up

18
0:01:09.527,000 --> 0:01:14,000
feeling as if she's not seen, and perhaps she doesn't exist.

19
0:01:16.157,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You see, if young people don't have positive images of themselves

20
0:01:19.95,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and all that remains are negative stereotypes,

21
0:01:23.142,000 --> 0:01:24,000
this affects their self-image.

22
0:01:26.034,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But it also affects the way that the rest of society treats them.

23
0:01:31.102,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I discovered this

24
0:01:32.362,000 --> 0:01:35,000
having lived in Cape Town for about five years at the time.

25
0:01:36.934,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I felt a deep sense of dislocation and invisibility.

26
0:01:43.142,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I couldn't see myself represented.

27
0:01:46.181,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I couldn't see the women who've raised me,

28
0:01:49.06,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the ones who've influenced me,

29
0:01:50.946,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the ones that have made South Africa what it is today.

30
0:01:54.709,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I decided to do something about it.

31
0:01:58.945,000 --> 0:02:,000
What do you think when you see this?

32
0:02:03.571,000 --> 0:02:05,000
If you were a black girl,

33
0:02:05.716,000 --> 0:02:06,000
how would it make you feel?

34
0:02:09.093,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Walking down the street,

35
0:02:11.562,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what does the city you live in say to you?

36
0:02:15.446,000 --> 0:02:16,000
What symbols are present?

37
0:02:17.37,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Which histories are celebrated?

38
0:02:19.879,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And on the other hand,

39
0:02:21.129,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which ones are omitted?

40
0:02:23.523,000 --> 0:02:27,000
You see, public spaces are hardly ever as neutral as they may seem.

41
0:02:28.272,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I discovered this when I made this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.

42
0:02:36.092,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Cape Town is teeming with masculine architecture,

43
0:02:41.251,000 --> 0:02:43,000
monuments and statues,

44
0:02:43.334,000 --> 0:02:45,000
such as Louis Botha in that photograph.

45
0:02:46.656,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This overt presence of white colonial and Afrikaner nationalist men

46
0:02:52.596,000 --> 0:02:57,000
not only echoes a social, gender and racial divide,

47
0:02:58.747,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but it also continues to affect the way that women --

48
0:03:03.397,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and the way, particularly, black women --

49
0:03:06.621,000 --> 0:03:11,000
see themselves in relation to dominant male figures

50
0:03:12.056,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in public spaces.

51
0:03:16.896,000 --> 0:03:18,000
For this reason, among others,

52
0:03:19.212,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I don't believe that we need statues.

53
0:03:22.326,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The preservation of history and the act of remembering

54
0:03:26.236,000 --> 0:03:3,000
can be achieved in more memorable and effective ways.

55
0:03:32.244,000 --> 0:03:35,000
As part of a year-long public holiday series,

56
0:03:36.127,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I use performance art as a form of social commentary

57
0:03:40.278,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to draw people's attention to certain issues,

58
0:03:43.5,000 --> 0:03:48,000
as well as addressing the absence of the black female body

59
0:03:49.474,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in memorialized public spaces,

60
0:03:51.736,000 --> 0:03:52,000
especially on public holidays.

61
0:03:54.975,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Women's Day was coming up.

62
0:03:57.089,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I looked at what the day means --

63
0:03:59.78,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the Women's March to the union buildings in 1956,

64
0:04:04.459,000 --> 0:04:06,000
petitioning against the pass laws.

65
0:04:07.89,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy of how women are treated,

66
0:04:12.72,000 --> 0:04:14,000
especially in public spaces today,

67
0:04:15.8,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I decided to do something about it.

68
0:04:19.157,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Headline:

69
0:04:20.837,000 --> 0:04:25,000
[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank]

70
0:04:28.829,000 --> 0:04:31,000
How do I comment on such polar opposites?

71
0:04:33.557,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In the guise of my great-grandmother,

72
0:04:35.722,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I performed bare-breasted,

73
0:04:37.449,000 --> 0:04:39,000
close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.

74
0:04:41.146,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This space is also called Freedom Square,

75
0:04:43.751,000 --> 0:04:46,000
where women were a part of demonstrations against apartheid laws.

76
0:04:48.976,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I was not comfortable with women being seen as only victims in society.

77
0:04:56.359,000 --> 0:04:58,000
You might wonder how people reacted to this.

78
0:04:59.751,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Video) Woman: (Cheering)

79
0:05:03.186,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Woman 2 (offscreen): Yes!

80
0:05:12.874,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?

81
0:05:15.954,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Applause)

82
0:05:19.702,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So I realized that through my performances,

83
0:05:22.68,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I've been able to make regular people reflect upon their society,

84
0:05:27.788,000 --> 0:05:3,000
looking at the past as well as the current democracy.

85
0:05:31.512,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Video) Man (offscreen): She's been there since three o'clock.

86
0:05:34.493,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three. About an hour still?

87
0:05:37.251,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day.

88
0:05:45.531,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Man 1: It's very interesting.

89
0:05:47.539,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It's very powerful.

90
0:05:50.144,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I think it's cool.

91
0:05:54.463,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I think a lot of people are quick to join a group

92
0:05:59.812,000 --> 0:06:,000
that's a movement towards something,

93
0:06:01.708,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but not many people are ready to do something as an individual.

94
0:06:06.959,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Man 2: So it's the individual versus the collective.

95
0:06:09.59,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Man 1: Yeah.

96
0:06:10.77,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So I think her pushing her own individual message in performance ...

97
0:06:17.74,000 --> 0:06:18,000
it's powerful.

98
0:06:20.005,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Yeah, I think it's quite powerful that she's doing it on her own.

99
0:06:25.286,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I'd be interested to know why she's using hair extensions as wings,

100
0:06:29.451,000 --> 0:06:32,000
or whatever those things are meant to be.

101
0:06:34.694,000 --> 0:06:35,000
They are wings, yes?

102
0:06:38.574,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Woman 3: With her standing there right now,

103
0:06:40.864,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I think it's just my interpretation

104
0:06:44.848,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that we are bringing the statue down

105
0:06:48.243,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and bringing up something

106
0:06:50.492,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that's supposed to represent African pride, I think.

107
0:06:55.121,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Or something like that.

108
0:06:57.621,000 --> 0:07:,000
Something should stand while Rhodes falls,

109
0:07:01.121,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I think that's what it's saying. Yeah.

110
0:07:04.568,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Yes. Thank you.

111
0:07:05.808,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Man 3: What is behind me represents the African culture.

112
0:07:09.295,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We can't have the colonialist law,

113
0:07:11.708,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so we need to remove all these colonial statues.

114
0:07:14.623,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We have have our own statues now,

115
0:07:17.141,000 --> 0:07:21,000
our African leaders -- Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah --

116
0:07:22.037,000 --> 0:07:26,000
all those who paid their lives for our liberation.

117
0:07:26.294,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We can't continue in the 21st century,

118
0:07:28.626,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and after 21 years of democracy,

119
0:07:30.687,000 --> 0:07:32,000
have the colonizers in our own country.

120
0:07:32.851,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They belong somewhere. Maybe in a museum; not here.

121
0:07:35.848,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I mean learning institutions, places where young people,

122
0:07:39.022,000 --> 0:07:4,000
young minds are being shaped.

123
0:07:40.624,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha, Rhodes, all these people,

124
0:07:45.338,000 --> 0:07:47,000
because they're representing the colonialism.

125
0:07:50.519,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Applause)

126
0:07:55.835,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,

127
0:07:58.882,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the Cecil John Rhodes statue was scheduled to be removed

128
0:08:02.883,000 --> 0:08:06,000
after a month of debates for and against its removal

129
0:08:07.122,000 --> 0:08:08,000
by various stakeholders.

130
0:08:10.434,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This caused a widespread interest in statues in South Africa.

131
0:08:15.031,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Opinions varied, but the media focused on problematizing

132
0:08:20.386,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the removal of statues.

133
0:08:24.912,000 --> 0:08:27,000
On that -- well, that year, I had just begun my master's

134
0:08:28.771,000 --> 0:08:29,000
at the University of Cape Town.

135
0:08:32.065,000 --> 0:08:35,000
During the time of the debate of the statue,

136
0:08:35.479,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I had been having reoccurring dreams

137
0:08:39.413,000 --> 0:08:4,000
about a bird.

138
0:08:41.317,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And so I started conjuring her

139
0:08:44.019,000 --> 0:08:47,000
mentally, spiritually and through dress.

140
0:08:49.872,000 --> 0:08:5,000
On that day,

141
0:08:51.589,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I happened to be having a meeting with my supervisors,

142
0:08:55.249,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and they told me that the statue was going to fall on that day.

143
0:08:59.925,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I told them that I'd explain later,

144
0:09:02.368,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but we had to postpone the meeting

145
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because I was going to perform her as the statue came down.

146
0:09:09.352,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Her name was Chapungu.

147
0:09:11.256,000 --> 0:09:15,000
She was a soapstone bird that was looted from Great Zimbabwe

148
0:09:15.66,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in the late 1800s,

149
0:09:17.432,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and is still currently housed in Cecil John Rhodes's estate

150
0:09:21.489,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in Cape Town.

151
0:09:23.924,000 --> 0:09:24,000
On that day,

152
0:09:25.124,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I embodied her existence using my body,

153
0:09:29.258,000 --> 0:09:32,000
while standing in the blazing sun for nearly four hours.

154
0:09:35.066,000 --> 0:09:36,000
As the time came,

155
0:09:36.934,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the crane came alive.

156
0:09:39.021,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The people did, too --

157
0:09:40.822,000 --> 0:09:41,000
shouting,

158
0:09:42.005,000 --> 0:09:43,000
screaming,

159
0:09:43.266,000 --> 0:09:44,000
clenching their fists

160
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and taking pictures of the moment on their phones and cameras.

161
0:09:49.759,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Chapungu's wings,

162
0:09:51.302,000 --> 0:09:52,000
along with the crane,

163
0:09:52.725,000 --> 0:09:56,000
rose to declare the fall of Cecil John Rhodes.

164
0:09:58.963,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Applause)

165
0:10:04.012,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Euphoria filled the air as he became absent from his base,

166
0:10:08.629,000 --> 0:10:1,000
while she remained still,

167
0:10:12.011,000 --> 0:10:13,000
very present,

168
0:10:13.634,000 --> 0:10:15,000
half an hour after his removal.

169
0:10:18.27,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Twenty-three years after apartheid,

170
0:10:21.054,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a new generation of radicals has arisen in South Africa.

171
0:10:24.481,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The story of Chapungu and Rhodes in the same space and time

172
0:10:29.378,000 --> 0:10:3,000
asks important questions

173
0:10:31.157,000 --> 0:10:33,000
related to gender,

174
0:10:34.056,000 --> 0:10:35,000
power,

175
0:10:35.357,000 --> 0:10:36,000
self-representation,

176
0:10:37.162,000 --> 0:10:38,000
history making

177
0:10:38.775,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and repatriation.

178
0:10:43.07,000 --> 0:10:44,000
From then on,

179
0:10:44.244,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I realized that my spiritual beliefs and dreams

180
0:10:49.489,000 --> 0:10:51,000
texture my material reality.

181
0:10:53.249,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But for me, Chapungu's story felt incomplete.

182
0:10:56.636,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This soapstone bird,

183
0:10:58.409,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a spiritual medium and messenger of God and the ancestors,

184
0:11:02.8,000 --> 0:11:04,000
needed me to continue her story.

185
0:11:05.501,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And so I dabbled in the dream space a little bit more,

186
0:11:09.941,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and this is how "Falling" was born.

[FALLING]

190
0:11:58.734,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Applause)

191
0:12:02.571,000 --> 0:12:03,000
In the film,

192
0:12:03.745,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany share a common story

193
0:12:07.527,000 --> 0:12:1,000
about the soapstone birds that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.

194
0:12:12.156,000 --> 0:12:14,000
After Zimbabwe gained its independence,

195
0:12:14.493,000 --> 0:12:17,000
all the birds except for one were returned to the monument.

196
0:12:18.984,000 --> 0:12:23,000
"Falling" explores the mythological belief that there will be unrest

197
0:12:24.134,000 --> 0:12:26,000
until the final bird is returned.

198
0:12:28.718,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Through my work,

199
0:12:30.065,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I have realized a lot about the world around me:

200
0:12:34.057,000 --> 0:12:35,000
how we move through spaces,

201
0:12:37.109,000 --> 0:12:39,000
who we choose to celebrate

202
0:12:39.468,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and who we remember.

203
0:12:41.9,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Now I look in the mirror and not only see an image of myself,

204
0:12:46.679,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but of the women who have made me who I am today.

205
0:12:50.536,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I stand tall in my work,

206
0:12:53.608,000 --> 0:12:55,000
celebrating women's histories,

207
0:12:56.093,000 --> 0:12:58,000
in the hope that perhaps one day,

208
0:12:59.314,000 --> 0:13:02,000
no little black girl has to ever feel

209
0:13:02.594,000 --> 0:13:03,000
like she doesn't exist.

210
0:13:04.504,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Thank you.

211
0:13:05.748,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Applause)

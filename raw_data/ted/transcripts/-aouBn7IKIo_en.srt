1
0:00:14.939,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Music)

2
0:00:19.555,000 --> 0:00:22,000
For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City,

3
0:00:23.221,000 --> 0:00:27,000
these shots might start to look familiar.

4
0:00:28.116,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This is Central Park,

5
0:00:29.8,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one of the most beautifully designed

6
0:00:31.536,000 --> 0:00:33,000
public spaces in America.

7
0:00:34.432,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But to anyone who hasn't visited,

8
0:00:36.934,000 --> 0:00:39,000
these images can't really fully convey.

9
0:00:40.565,000 --> 0:00:42,000
To really understand Central Park,

10
0:00:42.61,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you have to physically be there.

11
0:00:45.769,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Well, the same is true of the music,

12
0:00:49.874,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which my brother and I composed and mapped

13
0:00:52.671,000 --> 0:00:55,000
specifically for Central Park.

14
0:00:55.757,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Music)

15
0:01:00.815,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work

16
0:01:03.641,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that my brother Hays and I are doing --

17
0:01:06.798,000 --> 0:01:09,000
That's us there. That's both of us actually —

18
0:01:10.244,000 --> 0:01:13,000
specifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years,

19
0:01:14.051,000 --> 0:01:17,000
this idea of location-aware music.

20
0:01:17.66,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, my brother and I, we're musicians

21
0:01:19.614,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and music producers.

22
0:01:21.253,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We've been working together since,

23
0:01:22.889,000 --> 0:01:24,000
well, since we were kids, really.

24
0:01:24.901,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But recently, we've become more and more interested

25
0:01:27.5,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in projects where art

26
0:01:29.42,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and technology intersect,

27
0:01:32.248,000 --> 0:01:34,000
from creating sight-specific audio

28
0:01:34.475,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and video installation

29
0:01:36.347,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to engineering interactive concerts.

30
0:01:39.349,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But today I want to focus on this concept

31
0:01:41.996,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of composition for physical space.

32
0:01:45.738,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But before I go too much further into that,

33
0:01:48.187,000 --> 0:01:49,000
let me tell you a little bit about how we got started

34
0:01:49.9,000 --> 0:01:5,000
with this idea.

35
0:01:51.737,000 --> 0:01:53,000
My brother and I were living in New York City

36
0:01:53.792,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude

37
0:01:55.579,000 --> 0:01:57,000
did their temporary installation, The Gates,

38
0:01:57.808,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in Central Park.

39
0:01:59.629,000 --> 0:02:,000
Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures

40
0:02:01.273,000 --> 0:02:04,000
decorated the park for a number of weeks,

41
0:02:04.475,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and unlike work that's exhibited

42
0:02:06.407,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in a more neutral space,

43
0:02:07.955,000 --> 0:02:1,000
like on the walls of a gallery or a museum,

44
0:02:11.11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
this was work that was really in dialogue

45
0:02:13.421,000 --> 0:02:14,000
with this place,

46
0:02:14.801,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and in a lot of ways, The Gates

47
0:02:16.733,000 --> 0:02:17,000
was really a celebration

48
0:02:18.189,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design.

49
0:02:20.922,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This was an experience that stayed with us

50
0:02:23.184,000 --> 0:02:25,000
for a long time, and years later,

51
0:02:25.453,000 --> 0:02:27,000
my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C.,

52
0:02:28.278,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and we started to ask the question,

53
0:02:30.555,000 --> 0:02:31,000
would it be possible,

54
0:02:32.319,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in the same way that The Gates

55
0:02:33.76,000 --> 0:02:36,000
responded to the physical layout of the park,

56
0:02:36.958,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to compose music for a landscape?

57
0:02:41.8,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Which brought us to this.

58
0:02:44.447,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Music)

59
0:02:49.369,000 --> 0:02:52,000
On Memorial Day, we released "The National Mall,"

60
0:02:53.005,000 --> 0:02:55,000
a location-aware album

61
0:02:55.493,000 --> 0:02:57,000
released exclusively as a mobile app

62
0:02:58.21,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that uses the device's built-in GPS functionality

63
0:03:01.921,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to sonically map the entire park

64
0:03:04.706,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in our hometown of Washington, D.C.

65
0:03:10.46,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Hundreds of musical segments

66
0:03:12.481,000 --> 0:03:15,000
are geo-tagged throughout the entire park

67
0:03:15.742,000 --> 0:03:17,000
so that as a listener traverses the landscape,

68
0:03:18.586,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a musical score is actually unfolding around them.

69
0:03:21.995,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So this is not a playlist or a list of songs

70
0:03:24.235,000 --> 0:03:26,000
intended for the park,

71
0:03:26.79,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms

72
0:03:29.786,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that fit together like pieces of a puzzle

73
0:03:32.083,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and blend seamlessly

74
0:03:33.646,000 --> 0:03:35,000
based on a listener's chosen trajectory.

75
0:03:36.112,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So think of this as

76
0:03:37.483,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a choose-your-own-adventure of an album.

77
0:03:40.024,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Let's take a closer look.

78
0:03:41.616,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Let's look at one example here.

79
0:03:43.404,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So using the app,

80
0:03:45.682,000 --> 0:03:47,000
as you make your way towards the grounds

81
0:03:47.956,000 --> 0:03:48,000
surrounding the Washington Monument,

82
0:03:49.778,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you hear the sounds of instruments warming up,

83
0:03:53.989,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron

84
0:03:56.997,000 --> 0:04:,000
spelling out a very simple melody.

85
0:04:01.759,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.

86
0:04:07.595,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Keep walking, and a full choir joins in,

87
0:04:11.992,000 --> 0:04:13,000
until you finally reach the top of the hill

88
0:04:14.094,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks

89
0:04:16.844,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and all sorts of musical craziness,

90
0:04:19.13,000 --> 0:04:21,000
as if all of these sounds are radiating out

91
0:04:21.943,000 --> 0:04:22,000
from this giant obelisk that punctuates

92
0:04:23.783,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the center of the park.

93
0:04:26.712,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But were you to walk in the opposite direction,

94
0:04:29.501,000 --> 0:04:34,000
this entire sequence happens in reverse.

95
0:04:34.872,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park,

96
0:04:38.072,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the music would fade to silence,

97
0:04:40.294,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and the play button would disappear.

98
0:04:43.671,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We're sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world

99
0:04:46.719,000 --> 0:04:47,000
who can't travel to the United States,

100
0:04:48.646,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but would like to hear this record.

101
0:04:50.797,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Well, unlike a normal album,

102
0:04:53.44,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we haven't been able to accommodate this request.

103
0:04:55.728,000 --> 0:04:57,000
When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,

104
0:04:58.726,000 --> 0:05:,000
we just can't make that happen,

105
0:05:00.922,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the reason is because

106
0:05:03.1,000 --> 0:05:04,000
this isn't a promotional app

107
0:05:05.085,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or a game to promote or accompany

108
0:05:07.534,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the release of a traditional record.

109
0:05:09.819,000 --> 0:05:12,000
In this case, the app is the work itself,

110
0:05:13.553,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and the architecture of the landscape

111
0:05:15.436,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is intrinsic to the listening experience.

112
0:05:20.079,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Six months later, we did a location-aware album

113
0:05:22.947,000 --> 0:05:23,000
for Central Park,

114
0:05:24.488,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a park that is over two times the size of the National Mall,

115
0:05:27.76,000 --> 0:05:29,000
with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow

116
0:05:30.144,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to the Ramble to the Reservoir.

117
0:05:33.556,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Currently, my brother and I are working on

118
0:05:35.559,000 --> 0:05:37,000
projects all over the country,

119
0:05:37.876,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but last spring we started a project,

120
0:05:40.124,000 --> 0:05:41,000
here actually at Stanford's

121
0:05:41.785,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Experimental Media Art Department,

122
0:05:44.377,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where we're creating our largest location-aware album to date,

123
0:05:47.335,000 --> 0:05:49,000
one that will span the entirety of Highway 1

124
0:05:49.425,000 --> 0:05:51,000
here on the Pacific Coast.

125
0:05:51.715,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,

126
0:05:55.865,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is really just one idea.

127
0:05:58.368,000 --> 0:06:,000
But it speaks to a larger vision

128
0:06:00.706,000 --> 0:06:02,000
for a music industry that's sometimes struggled

129
0:06:02.855,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to find its footing in this digital age,

130
0:06:05.687,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that they begin to see these new technologies

131
0:06:08.152,000 --> 0:06:1,000
not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles

132
0:06:10.397,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to an existing model,

133
0:06:12.254,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but to dream up entirely new ways

134
0:06:13.992,000 --> 0:06:14,000
for people to interact with

135
0:06:15.709,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and experience music.

136
0:06:17.451,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Thank you.

137
0:06:19.495,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Applause)

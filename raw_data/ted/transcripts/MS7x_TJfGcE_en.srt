1
0:00:11.82,000 --> 0:00:17,000
so when I was 14 my family was in the

2
0:00:16.39,000 --> 0:00:2,000
process of adopting my little brothers

3
0:00:18.099,000 --> 0:00:23,000
from Ethiopia and one day my mom asked

4
0:00:21.34,000 --> 0:00:26,000
what day should we put for their

5
0:00:23.439,000 --> 0:00:3,000
birthday uh the day they were born

6
0:00:26.38,000 --> 0:00:33,000
obviously ridiculous question and my mom

7
0:00:30.55,000 --> 0:00:34,000
said well Kristen neither of your little

8
0:00:33.64,000 --> 0:00:37,000
brothers have a birth certificate so how

9
0:00:35.5,000 --> 0:00:41,000
do you suggest we find out when that was

10
0:00:38.1,000 --> 0:00:42,000
mine alone now 20 years later I'm still

11
0:00:41.74,000 --> 0:00:44,000
working on it

12
0:00:42.66,000 --> 0:00:45,000
except instead of trying to solve the

13
0:00:44.86,000 --> 0:00:46,000
mystery of my brother's missing 4

14
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
certificates I tried to solve this

15
0:00:47.8,000 --> 0:00:5,000
problem globally so what do birth

16
0:00:50.02,000 --> 0:00:53,000
certificates has to do with

17
0:00:51.25,000 --> 0:00:55,000
international development to answer that

18
0:00:53.83,000 --> 0:00:56,000
we have to look back at the original

19
0:00:55.45,000 --> 0:01:,000
development agenda the Human Rights

20
0:00:57.31,000 --> 0:01:02,000
agenda so in 1948 the Universal

21
0:01:00.579,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Declaration of Human Rights for the

22
0:01:02.62,000 --> 0:01:07,000
first time set a shared vision of basic

23
0:01:05.95,000 --> 0:01:11,000
human rights and dignities that apply to

24
0:01:07.99,000 --> 0:01:13,000
all people in all nations article 6 the

25
0:01:12.1,000 --> 0:01:17,000
right to be recognized as a person

26
0:01:14.319,000 --> 0:01:18,000
before the law or a legal identity for

27
0:01:17.38,000 --> 0:01:21,000
children this is a birth certificate and

28
0:01:19.06,000 --> 0:01:25,000
despite this being a universal human

29
0:01:21.52,000 --> 0:01:26,000
right 1 billion people today have no

30
0:01:25.09,000 --> 0:01:29,000
record they exist making it one of the

31
0:01:27.49,000 --> 0:01:31,000
greatest human rights violations of our

32
0:01:29.619,000 --> 0:01:36,000
time yet nobody seems to know about it

33
0:01:32.35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in the face of world poverty and hunger

34
0:01:36.639,000 --> 0:01:39,000
making sure everyone in the world has a

35
0:01:38.38,000 --> 0:01:43,000
legal identity doesn't really seem

36
0:01:39.909,000 --> 0:01:45,000
important but in reality it is see early

37
0:01:43.899,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in my career I was working with a social

38
0:01:46.6,000 --> 0:01:5,000
worker in a slum community in Mumbai and

39
0:01:48.909,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we were following up on a case with this

40
0:01:50.95,000 --> 0:01:53,000
little girl who had contracted polio as

41
0:01:52.869,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a baby and was paralyzed from the waist

42
0:01:54.85,000 --> 0:02:,000
down when we arrived at the home we

43
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:02,000
found her on the floor her legs were

44
0:02:00.88,000 --> 0:02:03,000
badly scarred and infected she was

45
0:02:03.579,000 --> 0:02:07,000
malnourished

46
0:02:04.389,000 --> 0:02:09,000
she had never gone to school and she had

47
0:02:07.749,000 --> 0:02:13,000
spent most of her life confined to the

48
0:02:10.209,000 --> 0:02:16,000
small dark room when we left I asked the

49
0:02:14.17,000 --> 0:02:18,000
social worker what the case plan was and

50
0:02:16.72,000 --> 0:02:19,000
she said well first we have to get her a

51
0:02:18.61,000 --> 0:02:2,000
birth certificate I was a little taken

52
0:02:20.47,000 --> 0:02:22,000
aback

53
0:02:21.01,000 --> 0:02:24,000
so well don't you think we need to get

54
0:02:22.78,000 --> 0:02:25,000
her some social assistance and us in a

55
0:02:24.67,000 --> 0:02:28,000
safe place to live and into a school she

56
0:02:26.769,000 --> 0:02:3,000
goes exactly which is why we need to get

57
0:02:28.72,000 --> 0:02:33,000
her a birth certificate see without a

58
0:02:31.45,000 --> 0:02:35,000
legal identity you are not recognized as

59
0:02:33.879,000 --> 0:02:37,000
a person by the government and a person

60
0:02:35.799,000 --> 0:02:39,000
who doesn't officially exists can't

61
0:02:38.049,000 --> 0:02:42,000
access government services and the

62
0:02:40.18,000 --> 0:02:43,000
government can only provide services for

63
0:02:42.19,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the number of people they know about

64
0:02:43.81,000 --> 0:02:49,000
hence people are overlooked for example

65
0:02:46.629,000 --> 0:02:51,000
by routine immunization services people

66
0:02:50.14,000 --> 0:02:54,000
without a legal identity are both

67
0:02:52.18,000 --> 0:02:57,000
uncounted and unprotected they're among

68
0:02:55.06,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the poorest members of society from the

69
0:02:57.25,000 --> 0:03:02,000
most marginalized communities they're

70
0:02:59.709,000 --> 0:03:03,000
victims of trafficking human traffickers

71
0:03:02.53,000 --> 0:03:06,000
know that it's nearly impossible to find

72
0:03:04.659,000 --> 0:03:08,000
someone if there was never a record they

73
0:03:07.269,000 --> 0:03:11,000
existed in the first place they are

74
0:03:09.609,000 --> 0:03:13,000
victims of exploitation such as child

75
0:03:11.65,000 --> 0:03:15,000
marriage and child labor without a birth

76
0:03:13.959,000 --> 0:03:17,000
certificate how do you prove a child is

77
0:03:15.79,000 --> 0:03:19,000
still a child they're among the

78
0:03:18.099,000 --> 0:03:21,000
stateless birth certificates provide

79
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
proof of who your parents are and where

80
0:03:21.94,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you were born the two main factors for

81
0:03:24.37,000 --> 0:03:29,000
acquiring nationality of the 1 billion

82
0:03:28.09,000 --> 0:03:32,000
people in the world without a legal

83
0:03:29.62,000 --> 0:03:33,000
identity the vast majority are children

84
0:03:32.169,000 --> 0:03:36,000
who are never registered at birth and

85
0:03:33.76,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the least developed nations the births

86
0:03:36.4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of over 60% of children have never been

87
0:03:39.04,000 --> 0:03:44,000
recorded a study across 17 countries in

88
0:03:42.669,000 --> 0:03:45,000
sub-saharan Africa found that 80% of

89
0:03:44.98,000 --> 0:03:47,000
children did not have a birth

90
0:03:46.18,000 --> 0:03:5,000
certificate out of the countries that

91
0:03:48.76,000 --> 0:03:53,000
have not yet achieved universal birth

92
0:03:51.04,000 --> 0:03:56,000
registration coverage in 26 countries a

93
0:03:54.669,000 --> 0:03:59,000
birth certificate is required to access

94
0:03:56.65,000 --> 0:04:01,000
health care including vaccines in 37

95
0:04:00.28,000 --> 0:04:03,000
countries it's required to access social

96
0:04:01.959,000 --> 0:04:08,000
assistance intended to bring people out

97
0:04:04.15,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of poverty and in 59 countries a birth

98
0:04:09.819,000 --> 0:04:14,000
certificate is required for a child to

99
0:04:11.769,000 --> 0:04:16,000
be enrolled or complete school a birth

100
0:04:15.159,000 --> 0:04:18,000
certificate is also often required for

101
0:04:17.32,000 --> 0:04:21,000
other forms of legal identity like a

102
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:23,000
national ID or a passport and some form

103
0:04:21.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of legal identity in almost every

104
0:04:23.53,000 --> 0:04:27,000
country is required to vote get a SIM

105
0:04:25.99,000 --> 0:04:29,000
card or open a bank account in fact of

106
0:04:28.479,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the 1.7 billion people in the world who

107
0:04:30.669,000 --> 0:04:34,000
are unbanked 20% is due to not having a

108
0:04:33.789,000 --> 0:04:36,000
legal identity

109
0:04:35.13,000 --> 0:04:4,000
now you don't have to be an expert to

110
0:04:37.69,000 --> 0:04:4,000
see that this times a billion is a big

111
0:04:40.21,000 --> 0:04:43,000
problem

112
0:04:41.169,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so it's not surprising that evidence

113
0:04:43.54,000 --> 0:04:46,000
shows that improved birth registration

114
0:04:45.19,000 --> 0:04:48,000
coverage goes hand-in-hand with improved

115
0:04:47.05,000 --> 0:04:51,000
development outcomes from poverty

116
0:04:48.82,000 --> 0:04:54,000
alleviation to better health nutrition

117
0:04:51.34,000 --> 0:04:59,000
education economic improvement and safe

118
0:04:54.85,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and orderly migration in 2015

119
0:04:59.97,000 --> 0:05:05,000
world leaders came together and promised

120
0:05:03.97,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that they would uphold human rights of

121
0:05:05.979,000 --> 0:05:11,000
all people and leave no one behind and

122
0:05:08.62,000 --> 0:05:13,000
efforts to end poverty hunger and reduce

123
0:05:12.25,000 --> 0:05:16,000
inequalities but how are they gonna

124
0:05:14.32,000 --> 0:05:17,000
uphold human rights and how do they know

125
0:05:16.27,000 --> 0:05:2,000
if anyone is being left behind if they

126
0:05:18.25,000 --> 0:05:26,000
do not know who they are or where they

127
0:05:20.74,000 --> 0:05:27,000
are in the first place so what can

128
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
countries do about this now there's a

129
0:05:28.51,000 --> 0:05:32,000
one-size-fits-all model because every

130
0:05:30.61,000 --> 0:05:34,000
country contexts unique there are five

131
0:05:33.19,000 --> 0:05:37,000
proven interventions that can be applied

132
0:05:35.11,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to any system number one reduced the

133
0:05:37.9,000 --> 0:05:42,000
distance to remove the cost three

134
0:05:40.87,000 --> 0:05:45,000
simplify the process for remove

135
0:05:43.27,000 --> 0:05:49,000
discrimination five increased demand

136
0:05:46.8,000 --> 0:05:51,000
gender discrimination remains a hidden

137
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
problem because statistically there's no

138
0:05:52.66,000 --> 0:05:55,000
difference between registration rates of

139
0:05:54.25,000 --> 0:05:57,000
boys and girls but the discrimination

140
0:05:55.78,000 --> 0:06:,000
isn't against the child is against the

141
0:05:57.639,000 --> 0:06:02,000
mother Angola was one of 35 countries

142
0:06:01.06,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that required a father's name or to be

143
0:06:03.34,000 --> 0:06:07,000
present in order for the child's first

144
0:06:05.05,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to be registered so in situations where

145
0:06:07.599,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the father is unknown unwilling or

146
0:06:10.06,000 --> 0:06:14,000
unable to claim paternity the mothers

147
0:06:12.46,000 --> 0:06:16,000
are legally prevented from registering

148
0:06:14.5,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the births of their own children so to

149
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
address this Angola put a policy in

150
0:06:19.479,000 --> 0:06:24,000
place allowing mothers to register their

151
0:06:21.31,000 --> 0:06:28,000
children as a single parent in Tanzania

152
0:06:25.06,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in 2012 only 13% of children had a birth

153
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
certificate so the government came up

154
0:06:30.4,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with a new system they put registration

155
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
centers in existing infrastructure such

156
0:06:38.349,000 --> 0:06:43,000
as community wards and in health

157
0:06:41.32,000 --> 0:06:44,000
facilities so they brought the services

158
0:06:43.419,000 --> 0:06:47,000
closer to the people who needed them

159
0:06:44.77,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they removed the fee they simplified the

160
0:06:48.13,000 --> 0:06:5,000
process

161
0:06:48.49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and automated it so the birth

162
0:06:50.259,000 --> 0:06:53,000
certificate could be issued on the spot

163
0:06:51.9,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to increase demand they rolled out a

164
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
public awareness campaign letting no

165
0:06:56.02,000 --> 0:06:59,000
letting people know that there's a new

166
0:06:57.669,000 --> 0:07:01,000
process and why it was important to

167
0:06:59.74,000 --> 0:07:03,000
register the births of their children in

168
0:07:01.919,000 --> 0:07:06,000
just a few years in the districts where

169
0:07:04.479,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the new system was put in place 83% of

170
0:07:07.599,000 --> 0:07:1,000
children now have birth certificates and

171
0:07:09.28,000 --> 0:07:14,000
they're in the process of rolling this

172
0:07:10.81,000 --> 0:07:16,000
out nationwide so what can you do

173
0:07:14.789,000 --> 0:07:19,000
see I believe we are all united by our

174
0:07:17.62,000 --> 0:07:21,000
humanity we are live on the same earth

175
0:07:20.139,000 --> 0:07:24,000
we breathe the same air and while none

176
0:07:22.599,000 --> 0:07:25,000
of us chose to be born or the situation

177
0:07:24.4,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we were born into we do get to choose

178
0:07:26.259,000 --> 0:07:32,000
how we live change occurs when a moment

179
0:07:30.34,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of awareness or a moment of compassion

180
0:07:33.21,000 --> 0:07:38,000
inspires a person to act and through our

181
0:07:36.13,000 --> 0:07:4,000
collective action we become the most

182
0:07:38.47,000 --> 0:07:42,000
powerful agents of change

183
0:07:40.18,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and when the cost of inaction is

184
0:07:42.699,000 --> 0:07:46,000
innocent children are left unprotected

185
0:07:44.49,000 --> 0:07:48,000
unvaccinated unable to go to school

186
0:07:47.44,000 --> 0:07:51,000
growing up to be adults who are unable

187
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to find decent work or vote trapped in a

188
0:07:52.419,000 --> 0:07:58,000
cycle of poverty exclusion and

189
0:07:54.759,000 --> 0:08:,000
invisibility it comes down to us to take

190
0:07:58.659,000 --> 0:08:03,000
this issue out of the darkness and into

191
0:08:01.03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the light because it's not every day you

192
0:08:04.18,000 --> 0:08:09,000
get the opportunity to change the world

193
0:08:05.83,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but today you do

194
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000

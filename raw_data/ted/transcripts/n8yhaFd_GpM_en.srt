1
0:00:12.584,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Eight years ago, I was haunted by an evil spirit.

2
0:00:20.106,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was 25 at the time,

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I was living in a tiny house behind someone else's house

4
0:00:26.792,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in Los Angeles.

5
0:00:28.111,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It was this guest house, it had kind of been dilapidated,

6
0:00:31.787,000 --> 0:00:33,000
not taken care of for a long time.

7
0:00:34.49,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And one night, I was sitting there

8
0:00:37.965,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I got this really spooky feeling,

9
0:00:42.491,000 --> 0:00:45,000
kind of the feeling like you're being watched.

10
0:00:45.533,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But no one was there except my two dogs,

11
0:00:48.576,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and they were just chewing their feet.

12
0:00:51.128,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I looked around. No one was there.

13
0:00:54.985,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And I thought, OK, it's just my imagination.

14
0:00:59.23,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But the feeling just kept getting worse,

15
0:01:01.865,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I started to feel this pressure in my chest,

16
0:01:07.181,000 --> 0:01:1,000
sort of like the feeling when you get bad news.

17
0:01:10.297,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But it started to sink lower and lower

18
0:01:13.632,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and almost hurt.

19
0:01:15.87,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And over the course of that week, this feeling got worse and worse,

20
0:01:19.628,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I started to become convinced that something was there

21
0:01:25.148,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in my little guest house, haunting me.

22
0:01:29.843,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I started to hear these sounds,

23
0:01:32.982,000 --> 0:01:37,000
this "whoosh," kind of whisper, like something passing through me.

24
0:01:40.305,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I called my best friend, Claire, and said,

25
0:01:45.398,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"I know this is going to sound crazy,

26
0:01:48.581,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but, um ...

27
0:01:50.669,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I think there's a ghost in my house, and I need to get rid of it."

28
0:01:55.672,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And she said -- she's very open-minded -- and she said,

29
0:02:00.044,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"I don't think you're crazy.

30
0:02:01.573,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I think you just need to do a cleansing ritual."

31
0:02:05.471,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:07.276,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"So get some sage and burn it,

33
0:02:12.725,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and tell it to go away."

34
0:02:15.247,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So I said, "OK," and I went and I bought sage.

35
0:02:18.933,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I had never done this before, so I set the sage on fire,

36
0:02:23.018,000 --> 0:02:29,000
waved it about, and said, "Go away! This is my house! I live here.

37
0:02:29.742,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You don't live here!"

38
0:02:32.413,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But the feeling stayed. Nothing got better.

39
0:02:35.718,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And then I started to think,

40
0:02:37.938,000 --> 0:02:39,000
OK, well now this thing is probably just laughing at me,

41
0:02:40.734,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because it hasn't left,

42
0:02:43.186,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and I probably just look like this impotent, powerless thing

43
0:02:46.435,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that couldn't get it to go away.

44
0:02:48.694,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So every day I'd come home

45
0:02:52.643,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and you guys, this feeling got so bad that -- I mean, I'm laughing at it now --

46
0:02:58.183,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but I would sit there in bed and cry every night.

47
0:03:02.86,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And the feeling on my chest got worse and worse.

48
0:03:08.183,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It was physically painful.

49
0:03:11.199,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I even went to a psychiatrist

50
0:03:14.645,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and tried to get her to prescribe me medicine,

51
0:03:18.097,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and she wouldn't just because I don't have schizophrenia, OK.

52
0:03:22.223,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:25.757,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So finally I got on the internet, and I Googled "hauntings."

54
0:03:32.581,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I came upon this forum of ghost hunters.

55
0:03:35.691,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But these were a special kind of ghost hunters --

56
0:03:38.047,000 --> 0:03:39,000
they were skeptics.

57
0:03:39.615,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They believed that every case of ghosts that they had investigated so far

58
0:03:45.209,000 --> 0:03:47,000
had been explained away by science.

59
0:03:47.408,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And I was like, "OK, smart guys, this is what's happening to me,

60
0:03:51.376,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and if you have an explanation for me, I would love to hear it."

61
0:03:55.475,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And one of them said, "OK.

62
0:03:58.709,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Um, have you heard of carbon monoxide poisoning?"

63
0:04:04.697,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I said, "Yeah.

64
0:04:09.183,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Like, gas poisoning?"

65
0:04:12.554,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Carbon monoxide poisoning is when you have a gas leak

66
0:04:15.557,000 --> 0:04:16,000
leaking into your home.

67
0:04:17.024,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I looked it up, and the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning

68
0:04:22.876,000 --> 0:04:25,000
include a pressure on your chest,

69
0:04:26.03,000 --> 0:04:3,000
auditory hallucinations -- whoosh --

70
0:04:30.452,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and an unexplained feeling of dread.

71
0:04:35.651,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So that night, I called the gas company.

72
0:04:38.077,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I said, "I have an emergency. I need you to come out.

73
0:04:41.906,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I don't want to get into the story now, but I need you to come out."

74
0:04:45.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:46.417,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They came out. I said, "I suspect a gas leak."

76
0:04:49.228,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They brought their carbon monoxide detector,

77
0:04:51.768,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and the man said,

78
0:04:53.834,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"It's a really good thing that you called us tonight,

79
0:04:57.321,000 --> 0:04:59,000
because you could have been dead very soon."

80
0:05:01.487,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Thirty-seven percent of Americans believe in haunted houses,

81
0:05:06.878,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and I wonder how many of them have been in one

82
0:05:11.492,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and how many of them have been in danger.

83
0:05:16.603,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So that haunting story has led me to my job.

84
0:05:21.36,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I'm an investigator, and I'm an investigator in two senses:

85
0:05:24.282,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I'm an investigative journalist,

86
0:05:25.874,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and I'm also an investigator of the claims of the paranormal

87
0:05:29.084,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and claims of the spiritual.

88
0:05:31.104,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And that means a few things.

89
0:05:32.636,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Sometimes that means that I'm pretending to need an exorcism

90
0:05:36.611,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so I can get -- yes, that's right! -- so I can go to an exorcist

91
0:05:41.2,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and see if he's using gimmicks or psychological tricks

92
0:05:44.83,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to try to convince someone that they're possessed.

93
0:05:47.742,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Sometimes that means I'm going undercover in a fringe group

94
0:05:51.088,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which I report on for a podcast that I co-host.

95
0:05:54.485,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And I've done over 70 investigations like this with my co-host, Ross.

96
0:05:59.543,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I would love to tell you that nine times out of 10, science wins,

97
0:06:04.563,000 --> 0:06:06,000
saves the day, it's all explained.

98
0:06:07.083,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That's not true.

99
0:06:08.276,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The truth is, 10 times out of 10, science wins, it saves the day.

100
0:06:14.516,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Applause)

101
0:06:26.847,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And that doesn't mean there's no such thing as a mystery.

102
0:06:29.552,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Of course there are mysteries, but a mystery is a mystery.

103
0:06:33.502,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It is not a ghost.

104
0:06:36.286,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now, I believe there are two kinds of truth,

105
0:06:39.931,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and it's taken me a while to get to this place, but I think this is right,

106
0:06:44.306,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so hear me out.

107
0:06:45.594,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I think there is outer truth and there's inner truth.

108
0:06:48.773,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So if you say to me,

109
0:06:52.012,000 --> 0:06:54,000
"There was a man named Jesus and he once existed,"

110
0:06:54.709,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that's outer truth, right?

111
0:06:56.43,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And we can go and look at the historical record.

112
0:06:58.804,000 --> 0:07:,000
We can determine whether that seems to be true.

113
0:07:01.239,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And I would argue, it does seem to be true.

114
0:07:03.802,000 --> 0:07:08,000
If you say, "Jesus rose from the dead," -- ooh, trickier.

115
0:07:09.497,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

116
0:07:12.261,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I would say that's an outer-truth claim,

117
0:07:19.224,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because he physically rose or he didn't.

118
0:07:21.286,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I'm not going to get into whether he rose or he didn't,

119
0:07:24.036,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but I would say that's an outer-truth claim.

120
0:07:26.138,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It happened or it didn't happen.

121
0:07:27.856,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But if you say, "I don't care whether he rose from the dead.

122
0:07:31.582,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It's symbolically important to me,

123
0:07:33.95,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and that metaphor is so meaningful, so purposeful to me,

124
0:07:37.468,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and I'm not going to try to persuade you of it,"

125
0:07:39.795,000 --> 0:07:41,000
now you've moved it from outer truth to inner truth,

126
0:07:42.374,000 --> 0:07:43,000
from science to art.

127
0:07:43.92,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And I think we have a tendency to not be clear about this,

128
0:07:47.108,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to try to move our inner truths to outer truths,

129
0:07:50.544,000 --> 0:07:52,000
or to not be fair about it to each other,

130
0:07:53.471,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and when people are telling us their inner truths,

131
0:07:55.859,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to try to make them defend them by outer-truth standards.

132
0:07:59.494,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So I'm talking here about outer truth, about objective things.

133
0:08:03.034,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And there was an objective reality in my haunted house, right?

134
0:08:08.744,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Now that I've told you about the gas leak,

135
0:08:10.817,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I doubt a single person here would be like,

136
0:08:12.861,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"I still think there was a ghost, too" --

137
0:08:14.859,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

138
0:08:15.923,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because as soon as we have these scientific explanations,

139
0:08:18.694,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we know to give up the ghost.

140
0:08:20.38,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We use these things as stopgaps for things that we can't explain.

141
0:08:24.414,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We don't believe them because of evidence;

142
0:08:26.439,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we believe them because of a lack of evidence.

143
0:08:30.202,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So there is a group in Los Angeles

144
0:08:32.59,000 --> 0:08:35,000
called the Independent Investigations Group, or the IIG,

145
0:08:36.322,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and they do great work.

146
0:08:38.326,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They'll give a $10,000 prize

147
0:08:41.053,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to anyone who can show, under scientific conditions,

148
0:08:45.604,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that they have a paranormal ability.

149
0:08:47.983,000 --> 0:08:48,000
No one's done it yet,

150
0:08:49.713,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but they've had a couple people who claim that they were clairaudients,

151
0:08:54.795,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which means that they can hear voices either from the great beyond

152
0:08:58.875,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or they can read minds.

153
0:09:00.797,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And they had one person who was very sincere,

154
0:09:03.581,000 --> 0:09:05,000
who believed that he could read minds.

155
0:09:06.565,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So they set up a test with him, and this is the way it always works.

156
0:09:12.576,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The group says, "OK, we have a protocol,

157
0:09:14.846,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we have a way to scientifically test this.

158
0:09:16.885,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Do you agree with it?"

159
0:09:18.062,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The person says yes. Then they test it.

160
0:09:19.982,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's very important that both sides agree.

161
0:09:22.011,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They did that, they tested him.

162
0:09:24.45,000 --> 0:09:26,000
They said, "OK, you know what?

163
0:09:27.028,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You weren't able to predict what Lisa was thinking.

164
0:09:30.894,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It matched up about the same as chance.

165
0:09:32.947,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Looks like you don't have the power."

166
0:09:34.813,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And that gave them the opportunity

167
0:09:36.687,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to compassionately sit down with him and have a very difficult discussion,

168
0:09:41.98,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which basically amounted to,

169
0:09:43.973,000 --> 0:09:47,000
"Hey, we know you're sincere, and what that means is,

170
0:09:48.56,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you do hear something in your head."

171
0:09:50.917,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And that guy got to make the very difficult decision,

172
0:09:55.583,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but really the life-changing decision about whether to go get help.

173
0:10:01.728,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We're actually helping people to make these connections

174
0:10:06.795,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that maybe before seemed like otherworldly explanations,

175
0:10:12.129,000 --> 0:10:17,000
help draw us into reality and maybe change our lives for the better.

176
0:10:18.293,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, on the other hand, maybe one time it'll turn out to be true.

177
0:10:24.708,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts,

178
0:10:26.755,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and holy shit, it will be the best thing!

179
0:10:28.952,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And every time I do one of these investigations,

180
0:10:31.7,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I still get so excited,

181
0:10:33.53,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and I'm like 75 into them,

182
0:10:35.617,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and still I swear on number 76, I'm going to be like, "This is the one!"

183
0:10:39.718,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

184
0:10:40.947,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic, but I hope I never lose this hope,

185
0:10:45.827,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and I invite you to take this same attitude

186
0:10:49.626,000 --> 0:10:51,000
when people share their outer beliefs with you.

187
0:10:52.093,000 --> 0:10:54,000
When talking about testable claims,

188
0:10:54.584,000 --> 0:10:57,000
respect them enough to ask these good questions.

189
0:10:58.287,000 --> 0:11:,000
Challenge and see how you can examine them together,

190
0:11:01.173,000 --> 0:11:05,000
because there's this idea that you can't respect a belief

191
0:11:05.366,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and still challenge it, but that's not true.

192
0:11:07.94,000 --> 0:11:09,000
When we jiggle the lock, when we test the claim,

193
0:11:10.711,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we're saying, OK, I respect you, I'm listening to what you're saying,

194
0:11:14.707,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I'm going to test it out with you.

195
0:11:16.723,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We've all had that experience where you're telling someone something,

196
0:11:20.102,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and they're like, "Oh, that's really interesting, yeah,"

197
0:11:22.857,000 --> 0:11:24,000
you know you're being had.

198
0:11:25.004,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But when someone says, "Really? Huh.

199
0:11:29.413,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Sounds a little sketchy to me, but I'm listening,"

200
0:11:31.827,000 --> 0:11:33,000
you at least know you're being engaged and respected.

201
0:11:34.508,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And that's the kind of attitude we should have with these claims.

202
0:11:37.648,000 --> 0:11:39,000
That's showing someone that you care what they're saying.

203
0:11:40.379,000 --> 0:11:42,000
That's respect.

204
0:11:46.03,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now, yes, most of these searches will come up empty,

205
0:11:50.753,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but that's how all of science works.

206
0:11:52.983,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Every cure for cancer so far has not panned out,

207
0:11:57.108,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but we don't stop looking,

208
0:11:59.464,000 --> 0:12:,000
for two reasons.

209
0:12:01.018,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Because number one, the answer matters.

210
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Whether it's looking at the afterlife or the paranormal or the cure for cancer,

211
0:12:07.566,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it all amounts to the same question:

212
0:12:09.923,000 --> 0:12:11,000
How long will we be here?

213
0:12:13.785,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And two, because looking for the truth,

214
0:12:17.593,000 --> 0:12:18,000
being open-minded,

215
0:12:18.926,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and being willing to be wrong and to change your whole worldview

216
0:12:23.319,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is awe-inspiring.

217
0:12:26.138,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I still get excited at ghost stories every single time.

218
0:12:29.975,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I still consider that every group I join might be right,

219
0:12:33.083,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and I hope I never lose that hope.

220
0:12:35.104,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Let's all never lose that hope,

221
0:12:36.932,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because searching for what's out there

222
0:12:39.811,000 --> 0:12:4,000
helps us understand what's in here.

223
0:12:42.457,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And also, please have a carbon monoxide detector in your home.

224
0:12:49.982,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Thank you.

225
0:12:51.285,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:14.24,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So this right here

2
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is the tiny village of Elle, close to Lista.

3
0:00:19.84,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's right at the southernmost tip of Norway.

4
0:00:23.32,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And on January 2 this year,

5
0:00:25.76,000 --> 0:00:27,000
an elderly guy who lives in the village,

6
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
he went out to see what was cast ashore

7
0:00:30.92,000 --> 0:00:31,000
during a recent storm.

8
0:00:34.08,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge,

9
0:00:37.32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
he found a wetsuit.

10
0:00:39.92,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It was grey and black, and he thought it looked cheap.

11
0:00:44.24,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Out of each leg of the wetsuit

12
0:00:46.32,000 --> 0:00:49,000
there were sticking two white bones.

13
0:00:50.12,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It was clearly the remains of a human being.

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And usually, in Norway, dead people are identified quickly.

15
0:00:57.32,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So the police started searching

16
0:00:58.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
through missing reports from the local area,

17
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:02,000
national missing reports,

18
0:01:02.24,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and looked for accidents with a possible connection.

19
0:01:04.72,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They found nothing.

20
0:01:06.92,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So they ran a DNA profile,

21
0:01:08.44,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and they started searching internationally through Interpol.

22
0:01:11.6,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Nothing.

23
0:01:14.24,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This was a person that nobody seemed to be missing.

24
0:01:18.52,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave.

25
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But then, after a month,

26
0:01:25.76,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands.

27
0:01:30.08,000 --> 0:01:32,000
A couple of months earlier, they had found a body,

28
0:01:32.72,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in an identical wetsuit, and they had no idea who this person was.

29
0:01:37.791,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit

30
0:01:40.72,000 --> 0:01:43,000
by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.

31
0:01:44.12,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So they were then able to tell

32
0:01:46.32,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time,

33
0:01:51.68,000 --> 0:01:53,000
October 7, 2014,

34
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in the French city of Calais by the English Channel.

35
0:01:57.76,000 --> 0:02:,000
But this was all they were able to figure out.

36
0:02:00.96,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The customer paid cash.

37
0:02:02.64,000 --> 0:02:04,000
There was no surveillance footage from the shop.

38
0:02:05.28,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So it became a cold case.

39
0:02:07.84,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We heard this story,

40
0:02:09.08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and it triggered me and my colleague, photographer Tomm Christiansen,

41
0:02:12.343,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and we of course had the obvious question: who were these people?

42
0:02:15.44,000 --> 0:02:17,000
At the time, I'd barely heard about Calais,

43
0:02:17.464,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but it took about two or three seconds to figure out

44
0:02:20.32,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Calais is basically known for two things.

45
0:02:23.28,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain,

46
0:02:26.12,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp

47
0:02:29.68,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and are trying desperately to cross over to Britain.

48
0:02:32.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people,

49
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and the police made this theory as well.

50
0:02:40.28,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe

51
0:02:43.495,000 --> 0:02:46,000
goes missing off the coast of France, people would just know.

52
0:02:46.72,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Your friends or family would report you missing,

53
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the police would come search for you, the media would know,

54
0:02:51.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and there would be pictures of you on lampposts.

55
0:02:54.08,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's difficult to disappear without a trace.

56
0:02:57.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But if you just fled the war in Syria,

57
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and your family, if you have any family left,

58
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
don't necessarily know where you are,

59
0:03:04.08,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and you're staying here illegally

60
0:03:06.12,000 --> 0:03:08,000
amongst thousands of others who come and go every day.

61
0:03:09.44,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Well, if you disappear one day, nobody will notice.

62
0:03:13.6,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone.

63
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf

64
0:03:20.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

65
0:03:24.768,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Me and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year,

66
0:03:27.84,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and after three months of investigation, we were able to tell the story

67
0:03:31.2,000 --> 0:03:33,000
about how these two young men fled the war in Syria,

68
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:35,000
ended up stuck in Calais,

69
0:03:35.76,000 --> 0:03:38,000
bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt

70
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to swim across the English Channel in order to reach England.

71
0:03:43.28,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It is a story about the fact that everybody has a name,

72
0:03:46.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
everybody has a story, everybody is someone.

73
0:03:49.48,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But it is also a story about what it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.

74
0:03:55.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So this is where we started our search.

75
0:03:57.08,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is in Calais.

76
0:03:58.6,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Right now, between 3,500 and 5,000 people are living here

77
0:04:01.72,000 --> 0:04:02,000
under horrible conditions.

78
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe.

79
0:04:06.32,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Limited access to food, limited access to water,

80
0:04:09.4,000 --> 0:04:1,000
limited access to health care.

81
0:04:10.92,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Disease and infections are widespread.

82
0:04:13.92,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England

83
0:04:17.12,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in order to claim asylum.

84
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry,

85
0:04:22.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
or the Eurotunnel,

86
0:04:24.44,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night

87
0:04:26.8,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to try to hide on the trains.

88
0:04:29.519,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Most want to go to Britain because they know the language,

89
0:04:32.48,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there.

90
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They want to work, they want to study,

91
0:04:37.84,000 --> 0:04:39,000
they want to be able to continue their lives.

92
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers.

93
0:04:42.96,000 --> 0:04:45,000
If you go to Calais and talk to refugees, you'll meet lawyers, politicians,

94
0:04:46.52,000 --> 0:04:48,000
engineers, graphic designers, farmers, soldiers.

95
0:04:49.2,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You've got the whole spectrum.

96
0:04:51.52,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But who all of these people are

97
0:04:53.92,000 --> 0:04:57,000
usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants,

98
0:04:58.4,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because we usually do that in statistics.

99
0:05:01.44,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So you have 60 million refugees globally.

100
0:05:03.64,000 --> 0:05:05,000
About half a million have made the crossing

101
0:05:05.68,000 --> 0:05:07,000
over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year,

102
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.

103
0:05:10.44,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But these are numbers,

104
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and the numbers don't say anything about who these people are,

105
0:05:15.8,000 --> 0:05:17,000
where they came from, or why they're here.

106
0:05:19.64,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And first, I want to tell you about one of them.

107
0:05:22.52,000 --> 0:05:25,000
This is 22-year-old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

108
0:05:26.12,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We first heard about him after being in Calais the first time

109
0:05:29.04,000 --> 0:05:31,000
looking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies.

110
0:05:31.84,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And after a while, we heard this story

111
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
about a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England,

112
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months.

113
0:05:41.12,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz

114
0:05:45.12,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was October 7, 2014.

115
0:05:47.8,000 --> 0:05:49,000
That was the same date the wetsuits were bought.

116
0:05:51.24,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So we flew over there and we met the uncle

117
0:05:53.4,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and we did DNA samples of him,

118
0:05:55.52,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz's closest relative

119
0:05:58.84,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who now lives in Jordan.

120
0:06:00.6,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The analysis concluded

121
0:06:02.72,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands

122
0:06:06.24,000 --> 0:06:07,000
was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.

123
0:06:09.72,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And while we were doing all this investigation,

124
0:06:12.24,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we got to know Mouaz's story.

125
0:06:15.32,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in 1991.

126
0:06:19.24,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He was raised in a middle class family,

127
0:06:21.122,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer

128
0:06:23.813,000 --> 0:06:27,000
who spent 11 years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria.

129
0:06:28.12,000 --> 0:06:29,000
While his father was in prison,

130
0:06:29.76,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Mouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters.

131
0:06:33.04,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They said he was that kind of guy.

132
0:06:35.04,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer

133
0:06:37.84,000 --> 0:06:39,000
at the University of Damascus.

134
0:06:40.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So a couple of years into the Syrian war,

135
0:06:42.44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country, Jordan.

136
0:06:46.6,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Their father had problems finding work in Jordan,

137
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and Mouaz could not continue his studies,

138
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
so he figured, "OK, the best thing I can do to help my family

139
0:06:54.48,000 --> 0:06:56,000
would be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies

140
0:06:57.24,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and find work."

141
0:06:58.8,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So he goes to Turkey.

142
0:07:00.24,000 --> 0:07:02,000
In Turkey, he's not accepted at a university,

143
0:07:03.44,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and once he had left Jordan as a refugee, he was not allowed to reenter.

144
0:07:08.24,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So then he decides to head for the UK,

145
0:07:10.88,000 --> 0:07:11,000
where his uncle lives.

146
0:07:12.44,000 --> 0:07:15,000
He makes it into Algeria, walks into Libya,

147
0:07:15.6,000 --> 0:07:18,000
pays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat,

148
0:07:19.44,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and from there on he heads to Dunkirk,

149
0:07:21.36,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the city right next to Calais by the English Channel.

150
0:07:25.955,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We know he made at least 12 failed attempts to cross the English Channel

151
0:07:29.36,000 --> 0:07:3,000
by hiding in a truck.

152
0:07:31.52,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But at some point, he must have given up all hope.

153
0:07:35.36,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The last night we know he was alive,

154
0:07:37.44,000 --> 0:07:4,000
he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk.

155
0:07:41.52,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We found his name in the records, and he seems to have stayed there alone.

156
0:07:45.68,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The day after, he went into Calais, entered a sports shop

157
0:07:49.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a couple of minutes before 8 o'clock in the evening,

158
0:07:52.12,000 --> 0:07:53,000
along with Shadi Kataf.

159
0:07:53.68,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They both bought wetsuits,

160
0:07:55.72,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and the woman in the shop

161
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
was the last person we know of to have seen them alive.

162
0:08:01.76,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz,

163
0:08:05.08,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but we weren't able to do that.

164
0:08:07.52,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But they do have a similar story.

165
0:08:09.64,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his, living in Germany,

166
0:08:13.56,000 --> 0:08:17,000
had read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.

167
0:08:18.04,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So we got in touch with him.

168
0:08:20.92,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,

169
0:08:23.48,000 --> 0:08:25,000
was also raised in Damascus.

170
0:08:25.88,000 --> 0:08:26,000
He was a working kind of guy.

171
0:08:27.44,000 --> 0:08:3,000
He ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company.

172
0:08:30.88,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He lived with his extended family,

173
0:08:32.8,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but their house got bombed early in the war.

174
0:08:35.76,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.

175
0:08:43.04,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live

176
0:08:46.96,000 --> 0:08:47,000
on planet Earth.

177
0:08:49.24,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They've been bombed by the military, they've been besieged,

178
0:08:52.039,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they've been stormed by ISIS

179
0:08:53.445,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and they've been cut off from supplies for years.

180
0:08:56.32,000 --> 0:08:58,000
There was a UN official who visited last year,

181
0:08:58.487,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and he said, "They ate all the grass so there was no grass left."

182
0:09:05.44,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Out of a population of 150,000,

183
0:09:07.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
only 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk.

184
0:09:11.96,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Shadi and his sisters got out.

185
0:09:14.04,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The parents are still stuck inside.

186
0:09:18.4,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So Shadi and one of his sisters, they fled to Libya.

187
0:09:21.96,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This was after the fall of Gaddafi,

188
0:09:23.651,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but before Libya turned into full-blown civil war.

189
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya,

190
0:09:31.48,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Shadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater.

191
0:09:37.8,000 --> 0:09:39,000
He fell completely in love with the ocean,

192
0:09:40.68,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya,

193
0:09:43.92,000 --> 0:09:45,000
late August 2014,

194
0:09:46.2,000 --> 0:09:48,000
he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy.

195
0:09:50.6,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Reality was not that easy.

196
0:09:53.52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We don't know much about his travels

197
0:09:55.36,000 --> 0:09:57,000
because he had a hard time communicating with his family,

198
0:09:58.08,000 --> 0:10:,000
but we do know that he struggled.

199
0:10:00.12,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And by the end of September,

200
0:10:01.52,000 --> 0:10:03,000
he was living on the streets somewhere in France.

201
0:10:04.84,000 --> 0:10:07,000
On October 7, he calls his cousin in Belgium,

202
0:10:07.88,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and explains his situation.

203
0:10:09.88,000 --> 0:10:14,000
He said, "I'm in Calais. I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop.

204
0:10:15.08,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I can't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain,

205
0:10:19.04,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim."

206
0:10:22.56,000 --> 0:10:24,000
His cousin, of course, tried to warn him not to,

207
0:10:25.04,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but Shadi's battery on the phone went flat,

208
0:10:27.2,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and his phone was never switched on again.

209
0:10:31.52,000 --> 0:10:35,000
What was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later,

210
0:10:35.6,000 --> 0:10:36,000
800 kilometers away

211
0:10:37.56,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.

212
0:10:40.56,000 --> 0:10:42,000
He's still waiting for his funeral in Norway,

213
0:10:42.72,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and none of his family will be able to attend.

214
0:10:47.08,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz

215
0:10:49.64,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is a story about death,

216
0:10:52.8,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but I don't agree.

217
0:10:54.04,000 --> 0:10:59,000
To me, this is a story about two questions that I think we all share:

218
0:10:59.52,000 --> 0:11:,000
what is a better life,

219
0:11:01.32,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and what am I willing to do to achieve it?

220
0:11:04.76,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And to me, and probably a lot of you,

221
0:11:06.56,000 --> 0:11:07,000
a better life would mean

222
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful,

223
0:11:11.08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
whether that be spending more time with your family and friends,

224
0:11:14.104,000 --> 0:11:15,000
travel to an exotic place,

225
0:11:15.64,000 --> 0:11:17,000
or just getting money to buy that cool new device

226
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:19,000
or a pair of new sneakers.

227
0:11:19.72,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And this is all within our reach pretty easily.

228
0:11:23.84,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But if you are fleeing a war zone,

229
0:11:25.8,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the answers to those two questions are dramatically different.

230
0:11:29.8,000 --> 0:11:31,000
A better life is a life in safety.

231
0:11:32.08,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's a life in dignity.

232
0:11:34.44,000 --> 0:11:36,000
A better life means not having your house bombed,

233
0:11:37.12,000 --> 0:11:38,000
not fearing being kidnapped.

234
0:11:38.68,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It means being able to send your children to school,

235
0:11:41.133,000 --> 0:11:42,000
go to university,

236
0:11:42.32,000 --> 0:11:46,000
or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love.

237
0:11:46.76,000 --> 0:11:49,000
A better life would be a future of some possibilities

238
0:11:50.4,000 --> 0:11:52,000
compared to nearly none,

239
0:11:52.72,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and that's a strong motivation.

240
0:11:55.48,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And I have no trouble imagining

241
0:11:57.6,000 --> 0:12:,000
that after spending weeks or even months

242
0:12:01.12,000 --> 0:12:02,000
as a second-grade citizen,

243
0:12:03.04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp

244
0:12:07.2,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with a stupid, racist name like "The Jungle,"

245
0:12:10.68,000 --> 0:12:13,000
most of us would be willing to do just about anything.

246
0:12:15.2,000 --> 0:12:17,000
If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz

247
0:12:17.48,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel,

248
0:12:21.56,000 --> 0:12:23,000
they would probably say, "This is worth the risk,"

249
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
because they could no longer see any other option.

250
0:12:29.4,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And that's desperation,

251
0:12:31.68,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but that's the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.

252
0:12:37.76,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Thank you.

253
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Applause)

254
0:12:49.91,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.

255
0:12:51.58,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This is Tomm Christiansen,

256
0:12:52.84,000 --> 0:12:55,000
who took most of the pictures you have seen and they've done reporting together.

257
0:12:57.68,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Tomm, you two have been back to Calais recently.

258
0:13:00.08,000 --> 0:13:01,000
This was the third trip.

259
0:13:01.72,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It was after the publication of the article.

260
0:13:03.8,000 --> 0:13:05,000
What has changed? What have you seen there?

261
0:13:05.96,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Tomm Christiansen: The first time we were in Calais,

262
0:13:08.413,000 --> 0:13:09,000
it was about 1,500 refugees there.

263
0:13:10.08,000 --> 0:13:13,000
They had a difficult time, but they were positive, they had hope.

264
0:13:13.76,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The last time, the camp has grown, maybe four or five thousand people.

265
0:13:18.8,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It seemed more permanent, NGOs have arrived,

266
0:13:21.4,000 --> 0:13:22,000
a small school has opened.

267
0:13:23.24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time,

268
0:13:26.64,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and the French government has managed to seal off the borders better,

269
0:13:31.56,000 --> 0:13:34,000
so now The Jungle is growing,

270
0:13:34.64,000 --> 0:13:38,000
along with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees.

271
0:13:38.88,000 --> 0:13:42,000
BG: Are you planning to go back? And continue the reporting?

272
0:13:43.6,000 --> 0:13:44,000
TC: Yes.

273
0:13:44.84,000 --> 0:13:46,000
BG: Anders, I'm a former journalist,

274
0:13:46.88,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and to me, it's amazing that in the current climate

275
0:13:49.32,000 --> 0:13:51,000
of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis,

276
0:13:51.88,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story,

277
0:13:55.8,000 --> 0:13:57,000
which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility,

278
0:13:58.682,000 --> 0:13:59,000
but how did you sell it to your editors?

279
0:14:02.36,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Anders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first,

280
0:14:04.4,000 --> 0:14:07,000
because we weren't able to know what we actually could figure out.

281
0:14:08.4,000 --> 0:14:09,000
As soon as it became clear

282
0:14:09.68,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was,

283
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted,

284
0:14:17.24,000 --> 0:14:2,000
just travel wherever you need to go, do whatever you need to do,

285
0:14:20.28,000 --> 0:14:23,000
just get this done.

286
0:14:23.72,000 --> 0:14:25,000
BG: That's an editor taking responsibility.

287
0:14:26.08,000 --> 0:14:28,000
The story, by the way, has been translated and published

288
0:14:28.724,000 --> 0:14:31,000
across several European countries, and certainly will continue to do.

289
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And we want to read the updates from you. Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm.

290
0:14:35.56,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Applause)

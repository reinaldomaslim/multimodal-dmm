1
0:00:12.74,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Most of you can probably relate to what I'm feeling right now.

2
0:00:16.992,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My heart is racing in my chest.

3
0:00:19.715,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My palms are a little bit clammy.

4
0:00:22.676,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm sweating.

5
0:00:24.643,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And my breath is a little bit shallow.

6
0:00:27.318,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now, these familiar sensations are obviously the result

7
0:00:30.202,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of standing up in front of a thousand of you

8
0:00:32.609,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and giving a talk that might be streamed online

9
0:00:34.894,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to perhaps a million more.

10
0:00:37.086,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But the physical sensations I'm experiencing right now

11
0:00:39.689,000 --> 0:00:43,000
are actually the result of a much more basic mind-body mechanism.

12
0:00:44.218,000 --> 0:00:47,000
My nervous system is sending a flood of hormones

13
0:00:47.545,000 --> 0:00:49,000
like cortisol and adrenaline into my bloodstream.

14
0:00:51.053,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's a very old and very necessary response that sends blood and oxygen

15
0:00:55.842,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to the organs and muscles that I might need

16
0:00:57.945,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to respond quickly to a potential threat.

17
0:01:01.026,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But there's a problem with this response,

18
0:01:03.08,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and that is, it can get over-activated.

19
0:01:06.234,000 --> 0:01:09,000
If I face these kinds of stressors on a daily basis,

20
0:01:09.268,000 --> 0:01:11,000
particularly over an extended period of time,

21
0:01:12.711,000 --> 0:01:14,000
my system can get overloaded.

22
0:01:15.415,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So basically, if this response happens infrequently: super-necessary

23
0:01:19.108,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for my well-being and survival.

24
0:01:21.384,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But if it happens too much,

25
0:01:22.945,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it can actually make me sick.

26
0:01:25.57,000 --> 0:01:27,000
There's a growing body of research examining the relationship

27
0:01:28.503,000 --> 0:01:3,000
between chronic stress and illness.

28
0:01:30.613,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Things like heart disease and even cancer

29
0:01:32.726,000 --> 0:01:34,000
are being shown to have a relationship to stress.

30
0:01:35.794,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And that's because, over time, too much activation from stress

31
0:01:39.834,000 --> 0:01:42,000
can interfere with my body's processes that keep me healthy.

32
0:01:44.793,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now, let's imagine for a moment that I was pregnant.

33
0:01:48.426,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What might this kind of stress,

34
0:01:50.397,000 --> 0:01:52,000
particularly over the length of my pregnancy,

35
0:01:52.69,000 --> 0:01:53,000
what kind of impact might that have

36
0:01:54.554,000 --> 0:01:56,000
on the health of my developing fetus?

37
0:01:58.176,000 --> 0:02:,000
You probably won't be surprised when I tell you

38
0:02:00.537,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that this kind of stress during pregnancy is not good.

39
0:02:03.935,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It can even cause the body to initiate labor too early,

40
0:02:07.59,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because in a basic sense, the stress communicates

41
0:02:10.28,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that the womb is no longer a safe place for the child.

42
0:02:14.171,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Stress during pregnancy is linked with things like high blood pressure

43
0:02:17.554,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and low infant birth weight,

44
0:02:19.237,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and it can begin a cascade of health challenges

45
0:02:21.453,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that make birth much more dangerous

46
0:02:23.64,000 --> 0:02:25,000
for both parent and child.

47
0:02:26.954,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now of course stress, particularly in our modern lifestyle,

48
0:02:30.03,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is a somewhat universal experience, right?

49
0:02:32.344,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Maybe you've never stood up to give a TED Talk,

50
0:02:34.708,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but you've faced a big presentation at work,

51
0:02:37.386,000 --> 0:02:38,000
a sudden job loss,

52
0:02:38.978,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a big test,

53
0:02:40.315,000 --> 0:02:42,000
a heated conflict with a family member or friend.

54
0:02:43.756,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But it turns out that the kind of stress we experience

55
0:02:46.916,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and whether we're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough

56
0:02:50.154,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to keep our bodies working properly

57
0:02:52.229,000 --> 0:02:54,000
depends a lot on who we are.

58
0:02:55.255,000 --> 0:02:56,000
There's also a growing body of research

59
0:02:57.14,000 --> 0:03:,000
showing that people who experience more discrimination

60
0:03:01.142,000 --> 0:03:02,000
are more likely to have poor health.

61
0:03:03.841,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Even the threat of discrimination,

62
0:03:06.155,000 --> 0:03:09,000
like worrying you might be stopped by police while driving your car,

63
0:03:09.621,000 --> 0:03:12,000
can have a negative impact on your health.

64
0:03:14.687,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams,

65
0:03:17.29,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the person who pioneered the tools that have proven these linkages,

66
0:03:20.781,000 --> 0:03:22,000
says that the more marginalized groups in our society

67
0:03:23.758,000 --> 0:03:26,000
experience more discrimination and more impacts on their health.

68
0:03:28.522,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I've been interested in these issues for over a decade.

69
0:03:31.658,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I became interested in maternal health

70
0:03:34.49,000 --> 0:03:37,000
when a failed premed trajectory instead sent me down a path

71
0:03:38.259,000 --> 0:03:4,000
looking for other ways to help pregnant people.

72
0:03:40.752,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I became a doula,

73
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a lay person trained to provide support

74
0:03:44.247,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to people during pregnancy and childbirth.

75
0:03:46.391,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And because I'm Latina and a Spanish speaker,

76
0:03:48.999,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in my first volunteer doula gig at a public hospital in North Carolina,

77
0:03:52.932,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I saw clearly how race and class impacted the experiences

78
0:03:56.279,000 --> 0:03:57,000
of the women that I supported.

79
0:03:58.669,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If we take a look at the statistics about the rates of illness

80
0:04:02.028,000 --> 0:04:03,000
during pregnancy and childbirth,

81
0:04:03.855,000 --> 0:04:06,000
we see clearly the pattern outlined by Dr. Williams.

82
0:04:07.533,000 --> 0:04:09,000
African-American women in particular

83
0:04:09.806,000 --> 0:04:11,000
have an entirely different experience than white women

84
0:04:12.739,000 --> 0:04:14,000
when it comes to whether their babies are born healthy.

85
0:04:16.308,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In certain parts of the country, particularly the Deep South,

86
0:04:19.416,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the rates of mother and infant death for black women

87
0:04:22.153,000 --> 0:04:25,000
actually approximate those rates in Sub-Saharan African.

88
0:04:26.64,000 --> 0:04:27,000
In those same communities,

89
0:04:28.285,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the rates for white women are near zero.

90
0:04:32.54,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Even nationally, black women are four times more likely

91
0:04:36.159,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to die during pregnancy and childbirth

92
0:04:38.475,000 --> 0:04:39,000
than white women.

93
0:04:40.072,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Four times more likely to die.

94
0:04:43.092,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They're also twice as likely for their infants to die

95
0:04:46.035,000 --> 0:04:47,000
before the first year of life

96
0:04:47.64,000 --> 0:04:48,000
than white infants,

97
0:04:49.195,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and two to three times more likely

98
0:04:51.136,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to give birth too early or too skinny --

99
0:04:54.076,000 --> 0:04:55,000
a sign of insufficient development.

100
0:04:56.737,000 --> 0:05:,000
Native women are also more likely to have higher rates of these problems

101
0:05:00.878,000 --> 0:05:01,000
than white women,

102
0:05:02.1,000 --> 0:05:04,000
as are some groups of Latinas.

103
0:05:05.145,000 --> 0:05:07,000
For the last decade as a doula turned journalist and blogger,

104
0:05:08.13,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I've been trying to raise the alarm

105
0:05:09.869,000 --> 0:05:11,000
about just how different the experiences of women of color,

106
0:05:12.864,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but particularly black women,

107
0:05:14.343,000 --> 0:05:16,000
are when it comes to pregnancy and birth in the US.

108
0:05:17.166,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But when I tell people about these appalling statistics,

109
0:05:20.086,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I'm usually met with an assumption that it's about either poverty

110
0:05:23.841,000 --> 0:05:24,000
or lack of access to care.

111
0:05:26.041,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But it turns out, neither of these things tell the whole story.

112
0:05:29.388,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Even middle-class black women still have much worse outcomes

113
0:05:33.924,000 --> 0:05:35,000
than their middle-class white counterparts.

114
0:05:36.882,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The gap actually widens among this group.

115
0:05:40.374,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And while access to care is definitely still a problem,

116
0:05:43.917,000 --> 0:05:46,000
even women of color who receive the recommended prenatal care

117
0:05:47.38,000 --> 0:05:48,000
still suffer from these high rates.

118
0:05:50.249,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And so we come back to the path

119
0:05:52.128,000 --> 0:05:56,000
from discrimination to stress to poor health,

120
0:05:56.303,000 --> 0:06:,000
and it begins to paint a picture that many people of color know to be true:

121
0:06:00.524,000 --> 0:06:02,000
racism is actually making us sick.

122
0:06:04.108,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Still sound like a stretch?

123
0:06:05.796,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Consider this: immigrants, particularly black and Latina immigrants,

124
0:06:10.104,000 --> 0:06:13,000
actually have better health when they first arrive in the United States.

125
0:06:13.667,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But the longer they stay in this country, the worse their health becomes.

126
0:06:18.256,000 --> 0:06:22,000
People like me, born in the United States to Cuban immigrant parents,

127
0:06:22.392,000 --> 0:06:25,000
are actually more likely to have worse health than my grandparents did.

128
0:06:26.549,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's what researchers call "the immigrant paradox,"

129
0:06:29.075,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it further illustrates

130
0:06:30.383,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that there's something in the US environment

131
0:06:32.61,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that is making us sick.

132
0:06:34.5,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But here's the thing:

133
0:06:35.689,000 --> 0:06:38,000
this problem, that racism is making people of color,

134
0:06:38.78,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but especially black women and babies, sick, is vast.

135
0:06:41.485,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I could spend all of my time with you talking about it,

136
0:06:44.279,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but I won't, because I want to make sure to tell you about one solution.

137
0:06:47.958,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And the good news is, it's a solution that isn't particularly expensive,

138
0:06:51.415,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and doesn't require any fancy drug treatments

139
0:06:53.905,000 --> 0:06:54,000
or new technologies.

140
0:06:55.115,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The solution is called, "The JJ Way."

141
0:06:59.309,000 --> 0:07:,000
Meet Jennie Joseph.

142
0:07:01.245,000 --> 0:07:03,000
She's a midwife in the Orlando, Florida area

143
0:07:03.816,000 --> 0:07:06,000
who has been serving pregnant women for over a decade.

144
0:07:07.072,000 --> 0:07:09,000
In what she calls her easy-access clinics,

145
0:07:09.513,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Jennie and her team provide prenatal care to over 600 women per year.

146
0:07:14.692,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Her clients, most of whom are black, Haitian and Latina,

147
0:07:19.443,000 --> 0:07:2,000
deliver at the local hospital.

148
0:07:21.441,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But by providing accessible and respectful prenatal care,

149
0:07:25.492,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Jennie has achieved something remarkable:

150
0:07:28.016,000 --> 0:07:32,000
almost all of her clients give birth to healthy, full-term babies.

151
0:07:33.285,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Her method is deceptively simple.

152
0:07:35.696,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Jennie says that all of her appointments start at the front desk.

153
0:07:38.896,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Every member of her team, and every moment a women is at her clinic,

154
0:07:42.66,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is as supportive as possible.

155
0:07:45.213,000 --> 0:07:47,000
No one is turned away due to lack of funds.

156
0:07:47.639,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The JJ Way is to make the finances work no matter what the hurdles.

157
0:07:51.8,000 --> 0:07:53,000
No one is chastised for showing up late to their appointments.

158
0:07:54.818,000 --> 0:07:56,000
No one is talked down to or belittled.

159
0:07:57.594,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Jennie's waiting room feels more like your aunt's living room than a clinic.

160
0:08:01.855,000 --> 0:08:03,000
She calls this space "a classroom in disguise."

161
0:08:05.512,000 --> 0:08:07,000
With the plush chairs arranged in a circle,

162
0:08:07.935,000 --> 0:08:09,000
women wait for their appointments in one-on-one chats

163
0:08:10.619,000 --> 0:08:11,000
with a staff educator,

164
0:08:11.876,000 --> 0:08:12,000
or in group prenatal classes.

165
0:08:14.569,000 --> 0:08:16,000
When you finally are called back to your appointment,

166
0:08:17.128,000 --> 0:08:18,000
you are greeted by Alexis or Trina,

167
0:08:18.999,000 --> 0:08:19,000
two of Jennie's medical assistants.

168
0:08:20.912,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Both are young, African-American and moms themselves.

169
0:08:24.455,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Their approach is casual and friendly.

170
0:08:27.125,000 --> 0:08:28,000
During one visit I observed,

171
0:08:28.924,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Trina chatted with a young soon-to-be mom

172
0:08:31.875,000 --> 0:08:32,000
while she took her blood pressure.

173
0:08:33.77,000 --> 0:08:36,000
This Latina mom was having trouble keeping food down due to nausea.

174
0:08:38.185,000 --> 0:08:4,000
As Trina deflated the blood pressure cuff,

175
0:08:40.257,000 --> 0:08:42,000
she said, "We'll see about changing your prescription, OK?

176
0:08:43.099,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We can't have you not eating."

177
0:08:45.531,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That "we" is actually a really crucial aspect of Jennie's model.

178
0:08:49.604,000 --> 0:08:53,000
She sees her staff as part of a team that, alongside the woman and her family,

179
0:08:54.387,000 --> 0:08:55,000
has one goal:

180
0:08:55.785,000 --> 0:08:57,000
get mom to term with a healthy baby.

181
0:08:59.089,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Jennie says that Trina and Alexis are actually the center of her care model,

182
0:09:02.802,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and that her role as a provider is just to support their work.

183
0:09:07.17,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Trina spends a lot of her day on her cell phone,

184
0:09:09.468,000 --> 0:09:11,000
texting with clients about all sorts of things.

185
0:09:11.904,000 --> 0:09:14,000
One woman texted to ask if a medication she was prescribed at the hospital

186
0:09:15.805,000 --> 0:09:16,000
was OK to take while pregnant.

187
0:09:17.767,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The answer was no.

188
0:09:19.468,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Another woman texted with pictures of an infant born under Jennie's care.

189
0:09:24.339,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Lastly, when you finally are called back to see the provider,

190
0:09:27.694,000 --> 0:09:29,000
you've already taken your own weight in the waiting room,

191
0:09:30.447,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and done your own pee test in the bathroom.

192
0:09:32.849,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This is a big departure from the traditional medical model,

193
0:09:35.712,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because it places responsibility and information

194
0:09:38.624,000 --> 0:09:39,000
back in the woman's hands.

195
0:09:40.959,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So rather than a medical setting where you might be chastised

196
0:09:43.92,000 --> 0:09:45,000
for not keeping up with provider recommendations --

197
0:09:46.396,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the kind of settings often available to low-income women --

198
0:09:49.466,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Jennie's model is to be as supportive as possible.

199
0:09:52.997,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And that support provides a crucial buffer

200
0:09:56.038,000 --> 0:10:,000
to the stress of racism and discrimination facing these women every day.

201
0:10:02.008,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But here's the best thing about Jennie's model:

202
0:10:05.219,000 --> 0:10:07,000
it's been incredibly successful.

203
0:10:08.195,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Remember those statistics I told you,

204
0:10:10.03,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that black women are more likely to give birth too early,

205
0:10:12.81,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to give birth to low birth weight babies,

206
0:10:14.986,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to even die due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth?

207
0:10:18.54,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Well, The JJ Way has almost entirely eliminated those problems,

208
0:10:22.429,000 --> 0:10:24,000
starting with what Jennie calls "skinny babies."

209
0:10:25.492,000 --> 0:10:27,000
She's been able to get almost all her clients to term

210
0:10:28.114,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with healthy, chunky babies like this one.

211
0:10:31.768,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Audience: Aw!

212
0:10:34.14,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Miriam Zoila Pérez: This is a baby girl

213
0:10:36.421,000 --> 0:10:38,000
born to a client of Jennie's this past June.

214
0:10:39.794,000 --> 0:10:41,000
A similar demographic of women in Jennie's area

215
0:10:42.412,000 --> 0:10:44,000
who gave birth at the same hospital her clients did

216
0:10:45.308,000 --> 0:10:47,000
were three times more likely to give birth

217
0:10:47.92,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to a baby below a healthy weight.

218
0:10:50.677,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Jennie is making headway into what has been seen for decades

219
0:10:53.759,000 --> 0:10:55,000
as an almost intractable problem.

220
0:10:56.928,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Some of you might be thinking,

221
0:10:58.618,000 --> 0:11:,000
all this one-on-one attention that The JJ Way requires

222
0:11:01.263,000 --> 0:11:03,000
must be too expensive to scale.

223
0:11:03.622,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Well, you'd be wrong.

224
0:11:05.102,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The visit with the provider is not the center of Jennie's model,

225
0:11:08.709,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and for good reason.

226
0:11:10.264,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Those visits are expensive, and in order to maintain her model,

227
0:11:13.389,000 --> 0:11:15,000
she's got to see a lot of clients to cover costs.

228
0:11:15.906,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But Jennie doesn't have to spend a ton of time with each woman,

229
0:11:19.023,000 --> 0:11:23,000
if all of the members of her team can provide the support, information

230
0:11:23.469,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and care that her clients need.

231
0:11:26.55,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The beauty of Jennie's model is that she actually believes

232
0:11:29.589,000 --> 0:11:32,000
it can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting.

233
0:11:32.828,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's a revolution in care just waiting to happen.

234
0:11:37.225,000 --> 0:11:39,000
These problems I've been sharing with you are big.

235
0:11:39.689,000 --> 0:11:42,000
They come from long histories of racism, classism,

236
0:11:43.125,000 --> 0:11:45,000
a society based on race and class stratification.

237
0:11:46.037,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They involve elaborate physiological mechanisms

238
0:11:48.457,000 --> 0:11:49,000
meant to protect us,

239
0:11:49.636,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that, when overstimulated, actually make us sick.

240
0:11:52.576,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But if there's one thing I've learned from my work as a doula,

241
0:11:55.562,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it's that a little bit of unconditional support can go a really long way.

242
0:11:59.428,000 --> 0:12:01,000
History has shown that people are incredibly resilient,

243
0:12:02.321,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and while we can't eradicate racism

244
0:12:04.228,000 --> 0:12:06,000
or the stress that results from it overnight,

245
0:12:06.514,000 --> 0:12:09,000
we might just be able to create environments that provide a buffer

246
0:12:09.738,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to what people of color experience on a daily basis.

247
0:12:12.624,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And during pregnancy, that buffer can be an incredible tool

248
0:12:15.878,000 --> 0:12:17,000
towards shifting the impact of racism

249
0:12:18.071,000 --> 0:12:19,000
for generations to come.

250
0:12:19.942,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you.

251
0:12:21.178,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

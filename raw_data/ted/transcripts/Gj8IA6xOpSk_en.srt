1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm delighted to be here.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
won't interest many other people.

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I would love to talk about my astronomy,

8
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in non-gray atmospheres

10
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere

11
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.

12
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So I'm not going to talk about that.

13
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It would be just as much fun

15
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,

16
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems

17
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.

18
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I caught the guys,

19
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,

20
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
and stealing information and selling it.

21
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I'd love to talk about that -- and it'd be fun --

22
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but, 20 years later ...

23
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.

24
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's tedious.

25
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'm --

26
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The first time you do something, it's science.

27
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The second time, it's engineering.

28
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
A third time, it's just being a technician.

29
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.

30
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So, I'm not going to talk about that.

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,

32
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,

33
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
nor am I going to talk about

34
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
why I believe computers don't belong in schools.

35
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around

36
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that we have to bring more computers into schools.

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
My idea is: no! No!

38
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.

39
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I'd love to talk about this,

40
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom

41
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that it doesn't need much talking about --

42
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but I guess I may be very wrong about that,

43
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and everything else that I've said.

44
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So don't go back and read my dissertation.

45
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It probably has lies in it as well.

46
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Having said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.

47
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And if you look at it over here,

49
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.

50
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?

51
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,

52
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because I've got gray hair,

53
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.

54
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,

55
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
if you really want to know about the future,

56
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.

57
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
No! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.

58
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
No, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years,

59
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
ask a kindergarten teacher.

60
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They know.

61
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,

62
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
ask an experienced one.

63
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.

64
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I don't. Nor, I suspect,

65
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.

66
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Certainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things

67
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that are going to be there.

68
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But to me, things aren't the future.

69
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
What I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,

70
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging

71
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and spend a huge amount of on-screen time,

72
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but have never gone bowling together?

73
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Change is happening, and the change that is happening

74
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is not one that is in software.

75
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
But that's not what I'm going to talk about.

76
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,

77
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?

78
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about

79
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is right over here. Right over here.

80
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.

81
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I would dearly love to talk about

82
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
things that have one side.

83
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,

84
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but I'm one of the very few people,

85
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
if not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.

86
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Right away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.

87
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is a Klein bottle.

88
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
For those of you in the audience who know,

89
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.

90
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.

91
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.

92
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It has wonderful properties.

93
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,

94
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
you get one of these, and I make them out of glass.

95
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I'd love to talk to you about this,

96
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because --

97
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.)

99
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
However, the "D" in TED of course stands for design.

100
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Just two weeks ago I made --

101
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.

102
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But what I've just made --

103
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.

104
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is a Klein bottle wine bottle,

105
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which, although in four dimensions

106
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,

107
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it's perfectly capable of doing so

108
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
because our universe has only three spatial dimensions.

109
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,

110
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
it can hold fluids.

111
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So it's highly -- that one's the cool one.

112
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That was a month of my life.

113
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.

114
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Instead, I'm going to mention my mom,

116
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
who passed away last summer.

117
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.

118
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Could somebody put this guy up?

119
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And I looked over her album

120
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and she had collected a picture of me, standing --

121
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
well, sitting -- in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.

122
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And I looked at it, and said, oh my god,

123
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!

124
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
As a technician, repairing and maintaining

125
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!

126
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!

127
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And it sent me back.

128
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Soon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.

129
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This guy over here of course is me.

130
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This man is Robert Moog,

131
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the inventor of the Moog synthesizer,

132
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
who passed away this past August.

133
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Robert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.

134
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
A musician who took time from his life to teach me,

135
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.

136
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me

137
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there --

138
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.

139
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We're studying physics, I'm studying physics,

140
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.

141
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics."

142
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Mentoring me. He'd come up and

143
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
spend hours and hours with me.

144
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.

145
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
In the background, my bicycle.

146
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.

147
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment

148
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to show Greg Flint and I things about this.

149
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms,

150
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Bessel functions, modulation transfer functions,

151
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
stuff like this.

152
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.

153
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.

154
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do --

156
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,

157
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.

158
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?

159
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay?

160
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.

161
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I've decided that, for me at least,

162
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I don't have a big enough head.

163
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So I think locally and I act locally.

164
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.

165
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.

166
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I was talking about this stuff to

167
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
some schoolteachers about a year ago.

168
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,

169
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
"Well, how come you ain't teaching?"

170
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate --

171
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."

172
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
No, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,

173
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
how come you ain't over here on the front lines?

174
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Put your money where you mouth is."

175
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Is true. Is true. I teach eighth-grade science four days a week.

176
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Not just showing up every now and then.

177
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.

178
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I take lunch hour. (Applause)

179
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps.

180
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.

181
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Not just show up to class every now and then.

182
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.

183
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
One of the things that I've done for my science students

184
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
is to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.

185
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
No calculus, I'll cut out that.

186
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You won't need to know trig.

187
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,

188
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and we're going to do serious experiments.

189
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.

190
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We're going to be doing genuine physics."

191
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.

192
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(High-pitched tone)

193
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Oh, before I even turn that on,

194
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class --

195
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for

196
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
was to measure the speed of light.

197
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
My students in El Cerrito -- with my help, of course,

198
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope --

199
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
measured the speed of light.

200
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of

201
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
who have measured the speed of light?

202
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.

203
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I'd love to measure the speed of light here.

204
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,"

205
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I was just going to impose upon the powers that be,

206
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and measure the speed of light.

207
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,

208
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!

209
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And there's no time to do it.

210
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!

211
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!

212
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound

213
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.

214
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But, probably -- one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,

215
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"

216
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And all of you know the wave equation is

217
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...

218
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is a constant. When the frequency goes up,

219
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,

220
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here --

221
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
over here, that's what's interesting --

222
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
as the pitch goes up, things get closer,

223
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
pitch goes down, things stretch out.

224
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Right? This is simple physics.

225
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?

226
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
What they didn't tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics --

227
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but they should have, and I wish they had,

228
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound

229
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
or light, you get a constant.

230
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And that constant is the speed of sound.

231
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So, in order to measure the speed of sound,

232
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.

233
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I've got a frequency counter right here.

234
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.

235
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Now, so I know the frequency.

236
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.

237
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
All I need now is to flip on another beam,

238
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and the bottom beam is me talking, right?

239
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.

240
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,

241
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
you'll notice the spiral.

242
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,

243
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
coming out this way.

244
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,

245
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but bear with me. (Laughter)

246
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
To measure the wavelength,

247
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
all I need to do is measure the distance from here --

248
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
one full wave -- over to here.

249
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.

250
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.

251
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.

252
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.

253
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.

254
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.

255
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The wavelength was 0.2 meters.

256
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Let's figure out what this is.

257
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

258
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.

259
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.

260
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink --

261
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
we've been able to measure the speed of sound to --

262
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
not bad. Pretty good.

263
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
All of which comes to what I wanted to say.

264
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago.

265
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,

266
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and I'm like, "Oh my God!"

267
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.

268
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.

269
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.

270
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
There's a riot going on on campus,

271
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and the police are chasing me, right?

272
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,

273
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
"You! You're a student."

274
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!

275
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!

276
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.

277
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
This cop comes after me with a rifle.

278
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
He wants to clunk me over the head!

279
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"

280
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.

281
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It's one of these bell-tower buildings.

282
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
The cop's chasing me.

283
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.

284
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Chases me into this room.

285
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
The entranceway to the bell tower.

286
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I slam the door behind me, climb up,

287
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.

288
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,

289
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
the square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter)

290
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I keep climbing up, go back.

291
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I go to a place where a dowel splits off.

292
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.

293
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.

294
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.

295
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,

296
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
that you climb up this wooden ladder.

297
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.

298
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
A dome, one of these ten-foot domes.

299
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,

300
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.

301
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?"

302
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.

303
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Namely, that when they cast bells,

304
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
they write inscriptions on them.

305
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.

306
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
I'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"

307
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed

308
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
upon the Hayes Hall tower bells:

309
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
"All truth is one.

310
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
In this light, may science and religion endeavor here

311
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,

312
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
from narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.

313
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
It is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn."

314
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Thank you very much.

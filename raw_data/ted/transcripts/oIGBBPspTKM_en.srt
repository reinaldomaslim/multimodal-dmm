1
0:00:12.794,000 --> 0:00:15,000
About 10 years ago, I went through a little bit of a hard time.

2
0:00:16.175,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I decided to go see a therapist.

3
0:00:18.473,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I had been seeing her for a few months, when she looked at me one day and said,

4
0:00:22.219,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Who actually raised you until you were three?"

5
0:00:26.202,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Seemed like a weird question. I said, "My parents."

6
0:00:29.89,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And she said, "I don't think that's actually the case;

7
0:00:33.172,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because if it were,

8
0:00:34.353,000 --> 0:00:37,000
we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this."

9
0:00:38.906,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It sounded like the setup to a joke, but I knew she was serious.

10
0:00:42.948,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Because when I first started seeing her,

11
0:00:45.224,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I was trying to be the funniest person in the room.

12
0:00:47.854,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And I would try and crack these jokes, but she caught on to me really quickly,

13
0:00:52.036,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and whenever I tried to make a joke, she would look at me and say,

14
0:00:55.837,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"That is actually really sad."

15
0:00:58.991,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:00.912,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's terrible.

17
0:01:02.557,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So I knew I had to be serious, and I asked my parents

18
0:01:06.068,000 --> 0:01:08,000
who had actually raised me until I was three?

19
0:01:08.666,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And to my surprise, they said

20
0:01:11.064,000 --> 0:01:14,000
my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family.

21
0:01:15.291,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I had called her my auntie.

22
0:01:18.502,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I remember my auntie so clearly,

23
0:01:20.611,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it felt like she had been part of my life when I was much older.

24
0:01:24.312,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I remember the thick, straight hair,

25
0:01:26.663,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and how it would come around me like a curtain

26
0:01:28.949,000 --> 0:01:29,000
when she bent to pick me up;

27
0:01:30.314,000 --> 0:01:32,000
her soft, southern Thai accent;

28
0:01:32.876,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the way I would cling to her,

29
0:01:34.73,000 --> 0:01:36,000
even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom

30
0:01:36.873,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or get something to eat.

31
0:01:38.922,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I loved her, but [with] the ferocity that a child has sometimes

32
0:01:42.552,000 --> 0:01:46,000
before she understands that love also requires letting go.

33
0:01:48.807,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie,

34
0:01:52.267,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is also one of my first memories of life at all.

35
0:01:56.345,000 --> 0:02:,000
I remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family.

36
0:02:01.686,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop,

37
0:02:04.607,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as I did every single time it happened,

38
0:02:07.405,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for things as minor as wanting to go out with her friends,

39
0:02:10.166,000 --> 0:02:11,000
or being a little late.

40
0:02:12.856,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I became so hysterical over her treatment,

41
0:02:15.292,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that eventually, she was just beaten behind closed doors.

42
0:02:21.634,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away.

43
0:02:25.424,000 --> 0:02:26,000
As an adult, I learned later

44
0:02:27.02,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that she had been just 19 when she was brought over from Thailand

45
0:02:31.271,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to the States to care for me, on a tourist visa.

46
0:02:35.674,000 --> 0:02:37,000
She wound up working in Illinois for a time,

47
0:02:37.755,000 --> 0:02:39,000
before eventually returning to Thailand,

48
0:02:40.209,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which is where I ran into her again, at a political rally in Bangkok.

49
0:02:45.159,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I clung to her again, as I had when I was a child,

50
0:02:48.616,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and I let go, and then I promised that I would call.

51
0:02:53.079,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I never did, though.

52
0:02:55.536,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Because I was afraid if I said everything that she meant to me --

53
0:03:00.327,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that I owed perhaps the best parts of who I became to her care,

54
0:03:05.101,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and that the words "I'm sorry" were like a thimble

55
0:03:08.213,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage I felt

56
0:03:12.662,000 --> 0:03:16,000
over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had --

57
0:03:18.41,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I thought if I said those words to her, I would never stop crying again.

58
0:03:24.304,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Because she had saved me.

59
0:03:26.87,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I had not saved her.

60
0:03:32.877,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I'm a journalist, and I've been writing and researching human trafficking

61
0:03:36.345,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for the past eight years or so,

62
0:03:38.47,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and even so, I never put together this personal story

63
0:03:42.445,000 --> 0:03:45,000
with my professional life until pretty recently.

64
0:03:46.234,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes

65
0:03:49.577,000 --> 0:03:51,000
most of our understanding about human trafficking.

66
0:03:52.977,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Because human trafficking is far more prevalent, complex and close to home

67
0:03:58.628,000 --> 0:03:59,000
than most of us realize.

68
0:04:01.377,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I spent time in jails and brothels,

69
0:04:03.393,000 --> 0:04:06,000
interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement, NGO workers.

70
0:04:07.578,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And when I think about what we've done about human trafficking,

71
0:04:10.579,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I am hugely disappointed.

72
0:04:13.284,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Partly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all.

73
0:04:18.185,000 --> 0:04:19,000
When I say "human trafficking,"

74
0:04:20.011,000 --> 0:04:23,000
most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie.

75
0:04:23.834,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You probably think about a young girl or woman,

76
0:04:26.575,000 --> 0:04:29,000
who's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp.

77
0:04:31.009,000 --> 0:04:34,000
That is real suffering, and that is a real story.

78
0:04:35.578,000 --> 0:04:36,000
That story makes me angry

79
0:04:36.885,000 --> 0:04:39,000
for far more than just the reality of that situation, though.

80
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:45,000
As a journalist, I really care about how we relate to each other through language,

81
0:04:46.396,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and the way we tell that story, with all the gory, violent detail,

82
0:04:50.111,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the salacious aspects -- I call that "look at her scars" journalism.

83
0:04:55.782,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We use that story to convince ourselves

84
0:04:58.064,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl.

85
0:05:03.328,000 --> 0:05:04,000
That story lets us off the hook.

86
0:05:05.248,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for,

87
0:05:09.01,000 --> 0:05:11,000
for the structural inequality, or the poverty,

88
0:05:11.193,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or the barriers to migration.

89
0:05:13.689,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We let ourselves think

90
0:05:14.864,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution,

91
0:05:18.464,000 --> 0:05:19,000
when in reality,

92
0:05:20.003,000 --> 0:05:23,000
human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives.

93
0:05:24.771,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Let me show you what I mean.

94
0:05:26.996,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Forced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking.

95
0:05:31.828,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Ten percent is in state- imposed forced labor.

96
0:05:35.823,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but a whopping 68 percent is for the purpose of creating the goods

97
0:05:40.01,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day,

98
0:05:44.664,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in sectors like agricultural work, domestic work and construction.

99
0:05:49.298,000 --> 0:05:52,000
That is food and care and shelter.

100
0:05:53.067,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And somehow, these most essential workers

101
0:05:55.453,000 --> 0:05:59,000
are also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today.

102
0:06:01.43,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Human trafficking is the use of force, fraud or coercion

103
0:06:05.917,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to compel another person's labor.

104
0:06:08.47,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And it's found in cotton fields, and coltan mines,

105
0:06:11.268,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and even car washes in Norway and England.

106
0:06:14.245,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.

107
0:06:18.171,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's found in Thailand's fishing industry.

108
0:06:20.726,000 --> 0:06:23,000
That country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world.

109
0:06:25.248,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But what are the circumstances

110
0:06:27.598,000 --> 0:06:3,000
behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp?

111
0:06:31.724,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Thai military were caught selling Burmese and Cambodian migrants

112
0:06:35.989,000 --> 0:06:36,000
onto fishing boats.

113
0:06:37.944,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Those fishing boats were taken out, the men put to work,

114
0:06:41.065,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick,

115
0:06:44.741,000 --> 0:06:45,000
or trying to resist their treatment.

116
0:06:47.368,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Those fish were then used to feed shrimp,

117
0:06:49.887,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers:

118
0:06:54.345,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Costco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour.

119
0:07:01.251,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that,

120
0:07:04.474,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and in places you would never even imagine.

121
0:07:07.016,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks,

122
0:07:10.025,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or to sing in touring boys' choirs.

123
0:07:12.953,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey.

124
0:07:16.942,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The scheme in that case was incredible.

125
0:07:19.522,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The traffickers found young families who were from Ghana and Togo,

126
0:07:25.647,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and they told these families that "your daughters are going to get

127
0:07:29.013,000 --> 0:07:31,000
a fine education in the United States."

128
0:07:31.718,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They then located winners of the green card lottery,

129
0:07:34.4,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and they told them, "We'll help you out.

130
0:07:37.285,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We'll get you a plane ticket. We'll pay your fees.

131
0:07:40.288,000 --> 0:07:42,000
All you have to do is take this young girl with you,

132
0:07:43.284,000 --> 0:07:45,000
say that she's your sister or your spouse.

133
0:07:46.998,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Once everyone arrived in New Jersey, the young girls were taken away,

134
0:07:50.285,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and put to work for 14-hour days,

135
0:07:52.868,000 --> 0:07:54,000
seven days a week, for five years.

136
0:07:56.154,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They made their traffickers nearly four million dollars.

137
0:08:02.345,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This is a huge problem.

138
0:08:04.491,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So what have we done about it?

139
0:08:07.049,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We've mostly turned to the criminal justice system.

140
0:08:10.386,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But keep in mind, most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized.

141
0:08:14.418,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They're migrants, people of color.

142
0:08:16.448,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Sometimes they're in the sex trade.

143
0:08:18.634,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And for populations like these,

144
0:08:20.824,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the criminal justice system is too often part of the problem,

145
0:08:23.886,000 --> 0:08:24,000
rather than the solution.

146
0:08:26.444,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In study after study, in countries ranging from Bangladesh to the United States,

147
0:08:31.113,000 --> 0:08:35,000
between 20 and 60 percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed

148
0:08:35.874,000 --> 0:08:39,000
said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone.

149
0:08:42.302,000 --> 0:08:45,000
People in prostitution, including people who have been trafficked into it,

150
0:08:45.993,000 --> 0:08:48,000
regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution.

151
0:08:49.809,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult

152
0:08:52.897,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to leave poverty, leave abuse, or leave prostitution,

153
0:08:56.818,000 --> 0:08:57,000
if that person so desires.

154
0:09:00.296,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Workers outside of the sex sector --

155
0:09:02.256,000 --> 0:09:06,000
if they try and resist their treatment, they risk deportation.

156
0:09:07.146,000 --> 0:09:1,000
In case after case I've studied, employers have no problem

157
0:09:10.352,000 --> 0:09:13,000
calling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport

158
0:09:13.819,000 --> 0:09:15,000
their striking trafficked workers.

159
0:09:16.718,000 --> 0:09:17,000
If those workers run away,

160
0:09:18.496,000 --> 0:09:22,000
they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers

161
0:09:23.232,000 --> 0:09:26,000
who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught.

162
0:09:29.67,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers.

163
0:09:36.033,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But out of an estimated 21 million victims of human trafficking in the world,

164
0:09:40.743,000 --> 0:09:44,000
they have helped and identified fewer than 50,000 people.

165
0:09:45.742,000 --> 0:09:46,000
That's like comparing

166
0:09:47.385,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the population of the world to the population of Los Angeles,

167
0:09:51.28,000 --> 0:09:52,000
proportionally speaking.

168
0:09:53.997,000 --> 0:09:59,000
As for convictions, out of an estimated 5,700 convictions in 2013,

169
0:10:00.443,000 --> 0:10:02,000
fewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.

170
0:10:03.976,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Keep in mind that labor trafficking

171
0:10:05.692,000 --> 0:10:08,000
accounts for 68 percent of all trafficking,

172
0:10:08.882,000 --> 0:10:11,000
but fewer than 10 percent of the convictions.

173
0:10:14.161,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed.

174
0:10:19.523,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I'd like to add one more element to that.

175
0:10:22.772,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections,

176
0:10:26.951,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and denied the right to organize.

177
0:10:29.874,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum.

178
0:10:32.538,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It happens in systematically degraded work environments.

179
0:10:37.249,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You might be thinking,

180
0:10:38.424,000 --> 0:10:41,000
oh, she's talking about failed states, or war-torn states, or --

181
0:10:41.549,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I'm actually talking about the United States.

182
0:10:44.27,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Let me tell you what that looks like.

183
0:10:47.342,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I spent many months researching a trafficking case called Global Horizons,

184
0:10:50.859,000 --> 0:10:52,000
involving hundreds of Thai farm workers.

185
0:10:53.209,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They were sent all over the States, to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations,

186
0:10:56.825,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and Washington apple orchards, and anywhere the work was needed.

187
0:11:00.555,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They were promised three years of solid agricultural work.

188
0:11:04.903,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So they made a calculated risk.

189
0:11:06.847,000 --> 0:11:09,000
They sold their land, they sold their wives' jewelry,

190
0:11:09.953,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company, Global Horizons.

191
0:11:14.776,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But once they were brought over,

192
0:11:16.628,000 --> 0:11:18,000
their passports were confiscated.

193
0:11:18.677,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint.

194
0:11:21.791,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They worked so hard they fainted in the fields.

195
0:11:26.138,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This case hit me so hard.

196
0:11:29.572,000 --> 0:11:31,000
After I came back home,

197
0:11:31.677,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I was wandering through the grocery store, and I froze in the produce department.

198
0:11:36.688,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I was remembering the over-the-top meals the Global Horizons survivors

199
0:11:40.108,000 --> 0:11:42,000
would make for me every time I showed up to interview them.

200
0:11:44.521,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They finished one meal with this plate of perfect, long-stemmed strawberries,

201
0:11:49.447,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and as they handed them to me, they said,

202
0:11:51.984,000 --> 0:11:54,000
"Aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special

203
0:11:55.24,000 --> 0:11:56,000
in the States?

204
0:11:57.091,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And don't they taste so much better

205
0:11:58.925,000 --> 0:12:01,000
when you know the people whose hands picked them for you?"

206
0:12:06.016,000 --> 0:12:1,000
As I stood in that grocery store weeks later, I realized I had no idea

207
0:12:10.271,000 --> 0:12:12,000
of who to thank for this plenty,

208
0:12:12.471,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and no idea of how they were being treated.

209
0:12:15.569,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So, like the journalist I am, I started digging into the agricultural sector.

210
0:12:20.423,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And I found there are too many fields, and too few labor inspectors.

211
0:12:25.119,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I found multiple layers of plausible deniability

212
0:12:27.993,000 --> 0:12:31,000
between grower and distributor and processor, and God knows who else.

213
0:12:32.988,000 --> 0:12:34,000
The Global Horizons survivors had been brought to the States

214
0:12:35.878,000 --> 0:12:37,000
on a temporary guest worker program.

215
0:12:38.979,000 --> 0:12:41,000
That guest worker program ties a person's legal status

216
0:12:42.636,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to his or her employer,

217
0:12:44.302,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and denies that worker the right to organize.

218
0:12:48.717,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Mind you, none of what I am describing about this agricultural sector

219
0:12:52.993,000 --> 0:12:55,000
or the guest worker program is actually human trafficking.

220
0:12:57.234,000 --> 0:13:,000
It is merely what we find legally tolerable.

221
0:13:02.305,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And I would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation.

222
0:13:06.187,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And all of this had been hidden to me, before I had tried to understand it.

223
0:13:11.741,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I wasn't the only person grappling with these issues.

224
0:13:15.045,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay,

225
0:13:17.233,000 --> 0:13:2,000
is one of the biggest anti-trafficking philanthropists in the world.

226
0:13:21.544,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And even he wound up accidentally investing nearly 10 million dollars

227
0:13:26.709,000 --> 0:13:29,000
in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions

228
0:13:30.393,000 --> 0:13:32,000
in that Global Horizons case.

229
0:13:34.464,000 --> 0:13:37,000
When he found out, he and his wife were shocked and horrified,

230
0:13:38.458,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and they wound up writing an op-ed for a newspaper,

231
0:13:41.075,000 --> 0:13:44,000
saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can

232
0:13:44.998,000 --> 0:13:47,000
about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support.

233
0:13:49.909,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I totally agree.

234
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
What would happen if each one of us decided

235
0:13:55.797,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that we are no longer going to support companies

236
0:13:58.378,000 --> 0:14:01,000
if they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains?

237
0:14:02.326,000 --> 0:14:04,000
If we demanded laws calling for the same?

238
0:14:05.729,000 --> 0:14:07,000
If all the CEOs out there decided

239
0:14:08.651,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that they were going to go through their businesses and say, "no more"?

240
0:14:13.046,000 --> 0:14:15,000
If we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers?

241
0:14:16.574,000 --> 0:14:19,000
If we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize

242
0:14:19.709,000 --> 0:14:2,000
without fear of retaliation?

243
0:14:21.968,000 --> 0:14:24,000
These would be decisions heard around the world.

244
0:14:26.729,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This isn't a matter of buying a fair-trade peach

245
0:14:29.007,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and calling it a day, buying a guilt-free zone with your money.

246
0:14:33.188,000 --> 0:14:34,000
That's not how it works.

247
0:14:35.402,000 --> 0:14:39,000
This is the decision to change a system that is broken,

248
0:14:39.452,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and that we have unwittingly but willingly

249
0:14:42.987,000 --> 0:14:46,000
allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long.

250
0:14:49.435,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization.

251
0:14:54.303,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But that is not my experience of them.

252
0:14:57.725,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Over all the years that I've been talking to them,

253
0:15:00.106,000 --> 0:15:03,000
they have taught me that we are more than our worst days.

254
0:15:03.941,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Each one of us is more than what we have lived through.

255
0:15:08.183,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Especially trafficking survivors.

256
0:15:10.746,000 --> 0:15:13,000
These people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible

257
0:15:14.393,000 --> 0:15:15,000
in their communities.

258
0:15:16.022,000 --> 0:15:18,000
They were the people that you would take a gamble on.

259
0:15:19.084,000 --> 0:15:22,000
You'd say, I'm gong to sell my rings, because I have the chance

260
0:15:22.29,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to send you off to a better future.

261
0:15:25.39,000 --> 0:15:27,000
They were the emissaries of hope.

262
0:15:29.371,000 --> 0:15:31,000
These survivors don't need saving.

263
0:15:32.731,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They need solidarity, because they're behind

264
0:15:35.799,000 --> 0:15:38,000
some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today.

265
0:15:40.766,000 --> 0:15:42,000
The nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families

266
0:15:43.727,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and their employers' families --

267
0:15:45.651,000 --> 0:15:47,000
their activism got us an international treaty

268
0:15:48.593,000 --> 0:15:49,000
on domestic workers' rights.

269
0:15:51.284,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The Nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade --

270
0:15:55.303,000 --> 0:15:56,000
they came together, and they decided

271
0:15:57.074,000 --> 0:16:,000
that they were going to make the world's first anti-trafficking organization

272
0:16:00.695,000 --> 0:16:03,000
actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves.

273
0:16:05.681,000 --> 0:16:07,000
These Indian shipyard workers were trafficked

274
0:16:08.483,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to do post-Hurricane Katrina reconstruction.

275
0:16:11.541,000 --> 0:16:14,000
They were threatened with deportation, but they broke out of their work compound

276
0:16:15.339,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and they marched from New Orleans to Washington, D.C.,

277
0:16:18.742,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to protest labor exploitation.

278
0:16:21.778,000 --> 0:16:24,000
They cofounded an organization called the National Guest Worker Alliance,

279
0:16:25.317,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and through this organization, they have wound up helping other workers

280
0:16:30.025,000 --> 0:16:34,000
bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains

281
0:16:34.447,000 --> 0:16:35,000
in Walmart and Hershey's factories.

282
0:16:36.139,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And although the Department of Justice declined to take their case,

283
0:16:40.344,000 --> 0:16:44,000
a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits

284
0:16:44.61,000 --> 0:16:47,000
this February, and got their clients 14 million dollars.

285
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
These survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet,

286
0:16:54.541,000 --> 0:16:58,000
other workers, and for the possibility of a just world for all of us.

287
0:16:59.626,000 --> 0:17:01,000
This is our chance to do the same.

288
0:17:02.716,000 --> 0:17:04,000
This is our chance to make the decision

289
0:17:04.923,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that tells us who we are, as a people and as a society;

290
0:17:08.778,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that our prosperity is no longer prosperity,

291
0:17:11.649,000 --> 0:17:14,000
as long as it is pinned to other people's pain;

292
0:17:15.561,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that our lives are inextricably woven together;

293
0:17:19.193,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and that we have the power to make a different choice.

294
0:17:26.217,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you.

295
0:17:31.976,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Before I started this TED process and climbed up on this stage,

296
0:17:34.977,000 --> 0:17:36,000
I had told literally a handful of people about it,

297
0:17:37.977,000 --> 0:17:38,000
because, like many a journalist,

298
0:17:39.953,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I am far more interested in learning about your stories

299
0:17:42.867,000 --> 0:17:45,000
than sharing much, if anything, about my own.

300
0:17:47.273,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this.

301
0:17:50.242,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I haven't issued my mountains of document requests,

302
0:17:52.67,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and interviewed everyone and their mother,

303
0:17:54.931,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and I haven't found my auntie yet.

304
0:17:57.241,000 --> 0:18:01,000
I don't know her story of what happened, and of her life now.

305
0:18:02.781,000 --> 0:18:05,000
The story as I've told it to you is messy and unfinished.

306
0:18:06.914,000 --> 0:18:1,000
But I think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in,

307
0:18:11.79,000 --> 0:18:13,000
when it comes to human trafficking.

308
0:18:14.523,000 --> 0:18:16,000
We are all implicated in this problem.

309
0:18:18.291,000 --> 0:18:22,000
But that means we are all also part of its solution.

310
0:18:24.241,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Figuring out how to build a more just world is our work to do,

311
0:18:28.379,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and our story to tell.

312
0:18:31.289,000 --> 0:18:33,000
So let us tell it the way we should have done,

313
0:18:33.701,000 --> 0:18:34,000
from the very beginning.

314
0:18:35.801,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Let us tell this story together.

315
0:18:39.518,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Thank you so much.

316
0:18:40.851,000 --> 0:18:46,000

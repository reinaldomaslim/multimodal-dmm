1
0:00:12.64,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm going to talk about how AI and mankind can coexist,

2
0:00:17.2,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but first, we have to rethink about our human values.

3
0:00:21.04,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So let me first make a confession about my errors in my values.

4
0:00:25.92,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It was 11 o'clock, December 16, 1991.

5
0:00:30.2,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I was about to become a father for the first time.

6
0:00:33.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
My wife, Shen-Ling, lay in the hospital bed

7
0:00:36.36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
going through a very difficult 12-hour labor.

8
0:00:40.28,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I sat by her bedside

9
0:00:42.6,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but looked anxiously at my watch,

10
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I knew something that she didn't.

11
0:00:47.44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I knew that if in one hour,

12
0:00:50.36,000 --> 0:00:51,000
our child didn't come,

13
0:00:52.32,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was going to leave her there

14
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and go back to work

15
0:00:55.96,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and make a presentation about AI

16
0:00:58.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
to my boss, Apple's CEO.

17
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Fortunately, my daughter was born at 11:30 --

18
0:01:07.08,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:09.04,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:15,000
sparing me from doing the unthinkable,

21
0:01:15.36,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and to this day, I am so sorry

22
0:01:17.88,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for letting my work ethic take precedence over love for my family.

23
0:01:22.56,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Applause)

24
0:01:28.32,000 --> 0:01:3,000
My AI talk, however, went off brilliantly.

25
0:01:30.96,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:33.72,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Apple loved my work and decided to announce it

27
0:01:36.88,000 --> 0:01:38,000
at TED1992,

28
0:01:39.6,000 --> 0:01:42,000
26 years ago on this very stage.

29
0:01:42.64,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I thought I had made one of the biggest, most important discoveries in AI,

30
0:01:47.72,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and so did the "Wall Street Journal" on the following day.

31
0:01:51.44,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But as far as discoveries went,

32
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it turned out,

33
0:01:55.36,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I didn't discover India, or America.

34
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Perhaps I discovered a little island off of Portugal.

35
0:02:02.72,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But the AI era of discovery continued,

36
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and more scientists poured their souls into it.

37
0:02:09.24,000 --> 0:02:11,000
About 10 years ago, the grand AI discovery

38
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:14,000
was made by three North American scientists,

39
0:02:15.08,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and it's known as deep learning.

40
0:02:17.4,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Deep learning is a technology that can take a huge amount of data

41
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:22,000
within one single domain

42
0:02:22.88,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and learn to predict or decide at superhuman accuracy.

43
0:02:27.84,000 --> 0:02:29,000
For example, if we show the deep learning network

44
0:02:30.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
a massive number of food photos,

45
0:02:33.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it can recognize food

46
0:02:35.08,000 --> 0:02:38,000
such as hot dog or no hot dog.

47
0:02:38.4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:41.56,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Or if we show it many pictures and videos and sensor data

49
0:02:46.6,000 --> 0:02:48,000
from driving on the highway,

50
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it can actually drive a car as well as a human being

51
0:02:53.36,000 --> 0:02:54,000
on the highway.

52
0:02:55.04,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And what if we showed this deep learning network

53
0:02:57.88,000 --> 0:02:59,000
all the speeches made by President Trump?

54
0:03:01.68,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Then this artificially intelligent President Trump,

55
0:03:05.6,000 --> 0:03:07,000
actually the network --

56
0:03:07.84,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:09.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
can --

58
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Applause)

59
0:03:14.84,000 --> 0:03:16,000
You like double oxymorons, huh?

60
0:03:17.2,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:21.08,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Applause)

62
0:03:27.2,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So this network, if given the request to make a speech about AI,

63
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
he, or it, might say --

64
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Recording) Donald Trump: It's a great thing

65
0:03:38.4,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to build a better world with artificial intelligence.

66
0:03:41.36,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Kai-Fu Lee: And maybe in another language?

67
0:03:43.4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
DT: (Speaking Chinese)

68
0:03:45.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:46.76,000 --> 0:03:48,000
KFL: You didn't know he knew Chinese, did you?

70
0:03:50.12,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So deep learning has become the core in the era of AI discovery,

71
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and that's led by the US.

72
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
But we're now in the era of implementation,

73
0:04:00.28,000 --> 0:04:05,000
where what really matters is execution, product quality, speed and data.

74
0:04:05.84,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And that's where China comes in.

75
0:04:07.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Chinese entrepreneurs,

76
0:04:09.56,000 --> 0:04:1,000
who I fund as a venture capitalist,

77
0:04:11.48,000 --> 0:04:12,000
are incredible workers,

78
0:04:13.24,000 --> 0:04:14,000
amazing work ethic.

79
0:04:15.2,000 --> 0:04:2,000
My example in the delivery room is nothing compared to how hard people work in China.

80
0:04:20.52,000 --> 0:04:23,000
As an example, one startup tried to claim work-life balance:

81
0:04:24.24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
"Come work for us because we are 996."

82
0:04:27.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And what does that mean?

83
0:04:29.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It means the work hours of 9am to 9pm, six days a week.

84
0:04:34.96,000 --> 0:04:37,000
That's contrasted with other startups that do 997.

85
0:04:39.32,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And the Chinese product quality has consistently gone up

86
0:04:42.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in the past decade,

87
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and that's because of a fiercely competitive environment.

88
0:04:48.76,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs compete in a very gentlemanly fashion,

89
0:04:54.68,000 --> 0:04:57,000
sort of like in old wars in which each side took turns

90
0:04:58.6,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to fire at each other.

91
0:04:59.88,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:00.96,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But in the Chinese environment,

93
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it's truly a gladiatorial fight to the death.

94
0:05:06.92,000 --> 0:05:12,000
In such a brutal environment, entrepreneurs learn to grow very rapidly,

95
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:16,000
they learn to make their products better at lightning speed,

96
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and they learn to hone their business models

97
0:05:19.36,000 --> 0:05:2,000
until they're impregnable.

98
0:05:21.4,000 --> 0:05:24,000
As a result, great Chinese products like WeChat and Weibo

99
0:05:25.28,000 --> 0:05:26,000
are arguably better

100
0:05:26.72,000 --> 0:05:29,000
than the equivalent American products from Facebook and Twitter.

101
0:05:31.92,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And the Chinese market embraces this change

102
0:05:35.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and accelerated change and paradigm shifts.

103
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:4,000
As an example, if any of you go to China,

104
0:05:40.2,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you will see it's almost cashless and credit card-less,

105
0:05:44.24,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because that thing that we all talk about, mobile payment,

106
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
has become the reality in China.

107
0:05:49.44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
In the last year,

108
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:55,000
18.8 trillion US dollars were transacted on mobile internet,

109
0:05:56.72,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and that's because of very robust technologies

110
0:05:59.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
built behind it.

111
0:06:00.96,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's even bigger than the China GDP.

112
0:06:04.12,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And this technology, you can say, how can it be bigger than the GDP?

113
0:06:07.76,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Because it includes all transactions:

114
0:06:09.76,000 --> 0:06:12,000
wholesale, channels, retail, online, offline,

115
0:06:13.56,000 --> 0:06:18,000
going into a shopping mall or going into a farmers market like this.

116
0:06:18.64,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The technology is used by 700 million people

117
0:06:22.04,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to pay each other, not just merchants,

118
0:06:24.12,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so it's peer to peer,

119
0:06:25.56,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and it's almost transaction-fee-free.

120
0:06:29.72,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it's instantaneous,

121
0:06:32.12,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and it's used everywhere.

122
0:06:34.32,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And finally, the China market is enormous.

123
0:06:37.72,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This market is large,

124
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:43,000
which helps give entrepreneurs more users, more revenue,

125
0:06:44.24,000 --> 0:06:46,000
more investment, but most importantly,

126
0:06:46.6,000 --> 0:06:5,000
it gives the entrepreneurs a chance to collect a huge amount of data

127
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which becomes rocket fuel for the AI engine.

128
0:06:54.96,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So as a result, the Chinese AI companies

129
0:06:57.92,000 --> 0:06:58,000
have leaped ahead

130
0:06:59.68,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so that today, the most valuable companies

131
0:07:02.8,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in computer vision, speech recognition,

132
0:07:05.44,000 --> 0:07:08,000
speech synthesis, machine translation and drones

133
0:07:08.88,000 --> 0:07:09,000
are all Chinese companies.

134
0:07:11.4,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So with the US leading the era of discovery

135
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and China leading the era of implementation,

136
0:07:17.8,000 --> 0:07:19,000
we are now in an amazing age

137
0:07:20.08,000 --> 0:07:23,000
where the dual engine of the two superpowers

138
0:07:23.36,000 --> 0:07:24,000
are working together

139
0:07:25.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to drive the fastest revolution in technology

140
0:07:29.64,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that we have ever seen as humans.

141
0:07:32.64,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And this will bring tremendous wealth,

142
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
unprecedented wealth:

143
0:07:36.96,000 --> 0:07:39,000
16 trillion dollars, according to PwC,

144
0:07:40.88,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in terms of added GDP to the worldwide GDP by 2030.

145
0:07:46.28,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It will also bring immense challenges

146
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in terms of potential job replacements.

147
0:07:52.52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Whereas in the Industrial Age

148
0:07:55.88,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it created more jobs

149
0:07:57.44,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because craftsman jobs were being decomposed into jobs in the assembly line,

150
0:08:03.24,000 --> 0:08:04,000
so more jobs were created.

151
0:08:05.24,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But AI completely replaces the individual jobs

152
0:08:10.2,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in the assembly line with robots.

153
0:08:12.48,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And it's not just in factories,

154
0:08:14.44,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but truckers, drivers

155
0:08:16.52,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and even jobs like telesales, customer service

156
0:08:20.64,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and hematologists as well as radiologists

157
0:08:23.64,000 --> 0:08:25,000
over the next 15 years

158
0:08:25.76,000 --> 0:08:27,000
are going to be gradually replaced

159
0:08:28.32,000 --> 0:08:29,000
by artificial intelligence.

160
0:08:30.36,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And only the creative jobs --

161
0:08:32.44,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:34.44,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I have to make myself safe, right?

163
0:08:38.96,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Really, the creative jobs are the ones that are protected,

164
0:08:41.96,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because AI can optimize but not create.

165
0:08:45.96,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But what's more serious than the loss of jobs

166
0:08:49.559,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is the loss of meaning,

167
0:08:51.36,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because the work ethic in the Industrial Age

168
0:08:54.52,000 --> 0:08:59,000
has brainwashed us into thinking that work is the reason we exist,

169
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that work defined the meaning of our lives.

170
0:09:03.12,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And I was a prime and willing victim to that type of workaholic thinking.

171
0:09:09.44,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I worked incredibly hard.

172
0:09:11.08,000 --> 0:09:14,000
That's why I almost left my wife in the delivery room,

173
0:09:14.68,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that's why I worked 996 alongside my entrepreneurs.

174
0:09:18.88,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And that obsession that I had with work

175
0:09:23.32,000 --> 0:09:26,000
ended abruptly a few years ago

176
0:09:26.4,000 --> 0:09:29,000
when I was diagnosed with fourth stage lymphoma.

177
0:09:31.48,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The PET scan here shows over 20 malignant tumors

178
0:09:35.64,000 --> 0:09:37,000
jumping out like fireballs,

179
0:09:37.84,000 --> 0:09:39,000
melting away my ambition.

180
0:09:40.44,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But more importantly,

181
0:09:41.92,000 --> 0:09:43,000
it helped me reexamine my life.

182
0:09:44.68,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Knowing that I may only have a few months to live

183
0:09:47.8,000 --> 0:09:49,000
caused me to see how foolish it was

184
0:09:50.76,000 --> 0:09:53,000
for me to base my entire self-worth

185
0:09:54.36,000 --> 0:09:58,000
on how hard I worked and the accomplishments from hard work.

186
0:09:59.32,000 --> 0:10:01,000
My priorities were completely out of order.

187
0:10:02.32,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I neglected my family.

188
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:06,000
My father had passed away,

189
0:10:06.44,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and I never had a chance to tell him I loved him.

190
0:10:10.12,000 --> 0:10:13,000
My mother had dementia and no longer recognized me,

191
0:10:13.88,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and my children had grown up.

192
0:10:16.4,000 --> 0:10:17,000
During my chemotherapy,

193
0:10:18.08,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I read a book by Bronnie Ware

194
0:10:20.56,000 --> 0:10:25,000
who talked about dying wishes and regrets of the people in the deathbed.

195
0:10:26.08,000 --> 0:10:28,000
She found that facing death,

196
0:10:28.36,000 --> 0:10:31,000
nobody regretted that they didn't work hard enough in this life.

197
0:10:32.88,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They only regretted that they didn't spend enough time with their loved ones

198
0:10:38.08,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and that they didn't spread their love.

199
0:10:42.4,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So I am fortunately today in remission.

200
0:10:46.96,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Applause)

201
0:10:53.84,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So I can be back at TED again

202
0:10:55.84,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to share with you that I have changed my ways.

203
0:10:59.24,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I now only work 965 --

204
0:11:03.2,000 --> 0:11:06,000
occasionally 996, but usually 965.

205
0:11:07.2,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I moved closer to my mother,

206
0:11:09.12,000 --> 0:11:11,000
my wife usually travels with me,

207
0:11:11.6,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and when my kids have vacation, if they don't come home, I go to them.

208
0:11:15.44,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So it's a new form of life

209
0:11:17.92,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that helped me recognize

210
0:11:19.76,000 --> 0:11:22,000
how important it is that love is for me,

211
0:11:22.96,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and facing death helped me change my life,

212
0:11:26.4,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but it also helped me see a new way

213
0:11:28.88,000 --> 0:11:31,000
of how AI should impact mankind

214
0:11:32.68,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and work and coexist with mankind,

215
0:11:36.68,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that really, AI is taking away a lot of routine jobs,

216
0:11:41.2,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but routine jobs are not what we're about.

217
0:11:44.88,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Why we exist is love.

218
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
When we hold our newborn baby,

219
0:11:49.28,000 --> 0:11:5,000
love at first sight,

220
0:11:50.8,000 --> 0:11:51,000
or when we help someone in need,

221
0:11:52.6,000 --> 0:11:56,000
humans are uniquely able to give and receive love,

222
0:11:56.88,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and that's what differentiates us from AI.

223
0:12:00.8,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Despite what science fiction may portray,

224
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I can responsibly tell you that AI has no love.

225
0:12:07.28,000 --> 0:12:1,000
When AlphaGo defeated the world champion Ke Jie,

226
0:12:10.84,000 --> 0:12:13,000
while Ke Jie was crying and loving the game of go,

227
0:12:13.96,000 --> 0:12:16,000
AlphaGo felt no happiness from winning

228
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and certainly no desire to hug a loved one.

229
0:12:23.6,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So how do we differentiate ourselves

230
0:12:26.28,000 --> 0:12:28,000
as humans in the age of AI?

231
0:12:28.84,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We talked about the axis of creativity,

232
0:12:31.96,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and certainly that is one possibility,

233
0:12:34.84,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and now we introduce a new axis

234
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that we can call compassion, love, or empathy.

235
0:12:40.8,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Those are things that AI cannot do.

236
0:12:43.4,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So as AI takes away the routine jobs,

237
0:12:46.24,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I like to think we can, we should and we must create jobs of compassion.

238
0:12:51.8,000 --> 0:12:53,000
You might ask how many of those there are,

239
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but I would ask you:

240
0:12:55.8,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Do you not think that we are going to need a lot of social workers

241
0:12:59.64,000 --> 0:13:,000
to help us make this transition?

242
0:13:01.96,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Do you not think we need a lot of compassionate caregivers

243
0:13:05.24,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to give more medical care to more people?

244
0:13:07.96,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Do you not think we're going to need 10 times more teachers

245
0:13:11.24,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to help our children find their way

246
0:13:14.04,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to survive and thrive in this brave new world?

247
0:13:17.32,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And with all the newfound wealth,

248
0:13:19.8,000 --> 0:13:23,000
should we not also make labors of love into careers

249
0:13:24.36,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and let elderly accompaniment

250
0:13:27.08,000 --> 0:13:3,000
or homeschooling become careers also?

251
0:13:30.6,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

252
0:13:36.8,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This graph is surely not perfect,

253
0:13:39.08,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but it points at four ways that we can work with AI.

254
0:13:42.64,000 --> 0:13:45,000
AI will come and take away the routine jobs

255
0:13:46.24,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and in due time, we will be thankful.

256
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
AI will become great tools for the creatives

257
0:13:52.12,000 --> 0:13:55,000
so that scientists, artists, musicians and writers

258
0:13:55.8,000 --> 0:13:56,000
can be even more creative.

259
0:13:58.12,000 --> 0:14:03,000
AI will work with humans as analytical tools

260
0:14:03.52,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that humans can wrap their warmth around

261
0:14:06.24,000 --> 0:14:07,000
for the high-compassion jobs.

262
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And we can always differentiate ourselves

263
0:14:10.84,000 --> 0:14:11,000
with the uniquely capable jobs

264
0:14:12.68,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that are both compassionate and creative,

265
0:14:16.32,000 --> 0:14:21,000
using and leveraging our irreplaceable brains and hearts.

266
0:14:21.52,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So there you have it:

267
0:14:22.84,000 --> 0:14:25,000
a blueprint of coexistence for humans and AI.

268
0:14:27.4,000 --> 0:14:28,000
AI is serendipity.

269
0:14:29.24,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It is here to liberate us from routine jobs,

270
0:14:32.24,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and it is here to remind us what it is that makes us human.

271
0:14:36.44,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So let us choose to embrace AI and to love one another.

272
0:14:40.44,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Thank you.

273
0:14:41.68,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Applause)

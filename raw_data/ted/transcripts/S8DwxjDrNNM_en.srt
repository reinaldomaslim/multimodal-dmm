1
0:00:12.854,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass-stained cathedral.

2
0:00:18.403,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet,

3
0:00:21.793,000 --> 0:00:22,000
dip both hands into holy water,

4
0:00:23.703,000 --> 0:00:24,000
trace the trinity across my chest,

5
0:00:25.553,000 --> 0:00:27,000
my tiny body drooping like a question mark

6
0:00:28.379,000 --> 0:00:3,000
all over the wooden pew.

7
0:00:30.669,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I asked Jesus to fix me,

8
0:00:33.339,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and when he did not answer

9
0:00:35.465,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn

10
0:00:38.141,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and salve my mouth

11
0:00:39.631,000 --> 0:00:4,000
would dissolve like sugar on tongue,

12
0:00:41.461,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but shame lingered as an aftertaste.

13
0:00:43.376,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity,

14
0:00:46.94,000 --> 0:00:48,000
my mother told me of the miracle I was,

15
0:00:49.86,000 --> 0:00:52,000
said I could grow up to be anything I want.

16
0:00:52.86,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I decided to

17
0:00:55.066,000 --> 0:00:56,000
be a boy.

18
0:00:56.227,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was cute.

19
0:00:57.217,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I had snapback, toothless grin,

20
0:00:59.007,000 --> 0:01:,000
used skinned knees as street cred,

21
0:01:00.847,000 --> 0:01:02,000
played hide and seek with what was left of my goal.

22
0:01:03.277,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I was it.

23
0:01:04.204,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The winner to a game the other kids couldn't play,

24
0:01:06.629,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I was the mystery of an anatomy,

25
0:01:08.809,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a question asked but not answered,

26
0:01:10.622,000 --> 0:01:14,000
tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl,

27
0:01:14.918,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and when I turned 12, the boy phase wasn't deemed cute anymore.

28
0:01:19.655,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts,

29
0:01:25.297,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home,

30
0:01:29.546,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that I exist for heterosexual marriage and child-bearing.

31
0:01:33.168,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I swallowed their insults along with their slurs.

32
0:01:36.999,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Naturally, I did not come out of the closet.

33
0:01:39.716,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The kids at my school opened it without my permission.

34
0:01:42.432,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Called me by a name I did not recognize,

35
0:01:44.894,000 --> 0:01:45,000
said "lesbian,"

36
0:01:46.124,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but I was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie.

37
0:01:48.7,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It had nothing to do with hating my body,

38
0:01:50.903,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I just love it enough to let it go,

39
0:01:53.023,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I treat it like a house,

40
0:01:54.409,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and when your house is falling apart,

41
0:01:56.239,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you do not evacuate,

42
0:01:57.223,000 --> 0:02:,000
you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides,

43
0:02:01.015,000 --> 0:02:03,000
you make it pretty enough to invite guests over,

44
0:02:03.376,000 --> 0:02:06,000
you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on.

45
0:02:07.904,000 --> 0:02:12,000
My mother fears I have named myself after fading things.

46
0:02:12.919,000 --> 0:02:15,000
As she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall,

47
0:02:15.939,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington.

48
0:02:18.489,000 --> 0:02:2,000
She fears that I'll die without a whisper,

49
0:02:20.7,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that I'll turn into "what a shame" conversations at the bus stop.

50
0:02:23.763,000 --> 0:02:25,000
She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum,

51
0:02:26.409,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that I am a walking casket,

52
0:02:28.035,000 --> 0:02:31,000
news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle,

53
0:02:31.239,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body

54
0:02:34.995,000 --> 0:02:37,000
becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages.

55
0:02:38.541,000 --> 0:02:41,000
No one ever thinks of us as human

56
0:02:41.637,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because we are more ghost than flesh,

57
0:02:43.795,000 --> 0:02:45,000
because people fear that my gender expression is a trick,

58
0:02:46.494,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that it exists to be perverse,

59
0:02:48.351,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that it ensnares them without their consent,

60
0:02:50.394,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands

61
0:02:53.088,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and once they have fed off my queer,

62
0:02:55.387,000 --> 0:02:58,000
they'll regurgitate all the parts they did not like.

63
0:02:58.387,000 --> 0:03:02,000
They'll put me back into the closet, hang me with all the other skeletons.

64
0:03:02.747,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I will be the best attraction.

65
0:03:05.162,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins,

66
0:03:08.241,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to misspell their names on gravestones.

67
0:03:10.811,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And people still wonder why there are boys rotting,

68
0:03:13.266,000 --> 0:03:15,000
they go away in high school hallways

69
0:03:15.657,000 --> 0:03:17,000
they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second

70
0:03:18.559,000 --> 0:03:21,000
afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day

71
0:03:22.437,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents.

72
0:03:29.062,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I wonder how long it will be

73
0:03:30.807,000 --> 0:03:33,000
before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant,

74
0:03:34.487,000 --> 0:03:37,000
before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin

75
0:03:38.11,000 --> 0:03:4,000
way before we learn how to love them.

76
0:03:40.153,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Like God didn't save all this breath and mercy,

77
0:03:44.077,000 --> 0:03:47,000
like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus' feet.

78
0:03:47.653,000 --> 0:03:5,000
My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat.

79
0:03:52.041,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Maybe I am finally fixed,

80
0:03:55.175,000 --> 0:03:57,000
maybe I just don't care,

81
0:03:57.428,000 --> 0:04:01,000
maybe God finally listened to my prayers.

82
0:04:02.139,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Thank you.

83
0:04:03.604,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Applause)

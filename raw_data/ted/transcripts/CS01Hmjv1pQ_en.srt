1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is actually quite simple.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We don't want Iran to get the bomb.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The gray boxes that you see,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
these are real-time control systems.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now if we manage to compromise these systems

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that control drive speeds and valves,

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we can actually cause a lot of problems

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
with the centrifuge.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The gray boxes don't run Windows software;

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
they are a completely different technology.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But if we manage

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to place a good Windows virus

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
on a notebook

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that is used by a maintenance engineer

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to configure this gray box,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
then we are in business.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So we start with a Windows dropper.

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The payload goes onto the gray box,

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
damages the centrifuge,

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
mission accomplished.

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That's easy, huh?

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I want to tell you how we found that out.

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The only thing that was known

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And it seemed to want to do something

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So that got our attention,

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and we started a lab project

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
where we infected our environment with Stuxnet

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and checked this thing out.

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And then some very funny things happened.

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat

41
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that didn't like our cheese --

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
sniffed, but didn't want to eat.

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Didn't make sense to me.

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I realized, well, this is a directed attack.

46
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It's completely directed.

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The dropper is prowling actively

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
on the gray box

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
if a specific configuration is found,

50
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is actually running on that target.

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.

53
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So that really got my attention,

54
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we started to work on this

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
nearly around the clock,

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It could be, let's say for example,

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a U.S. power plant,

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
or a chemical plant in Germany.

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So we better find out what the target is soon."

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So we extracted and decompiled

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the attack code,

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --

64
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a smaller one and a bigger one.

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered

66
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
by people who obviously had all insider information.

67
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They knew all the bits and bites

68
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that they had to attack.

69
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So they know everything.

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet

72
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is complex and high-tech,

73
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
let me tell you this:

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the payload is rocket science.

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's way above everything

76
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that we have ever seen before.

77
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We are talking about --

79
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
around about 15,000 lines of code.

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I want to tell you how we were able

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to make sense out of this code.

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because we know what they do.

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And then we were looking for timers and data structures

86
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and trying to relate them to the real world --

87
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to potential real world targets.

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So we do need target theories

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that we can prove or disprove.

90
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
In order to get target theories,

91
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we remember

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it must be a high-value target

94
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and it is most likely located in Iran,

95
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because that's where most of the infections had been reported.

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.

97
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It basically boils down

98
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to the Bushehr nuclear power plant

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So I told my assistant,

101
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base."

102
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I phoned them up and picked their brain

103
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in an effort to match their expertise

104
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with what we found in code and data.

105
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that worked pretty well.

106
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So we were able to associate

107
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the small digital warhead

108
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
with the rotor control.

109
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,

110
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that black object that you see.

111
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,

112
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
you are actually able to crack the rotor

113
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.

114
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What we also saw

115
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is that the goal of the attack

116
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
was really to do it slowly and creepy --

117
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
obviously in an effort

118
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to drive maintenance engineers crazy,

119
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.

120
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this

121
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
by looking very closely

122
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
at data and data structures.

123
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So for example, the number 164

124
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
really stands out in that code;

125
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
you can't overlook it.

126
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I started to research scientific literature

127
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
on how these centrifuges

128
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
are actually built in Natanz

129
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and found they are structured

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in what is called a cascade,

131
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.

132
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So that made sense, that was a match.

133
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And it even got better.

134
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
These centrifuges in Iran

135
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.

136
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And guess what we found in the attack code?

137
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
An almost identical structure.

138
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So again, that was a real good match.

139
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.

140
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.

141
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
These results have been obtained

142
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
over several weeks of really hard labor.

143
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And we often went into just a dead end

144
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and had to recover.

145
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Anyway, so we figured out

146
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that both digital warheads

147
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
were actually aiming at one and the same target,

148
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but from different angles.

149
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The small warhead is taking one cascade,

150
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,

151
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and the big warhead

152
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is talking to six cascades

153
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and manipulating valves.

154
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So in all, we are very confident

155
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that we have actually determined what the target is.

156
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.

157
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So we don't have to worry

158
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that other targets

159
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
might be hit by Stuxnet.

160
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --

161
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
really knocked my socks off.

162
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Down there is the gray box,

163
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and on the top you see the centrifuges.

164
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now what this thing does

165
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
is it intercepts the input values from sensors --

166
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
so for example, from pressure sensors

167
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and vibration sensors --

168
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and it provides legitimate program code,

169
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which is still running during the attack,

170
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
with fake input data.

171
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And as a matter of fact, this fake input data

172
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.

173
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies

174
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
where during the heist,

175
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.

176
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
That's cool, huh?

177
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The idea here is obviously

178
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
not only to fool the operators in the control room.

179
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.

180
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The idea

181
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is to circumvent a digital safety system.

182
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We need digital safety systems

183
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
where a human operator could not act quick enough.

184
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So for example, in a power plant,

185
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,

186
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
you must open relief valves within a millisecond.

187
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.

188
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So this is where we need digital safety systems.

189
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And when they are compromised,

190
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
then real bad things can happen.

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Your plant can blow up.

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.

193
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That's scary.

194
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But it gets worse.

195
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.

196
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Think about this:

197
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
this attack is generic.

198
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,

199
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
with centrifuges,

200
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with uranium enrichment.

201
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So it would work as well, for example,

202
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in a power plant

203
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
or in an automobile factory.

204
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It is generic.

205
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And you don't have -- as an attacker --

206
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you don't have to deliver this payload

207
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
by a USB stick,

208
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.

209
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.

210
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Just spread it as wide as possible.

211
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And if you do that,

212
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
what you end up with

213
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.

214
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
That's the consequence

215
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that we have to face.

216
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So unfortunately,

217
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the biggest number of targets for such attacks

218
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
are not in the Middle East.

219
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.

220
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So all of the green areas,

221
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
these are your target-rich environments.

222
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We have to face the consequences,

223
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and we better start to prepare right now.

224
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Thanks.

225
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Applause)

226
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.

227
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Ralph, it's been quite widely reported

228
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that people assume that Mossad

229
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is the main entity behind this.

230
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Is that your opinion?

231
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?

232
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Yeah. Okay.

233
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,

234
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but that the leading force is not Israel.

235
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So the leading force behind that

236
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is the cyber superpower.

237
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
There is only one,

238
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and that's the United States --

239
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
fortunately, fortunately.

240
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Because otherwise,

241
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
our problems would even be bigger.

242
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph.

243
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Applause)

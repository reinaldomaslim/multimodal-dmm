1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'll try to spin a story about energy,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and oil's a convenient starting place.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The talk will be broadly about energy,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but oil's a good place to start.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You take about eight or so carbon atoms,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
about 20 hydrogen atoms,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you put them together in exactly the right way

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and you get this marvelous liquid:

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
very energy-dense and very easy to refine

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
into a number of very useful products and fuels.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's great stuff.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now, as far as it goes,

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
there's a lot of oil out there in the world.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Here's my little pocket map

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of where it's all located.

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
A bigger one for you to look at.

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But this is it, this is the oil in the world.

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This is about 100 trillion gallons

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of crude oil

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
still to be developed and produced in the world today.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now, that's just one story about oil,

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and we could end it there and say,

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"Well, oil's going to last forever

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because, well, there's just a lot of it."

29
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But there's actually more to the story than that.

30
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil,

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
1000 meters below where you're all sitting

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Come talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil,

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and it's been a dominant part of our energy system

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for most of those 150 years.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about:

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
For the last 25 years,

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
oil has been playing less and less of a role

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in global energy systems.

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985,

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now, it's about 35 percent.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's been declining

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and I believe it will continue to decline.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and is declining.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So oil is playing a less significant role

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
every year.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And so, 25 years ago,

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
there was a peak oil;

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
just like, in the 1920s,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
there was a peak coal;

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and a hundred years before that,

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
there was a peak wood.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades?

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Well, a lot of natural gas

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and a little bit of nuclear, for starters.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And what goes on in the future?

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is peak gas,

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and beyond that,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
peak renewables.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
story about this picture.

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now, I'm not pretending that energy use in total

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
isn't increasing, it is --

71
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it,

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we'll fill in some of the details --

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but there's a very important message here:

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This is 200 years of history,

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
our energy system.

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Energy systems of the world

78
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
becoming progressively -- year on year,

79
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
decade on decade, century on century --

80
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
becoming less carbon intense.

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And that continues into the future

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
with the renewables that we're developing today,

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy

84
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
by mid century.

85
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now that might be the end of the story --

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Okay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables --

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but I think, actually, there's more to the story than that.

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And to tell the next part of the story --

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What is the future

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Well, we have to take a little excursion,

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and we'll start in central Texas.

94
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Here's a piece of limestone.

95
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.

96
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It's about 400 million years old.

97
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now, here's a piece of chalk.

99
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.

100
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And it's different than this limestone, you can see that.

101
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff,

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.

103
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Yeah, it's very different -- no, it's not different.

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's not different, it's the same stuff:

105
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.

106
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
What's different is how the molecules are put together.

107
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now, if you think that's kind of neat,

108
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the story gets really neat right now.

109
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Off the coast of California comes this:

110
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's an abalone shell.

111
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now, millions of abalone every year

112
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
make this shell.

113
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Oh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing,

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it's calcium carbonate.

115
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's the same stuff as this

116
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and the same stuff as this.

117
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But it's not the same stuff; it's different.

118
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's thousands of times,

119
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
maybe 3,000 times tougher than this.

120
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And why? Because the lowly abalone

121
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is able to lay down

122
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the calcium carbonate crystals in layers,

123
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
making this beautiful, iridescent

124
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
mother of pearl.

125
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Very specialized material

126
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that the abalone self-assembles,

127
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
millions of abalone,

128
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
all the time, every day, every year.

129
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is pretty incredible stuff.

130
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
All the same, what's different?

131
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
How the molecules are put together.

132
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, what does this have to do with energy?

133
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Here's a piece of coal.

134
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And I'll suggest that this coal

135
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is about as exciting

136
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
as this chalk.

137
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now, whether we're talking about fuels

138
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or energy carriers,

139
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
or perhaps novel materials for batteries

140
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or fuel cells,

141
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet

142
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because nature didn't need to.

143
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Nature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell,

144
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the survival of a species didn't depend

145
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
on building those materials,

146
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
until maybe now when it might just matter.

147
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So, when we think about the future of energy,

148
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
imagine

149
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
what would it be like

150
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
if instead of this,

151
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we could build the energy equivalent of this

152
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
just by rearranging the molecules differently.

153
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And so that is my story.

154
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The oil will never run out.

155
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It's not because we have a lot of it.

156
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills.

157
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's because, well,

158
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
thousands of years ago,

159
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
people invented ideas --

160
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they had ideas, innovations, technology --

161
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and the Stone Age ended,

162
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
not because we ran out of stones.

163
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

164
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology

165
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil.

166
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Thank you very much.

167
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Applause)

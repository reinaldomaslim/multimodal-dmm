1
0:00:12.806,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I would like to share with you today

2
0:00:14.306,000 --> 0:00:16,000
a project that has changed how I approach

3
0:00:16.46,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and practice architecture:

4
0:00:18.371,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the Fez River Rehabilitation Project.

5
0:00:21.299,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My hometown of Fez, Morocco,

6
0:00:23.64,000 --> 0:00:26,000
boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world,

7
0:00:27.307,000 --> 0:00:29,000
called the medina, nestled in a river valley.

8
0:00:30.046,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

9
0:00:33.634,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Since the 1950s, as the population of the medina grew,

10
0:00:37.61,000 --> 0:00:38,000
basic urban infrastructure

11
0:00:39.53,000 --> 0:00:41,000
such as green open spaces and sewage

12
0:00:42.46,000 --> 0:00:46,000
quickly changed and got highly stressed.

13
0:00:47.11,000 --> 0:00:49,000
One of the biggest casualties of the situation

14
0:00:50.065,000 --> 0:00:53,000
was the Fez River, which bisects the medina in its middle

15
0:00:54.028,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and has been considered for many centuries

16
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
as the city's very soul.

17
0:00:59.572,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In fact, one can witness the presence

18
0:01:01.99,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of the river's extensive water network

19
0:01:05.17,000 --> 0:01:06,000
all throughout the city,

20
0:01:06.451,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in places such as private and public fountains.

21
0:01:10.072,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Unfortunately, because of the pollution of the river,

22
0:01:13.921,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it has been covered little by little

23
0:01:16.357,000 --> 0:01:19,000
by concrete slabs since 1952.

24
0:01:19.431,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This process of erasure was coupled

25
0:01:22.859,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with the destruction of many houses

26
0:01:24.895,000 --> 0:01:25,000
along the river banks

27
0:01:26.387,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to be able to make machineries

28
0:01:28.376,000 --> 0:01:32,000
enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.

29
0:01:33.04,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking

30
0:01:36.335,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or trash yards.

31
0:01:38.291,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Actually, the state of the river

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
before entering the medina is pretty healthy.

33
0:01:43.535,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Then pollution takes its toll,

34
0:01:45.83,000 --> 0:01:47,000
mainly due to untreated sewage

35
0:01:48.249,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning.

36
0:01:51.9,000 --> 0:01:53,000
At some point, I couldn't bear

37
0:01:53.95,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the desecration of the river,

38
0:01:55.605,000 --> 0:01:57,000
such an important part of my city,

39
0:01:58.335,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I decided to take action,

40
0:01:59.986,000 --> 0:02:01,000
especially after I heard that the city

41
0:02:02.321,000 --> 0:02:05,000
received a grant to divert sewage water

42
0:02:05.415,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and to treat it.

43
0:02:07.035,000 --> 0:02:08,000
With clean water, suddenly

44
0:02:08.992,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the uncovering of the river became possible,

45
0:02:11.467,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and with luck and actually a lot of pushing,

46
0:02:14.347,000 --> 0:02:16,000
my partner Takako Tajima and I

47
0:02:16.563,000 --> 0:02:19,000
were commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers

48
0:02:20.194,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to uncover the river.

49
0:02:22.302,000 --> 0:02:23,000
However, we were sneaky,

50
0:02:24.257,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and we proposed more:

51
0:02:25.574,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways,

52
0:02:30.25,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and then to connect these pathways

53
0:02:32.21,000 --> 0:02:33,000
back to the city fabric,

54
0:02:33.853,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and finally to convert the urban voids

55
0:02:36.406,000 --> 0:02:39,000
along the riverbanks into public spaces

56
0:02:39.837,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that are lacking in the Medina of Fez.

57
0:02:42.187,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I will show you briefly now

58
0:02:43.954,000 --> 0:02:46,000
two of these public spaces.

59
0:02:46.991,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The first one is the Rcif Plaza,

60
0:02:49.771,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which sits actually right on top of the river,

61
0:02:52.853,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which you can see here in dotted lines.

62
0:02:55.89,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub

63
0:02:59.557,000 --> 0:03:,000
that actually compromised the urban integrity

64
0:03:01.481,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of the medina, that has the largest

65
0:03:03.849,000 --> 0:03:05,000
pedestrian network in the world.

66
0:03:06.448,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here,

67
0:03:09.553,000 --> 0:03:1,000
right next to the plaza,

68
0:03:11.364,000 --> 0:03:13,000
you can see that the river looked like

69
0:03:13.524,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a river of trash.

70
0:03:15.785,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Instead, what we proposed is to make

71
0:03:18.017,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the plaza entirely pedestrian,

72
0:03:20.375,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to cover it with recycled leather canopies,

73
0:03:23.278,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and to connect it to the banks of the river.

74
0:03:27.03,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The second site of intervention

75
0:03:28.914,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is also an urban void along the river banks,

76
0:03:31.92,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and it used to be an illegal parking,

77
0:03:34.267,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and we proposed to transform it

78
0:03:35.722,000 --> 0:03:38,000
into the first playground in the medina.

79
0:03:38.797,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The playground is constructed using recycled tires

80
0:03:42.525,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and also is coupled with a constructed wetland

81
0:03:45.36,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that not only cleans the water of the river

82
0:03:47.79,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but also retains it when floods occur.

83
0:03:51.381,000 --> 0:03:54,000
As the project progressed and received several design awards,

84
0:03:54.412,000 --> 0:03:56,000
new stakeholders intervened

85
0:03:56.68,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and changed the project goals and design.

86
0:04:00.458,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The only way for us to be able to bring

87
0:04:03.24,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the main goals of the project ahead

88
0:04:06.532,000 --> 0:04:08,000
was for us to do something very unusual

89
0:04:08.962,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that usually architects don't do.

90
0:04:10.874,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It was for us to take our design ego

91
0:04:14.126,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and our sense of authorship

92
0:04:15.602,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and put it in the backseat

93
0:04:17.736,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and to focus mainly on being activists

94
0:04:20.245,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and on trying to coalesce

95
0:04:22.15,000 --> 0:04:24,000
all of the agendas of stakeholders

96
0:04:24.441,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and focus on the main goals of the project:

97
0:04:27.264,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that is, to uncover the river, treat its water,

98
0:04:29.796,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and provide public spaces for all.

99
0:04:31.79,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We were actually very lucky,

100
0:04:33.282,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and many of those goals happened

101
0:04:35.825,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or are in the process of happening.

102
0:04:37.418,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Like, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza.

103
0:04:39.478,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is how it looked like about six years ago.

104
0:04:42.169,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This is how it looks like today.

105
0:04:44.251,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's still under construction,

106
0:04:45.983,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but actually it is heavily used

107
0:04:47.48,000 --> 0:04:48,000
by the local population.

108
0:04:49.123,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like

109
0:04:51.946,000 --> 0:04:52,000
when the project is completed.

110
0:04:53.831,000 --> 0:04:56,000
This is the river, covered, used as a trash yard.

111
0:04:57.829,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Then after many years of work,

112
0:04:59.651,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the river with clean water, uncovered.

113
0:05:02.385,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And finally, you can see here the river

114
0:05:04.41,000 --> 0:05:06,000
when the project will be completed.

115
0:05:06.851,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation

116
0:05:09.292,000 --> 0:05:11,000
will keep on changing and adapting

117
0:05:11.71,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to the sociopolitical landscape of the city,

118
0:05:13.938,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but we strongly believe that by reimagining

119
0:05:16.998,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the role and the agency of the architect,

120
0:05:19.439,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we have set up the core idea of the project into motion;

121
0:05:23.398,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that is, to transform the river from sewage

122
0:05:25.907,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to public space for all,

123
0:05:27.561,000 --> 0:05:3,000
thereby making sure that the city of Fez

124
0:05:30.733,000 --> 0:05:32,000
will remain a living city for its inhabitants

125
0:05:32.96,000 --> 0:05:34,000
rather than a mummified heritage.

126
0:05:35.12,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Thank you very much.

127
0:05:36.856,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Applause)

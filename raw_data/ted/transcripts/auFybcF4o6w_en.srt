1
0:00:12.48,000 --> 0:00:19,000
so when I do my job people hate me in

2
0:00:16.84,000 --> 0:00:21,000
fact the better I do my job the more

3
0:00:19.66,000 --> 0:00:22,000
people hate me and no I'm not a meter

4
0:00:22.39,000 --> 0:00:25,000
maid

5
0:00:22.9,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I'm not an undertaker I am a

6
0:00:25.75,000 --> 0:00:32,000
progressive lesbian talking head on Fox

7
0:00:28.509,000 --> 0:00:35,000
News so y'all heard that right just to

8
0:00:32.8,000 --> 0:00:37,000
make sure right I'm a gay talking head

9
0:00:35.65,000 --> 0:00:39,000
on Fox News I'm gonna tell you how I do

10
0:00:37.9,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it and the most important thing I've

11
0:00:39.85,000 --> 0:00:44,000
learned so I go on television I debate

12
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:46,000
people who literally want to obliterate

13
0:00:45.37,000 --> 0:00:49,000
everything I believe in in some cases

14
0:00:47.05,000 --> 0:00:51,000
who don't want me and people like me to

15
0:00:49.539,000 --> 0:00:52,000
even exist it's sort of like

16
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Thanksgiving with your conservative

17
0:00:52.84,000 --> 0:00:58,000
uncle on steroids with the live

18
0:00:56.98,000 --> 0:01:01,000
television audience of millions it's

19
0:00:59.23,000 --> 0:01:04,000
totally almost just like that and that's

20
0:01:02.41,000 --> 0:01:06,000
just on air the hate mail I get is

21
0:01:04.69,000 --> 0:01:09,000
unbelievable last week alone

22
0:01:06.73,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I got 230 eight pieces of nasty email

23
0:01:10.27,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and more hate tweets than I can even

24
0:01:12.729,000 --> 0:01:15,000
count

25
0:01:13.21,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I was called an idiot a traitor a

26
0:01:15.759,000 --> 0:01:24,000
scourge and an ugly man and that was

27
0:01:19.09,000 --> 0:01:27,000
just in one email so what have I

28
0:01:25.119,000 --> 0:01:28,000
realized being on the receiving end of

29
0:01:27.159,000 --> 0:01:31,000
all this ugliness well my biggest

30
0:01:29.049,000 --> 0:01:34,000
takeaway is that for decades we've been

31
0:01:31.6,000 --> 0:01:36,000
focused on political correctness but

32
0:01:34.689,000 --> 0:01:38,000
what matters more is emotional

33
0:01:37.27,000 --> 0:01:41,000
correctness let me give you a small

34
0:01:39.549,000 --> 0:01:43,000
example I don't care if you call me a

35
0:01:41.68,000 --> 0:01:46,000
dyke I really don't I care about two

36
0:01:44.2,000 --> 0:01:48,000
things one I care that you spell it

37
0:01:46.899,000 --> 0:01:48,000
right

38
0:01:51.78,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it's just quick refresher it's d-y Katie

39
0:01:55.659,000 --> 0:02:,000
you totally be a surprise and second I

40
0:01:59.77,000 --> 0:02:02,000
don't care about the word I care about

41
0:02:01.24,000 --> 0:02:04,000
how you use it are you being friendly

42
0:02:03.159,000 --> 0:02:08,000
are you just being naive or do you

43
0:02:05.17,000 --> 0:02:12,000
really want to hurt me personally it

44
0:02:08.89,000 --> 0:02:14,000
emotional correctness is the tone the

45
0:02:12.4,000 --> 0:02:16,000
feeling how we say what we say the

46
0:02:15.489,000 --> 0:02:19,000
respect and compassion we show one

47
0:02:17.38,000 --> 0:02:22,000
another and what I've realized is that

48
0:02:19.72,000 --> 0:02:25,000
political persuasion doesn't begin with

49
0:02:22.78,000 --> 0:02:27,000
ideas or facts or data political

50
0:02:25.75,000 --> 0:02:3,000
persuasion begins with being emotionally

51
0:02:27.82,000 --> 0:02:33,000
correct so when I first went to go work

52
0:02:31.42,000 --> 0:02:36,000
at Fox News true confession I expected

53
0:02:34.66,000 --> 0:02:38,000
there to be marks in the carpet from all

54
0:02:36.67,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the knuckle-dragging right that by the

55
0:02:39.25,000 --> 0:02:44,000
way in case you're paying attention is

56
0:02:40.48,000 --> 0:02:47,000
not emotionally correct but but liberals

57
0:02:44.29,000 --> 0:02:49,000
on my side we can be self-righteous we

58
0:02:48.19,000 --> 0:02:5,000
can be condescending we can be

59
0:02:49.81,000 --> 0:02:52,000
dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree

60
0:02:51.069,000 --> 0:02:56,000
with us in other words we can be

61
0:02:53.11,000 --> 0:03:,000
politically right but emotionally wrong

62
0:02:56.38,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and incidentally that means that people

63
0:03:00.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
don't like us right now here's the

64
0:03:04.48,000 --> 0:03:08,000
kicker

65
0:03:05.61,000 --> 0:03:1,000
conservatives are really nice I mean not

66
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
all of them and not the ones who send me

67
0:03:10.78,000 --> 0:03:14,000
hate mail but you would be surprised

68
0:03:12.82,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys

69
0:03:15.73,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I've ever met he spends his free time

70
0:03:18.97,000 --> 0:03:2,000
trying to fix up his staff on blind

71
0:03:20.98,000 --> 0:03:22,000
dates

72
0:03:21.459,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and I know that if I ever had a problem

73
0:03:23.59,000 --> 0:03:29,000
he would do anything he could to help

74
0:03:25.98,000 --> 0:03:31,000
now I think Sean Hannity is 99%

75
0:03:30.28,000 --> 0:03:35,000
politically wrong but his emotional

76
0:03:32.92,000 --> 0:03:36,000
correctness is strikingly impressive and

77
0:03:35.32,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that's why people listen to him because

78
0:03:37.6,000 --> 0:03:41,000
you can't get anyone to agree with you

79
0:03:39.22,000 --> 0:03:44,000
if they don't even listen to you first

80
0:03:41.79,000 --> 0:03:46,000
we spend so much time talking past each

81
0:03:44.98,000 --> 0:03:48,000
other and not enough time talking

82
0:03:46.9,000 --> 0:03:5,000
through our disagreements and if we can

83
0:03:49.87,000 --> 0:03:53,000
start to find compassion for one another

84
0:03:51.78,000 --> 0:03:57,000
then we have a shot at building common

85
0:03:54.85,000 --> 0:03:59,000
ground it actually sounds really hokey

86
0:03:57.85,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to sort of say it standing up here but

87
0:04:00.31,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when you try to put it in practice it's

88
0:04:02.53,000 --> 0:04:05,000
really powerful

89
0:04:04.27,000 --> 0:04:09,000
so someone who says they hate immigrants

90
0:04:06.4,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I try to imagine how scared they must be

91
0:04:09.31,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that their community is changing from

92
0:04:10.84,000 --> 0:04:14,000
what they've always known or someone who

93
0:04:13.63,000 --> 0:04:17,000
says they don't like teachers unions I

94
0:04:15.73,000 --> 0:04:18,000
bet they're really devastated to see

95
0:04:17.83,000 --> 0:04:19,000
their kids school going into the gutter

96
0:04:19.48,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they're just looking for someone to

97
0:04:20.59,000 --> 0:04:27,000
blame our challenge is to find the

98
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
compassion for others that we want them

99
0:04:27.67,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to have us that there's emotional

100
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:37,000
correctness I'm not saying it's easy an

101
0:04:34.66,000 --> 0:04:37,000
average of like five point six times per

102
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
day I have to stop myself from

103
0:04:38.41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
responding to all of my hate mail with a

104
0:04:40.21,000 --> 0:04:47,000
flurry of vile profanities this whole

105
0:04:44.56,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you know sort of finding a compassion

106
0:04:47.38,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and common ground with your enemies

107
0:04:48.73,000 --> 0:04:52,000
thing is kind of like a political

108
0:04:50.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
spiritual practice for me and I ain't

109
0:04:53.59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the Dalai Lama I'm not perfect but what

110
0:04:58.15,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I am is optimistic because I don't just

111
0:05:02.08,000 --> 0:05:06,000
get hate mail I get a lot of really nice

112
0:05:04.69,000 --> 0:05:08,000
letters lots of them

113
0:05:06.4,000 --> 0:05:11,000
one of my all-time favorites begins I'm

114
0:05:09.19,000 --> 0:05:18,000
not a big fan of your political leanings

115
0:05:11.53,000 --> 0:05:21,000
or your sometimes tortured logic but I'm

116
0:05:18.37,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a big fan of you as a person now this

117
0:05:21.85,000 --> 0:05:24,000
guy doesn't agree with me yet

118
0:05:27.54,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but he's listening not because of what I

119
0:05:31.36,000 --> 0:05:35,000
said but because of how I said it and

120
0:05:33.669,000 --> 0:05:36,000
somehow even though we've never met

121
0:05:35.38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
we've managed to form a connection

122
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that's emotional correctness and that's

123
0:05:40.51,000 --> 0:05:46,000
how we start the conversations that

124
0:05:42.79,000 --> 0:05:46,000
really lead to change thank you

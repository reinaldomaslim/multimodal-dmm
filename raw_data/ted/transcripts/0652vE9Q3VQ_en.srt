1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So what's image got do with it?

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a lot of subliminal messages,

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues

5
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that have come up.

6
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But I'm going to try and do something different,

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and try and put a face to a lot of the issues

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that we've been talking about.

10
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,

11
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
as you can see.

12
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We're not the only ones.

13
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And you know, it's amazing.

16
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I mean, we need a whole conference

17
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Just think about that, you know?

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And this is typically what we've been talking about,

20
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the role that the media plays in focusing

21
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
just on the negative stuff.

22
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, why is that a problem?

23
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
A typical disaster story:

24
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
disease, corruption, poverty.

25
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And some of you might be standing here thinking,

26
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated,

27
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and all you privileged people come here, saying,

28
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
'Forget the poor people.

29
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' "

30
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans

31
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
who really need help."

32
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?

33
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.

34
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We start with poverty.

35
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but I know what it is to grow up without having money,

37
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or being able to support family.

38
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.

39
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.

40
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.

41
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
When things were bad, we had porridge.

42
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And like many African families,

43
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
my parents could never save

44
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,

45
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and things were always dicey.

46
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,

47
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,

48
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which was free.

49
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And they adopted a very interesting

50
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
approach to education, which was

51
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.

52
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,

53
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.

54
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And what happened was,

55
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not,

56
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I got kicked out pretty much every term.

57
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You know, someone would come in with a list

58
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of the people who haven't paid school fees,

59
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and when they started getting pretty strict,

60
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.

61
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I remember thinking, I mean,

62
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?

63
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Because you know, as a kid

64
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you're embarrassed and

65
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you're sensitive, and everyone knows

66
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you guys don't have money.

67
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But they kept at it,

68
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and I now understand why they did what they did.

69
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They talk about corruption.

70
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.

71
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools,

72
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and provincial schools.

73
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School,

74
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a national school.

75
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I missed the cutoff by one point.

76
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I was so disappointed, and I was like,

77
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"

78
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And my father said, "OK, listen.

79
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.

80
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You know, it's just one point. I mean,

81
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."

82
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
So we went to the school,

83
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,

84
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and because my father didn't have the right last name,

85
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
he was treated like dirt.

86
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,

87
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
you know, who do you think you are?

88
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And, you know, you must be joking if you think

89
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you can get a slot.

90
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,

91
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and who had done much, much worse than I did,

92
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and they had slots there.

93
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent

94
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
being humiliated in front of you, you know?

95
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And we left, and I swore to myself,

96
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have

97
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to beg for anything in my life."

98
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They called me two weeks later, they're like,

99
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.

100
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

101
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.

102
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Disease.

103
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.

104
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
He never told anyone that he had AIDS,

105
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
his fear of the stigma was so strong.

106
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.

107
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And I was in the States at the time,

108
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.

109
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.

110
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.

111
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Because of doctor-patient privilege,

112
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they couldn't really tell us what was going on.

113
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.

114
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And when I went online and looked at the infectious --

115
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
read about the disease,

116
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I pretty much realized what was going on.

117
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The first time he got sick, he recovered.

118
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But what happened was that he had to be on medication

119
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States

120
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.

121
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.

122
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You know, so money ran out.

123
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
He got sick again.

124
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,

125
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and he used to import, bring him, could

126
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
get him a generic version of it.

127
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And that kept him going.

128
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But the money ran out.

129
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.

130
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,

131
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash

132
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for him to start the treatment until Monday.

133
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.

134
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And finally, we figured, well, OK,

135
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.

136
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
At least he'll get treated

137
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
while we try to figure out the money situation.

138
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And he died when the ambulance was coming

139
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to the hospital to take him.

140
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on --

141
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
imagine if this is all you know about me.

142
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
How would you look at me?

143
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
With pity, you know. Sadness.

144
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And this is how you look at Africa.

145
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is the damage it causes.

146
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You don't see the other side of me.

147
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You don't see the blogger,

148
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,

149
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the vibrant person, you know?

150
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And I just wanted to personalize that.

151
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Because we talk about it in big terms,

152
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and you wonder, you know, so what?

153
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But it's damaging.

154
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And I'm not unique, right?

155
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Imagine if all you knew about William

156
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.

157
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?

158
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And I was just moved.

159
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I was actually crying during his presentation.

160
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
He was like, I try and I make.

161
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"

162
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.

164
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
When you focus just on the disasters --

165
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

166
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
-- we're ignoring the potential.

167
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So, what is to be done?

168
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
First of all,

169
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.

170
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We heard about that yesterday.

171
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We had some of them this morning.

172
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And this is an example, you know,

173
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
blogging is one way of doing that.

174
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs

175
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that was developed in South Africa.

176
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So we need to start getting better.

177
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.

178
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And going back to the point I was trying to make,

179
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
this is the Swahili Wikipedia.

180
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.

181
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It only has five contributors.

182
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.

183
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --

184
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.

185
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
He's the only African who's contributing to this.

186
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
People, please. We can't whine and complain

187
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
the West is doing this.

188
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
What are we doing?

189
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?

190
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Why are we not generating our own content?

191
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.

192
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Reuters now integrates African blogs

193
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
into their coverage of Africa.

194
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So, that's a start,

195
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and we've heard of all their other initiatives.

196
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The cheetah generation.

197
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The aid approach, you know, is flawed.

198
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And after all the hoopla of Live 8,

199
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we're still not anywhere in the picture.

200
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
No, you're not.

201
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
(Laughter)

202
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But the point I'm trying to make, though,

203
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is that it's not enough for us to criticize.

204
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And for those of you in the diaspora

205
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
who are struggling with where should I be,

206
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
should I move back,

207
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
should I stay?

208
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
You know, just jump.

209
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The continent needs you.

210
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.

211
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,

212
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Covington and Burling, six figures.

213
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
With two paychecks, or three paychecks,

214
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I could solve a lot of my family's problems.

215
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here,

216
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.

217
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And because I'm needed here, you know?

218
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I probably can win a prize for the most ways

219
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to use a Harvard Law School degree

220
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because of all the things I'm doing.

221
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
One is because I'm pretty aggressive,

222
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and I try and find, you know, opportunities.

223
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But there is such a need, you know?

224
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time

225
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
for an organization called Enablis

226
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.

227
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We're now moving into East Africa.

228
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And we give them business development services,

229
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as well as financing loan and equity.

230
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I've also set up a project in Kenya,

231
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and what we do is we track the performance

232
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
of Kenyan MPs.

233
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.

234
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.

235
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Everything else on there is a labor of love.

236
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We've manually entered all the data there.

237
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And you can get profiles of each MP,

238
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
questions they've asked in parliament.

239
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We have a comment function,

240
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
where people can ask their MPs questions.

241
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
There are some MPs who participate,

242
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and come back and ask.

243
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And basically, we started this because we were tired

244
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
of complaining about our politicians.

245
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.

246
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
You're not just going to be accountable

247
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
out of the goodness of your heart.

248
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.

249
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
What are they doing?

250
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
You know, they're not going to change

251
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
just out of nowhere.

252
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So we need new policies, we need --

253
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
where's that coming from, you know?

254
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Another thing is that these leaders

255
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
are a reflection of our society.

256
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We talk about African governments

257
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?

258
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They come from us.

259
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?

260
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And how can we change that?

261
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start

262
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.

263
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Where do we go from here?

264
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I believe in the power of ideas.

265
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.

266
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,

267
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,

268
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
because it can make a difference.

269
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The other thing I want to urge you to do

270
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is take an interest in the individual.

271
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I've had lots of conversations about things I think

272
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
need to be happening in Africa.

273
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,

274
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"

275
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like,

276
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
"BBut it's not scalable, you know.

277
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
Give me something I can do with Paypal."

278
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's not that easy, you know?

279
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,

280
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,

281
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,

282
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
because usually the individual in Africa

283
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
carries a lot of people behind them.

284
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,

285
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.

286
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.

287
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I was helping her pay her tuition.

288
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.

289
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I was paying her school fees.

290
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,

291
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?

292
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You know, she's now my baby sister.

293
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,

294
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I am able to lift all those people.

295
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So, don't underestimate that.

296
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
An example. This man changed my life.

297
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.

298
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.

299
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,

300
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because he took an interest.

301
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like,

302
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
this is an overeager student,

303
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
which we don't normally get in the United States,

304
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
because everyone else is cynical and jaded.

305
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
He called me to his office and said,

306
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
"What do you want to do when you grow up?"

307
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I said, "I want to be a lawyer."

308
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And he was like, "Why? You know,

309
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
we don't need another lawyer in the United States."

310
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And he tried to talk me out of it,

311
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,

312
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I'm poli-sci Ph.D.

313
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,

314
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
what I need to do to help you out."

315
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It was like, "Where do you want to go?"

316
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And to me at that time university --

317
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I was at University of Pitts for undergrad,

318
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and that was like heaven, OK,

319
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
because compared to what could have been in Kenya.

320
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."

321
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart,

322
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
you have all these things going for you."

323
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,

324
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."

325
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard

326
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
for applying to law school.

327
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.

328
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,

329
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
you're that good, OK?

330
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."

331
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And he built me up, you know?

332
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And this is just an illustration.

333
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
You can meet other individuals here.

334
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
We just need a push.

335
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.

336
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?

337
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity

338
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
of us having to leave the continent

339
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
so that we can fulfill our potential.

340
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
You know, my vision is that my daughter,

341
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and any other African child being born today,

342
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
can be whoever they want to be here,

343
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
without having to leave.

344
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And they can have the possibility of transcending

345
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
the circumstances under which they were born.

346
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?

347
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,

348
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and you can move.

349
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,

350
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that doesn't define who you are.

351
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,

352
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and the circumstances under which you were born,

353
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
determine the rest of your life.

354
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I would like to see that change,

355
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and the change starts with us.

356
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.

357
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Thank you.

358
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Applause)

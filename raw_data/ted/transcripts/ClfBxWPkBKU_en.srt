1
0:00:12.739,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,

2
0:00:16.534,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and it's clear that the general public needs guidance,

3
0:00:20.819,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because the average bank robbery nets

4
0:00:23.692,000 --> 0:00:25,000
only 7,500 dollars.

5
0:00:26.23,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Rank amateurs who know nothing

6
0:00:28.2,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about how to cook the books.

7
0:00:30.539,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The folks who know, of course,

8
0:00:32.599,000 --> 0:00:33,000
run our largest banks,

9
0:00:34.39,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and in the last go-around,

10
0:00:36.908,000 --> 0:00:4,000
they cost us over 11 trillion dollars.

11
0:00:41.144,000 --> 0:00:43,000
That's what 11 trillion looks like.

12
0:00:43.561,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That's how many zeros?

13
0:00:45.108,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And cost us over 10 million jobs as well.

14
0:00:48.544,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So our task is to educate ourselves

15
0:00:51.195,000 --> 0:00:52,000
so that we can understand

16
0:00:52.403,000 --> 0:00:54,000
why we have these recurrent,

17
0:00:54.853,000 --> 0:00:56,000
intensifying financial crises,

18
0:00:56.93,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and how we can prevent them in the future.

19
0:01:00.125,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And the answer to that is

20
0:01:02.515,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.

21
0:01:06.921,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Control fraud is what happens

22
0:01:08.87,000 --> 0:01:09,000
when the people who control,

23
0:01:10.69,000 --> 0:01:11,000
typically a CEO,

24
0:01:12.415,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a seemingly legitimate entity,

25
0:01:14.988,000 --> 0:01:16,000
use it as a weapon to defraud.

26
0:01:17.244,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And these are the weapons of mass destruction

27
0:01:20.839,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in the financial world.

28
0:01:22.939,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They also follow in finance a particular strategy,

29
0:01:27.669,000 --> 0:01:29,000
because the weapon of choice in finance

30
0:01:30.041,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is accounting,

31
0:01:31.511,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and there is a recipe for accounting

32
0:01:35.405,000 --> 0:01:37,000
control fraud, and how it occurs.

33
0:01:37.735,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And we discovered this recipe

34
0:01:39.368,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in quite an odd way that I'll come back to in a moment.

35
0:01:42.062,000 --> 0:01:45,000
First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;

36
0:01:46.039,000 --> 0:01:51,000
second, by making or buying really crappy loans,

37
0:01:51.077,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but loans that are made at a very high interest rate

38
0:01:54.56,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or yield;

39
0:01:56.038,000 --> 0:01:58,000
three, while employing extreme leverage --

40
0:01:58.27,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that just means a lot of debt --

41
0:01:59.985,000 --> 0:02:,000
compared to your equity;

42
0:02:01.219,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and four, while providing only trivial loss reserves

43
0:02:05.239,000 --> 0:02:07,000
against the inevitable losses.

44
0:02:07.423,000 --> 0:02:1,000
If you follow those four simple steps,

45
0:02:11.089,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and any bank can follow them,

46
0:02:13.39,000 --> 0:02:15,000
then you are mathematically guaranteed

47
0:02:15.898,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to have three things occur.

48
0:02:18.088,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The first thing is

49
0:02:19.648,000 --> 0:02:22,000
you will report record bank profits --

50
0:02:23.012,000 --> 0:02:25,000
not just high, record.

51
0:02:25.523,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Two, the CEO will immediately be made incredibly wealthy

52
0:02:30.78,000 --> 0:02:32,000
by modern executive compensation.

53
0:02:33.676,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And three, farther down the road,

54
0:02:36.546,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the bank will suffer catastrophic losses

55
0:02:39.607,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and will fail unless it is bailed out.

56
0:02:42.803,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And that's a hint as to how

57
0:02:46.543,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we discovered this recipe,

58
0:02:48.279,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because we discovered it through an autopsy process.

59
0:02:52.355,000 --> 0:02:56,000
During the savings and loan debacle in 1984,

60
0:02:57.267,000 --> 0:02:59,000
we looked at every single failure,

61
0:02:59.722,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and we looked for common characteristics,

62
0:03:02.139,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and we discovered this recipe was common

63
0:03:06.398,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to each of these frauds.

64
0:03:08.712,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In other words, a coroner could find these things

65
0:03:11.79,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because this is a fatal recipe

66
0:03:14.65,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that will destroy the banks

67
0:03:16.074,000 --> 0:03:18,000
as well as the economy.

68
0:03:18.165,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And it also turns out to be precisely

69
0:03:21.678,000 --> 0:03:23,000
what could have stopped this crisis,

70
0:03:23.94,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars

71
0:03:26.462,000 --> 0:03:27,000
just in the household sector,

72
0:03:28.398,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that cost us 10 million jobs,

73
0:03:30.502,000 --> 0:03:33,000
was the easiest financial crisis by far

74
0:03:33.956,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to have avoided completely

75
0:03:36.427,000 --> 0:03:38,000
if we had simply learned the lessons

76
0:03:38.499,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of epidemics of control fraud,

77
0:03:40.604,000 --> 0:03:42,000
particularly using this recipe.

78
0:03:43.095,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So let's go to this crisis,

79
0:03:45.002,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and the two huge epidemics

80
0:03:47.851,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis --

81
0:03:51.515,000 --> 0:03:53,000
appraisal fraud and liar's loans --

82
0:03:54.348,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and what we're going to see

83
0:03:55.793,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in looking at both of these is

84
0:03:58.14,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we got warnings that were incredibly early

85
0:04:01.393,000 --> 0:04:02,000
about these frauds.

86
0:04:03.362,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We got warnings that we could have taken advantage of easily,

87
0:04:07.5,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because back in the savings and loan debacle,

88
0:04:09.97,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we had figured out how to respond

89
0:04:12.59,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and prevent these crises.

90
0:04:14.668,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And three, the warnings were unambiguous.

91
0:04:17.972,000 --> 0:04:19,000
They were obvious that what was going on

92
0:04:20.541,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.

93
0:04:25.42,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Let's take appraisal fraud first.

94
0:04:27.193,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is simply where you inflate the value

95
0:04:29.901,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of the home that is being pledged

96
0:04:32.63,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as security for the loan.

97
0:04:35.227,000 --> 0:04:38,000
In 2000, the year 2000,

98
0:04:38.733,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,

99
0:04:43.067,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the honest appraisers got together a formal petition

100
0:04:47.303,000 --> 0:04:5,000
begging the federal government to act,

101
0:04:50.405,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and the industry to act,

102
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.

103
0:04:56.069,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And the appraisers explained how it was occurring,

104
0:04:59.373,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that banks were demanding that appraisers

105
0:05:03.01,000 --> 0:05:04,000
inflate the appraisal,

106
0:05:04.92,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and that if the appraisers refused to do so,

107
0:05:08.221,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they, the banks, would blacklist

108
0:05:12.077,000 --> 0:05:14,000
honest appraisers

109
0:05:14.299,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and refuse to use them.

110
0:05:16.851,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, we've seen this before

111
0:05:19.413,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in the savings and loan debacle,

112
0:05:20.941,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and we know that this kind of fraud

113
0:05:22.765,000 --> 0:05:24,000
can only originate from the lenders,

114
0:05:25.361,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and that no honest lender would ever inflate

115
0:05:28.405,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the appraisal,

116
0:05:29.714,000 --> 0:05:32,000
because it's the great protection against loss.

117
0:05:32.81,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.

118
0:05:36.441,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It was something we'd seen before,

119
0:05:38.622,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and it was completely unambiguous.

120
0:05:40.861,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud

121
0:05:44.253,000 --> 0:05:45,000
led by the banks.

122
0:05:45.85,000 --> 0:05:46,000
What about liar's loans?

123
0:05:47.523,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Well, that warning actually comes earlier.

124
0:05:51.372,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The savings and loan debacle is basically

125
0:05:54.001,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the early 1980s through 1993,

126
0:05:57.548,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and in the midst of fighting that wave

127
0:06:00.303,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of accounting control fraud,

128
0:06:02.97,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in 1990, we found that a second front

129
0:06:07.158,000 --> 0:06:09,000
of fraud was being started.

130
0:06:09.203,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And like all good financial frauds in America,

131
0:06:11.358,000 --> 0:06:14,000
it began in Orange County, California.

132
0:06:15.21,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And we happened to be the regional regulators for it.

133
0:06:18.221,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And our examiners said,

134
0:06:20.01,000 --> 0:06:23,000
they are making loans without even checking

135
0:06:23.365,000 --> 0:06:25,000
what the borrower's income is.

136
0:06:25.868,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,

137
0:06:30.451,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and it only makes sense for entities engaged

138
0:06:34.083,000 --> 0:06:36,000
in these accounting control frauds.

139
0:06:36.324,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,

140
0:06:38.595,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and we drove those liar's loans

141
0:06:41.893,000 --> 0:06:45,000
out of the industry in 1990 and 1991,

142
0:06:46.337,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but we could only deal with the industry

143
0:06:48.389,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we had jurisdiction over,

144
0:06:50.438,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which was savings and loans,

145
0:06:52.143,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,

146
0:06:55.523,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Long Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up

147
0:06:58.429,000 --> 0:07:,000
its federal savings and loan charter,

148
0:07:01.298,000 --> 0:07:03,000
gave up federal deposit insurance,

149
0:07:03.741,000 --> 0:07:05,000
converted to become a mortgage bank

150
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,

151
0:07:09.2,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and changed its name to Ameriquest,

152
0:07:11.773,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and became the most notorious

153
0:07:13.445,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of the liar's loans frauds early on,

154
0:07:17.07,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and to add to that,

155
0:07:18.606,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they deliberately predated upon minorities.

156
0:07:23.826,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So we knew again about this crisis.

157
0:07:27.917,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.

158
0:07:31.151,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We had incredibly early warnings of it,

159
0:07:34.341,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and it was absolutely unambiguous

160
0:07:36.193,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that no honest lender would make loans in this fashion.

161
0:07:40.399,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So let's take a look at the reaction

162
0:07:43.241,000 --> 0:07:45,000
of the industry and the regulators

163
0:07:46.187,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the prosecutors to these clear

164
0:07:48.99,000 --> 0:07:52,000
early warnings that could have prevented the crisis.

165
0:07:53.457,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Start with the industry.

166
0:07:55.306,000 --> 0:08:,000
The industry responded between 2003 and 2006

167
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
by increasing liar's loans

168
0:08:04.101,000 --> 0:08:09,000
by over 500 percent.

169
0:08:09.333,000 --> 0:08:1,000
These were the loans

170
0:08:11.228,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that hyperinflated the bubble

171
0:08:12.983,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and produced the economic crisis.

172
0:08:16.631,000 --> 0:08:2,000
By 2006, half of all the loans called subprime

173
0:08:21.482,000 --> 0:08:23,000
were also liar's loans.

174
0:08:23.508,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,

175
0:08:26.793,000 --> 0:08:28,000
they're the most toxic combination

176
0:08:29.233,000 --> 0:08:3,000
you can possibly imagine.

177
0:08:31.093,000 --> 0:08:34,000
By 2006, 40 percent of all the loans

178
0:08:34.847,000 --> 0:08:36,000
made that year, all the home loans made that year,

179
0:08:37.464,000 --> 0:08:39,000
were liar's loans,

180
0:08:40.186,000 --> 0:08:41,000
40 percent.

181
0:08:41.497,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And this is despite a warning

182
0:08:44.201,000 --> 0:08:47,000
from the industry's own antifraud experts

183
0:08:47.624,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that said that these loans were an open invitation

184
0:08:50.779,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to fraudsters,

185
0:08:52.739,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and that they had a fraud incidence

186
0:08:54.481,000 --> 0:08:56,000
of 90 percent,

187
0:08:56.969,000 --> 0:08:58,000
nine zero.

188
0:08:59.661,000 --> 0:09:02,000
In response to that, the industry

189
0:09:02.728,000 --> 0:09:07,000
first started calling these loans liar's loans,

190
0:09:07.776,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which lacks a certain subtlety,

191
0:09:11.345,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and second, massively increased them,

192
0:09:14.395,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and no government regulator ever

193
0:09:17.656,000 --> 0:09:2,000
required or encouraged any lender

194
0:09:21.346,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to make a liar's loan

195
0:09:22.642,000 --> 0:09:24,000
or anyone to purchase a liar's loan,

196
0:09:25.329,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.

197
0:09:28.499,000 --> 0:09:3,000
This came from the lenders

198
0:09:30.621,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because of the fraud recipe.

199
0:09:33.79,000 --> 0:09:35,000
What happened to appraisal fraud?

200
0:09:36.224,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It expanded remarkably as well.

201
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:43,000
By 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,

202
0:09:43.757,000 --> 0:09:45,000
90 percent of appraisers reported

203
0:09:46.458,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that they had been subject to coercion

204
0:09:48.898,000 --> 0:09:5,000
from the lenders trying to get them

205
0:09:51.39,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to inflate an appraisal.

206
0:09:52.96,000 --> 0:09:54,000
In other words, both forms of fraud

207
0:09:55.95,000 --> 0:09:58,000
became absolutely endemic and normal,

208
0:09:59.724,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and this is what drove the bubble.

209
0:10:01.953,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What happened in the governmental sector?

210
0:10:04.145,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Well, the government, as I told you,

211
0:10:06.749,000 --> 0:10:08,000
when we were the savings and loan regulators,

212
0:10:09.465,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we could only deal with our industry,

213
0:10:12.143,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and if people gave up their federal deposit insurance,

214
0:10:14.581,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we couldn't do anything to them.

215
0:10:16.844,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Congress, it may strike you as impossible,

216
0:10:20.173,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but actually did something intelligent in 1994,

217
0:10:23.421,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and passed the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act

218
0:10:26.974,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,

219
0:10:30.227,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loans

220
0:10:34.254,000 --> 0:10:36,000
by every lender,

221
0:10:36.36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
whether or not they had federal deposit insurance.

222
0:10:39.358,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,

223
0:10:42.893,000 --> 0:10:43,000
as chairs of the Fed, do

224
0:10:44.86,000 --> 0:10:45,000
when they got these warnings

225
0:10:46.766,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that these were massively fraudulent loans

226
0:10:49.776,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and that they were being sold to the secondary market?

227
0:10:53.13,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Remember, there's no fraud exorcist.

228
0:10:55.35,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Once it starts out a fraudulent loan,

229
0:10:57.398,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it can only be sold to the secondary market

230
0:10:59.71,000 --> 0:11:,000
through more frauds,

231
0:11:00.906,000 --> 0:11:02,000
lying about the reps and warrantees,

232
0:11:03.454,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and then those people are going to produce

233
0:11:05.062,000 --> 0:11:06,000
mortgage-backed securities

234
0:11:06.49,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and exotic derivatives

235
0:11:07.758,000 --> 0:11:1,000
which are also going to be supposedly backed

236
0:11:10.98,000 --> 0:11:11,000
by those fraudulent loans.

237
0:11:12.703,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So the fraud is going to progress

238
0:11:14.244,000 --> 0:11:15,000
through the entire system,

239
0:11:15.708,000 --> 0:11:18,000
hyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.

240
0:11:18.961,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And remember, we had experience with this.

241
0:11:22.262,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We had seen significant losses,

242
0:11:24.55,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and we had experience of competent regulators

243
0:11:27.996,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in stopping it.

244
0:11:29.486,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Greenspan and Bernanke refused

245
0:11:32.382,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to use the authority under the statute

246
0:11:34.793,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to stop liar's loans.

247
0:11:37.11,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And this was a matter first of dogma.

248
0:11:39.674,000 --> 0:11:41,000
They're just horrifically opposed

249
0:11:42.525,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to anything regulatory.

250
0:11:44.344,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But it is also the international competition in laxity,

251
0:11:49.06,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the race to the bottom

252
0:11:50.344,000 --> 0:11:54,000
between the United States and the United Kingdom,

253
0:11:54.379,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the city of London, in particular,

254
0:11:55.98,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and the city of London won that race to the bottom,

255
0:11:58.95,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but it meant that all regulation in the West

256
0:12:02.802,000 --> 0:12:04,000
was completely degraded

257
0:12:04.806,000 --> 0:12:06,000
in this stupid competition to be

258
0:12:06.89,000 --> 0:12:08,000
who could have the weakest regulation.

259
0:12:08.962,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So that was the regulatory response.

260
0:12:11.012,000 --> 0:12:14,000
What about the response of the prosecutors

261
0:12:14.669,000 --> 0:12:15,000
after the crisis,

262
0:12:16.404,000 --> 0:12:2,000
after 11 trillion dollars in losses,

263
0:12:20.602,000 --> 0:12:22,000
after 10 million jobs lost,

264
0:12:22.642,000 --> 0:12:25,000
a crisis in which the losses and the frauds

265
0:12:25.926,000 --> 0:12:28,000
were more than 70 times larger

266
0:12:29.381,000 --> 0:12:31,000
than the savings and loan debacle?

267
0:12:31.685,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Well, in the savings and loan debacle,

268
0:12:33.576,000 --> 0:12:36,000
our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,

269
0:12:37.546,000 --> 0:12:41,000
made over 30,000 criminal referrals,

270
0:12:41.63,000 --> 0:12:43,000
produced over 1,000 felony convictions

271
0:12:44.266,000 --> 0:12:46,000
just in cases designated as major,

272
0:12:46.94,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and that understates the degree of prioritization,

273
0:12:50.078,000 --> 0:12:51,000
because we worked with the FBI

274
0:12:51.874,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,

275
0:12:56.138,000 --> 0:12:59,000
the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.

276
0:12:59.402,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,

277
0:13:02.186,000 --> 0:13:05,000
roughly 600 senior officials.

278
0:13:05.5,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Virtually all of them were prosecuted.

279
0:13:07.84,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We had a 90 percent conviction rate.

280
0:13:10.671,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's the greatest success against

281
0:13:12.501,000 --> 0:13:14,000
elite white collar criminals ever,

282
0:13:15.103,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and it was because of this understanding

283
0:13:17.339,000 --> 0:13:18,000
of control fraud

284
0:13:18.674,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and the accounting control fraud mechanism.

285
0:13:21.185,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Flash forward to the current crisis.

286
0:13:24.357,000 --> 0:13:26,000
The same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,

287
0:13:26.93,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which was supposed to regulate

288
0:13:28.56,000 --> 0:13:3,000
many of the largest makers of liar's loans

289
0:13:30.657,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in the country,

290
0:13:31.764,000 --> 0:13:35,000
has made, even today -- it no longer exists,

291
0:13:36.458,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but as of a year ago,

292
0:13:38.266,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it had made zero criminal referrals.

293
0:13:43.11,000 --> 0:13:44,000
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,

294
0:13:44.806,000 --> 0:13:46,000
which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks,

295
0:13:47.322,000 --> 0:13:49,000
has made zero criminal referrals.

296
0:13:49.873,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The Fed appears to have made

297
0:13:51.499,000 --> 0:13:52,000
zero criminal referrals.

298
0:13:53.494,000 --> 0:13:54,000
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

299
0:13:55.449,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is smart enough to refuse to answer the question.

300
0:13:59.983,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Without any guidance from the regulators,

301
0:14:05.518,000 --> 0:14:07,000
there's no expertise in the FBI

302
0:14:08.4,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to investigate complex frauds.

303
0:14:10.872,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It isn't simply that they've had

304
0:14:12.804,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to reinvent the wheel

305
0:14:14.626,000 --> 0:14:15,000
of how to do these prosecutions;

306
0:14:16.544,000 --> 0:14:2,000
they've forgotten that the wheel exists,

307
0:14:21.3,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and therefore, we have zero prosecutions,

308
0:14:25.398,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and of course, zero convictions,

309
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
of any of the elite bank frauds,

310
0:14:30.79,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the Wall Street types,

311
0:14:32.327,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that drove this crisis.

312
0:14:35.459,000 --> 0:14:37,000
With no expertise coming from the regulators,

313
0:14:37.696,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the FBI formed what it calls a partnership

314
0:14:40.787,000 --> 0:14:44,000
with the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.

315
0:14:45.11,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The Mortgage Bankers Association

316
0:14:46.943,000 --> 0:14:49,000
is the trade association of the perps.

317
0:14:50.694,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And the Mortgage Bankers Association

318
0:14:53.11,000 --> 0:14:56,000
set out, it had the audacity and the success

319
0:14:56.9,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to con the FBI.

320
0:14:58.578,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It had created a supposed definition

321
0:15:01.655,000 --> 0:15:03,000
of mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,

322
0:15:04.53,000 --> 0:15:05,000
its members are always the victim

323
0:15:06.392,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and never the perpetrators.

324
0:15:08.409,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,

325
0:15:12.923,000 --> 0:15:16,000
rod, reel and the boat they rode out in.

326
0:15:17.004,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And so the FBI,

327
0:15:20.06,000 --> 0:15:23,000
under the leadership of an attorney general

328
0:15:23.158,000 --> 0:15:24,000
who is African-American

329
0:15:24.332,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and a president of the United States who is African-American,

330
0:15:26.794,000 --> 0:15:29,000
have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,

331
0:15:30.294,000 --> 0:15:33,000
in which it is the first virgin crisis in history,

332
0:15:33.776,000 --> 0:15:36,000
conceived without sin in the executive ranks.

333
0:15:37.454,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And it's those oh-so-clever hairdressers

334
0:15:40.85,000 --> 0:15:43,000
who were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,

335
0:15:44.068,000 --> 0:15:46,000
who lack any financial sophistication.

336
0:15:46.452,000 --> 0:15:49,000
It is the silliest story you can conceive of,

337
0:15:49.81,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,

338
0:15:53.711,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and they leave the banksters alone entirely.

339
0:15:57.89,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And so, while lions are roaming the campsite,

340
0:16:00.8,000 --> 0:16:03,000
the FBI is chasing mice.

341
0:16:04.01,000 --> 0:16:05,000
What do we need to do?

342
0:16:05.44,000 --> 0:16:07,000
What can we do in all of this?

343
0:16:07.944,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We need to change the perverse incentive structures

344
0:16:11.763,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that produce these recurrent epidemics

345
0:16:14.759,000 --> 0:16:15,000
of accounting control fraud

346
0:16:16.088,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that are driving our crises.

347
0:16:18.102,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So we have to first get rid

348
0:16:20.99,000 --> 0:16:22,000
of the systemically dangerous institutions.

349
0:16:23.478,000 --> 0:16:26,000
These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.

350
0:16:26.963,000 --> 0:16:28,000
We need to shrink them to the point,

351
0:16:29.105,000 --> 0:16:3,000
within the next five years,

352
0:16:30.7,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that they no longer pose a systemic risk.

353
0:16:33.435,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Right now, they are ticking time bombs

354
0:16:35.572,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that will cause a global crisis

355
0:16:38.915,000 --> 0:16:4,000
as soon as the next one fails --

356
0:16:41.264,000 --> 0:16:42,000
not if, when.

357
0:16:43.06,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Second thing we need to do is completely reform

358
0:16:45.971,000 --> 0:16:47,000
modern executive and professional compensation,

359
0:16:48.963,000 --> 0:16:52,000
which is what they use to suborn the appraisers.

360
0:16:53.306,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Remember, they were pressuring the appraisers

361
0:16:55.194,000 --> 0:16:56,000
through the compensation system,

362
0:16:56.976,000 --> 0:16:58,000
trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,

363
0:16:59.638,000 --> 0:17:01,000
in which bad ethics drives good ethics

364
0:17:02.217,000 --> 0:17:03,000
out of the marketplace.

365
0:17:03.583,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And they largely succeeded,

366
0:17:05.519,000 --> 0:17:07,000
which is how the fraud became endemic.

367
0:17:08.402,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And the third thing that we need to do

368
0:17:11.1,000 --> 0:17:13,000
is deal with what we call the three D's:

369
0:17:13.738,000 --> 0:17:15,000
deregulation, desupervision,

370
0:17:16.319,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and the de facto decriminalization.

371
0:17:20.34,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Because we can make

372
0:17:22.437,000 --> 0:17:25,000
all three of these changes, and if we do so,

373
0:17:26.111,000 --> 0:17:28,000
we can dramatically reduce

374
0:17:28.92,000 --> 0:17:3,000
how often we have a crisis

375
0:17:31.112,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and how severe those crises are.

376
0:17:34.739,000 --> 0:17:36,000
That is not simply critical to our economy.

377
0:17:37.72,000 --> 0:17:4,000
You can see what these crises do to inequality

378
0:17:41.146,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and what they do to our democracy.

379
0:17:43.466,000 --> 0:17:45,000
They have produced crony capitalism,

380
0:17:46.21,000 --> 0:17:47,000
American-style,

381
0:17:47.592,000 --> 0:17:5,000
in which the largest financial institutions

382
0:17:50.87,000 --> 0:17:53,000
are the leading financial donors of both parties,

383
0:17:54.514,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and that's the reason why

384
0:17:56.434,000 --> 0:17:59,000
even after this crisis,

385
0:18:00.409,000 --> 0:18:05,000
70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,

386
0:18:05.694,000 --> 0:18:07,000
we have no meaningful reforms

387
0:18:08.548,000 --> 0:18:11,000
in any of the three areas that I've talked about,

388
0:18:11.922,000 --> 0:18:12,000
other than banning liar's loans,

389
0:18:13.714,000 --> 0:18:14,000
which is good,

390
0:18:14.79,000 --> 0:18:16,000
but that's just one form of ammunition

391
0:18:17.214,000 --> 0:18:18,000
for this fraud weapon.

392
0:18:18.61,000 --> 0:18:21,000
There are many forms of ammunition they can use.

393
0:18:22.591,000 --> 0:18:23,000
That's why we need to learn

394
0:18:24.342,000 --> 0:18:26,000
what the bankers have learned:

395
0:18:26.454,000 --> 0:18:29,000
the recipe for the best way to rob a bank,

396
0:18:29.877,000 --> 0:18:31,000
so that we can stop that recipe,

397
0:18:32.742,000 --> 0:18:33,000
because our legislators,

398
0:18:34.504,000 --> 0:18:36,000
who are dependent on political contributions,

399
0:18:37.194,000 --> 0:18:39,000
will not do it on their own.

400
0:18:39.388,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Thank you very much.

401
0:18:41.458,000 --> 0:18:43,000
(Applause)

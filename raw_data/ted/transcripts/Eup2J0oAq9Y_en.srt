Growing up in Missouri,

3
0:00:13.503,000 --> 0:00:15,000
they would kind of take us out into the woods,

4
0:00:16.179,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and they would give you a map, and they would give you a compass,

5
0:00:19.262,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and you had to find your way home.

6
0:00:20.911,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And without the compass,

7
0:00:22.607,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you can't even read the map.

8
0:00:24.113,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That's what I'm here to tell you.

9
0:00:25.739,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The compass is the key.

10
0:00:26.996,000 --> 0:00:27,000
[Small thing.]

11
0:00:28.252,000 --> 0:00:29,000
[Big idea.]

12
0:00:32.559,000 --> 0:00:36,000
A compass is most simply a piece of metal that has been magnetized,

13
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so that it will turn towards the Earth's magnetic pole.

14
0:00:40.753,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The one that we all think of is the pocket compass.

15
0:00:43.679,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It looks like a watch, right?

16
0:00:45.224,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You can hold it in your hand

17
0:00:46.663,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and watch the little needle bounce around

18
0:00:49.069,000 --> 0:00:5,000
until you find north.

19
0:00:50.62,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Magnetism is still a pretty mysterious force to physicists,

20
0:00:54.642,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but what we do know for sure is that a compass works

21
0:00:57.849,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because the Earth is this giant magnet.

22
0:01:00.095,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And when you use a compass,

23
0:01:01.781,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you are in touch with the very center of our planet,

24
0:01:05.459,000 --> 0:01:08,000
where this kind of roiling ball of molten iron

25
0:01:09.269,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is spinning around and creating a magnetic field.

26
0:01:12.259,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Just like a magnet you can play with on your tabletop,

27
0:01:15.059,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it has a north pole and a south pole,

28
0:01:16.955,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and we use compasses to find our way north because of that fact.

29
0:01:20.743,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The earliest known compass comes from about 200 BC in China.

30
0:01:25.822,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They figured out that some of the metal coming out of the ground

31
0:01:29.071,000 --> 0:01:3,000
was naturally magnetic,

32
0:01:30.358,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and so they fashioned this magnetized metal

33
0:01:33.13,000 --> 0:01:34,000
into this kind of ladle-looking thing,

34
0:01:34.983,000 --> 0:01:35,000
put it on a brass plate

35
0:01:36.49,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and then it would point north.

36
0:01:37.95,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It seems to have been primarily used to improve feng shui,

37
0:01:40.754,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so they could figure out what was the best way for energy to flow

38
0:01:44.305,000 --> 0:01:45,000
through their living spaces.

39
0:01:46.068,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Sailors were probably the early adopters

40
0:01:48.793,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of the more portable versions of it,

41
0:01:51.208,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because no matter where the sun was,

42
0:01:52.956,000 --> 0:01:54,000
no matter what the condition of the stars were,

43
0:01:55.176,000 --> 0:01:56,000
they would always be able to find north.

44
0:01:57.066,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, much later, the Europeans are the ones who innovate

45
0:02:00.592,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and come up with the compass rose.

46
0:02:02.442,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It essentially laid out

47
0:02:03.789,000 --> 0:02:05,000
what north, south, east and west looked like,

48
0:02:06.359,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and it also enabled you to kind of create new directions,

49
0:02:09.819,000 --> 0:02:12,000
like northwest, southeast, what have you.

50
0:02:12.94,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And for the first time, they knew where they were going.

51
0:02:15.672,000 --> 0:02:16,000
That's kind of a big deal.

52
0:02:17.263,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But also, I think it was part of this general reinvigoration

53
0:02:21.17,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of European science.

54
0:02:22.589,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You might know it as the Renaissance.

55
0:02:24.409,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Lots of new tools were invented,

56
0:02:26.709,000 --> 0:02:27,000
from the telescope to the microscope.

57
0:02:28.659,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Maps got better because of compasses, right?

58
0:02:31.2,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Because then you start to understand which direction is which,

59
0:02:34.474,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you get a lot more detail,

60
0:02:35.808,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and that just kind of changes

61
0:02:37.521,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the human relationship to the world.

62
0:02:39.879,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The compass with a map is like a superpower.

63
0:02:42.579,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Everything that we think of as world history

64
0:02:45.329,000 --> 0:02:47,000
would not have taken place without the compass:

65
0:02:47.933,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the age of exploration, Magellan circumnavigating the globe,

66
0:02:51.836,000 --> 0:02:53,000
even the fact that we know it is a globe.

67
0:02:53.969,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The compass ends up getting embedded in all these other tools,

68
0:02:57.424,000 --> 0:02:59,000
because it is such a functional object.

69
0:02:59.791,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So you might have it embedded in your multi-tool,

70
0:03:02.479,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you might have it embedded in your phone.

71
0:03:04.436,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The compass is everywhere,

72
0:03:05.716,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because it's literally how we find our way across the face of the Earth.

73
0:03:09.579,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So you can go off and explore,

74
0:03:11.299,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and find out what is over that next hill or that next horizon,

75
0:03:15.697,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but you can also reliably find your way home.

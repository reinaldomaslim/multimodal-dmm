1
0:00:14.79,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Hello.

2
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm a toy developer.

3
0:00:18.845,000 --> 0:00:22,000
With a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before,

4
0:00:22.899,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I began working at a toy company nine years ago.

5
0:00:26.026,000 --> 0:00:28,000
When I first started working there,

6
0:00:28.062,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I proposed many new ideas to my boss every day.

7
0:00:32.02,000 --> 0:00:34,000
However, my boss always asked

8
0:00:34.838,000 --> 0:00:36,000
if I had the data to prove it would sell,

9
0:00:37.442,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data.

10
0:00:40.875,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Data, data, data.

11
0:00:42.539,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product.

12
0:00:46.788,000 --> 0:00:5,000
However, I was unable to think of anything new at that moment.

13
0:00:51.08,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:52.542,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My ideas were unoriginal.

15
0:00:54.591,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I wasn't getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking.

16
0:00:58.904,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It was so hard that I became this skinny.

17
0:01:03.585,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:05.582,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It's true. (Applause)

19
0:01:08.224,000 --> 0:01:12,000
You've all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too.

20
0:01:12.279,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Your boss was being difficult. The data was difficult.

21
0:01:14.891,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You become sick of thinking.

22
0:01:16.682,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, I throw out the data.

23
0:01:19.587,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It's my dream to create new toys.

24
0:01:22.596,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And now, instead of data,

25
0:01:24.824,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas.

26
0:01:29.012,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I would like to introduce this method today.

27
0:01:32.58,000 --> 0:01:34,000
What is Shiritori?

28
0:01:34.701,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Take apple, elephant and trumpet, for example.

29
0:01:37.166,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's a game where you take turns saying words

30
0:01:39.4,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that start with the last letter of the previous word.

31
0:01:41.962,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's the same in Japanese and English.

32
0:01:43.864,000 --> 0:01:45,000
You can play Shiritori as you like:

33
0:01:46.158,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc. [Cat, cola, concert, brush]

34
0:01:49.396,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Many random words will come out.

35
0:01:52.084,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas.

36
0:01:57.174,000 --> 0:02:,000
In my case, for example, since I want to think of toys,

37
0:02:00.777,000 --> 0:02:02,000
what could a toy cat be?

38
0:02:03.66,000 --> 0:02:06,000
A cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place?

39
0:02:07.227,000 --> 0:02:09,000
How about a toy with cola?

40
0:02:09.353,000 --> 0:02:12,000
A toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet?

41
0:02:12.354,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:13.343,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Ridiculous ideas are okay. The key is to keep them flowing.

43
0:02:16.376,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The more ideas you produce, you're sure to come up with some good ones, too.

44
0:02:21.732,000 --> 0:02:25,000
A brush, for example. Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?

45
0:02:26.598,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and --

46
0:02:30.464,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Music noises) --

47
0:02:32.609,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth.

48
0:02:35.765,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

49
0:02:37.531,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Kids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it.

50
0:02:41.484,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Can we make a hat into a toy?

51
0:02:44.706,000 --> 0:02:48,000
How about something like a roulette game, where you try the hat on one by one,

52
0:02:48.757,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and then, when someone puts it on, a scary alien breaks through the top

53
0:02:53.641,000 --> 0:02:54,000
screaming, "Ahh!"

54
0:02:55.635,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties?

55
0:02:58.63,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Ideas that didn't come out while you stare at the data will start to come out.

56
0:03:03.873,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Actually, this bubble wrap, which is used to pack fragile objects,

57
0:03:09.745,000 --> 0:03:13,000
combined with a toy, made Mugen Pop Pop,

58
0:03:14.551,000 --> 0:03:17,000
a toy where you can pop the bubbles as much as you like.

59
0:03:17.823,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It was a big hit when it reached stores.

60
0:03:20.013,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Data had nothing to do with its success.

61
0:03:22.96,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Although it's only popping bubbles,

62
0:03:25.662,000 --> 0:03:27,000
it's a great way to kill time,

63
0:03:27.716,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so please pass this around

64
0:03:29.77,000 --> 0:03:31,000
amongst yourselves today and play with it.

65
0:03:32.325,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Applause)

66
0:03:36.856,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Anyway, you continue to come up with useless ideas.

67
0:03:39.544,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Think up many trivial ideas, everyone.

68
0:03:41.894,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If you base your ideas on data analysis and know what you're aiming for,

69
0:03:45.591,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you'll end up trying too hard,

70
0:03:48.06,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and you can't produce new ideas.

71
0:03:50.002,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Even if you know what your aim is,

72
0:03:52.235,000 --> 0:03:55,000
think of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed.

73
0:03:56.121,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If you do this, you surely will hit somewhere near the center.

74
0:03:59.272,000 --> 0:04:,000
At least one will.

75
0:04:00.86,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That's the one you should choose.

76
0:04:02.907,000 --> 0:04:04,000
If you do so, that idea will be in demand

77
0:04:05.541,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and, moreover, it will be brand new.

78
0:04:08.325,000 --> 0:04:1,000
That is how I think of new ideas.

79
0:04:10.441,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It doesn't have to be Shiritori; there are many different methods.

80
0:04:13.633,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You just have to choose words at random.

81
0:04:15.543,000 --> 0:04:17,000
You can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random.

82
0:04:18.49,000 --> 0:04:22,000
For example, you could look up two random letters and gather the results

83
0:04:22.904,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or go to the store and connect product names

84
0:04:26.552,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with what you want to think of.

85
0:04:29.992,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The point is to gather random words,

86
0:04:33.142,000 --> 0:04:36,000
not information from the category you're thinking for.

87
0:04:36.487,000 --> 0:04:41,000
If you do this, the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected

88
0:04:42.467,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and form connections that will produce many ideas.

89
0:04:45.356,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The greatest advantage to this method is the continuous flow of images.

90
0:04:49.245,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Because you're thinking of one word after another,

91
0:04:52.218,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the image of the previous word is still with you.

92
0:04:54.884,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That image will automatically be related with future words.

93
0:04:57.649,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Unconsciously, a concert will be connected to a brush

94
0:05:00.171,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and a roulette game will be connected to a hat.

95
0:05:02.36,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You wouldn't even realize it.

96
0:05:03.74,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You can come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

97
0:05:07.081,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This method is, of course, not just for toys.

98
0:05:09.181,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You can collect ideas for books, apps, events, and many other projects.

99
0:05:13.892,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I hope you all try this method.

100
0:05:18.17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
There are futures that are born from data.

101
0:05:21.089,000 --> 0:05:25,000
However, using this silly game called Shiritori,

102
0:05:25.859,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I look forward to the exciting future you will create,

103
0:05:28.959,000 --> 0:05:31,000
a future you couldn't even imagine.

104
0:05:32.49,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Thank you very much.

105
0:05:34.891,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Applause)

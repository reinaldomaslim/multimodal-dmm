1
0:00:13.44,000 --> 0:00:16,000
How can we get people to do more good,

2
0:00:16.52,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to go to the polls, give to charity, conserve resources,

3
0:00:20.88,000 --> 0:00:23,000
or even to do something as simple as washing their mugs at work

4
0:00:24.24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
so that the sink isn't always full of dirty dishes?

5
0:00:26.645,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:33.04,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When I first started working on this problem,

8
0:00:35.2,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I collaborated with a power company

9
0:00:37.12,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to recruit customers for a program that prevents blackouts

10
0:00:40.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
by reducing energy demand during peaks.

11
0:00:43.6,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The program is based on a tried-and-true technology.

12
0:00:46.24,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's one the Obama administration even called

13
0:00:48.64,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"the cornerstone to modernizing America's electrical grid."

14
0:00:52.88,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But, like so many great technological solutions,

15
0:00:56.4,000 --> 0:00:57,000
it has a key weakness:

16
0:00:59.76,000 --> 0:01:,000
people.

17
0:01:01.72,000 --> 0:01:02,000
People need to sign up.

18
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
To try to get people to sign up, the power company sent them a nice letter,

19
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:09,000
told them about all the program's benefits,

20
0:01:09.6,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it asked them to call into a hotline if they were interested.

21
0:01:12.68,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Those letters went out,

22
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but the phones, they were silent.

23
0:01:18.08,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So when we got involved, we suggested one small change.

24
0:01:21.36,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Instead of that hotline,

25
0:01:23.28,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we suggested that they use sign-up sheets that they'd post near the mailboxes

26
0:01:27.92,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in people's buildings.

27
0:01:30.12,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This tripled participation.

28
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Why?

29
0:01:37.68,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Well, we all know people care deeply about what others think of them,

30
0:01:41.92,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that we try to be seen as generous and kind,

31
0:01:44.6,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and we try to avoid being seen as selfish or a mooch.

32
0:01:48.12,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Whether we are aware of it or not, this is a big part of why people do good,

33
0:01:52.56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and so small changes that give people more credit for doing good,

34
0:01:57.8,000 --> 0:01:59,000
those changes can make a really big difference.

35
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Small changes like switching from a hotline,

36
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:06,000
where nobody will ever find out about your good deed,

37
0:02:06.12,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to a sign-up sheet

38
0:02:07.88,000 --> 0:02:1,000
where anyone who walks by can see your name.

39
0:02:12.52,000 --> 0:02:15,000
In our collaborations with governments, nonprofits, companies,

40
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
when we're trying to get people to do more good,

41
0:02:18.56,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we harness the power of reputations.

42
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And we have a simple checklist for this.

43
0:02:24.4,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And in fact, you already know the first item on that checklist.

44
0:02:28.96,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's to increase observability,

45
0:02:31.28,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to make sure people find out about good deeds.

46
0:02:35.44,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, wait a minute, I know some of you are probably thinking,

47
0:02:38.36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
there's no way people here thought,

48
0:02:40.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"Oh, well, now that I'm getting credit for my good deed,

49
0:02:42.76,000 --> 0:02:43,000
now it's totally worth it."

50
0:02:44.12,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And you're right.

51
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Usually, people don't.

52
0:02:47.76,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Rather, when they're making decisions in private,

53
0:02:50.84,000 --> 0:02:51,000
they worry about their own problems,

54
0:02:52.6,000 --> 0:02:56,000
about what to put on the table for dinner or how to pay their bills on time.

55
0:02:56.76,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But, when we make their decision more observable,

56
0:02:59.88,000 --> 0:03:02,000
they start to attend more to the opportunity to do good.

57
0:03:03.76,000 --> 0:03:05,000
In other words, what's so powerful about our approach

58
0:03:06.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is that it could turn on people's existing desire to do good,

59
0:03:11.48,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in this case, to help to prevent a blackout.

60
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Back to observability.

61
0:03:16.84,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I want to give you another example.

62
0:03:18.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This one is from a collaboration

63
0:03:20.48,000 --> 0:03:22,000
with a nonprofit that gets out the vote,

64
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and it does this by sending hundreds of thousands of letters every election

65
0:03:26.48,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in order to remind people and try to motivate them to go to the polls.

66
0:03:30.76,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We suggested adding the following sentence:

67
0:03:34.44,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"Someone may call you to find out about your experience at the polls."

68
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This sentence makes it feel more observable when you go to the polls,

69
0:03:43.04,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and it increased the effect of the letter by 50 percent.

70
0:03:48.68,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Making the letter more effective reduced the cost of getting an additional vote

71
0:03:52.44,000 --> 0:03:53,000
from 70 dollars down to about 40 dollars.

72
0:03:55.2,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Observability has been used to do things

73
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
like get people to donate blood more frequently

74
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:01,000
by listing the names of donors on local newsletters,

75
0:04:02.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
or to pay their taxes on time

76
0:04:05.44,000 --> 0:04:07,000
by listing the names of delinquents on a public website.

77
0:04:08.28,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:12.2,000 --> 0:04:13,000
What about this example?

79
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Toyota got hundreds of thousands of people to buy a more fuel-efficient car

80
0:04:18.64,000 --> 0:04:21,000
by making the Prius so unique ...

81
0:04:22.28,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:24.8,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that their good deed was observable from a mile away.

83
0:04:28.04,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:30.88,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Alright, so observability is great,

85
0:04:33.279,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but we all know, we've all seen

86
0:04:36.84,000 --> 0:04:38,000
people walk by an opportunity to do good.

87
0:04:40.08,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They'll see somebody asking for money on the sidewalk

88
0:04:43.4,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and they'll pull out their phones and look really busy,

89
0:04:46.04,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or they'll go to the museum and they'll waltz right on by the donation box.

90
0:04:50.32,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Imagine it's the holiday season

91
0:04:52.44,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and you're going to the supermarket, and there's a Salvation Army volunteer,

92
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and he's ringing his bell.

93
0:04:57.44,000 --> 0:04:58,000
A few years ago, researchers in San Diego

94
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:02,000
teamed up with a local chapter from the Salvation Army

95
0:05:02.92,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to try to find ways to increase donations.

96
0:05:06.24,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What they found was kind of funny.

97
0:05:08.68,000 --> 0:05:1,000
When the volunteer stood in front of just one door,

98
0:05:12.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
people would avoid giving by going out the other door.

99
0:05:16.88,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Why?

100
0:05:19.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Well, because they can always claim, "Oh, I didn't see the volunteer,"

101
0:05:22.8,000 --> 0:05:24,000
or, "I wanted to get something from over there,"

102
0:05:25.08,000 --> 0:05:26,000
or, "That's where my car is."

103
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In other words, there's lots of excuses.

104
0:05:30.64,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And that brings us to the second item on our checklist:

105
0:05:33.64,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to eliminate excuses.

106
0:05:36.8,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In the case of the Salvation Army,

107
0:05:38.48,000 --> 0:05:41,000
eliminating excuses just means standing in front of both doors,

108
0:05:41.76,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and sure enough, when they did this,

109
0:05:43.84,000 --> 0:05:44,000
donations rose.

110
0:05:47.28,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But that's when things got kind of funny,

111
0:05:49.48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
even funnier.

112
0:05:51.96,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The researchers were out in the parking lot,

113
0:05:54.52,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and they were counting people as they came in and out of the store,

114
0:05:57.72,000 --> 0:06:,000
and they noticed that when the volunteers stood in front of both doors,

115
0:06:01.56,000 --> 0:06:03,000
people stopped coming out of the store at all.

116
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:06.84,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Obviously, they were surprised by this, so they decided to look into it further,

118
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and that's when they found that there was actually a third, smaller utility door

119
0:06:16.12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
usually used to take out the recycling --

120
0:06:18.12,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:19.68,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and now people were going out that door in order to avoid the volunteers.

122
0:06:23.2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:26.32,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This teaches us an important lesson though.

124
0:06:30.48,000 --> 0:06:33,000
When we're trying to eliminate excuses, we need to be very thorough,

125
0:06:34.04,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because people are really creative in making them.

126
0:06:36.44,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:41.76,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Alright, I want to switch to a setting

128
0:06:43.64,000 --> 0:06:45,000
where excuses can have deadly consequences.

129
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
What if I told you that the world's deadliest infectious disease has a cure,

130
0:06:52.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in fact, that it's had one for 70 years,

131
0:06:55.92,000 --> 0:06:57,000
a good one, one that works almost every time?

132
0:06:59.92,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's incredible, but it's true.

133
0:07:02.4,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The disease is tuberculosis.

134
0:07:04.4,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It infects some 10 million people a year,

135
0:07:06.72,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and it kills almost two million of them.

136
0:07:09.68,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Like the blackout prevention program, we've got the solution.

137
0:07:13.76,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The problem is people.

138
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
People need to take their medication

139
0:07:17.76,000 --> 0:07:18,000
so that they're cured,

140
0:07:19.68,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and so that they don't get other people sick.

141
0:07:23.52,000 --> 0:07:25,000
For a few years now, we've been collaborating

142
0:07:25.68,000 --> 0:07:27,000
with a mobile health startup called Keheala

143
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to support TB patients as they undergo treatment.

144
0:07:31.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, you have to understand, TB treatment, it's really tough.

145
0:07:34.4,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We're talking about taking a really strong antibiotic

146
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
every single day for six months or more.

147
0:07:39.36,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That antibiotic is so strong that it will make you feel sick.

148
0:07:42.28,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It will make you feel nauseous and dizzy.

149
0:07:44.28,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It will make your pee turn funny colors.

150
0:07:46.72,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's also a problem because you have to go back to the clinic

151
0:07:49.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
about every week in order to get more pills,

152
0:07:52.08,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and in sub-Saharan Africa or other places where TB is common,

153
0:07:55.56,000 --> 0:07:57,000
now you're talking about going someplace pretty far,

154
0:07:58.04,000 --> 0:08:01,000
taking tough and slow public transport,

155
0:08:01.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
maybe the clinic is inefficient.

156
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So now you're talking about taking a half day off of work every week

157
0:08:06.4,000 --> 0:08:08,000
from a job you desperately can't afford to lose.

158
0:08:09.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's even worse when you consider the fact that there's a terrible stigma,

159
0:08:13.44,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and you desperately don't want people to find that you have the disease.

160
0:08:16.88,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Some of the toughest stories we hear are actually from women

161
0:08:19.76,000 --> 0:08:22,000
who, in these places where domestic violence can be kind of common,

162
0:08:23.32,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they tell us that they have to hide it from their husbands

163
0:08:26.08,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that they're coming to the clinic.

164
0:08:29.8,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So it's no surprise that people don't complete treatment.

165
0:08:33.84,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Can our approach really help them?

166
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Can we really get them to stick it out?

167
0:08:40.04,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Yeah.

168
0:08:42.08,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Every day, we text patients to remind them to take their medication,

169
0:08:46.2,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but if we stopped there,

170
0:08:47.76,000 --> 0:08:49,000
there'd be lots of excuses.

171
0:08:49.84,000 --> 0:08:5,000
"Well, I didn't see the text."

172
0:08:51.32,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Or, "You know, I saw the text, but then I totally forgot,

173
0:08:54.039,000 --> 0:08:56,000
put the phone down and I just forgot about it."

174
0:08:56.28,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Or, "I lent the phone out to my mom."

175
0:08:59.6,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We have to eliminate these excuses

176
0:09:01.64,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and we do that by asking patients

177
0:09:03.68,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to log in and verify that they've taken their medication.

178
0:09:07.68,000 --> 0:09:09,000
If they don't log in, we text them again.

179
0:09:09.96,000 --> 0:09:11,000
If they don't log in, we text them yet again.

180
0:09:12.88,000 --> 0:09:15,000
If, after three times, they still haven't verified,

181
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
we notify a team of supporters

182
0:09:17.96,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and that team will call and text them

183
0:09:20.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to try to get them back on the wagon.

184
0:09:22.96,000 --> 0:09:23,000
No excuses.

185
0:09:25.52,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Our approach, which, admittedly, uses all sorts of behavioral techniques,

186
0:09:29.32,000 --> 0:09:32,000
including, as you've probably noticed, observability,

187
0:09:32.56,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it was very effective.

188
0:09:34.8,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Patients without access to our platform

189
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
were three times more likely not to complete treatment.

190
0:09:43.52,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Alright,

191
0:09:44.92,000 --> 0:09:45,000
you've increased observability,

192
0:09:46.48,000 --> 0:09:48,000
you've eliminated excuses,

193
0:09:48.72,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but there's still a third thing you need to be aware of.

194
0:09:52.8,000 --> 0:09:55,000
If you've been to Washington, DC or Japan or London,

195
0:09:56.08,000 --> 0:09:57,000
you know that metro riders there

196
0:09:57.8,000 --> 0:10:,000
will be very careful to stand on the right-hand side of the escalator

197
0:10:01.28,000 --> 0:10:02,000
so that people can go by on the left.

198
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But unfortunately, not everywhere is that the norm,

199
0:10:06.56,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and there's plenty of places where you can just stand on both sides

200
0:10:09.76,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and block the escalator.

201
0:10:11.04,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Obviously, it's better for others

202
0:10:12.68,000 --> 0:10:14,000
when we stand on the right and let them go by,

203
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but we're only expected to do that some places.

204
0:10:18.72,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is a general phenomenon.

205
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Sometimes we're expected to do good

206
0:10:22.24,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and sometimes not,

207
0:10:24.08,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and it means that people are really sensitive to cues

208
0:10:27.48,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that they're expected to do good in a particular situation,

209
0:10:31.6,000 --> 0:10:34,000
which brings us to the third and final item on our checklist:

210
0:10:35.32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to communicate expectations,

211
0:10:37.12,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to tell people,

212
0:10:38.56,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"Do the good deed right now."

213
0:10:42.68,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Here's a simple way to communicate expectations;

214
0:10:44.96,000 --> 0:10:47,000
simply tell them, "Hey, everybody else is doing the good deed."

215
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The company Opower sends people in their electricity bill

216
0:10:52.36,000 --> 0:10:54,000
a small insert that compares their energy consumption

217
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
with that of people with similarly sized homes.

218
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And when people find out that their neighbors are using less electricity,

219
0:11:02.48,000 --> 0:11:03,000
they start to consume less.

220
0:11:04.4,000 --> 0:11:07,000
That same approach, it's been used to get people to vote or give to charity

221
0:11:08.08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or even reuse their towels in hotels.

222
0:11:12.24,000 --> 0:11:13,000
What about this one?

223
0:11:14.24,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Here's another way to communicate expectations;

224
0:11:16.76,000 --> 0:11:2,000
simply do it by saying, "Do the good deed" just at the right time.

225
0:11:23.84,000 --> 0:11:24,000
What about this one?

226
0:11:26.32,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This ticker reframes

227
0:11:28.96,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the kind of mundane task of turning off the lights

228
0:11:31.8,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and turns it instead into an environmental contribution.

229
0:11:36.32,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The bottom line is, lots of different ways to do this,

230
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
lots of ways to communicate expectations.

231
0:11:41.24,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Just don't forget to do it.

232
0:11:43.32,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And that's it.

233
0:11:44.64,000 --> 0:11:45,000
That's our checklist.

234
0:11:48.44,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Many of you are working on problems with important social consequences,

235
0:11:52.8,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and sometimes you might need to motivate people to do more good.

236
0:11:57.52,000 --> 0:12:,000
The tools you learned today can help you with this.

237
0:12:00.56,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And these tools, they don't require that you raise additional funds

238
0:12:03.76,000 --> 0:12:05,000
or that you develop any more fancy technologies.

239
0:12:06.68,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They just require harnessing reputations

240
0:12:09.48,000 --> 0:12:12,000
by increasing observability, eliminating excuses

241
0:12:12.92,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and communicating expectations.

242
0:12:16.12,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Thank you.

243
0:12:17.36,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Applause)

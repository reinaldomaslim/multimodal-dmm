2
0:00:13.02,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was a child, I knew I had superpowers.

3
0:00:18.74,000 --> 0:00:19,000
That's right.

4
0:00:19.98,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:21.1,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I thought I was absolutely amazing because I could understand

6
0:00:25.14,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and relate to the feelings of brown people,

7
0:00:27.3,000 --> 0:00:3,000
like my grandfather, a conservative Muslim guy.

8
0:00:31.18,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And also, I could understand my Afghan mother, my Pakistani father,

9
0:00:36.1,000 --> 0:00:39,000
not so religious but laid-back, fairly liberal.

10
0:00:40.3,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And of course, I could understand

11
0:00:41.94,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and relate to the feelings of white people.

12
0:00:44.38,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The white Norwegians of my country.

13
0:00:47.3,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You know, white, brown, whatever --

14
0:00:49.9,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I loved them all.

15
0:00:51.74,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I understood them all,

16
0:00:53.02,000 --> 0:00:55,000
even if they didn't always understand each other;

17
0:00:55.38,000 --> 0:00:56,000
they were all my people.

18
0:00:57.42,000 --> 0:00:59,000
My father, though, was always really worried.

19
0:01:00.38,000 --> 0:01:03,000
He kept saying that even with the best education,

20
0:01:03.74,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I was not going to get a fair shake.

21
0:01:06.94,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I would still face discrimination, according to him.

22
0:01:10.38,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And that the only way to be accepted by white people

23
0:01:13.22,000 --> 0:01:15,000
would be to become famous.

24
0:01:15.42,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now, mind you, he had this conversation with me when I was seven years old.

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So while I'm seven years old, he said,

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"Look, so it's either got to be sports, or it's got to be music."

27
0:01:26.66,000 --> 0:01:3,000
He didn't know anything about sports -- bless him -- so it was music.

28
0:01:31.14,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So when I was seven years old, he gathered all my toys, all my dolls,

29
0:01:35.5,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and he threw them all away.

30
0:01:37.98,000 --> 0:01:4,000
In exchange he gave me a crappy little Casio keyboard and --

31
0:01:41.86,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:43.1,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Yeah. And singing lessons.

33
0:01:45.14,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And he forced me, basically, to practice for hours and hours every single day.

34
0:01:49.94,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Very quickly, he also had me performing for larger and larger audiences,

35
0:01:54.22,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and bizarrely, I became almost a kind of poster child

36
0:01:58.02,000 --> 0:02:,000
for Norwegian multiculturalism.

37
0:02:00.58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I felt very proud, of course.

38
0:02:02.34,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Because even the newspapers at this point

39
0:02:05.7,000 --> 0:02:07,000
were starting to write nice things about brown people,

40
0:02:08.3,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so I could feel that my superpower was growing.

41
0:02:12.78,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So when I was 12 years old, walking home from school,

42
0:02:15.78,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I took a little detour

43
0:02:17.02,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because I wanted to buy my favorite sweets called "salty feet."

44
0:02:20.579,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I know they sound kind of awful,

45
0:02:23.46,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but I absolutely love them.

46
0:02:24.98,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They're basically these little salty licorice bits in the shape of feet.

47
0:02:29.94,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And now that I say it out loud, I realize how terrible that sounds,

48
0:02:36.1,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but be that as it may, I absolutely love them.

49
0:02:38.62,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So on my way into the store,

50
0:02:40.74,000 --> 0:02:44,000
there was this grown white guy in the doorway blocking my way.

51
0:02:45.3,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So I tried to walk around him, and as I did that, he stopped me

52
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and he was staring at me,

53
0:02:54.02,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and he spit in my face, and he said,

54
0:02:55.98,000 --> 0:02:56,000
"Get out of my way

55
0:02:57.22,000 --> 0:03:,000
you little black bitch, you little Paki bitch,

56
0:03:00.5,000 --> 0:03:01,000
go back home where you came from."

57
0:03:03.42,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I was absolutely horrified.

58
0:03:06.54,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I was staring at him.

59
0:03:07.86,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I was too afraid to wipe the spit off my face,

60
0:03:11.66,000 --> 0:03:13,000
even as it was mixing with my tears.

61
0:03:13.82,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I remember looking around, hoping that any minute now,

62
0:03:17.54,000 --> 0:03:2,000
a grown-up is going to come and make this guy stop.

63
0:03:21.22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But instead, people kept hurrying past me and pretended not to see me.

64
0:03:25.98,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I was very confused because I was thinking, well,

65
0:03:30.46,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"My white people, come on! Where are they? What's going on?

66
0:03:33.78,000 --> 0:03:35,000
How come they're not coming and rescuing me?"

67
0:03:36.58,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So, needless to say, I didn't buy the sweets.

68
0:03:38.86,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I just ran home as fast as I could.

69
0:03:41.86,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Things were still OK, though, I thought.

70
0:03:44.62,000 --> 0:03:47,000
As time went on, the more successful I became,

71
0:03:47.74,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I eventually started also attracting harassment from brown people.

72
0:03:53.34,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Some men in my parent's community felt that it was unacceptable

73
0:03:56.66,000 --> 0:04:,000
and dishonorable for a woman to be involved in music

74
0:04:01.54,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and to be so present in the media.

75
0:04:05.1,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So very quickly, I was starting to become attacked at my own concerts.

76
0:04:10.54,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I remember one of the concerts, I was onstage, I lean into the audience

77
0:04:15.58,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and the last thing I see is a young brown face,

78
0:04:18.86,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and the next thing I know is some sort of chemical is thrown in my eyes

79
0:04:23.1,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and I remember I couldn't really see and my eyes were watering

80
0:04:26.34,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but I kept singing anyway.

81
0:04:28.659,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I was spit in the face in the streets of Oslo, this time by brown men.

82
0:04:34.18,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They even tried to kidnap me at one point.

83
0:04:37.42,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The death threats were endless.

84
0:04:39.5,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I remember one older bearded guy stopped me in the street one time,

85
0:04:42.78,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and he said, "The reason I hate you so much

86
0:04:44.94,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is because you make our daughters think

87
0:04:47.02,000 --> 0:04:48,000
they can do whatever they want."

88
0:04:50.38,000 --> 0:04:52,000
A younger guy warned me to watch my back.

89
0:04:53.22,000 --> 0:04:56,000
He said music is un-Islamic and the job of whores,

90
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and if you keep this up, you are going to be raped

91
0:04:59.02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and your stomach will be cut out so that another whore like you will not be born.

92
0:05:05.38,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Again, I was so confused.

93
0:05:07.1,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I couldn't understand what was going on.

94
0:05:09.029,000 --> 0:05:12,000
My brown people now starting to treat me like this -- how come?

95
0:05:13.38,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Instead of bridging the worlds, the two worlds,

96
0:05:16.5,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I felt like I was falling between my two worlds.

97
0:05:19.82,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite.

98
0:05:24.38,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So by the time I was 17 years old,

99
0:05:26.42,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the death threats were endless, and the harassment was constant.

100
0:05:29.46,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It got so bad, at one point my mother sat me down and said,

101
0:05:32.246,000 --> 0:05:35,000
"Look, we can no longer protect you, we can no longer keep you safe,

102
0:05:35.74,000 --> 0:05:36,000
so you're going to have to go."

103
0:05:37.54,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So I bought a one-way ticket to London, I packed my suitcase and I left.

104
0:05:43.98,000 --> 0:05:46,000
My biggest heartbreak at that point was that nobody said anything.

105
0:05:47.7,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I had a very public exit from Norway.

106
0:05:50.94,000 --> 0:05:53,000
My brown people, my white people -- nobody said anything.

107
0:05:54.5,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Nobody said, "Hold on, this is wrong.

108
0:05:57.78,000 --> 0:06:,000
Support this girl, protect this girl, because she is one of us."

109
0:06:01.5,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Nobody said that.

110
0:06:03.14,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Instead, I felt like -- you know at the airport,

111
0:06:06.94,000 --> 0:06:08,000
on the baggage carousel you have these different suitcases

112
0:06:09.82,000 --> 0:06:1,000
going around and around,

113
0:06:11.1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and there's always that one suitcase left at the end,

114
0:06:13.62,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the one that nobody wants, the one that nobody comes to claim.

115
0:06:16.66,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I felt like that.

116
0:06:18.86,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I'd never felt so alone. I'd never felt so lost.

117
0:06:24.18,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So, after coming to London, I did eventually resume my music career.

118
0:06:28.82,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Different place, but unfortunately the same old story.

119
0:06:32.66,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I remember a message sent to me saying that I was going to be killed

120
0:06:36.22,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and that rivers of blood were going to flow

121
0:06:39.62,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and that I was going to be raped many times before I died.

122
0:06:43.1,000 --> 0:06:44,000
By this point, I have to say,

123
0:06:44.54,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I was actually getting used to messages like this,

124
0:06:47.02,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but what became different was that now they started threatening my family.

125
0:06:52.58,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So once again, I packed my suitcase, I left music and I moved to the US.

126
0:06:58.34,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I'd had enough.

127
0:06:59.62,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I didn't want to have anything to do with this anymore.

128
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And I was certainly not going to be killed for something

129
0:07:04.94,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that wasn't even my dream -- it was my father's choice.

130
0:07:10.02,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So I kind of got lost.

131
0:07:13.22,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I kind of fell apart.

132
0:07:14.78,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But I decided that what I wanted to do

133
0:07:17.14,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is spend the next however many years of my life

134
0:07:20.5,000 --> 0:07:21,000
supporting young people

135
0:07:22.18,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and to try to be there in some small way,

136
0:07:25.1,000 --> 0:07:26,000
whatever way that I could.

137
0:07:26.82,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I started volunteering for various organizations

138
0:07:30.1,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that were working with young Muslims inside of Europe.

139
0:07:35.9,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And, to my surprise, what I found was

140
0:07:38.94,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so many of these young people were suffering and struggling.

141
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They were facing so many problems with their families and their communities

142
0:07:47.82,000 --> 0:07:5,000
who seemed to care more about their honor and their reputation

143
0:07:51.46,000 --> 0:07:53,000
than the happiness and the lives of their own kids.

144
0:07:55.58,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I started feeling like maybe I wasn't so alone, maybe I wasn't so weird.

145
0:08:00.1,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Maybe there are more of my people out there.

146
0:08:03.1,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The thing is, what most people don't understand

147
0:08:05.34,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is that there are so many of us growing up in Europe

148
0:08:09.66,000 --> 0:08:11,000
who are not free to be ourselves.

149
0:08:12.1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We're not allowed to be who we are.

150
0:08:15.18,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We are not free to marry

151
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
or to be in relationships with people that we choose.

152
0:08:22.22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We can't even pick our own career.

153
0:08:23.9,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This is the norm in the Muslim heartlands of Europe.

154
0:08:27.7,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Even in the freest societies in the world, we're not free.

155
0:08:31.46,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Our lives, our dreams, our future does not belong to us,

156
0:08:35.38,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it belongs to our parents and their community.

157
0:08:38.66,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I found endless stories of young people

158
0:08:42.7,000 --> 0:08:44,000
who are lost to all of us,

159
0:08:45.619,000 --> 0:08:46,000
who are invisible to all of us

160
0:08:47.379,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but who are suffering, and they are suffering alone.

161
0:08:51.34,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Kids we are losing to forced marriages, to honor-based violence and abuse.

162
0:08:57.1,000 --> 0:09:,000
Eventually, I realized after several years of working with these young people,

163
0:09:00.82,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that I will not be able to keep running.

164
0:09:02.86,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I can't spend the rest of my life being scared and hiding

165
0:09:07.54,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and that I'm actually going to have to do something.

166
0:09:11.46,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I also realized that my silence, our silence,

167
0:09:14.58,000 --> 0:09:16,000
allows abuse like this to continue.

168
0:09:17.82,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So I decided that I wanted to put my childhood superpower to some use

169
0:09:22.34,000 --> 0:09:26,000
by trying to make people on the different sides of these issues understand

170
0:09:27.06,000 --> 0:09:32,000
what it's like to be a young person stuck between your family and your country.

171
0:09:32.78,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So I started making films, and I started telling these stories.

172
0:09:36.7,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And I also wanted people to understand the deadly consequences of us

173
0:09:41.14,000 --> 0:09:43,000
not taking these problems seriously.

174
0:09:43.82,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So the first film I made was about Banaz.

175
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
She was a 17-year-old Kurdish girl in London.

176
0:09:51.34,000 --> 0:09:53,000
She was obedient, she did whatever her parents wanted.

177
0:09:54.66,000 --> 0:09:56,000
She tried to do everything right.

178
0:09:57.1,000 --> 0:09:59,000
She married some guy that her parents chose for her,

179
0:09:59.74,000 --> 0:10:01,000
even though he beat and raped her constantly.

180
0:10:03.7,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And when she tried to go to her family for help, they said,

181
0:10:06.54,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"Well, you got to go back and be a better wife."

182
0:10:08.82,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Because they didn't want a divorced daughter on their hands

183
0:10:11.66,000 --> 0:10:13,000
because, of course, that would bring dishonor on the family.

184
0:10:15.5,000 --> 0:10:17,000
She was beaten so badly her ears would bleed,

185
0:10:19.02,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and when she finally left and she found a young man that she chose

186
0:10:24.14,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and she fell in love with,

187
0:10:25.98,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the community and the family found out

188
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and she disappeared.

189
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
She was found three months later.

190
0:10:33.02,000 --> 0:10:37,000
She'd been stuffed into a suitcase and buried underneath the house.

191
0:10:39.86,000 --> 0:10:42,000
She had been strangled, she had been beaten to death

192
0:10:44.58,000 --> 0:10:48,000
by three men, three cousins, on the orders of her father and uncle.

193
0:10:49.78,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The added tragedy of Banaz's story

194
0:10:51.98,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is that she had gone to the police in England five times asking for help,

195
0:10:57.9,000 --> 0:11:,000
telling them that she was going to be killed by her family.

196
0:11:00.98,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The police didn't believe her so they didn't do anything.

197
0:11:04.9,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And the problem with this

198
0:11:06.18,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is that not only are so many of our kids facing these problems

199
0:11:10.58,000 --> 0:11:13,000
within their families and within their families' communities,

200
0:11:13.7,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but they're also meeting misunderstandings

201
0:11:18.46,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and apathy in the countries that they grow up in.

202
0:11:23.46,000 --> 0:11:27,000
When their own families betray them, they look to the rest of us,

203
0:11:28.18,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and when we don't understand,

204
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we lose them.

205
0:11:32.94,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So while I was making this film, several people said to me,

206
0:11:36.14,000 --> 0:11:38,000
"Well, Deeyah, you know, this is just their culture,

207
0:11:38.7,000 --> 0:11:4,000
this is just what those people do to their kids

208
0:11:40.915,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and we can't really interfere."

209
0:11:43.7,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I can assure you being murdered is not my culture.

210
0:11:48.1,000 --> 0:11:49,000
You know?

211
0:11:49.34,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And surely people who look like me,

212
0:11:51.06,000 --> 0:11:53,000
young women who come from backgrounds like me,

213
0:11:53.58,000 --> 0:11:57,000
should be subject to the same rights, the same protections

214
0:11:57.7,000 --> 0:12:,000
as anybody else in our country, why not?

215
0:12:02.18,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So, for my next film, I wanted to try and understand

216
0:12:06.94,000 --> 0:12:08,000
why some of our young Muslim kids in Europe

217
0:12:09.82,000 --> 0:12:11,000
are drawn to extremism and violence.

218
0:12:12.7,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But with that topic,

219
0:12:13.98,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I also recognized that I was going to have to face my worst fear:

220
0:12:18.86,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the brown men with beards.

221
0:12:22.7,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The same men, or similar men,

222
0:12:25.54,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to the ones that have hounded me for most of my life.

223
0:12:29.38,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Men that I've been afraid of most of my life.

224
0:12:32.1,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Men that I've also deeply disliked,

225
0:12:34.98,000 --> 0:12:35,000
for many, many years.

226
0:12:36.98,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So I spent the next two years interviewing convicted terrorists,

227
0:12:40.98,000 --> 0:12:42,000
jihadis and former extremists.

228
0:12:43.5,000 --> 0:12:46,000
What I already knew, what was very obvious already,

229
0:12:46.86,000 --> 0:12:51,000
was that religion, politics, Europe's colonial baggage,

230
0:12:52.06,000 --> 0:12:56,000
also Western foreign policy failures of recent years,

231
0:12:56.34,000 --> 0:12:57,000
were all a part of the picture.

232
0:12:58.34,000 --> 0:13:01,000
But what I was more interested in finding out was what are the human,

233
0:13:01.62,000 --> 0:13:02,000
what are the personal reasons

234
0:13:03.22,000 --> 0:13:07,000
why some of our young people are susceptible to groups like this.

235
0:13:08.82,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And what really surprised me was that I found wounded human beings.

236
0:13:15.58,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Instead of the monsters that I was looking for,

237
0:13:18.06,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that I was hoping to find --

238
0:13:19.46,000 --> 0:13:22,000
quite frankly because it would have been very satisfying --

239
0:13:22.62,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I found broken people.

240
0:13:25.34,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Just like Banaz,

241
0:13:26.86,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I found that these young men were torn apart

242
0:13:30.14,000 --> 0:13:32,000
from trying to bridge the gaps

243
0:13:32.7,000 --> 0:13:35,000
between their families and the countries that they were born in.

244
0:13:37.54,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And what I also learned is that extremist groups, terrorist groups

245
0:13:40.94,000 --> 0:13:43,000
are taking advantage of these feelings of our young people

246
0:13:44.42,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and channeling that -- cynically -- channeling that toward violence.

247
0:13:48.3,000 --> 0:13:49,000
"Come to us," they say.

248
0:13:49.9,000 --> 0:13:51,000
"Reject both sides, your family and your country

249
0:13:52.9,000 --> 0:13:53,000
because they reject you.

250
0:13:54.58,000 --> 0:13:57,000
For your family, their honor is more important than you

251
0:13:57.7,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and for your country,

252
0:13:58.98,000 --> 0:14:03,000
a real Norwegian, Brit or a French person will always be white and never you."

253
0:14:05.86,000 --> 0:14:08,000
They're also promising our young people the things that they crave:

254
0:14:09.34,000 --> 0:14:13,000
significance, heroism, a sense of belonging and purpose,

255
0:14:13.7,000 --> 0:14:15,000
a community that loves and accepts them.

256
0:14:17.02,000 --> 0:14:19,000
They make the powerless feel powerful.

257
0:14:19.98,000 --> 0:14:23,000
The invisible and the silent are finally seen and heard.

258
0:14:26.94,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This is what they're doing for our young people.

259
0:14:29.5,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Why are these groups doing this for our young people and not us?

260
0:14:34.58,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The thing is,

261
0:14:36.18,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I'm not trying to justify

262
0:14:39.54,000 --> 0:14:42,000
or excuse any of the violence.

263
0:14:43.3,000 --> 0:14:46,000
What I am trying to say is that we have to understand

264
0:14:46.9,000 --> 0:14:49,000
why some of our young people are attracted to this.

265
0:14:51.5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I would like to also show you, actually --

266
0:14:53.86,000 --> 0:14:56,000
these are childhood photos of some of the guys in the film.

267
0:14:59.06,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What really struck me is that so many of them --

268
0:15:02.78,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I never would have thought this --

269
0:15:04.46,000 --> 0:15:07,000
but so many of them have absent or abusive fathers.

270
0:15:08.62,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And several of these young guys

271
0:15:10.58,000 --> 0:15:14,000
ended up finding caring and compassionate father figures

272
0:15:14.74,000 --> 0:15:15,000
within these extremist groups.

273
0:15:17.74,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I also found men brutalized by racist violence,

274
0:15:21.62,000 --> 0:15:23,000
but who found a way to stop feeling like victims

275
0:15:23.9,000 --> 0:15:24,000
by becoming violent themselves.

276
0:15:25.42,000 --> 0:15:3,000
In fact, I found something, to my horror, that I recognized.

277
0:15:30.74,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I found the same feelings that I felt as a 17-year-old as I fled from Norway.

278
0:15:37.98,000 --> 0:15:4,000
The same confusion, the same sorrow,

279
0:15:41.38,000 --> 0:15:44,000
the same feeling of being betrayed

280
0:15:46.58,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and not belonging to anyone.

281
0:15:50.38,000 --> 0:15:53,000
The same feeling of being lost and torn between cultures.

282
0:15:54.58,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Having said that, I did not choose destruction,

283
0:15:57.14,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I chose to pick up a camera instead of a gun.

284
0:15:59.9,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And the reason I did that is because of my superpower.

285
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I could see that understanding is the answer, instead of violence.

286
0:16:08.18,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Seeing human beings

287
0:16:09.9,000 --> 0:16:12,000
with all their virtues and all their flaws

288
0:16:13.66,000 --> 0:16:14,000
instead of continuing the caricatures:

289
0:16:15.54,000 --> 0:16:17,000
the us and them, the villains and victims.

290
0:16:18.22,000 --> 0:16:2,000
I'd also finally come to terms with the fact

291
0:16:20.34,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that my two cultures didn't have to be on a collision course

292
0:16:24.02,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but instead became a space where I found my own voice.

293
0:16:27.66,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I stopped feeling like I had to pick a side,

294
0:16:30.42,000 --> 0:16:32,000
but this took me many, many years.

295
0:16:33.46,000 --> 0:16:35,000
There are so many of our young people today

296
0:16:35.5,000 --> 0:16:37,000
who are struggling with these same issues,

297
0:16:37.54,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and they're struggling with this alone.

298
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And this leaves them open like wounds.

299
0:16:44.38,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And for some, the worldview of radical Islam

300
0:16:47.46,000 --> 0:16:5,000
becomes the infection that festers in these open wounds.

301
0:16:52.98,000 --> 0:16:55,000
There's an African proverb that says,

302
0:16:57.78,000 --> 0:17:,000
"If the young are not initiated into the village,

303
0:17:00.82,000 --> 0:17:02,000
they will burn it down just to feel its warmth."

304
0:17:05.06,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I would like to ask --

305
0:17:07.46,000 --> 0:17:09,000
to Muslim parents and Muslim communities,

306
0:17:10.02,000 --> 0:17:12,000
will you love and care for your children

307
0:17:12.46,000 --> 0:17:14,000
without forcing them to meet your expectations?

308
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Can you choose them instead of your honor?

309
0:17:18.22,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Can you understand why they're so angry and alienated

310
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
when you put your honor before their happiness?

311
0:17:24.34,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Can you try to be a friend to your child

312
0:17:26.939,000 --> 0:17:27,000
so that they can trust you

313
0:17:28.74,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and want to share with you their experiences,

314
0:17:31.06,000 --> 0:17:33,000
rather than having to seek it somewhere else?

315
0:17:34.179,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And to our young people tempted by extremism,

316
0:17:38.5,000 --> 0:17:41,000
can you acknowledge that your rage is fueled by pain?

317
0:17:43.46,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Will you find the strength to resist those cynical old men

318
0:17:46.9,000 --> 0:17:49,000
who want to use your blood for their own profits?

319
0:17:50.86,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Can you find a way to live?

320
0:17:53.7,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Can you see that the sweetest revenge

321
0:17:55.98,000 --> 0:17:58,000
is for you to live a happy, full and free life?

322
0:17:59.46,000 --> 0:18:01,000
A life defined by you and nobody else.

323
0:18:02.38,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Why do you want to become just another dead Muslim kid?

324
0:18:06.9,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And for the rest of us, when will we start listening to our young people?

325
0:18:12.34,000 --> 0:18:13,000
How can we support them

326
0:18:13.62,000 --> 0:18:16,000
in redirecting their pain into something more constructive?

327
0:18:18.58,000 --> 0:18:19,000
They think we don't like them.

328
0:18:20.06,000 --> 0:18:22,000
They think we don't care what happens to them.

329
0:18:22.86,000 --> 0:18:23,000
They think we don't accept them.

330
0:18:24.66,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Can we find a way to make them feel differently?

331
0:18:29.1,000 --> 0:18:31,000
What will it take for us to see them and notice them

332
0:18:32.06,000 --> 0:18:36,000
before they become either the victims or the perpetrators of violence?

333
0:18:37.02,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Can we make ourselves care about them and consider them to be our own?

334
0:18:40.62,000 --> 0:18:44,000
And not just be outraged when the victims of violence look like ourselves?

335
0:18:45.5,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Can we find a way to reject hatred and heal the divisions between us?

336
0:18:50.54,000 --> 0:18:53,000
The thing is we cannot afford to give up on each other or on our kids,

337
0:18:54.54,000 --> 0:18:56,000
even if they've given up on us.

338
0:18:56.7,000 --> 0:18:58,000
We are all in this together.

339
0:18:58.9,000 --> 0:19:03,000
And in the long term, revenge and violence will not work against extremists.

340
0:19:05.3,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Terrorists want us to huddle in our houses in fear,

341
0:19:09.1,000 --> 0:19:11,000
closing our doors and our hearts.

342
0:19:11.3,000 --> 0:19:14,000
They want us to tear open more wounds in our societies

343
0:19:15.14,000 --> 0:19:18,000
so that they can use them to spread their infection more widely.

344
0:19:18.7,000 --> 0:19:2,000
They want us to become like them:

345
0:19:21.42,000 --> 0:19:23,000
intolerant, hateful and cruel.

346
0:19:26.02,000 --> 0:19:28,000
The day after the Paris attacks,

347
0:19:28.5,000 --> 0:19:31,000
a friend of mine sent this photo of her daughter.

348
0:19:32.62,000 --> 0:19:34,000
This is a white girl and an Arab girl.

349
0:19:35.1,000 --> 0:19:36,000
They're best friends.

350
0:19:36.94,000 --> 0:19:39,000
This image is the kryptonite for extremists.

351
0:19:43.06,000 --> 0:19:46,000
These two little girls with their superpowers

352
0:19:46.14,000 --> 0:19:47,000
are showing the way forward

353
0:19:47.66,000 --> 0:19:5,000
towards a society that we need to build together,

354
0:19:51.94,000 --> 0:19:54,000
a society that includes and supports,

355
0:19:56.3,000 --> 0:19:58,000
rather than rejects our kids.

356
0:19:59.78,000 --> 0:20:,000
Thank you for listening.

357
0:20:01.14,000 --> 0:20:07,000
(Applause)

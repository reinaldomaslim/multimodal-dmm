1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to come and speak to you today

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about what I consider to be

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the biggest stunt on Earth.

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Or perhaps not quite on Earth.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
A parachute jump from the very edge of space.

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
More about that a bit later on.

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
What I'd like to do first is take you through

9
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
a very brief helicopter ride of stunts

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the stunts industry in the movies and in television,

11
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and show you how technology

12
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
has started to interface with the physical skills

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of the stunt performer

14
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in a way that makes the stunts bigger

15
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before.

16
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
I've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.

17
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts

18
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I often design them.

19
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
During that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.

20
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's critical now that when a car crash happens

21
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew.

22
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men.

23
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or any passerby. So, safety is everything.

25
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But it wasn't always that way.

26
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
In the old days of the silent movies --

27
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands --

28
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.

29
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They had no safety, no real technology.

30
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
What safety they had was very scant.

31
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is the first stunt woman,

32
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Rosie Venger, an amazing woman.

33
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You can see from the slide, very very strong.

34
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
She really paved the way

35
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
at a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.

36
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.

37
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.

38
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see

39
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.

40
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is a screen capture from "Stagecoach,"

41
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen.

42
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
There is no safety, no back support,

43
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
no pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.

44
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly.

45
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,

46
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.

47
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We couldn't do them without technology.

48
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
These are particularly dangerous

49
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because there is no mask on my face.

50
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,

51
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
one for FHM magazine.

52
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Highly dangerous, but also you'll notice

53
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.

54
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,

55
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
have been replaced with modern materials

56
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
like Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex --

57
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals

58
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.

59
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Here's a bit more.

60
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.

61
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
One of the things that a stuntman often does,

62
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and you'll see it every time in the big movies,

63
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is be blown through the air.

64
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.

65
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,

66
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and hopefully you make it look good.

67
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.

68
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,

69
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because it will break your legs very, very quickly

70
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
if you land on it wrong.

71
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.

72
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And that's in the up position. When you step on it,

73
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,

74
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,

75
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
anything from five feet to 30 feet.

76
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.

77
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Which I'm sure you wouldn't want.

78
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Not today.

79
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Car stunts are another area

80
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
where technology and engineering

81
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
advances have made life easier for us, and safer.

82
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.

83
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Being run over is never easy.

84
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
That's an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.

85
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane --

86
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the materials that help us, when we're hit like this,

87
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
not to hurt ourselves too much.

88
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The picture in the bottom right-hand corner there

89
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is of some crash test dummy work that I was doing.

90
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Showing how stunts work in different areas, really.

91
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And testing breakaway signpost pillars.

92
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,

93
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.

94
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The car on the left drove into the steel pillar.

95
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And you can't see it from there, but the engine was in the driver's lap.

96
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They did it by remote control.

97
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed,

98
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and clearly walked away from it.

99
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology.

100
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes.

101
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.

102
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
You can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floor

103
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
by the wheel of the other car.

104
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
That's the piston that was fired out of the floor.

105
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything over

106
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with a nitrogen cannon with enough power. (Laughs)

107
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
It's a great job, really. (Laughter)

108
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's such fun!

109
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You should hear

110
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
some of the phone conversations that I have with people

111
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
on my Bluetooth in the shop.

112
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames,

113
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and how about someone, you know, big explosion."

114
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And people are looking like this ...

115
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughs)

116
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are.

117
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The next thing that I'd like to show you is something that

118
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Dunlop asked me to do earlier this year

119
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with our Channel Five's "Fifth Gear Show."

120
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
A loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.

121
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Only one person had ever done it before.

122
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,

123
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
"Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.

124
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor."

125
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Well, you'd die if you did that.

126
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We went to Cambridge University, the other university,

127
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there,

128
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.

129
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Even then, I caught seven G

130
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.

131
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.

132
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So again, science helps us, and with the engineering too --

133
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the modifications to the car and the wheel.

134
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
High falls, they're old fashioned stunts.

135
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What's interesting about high falls

136
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is that although we use airbags,

137
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and some airbags are quite advanced,

138
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to,

139
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
if you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition.

140
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.

141
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's a bouncy castle

142
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
with slats in the side to allow the air to escape.

143
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
That's all it is, a bouncy castle.

144
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.

145
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.

146
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.

147
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective.

148
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
They're great for catching you, up to certain heights.

149
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And on the other side of the fence,

150
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that physical art, the physical performance of the stuntman,

151
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
has interfaced with the very highest

152
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
technology in I.T. and in software.

153
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Not the cardboard box, but the green screen.

154
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.

155
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Two stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt.

156
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.

157
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it,

158
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
moving or still,

159
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint.

160
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing.

161
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Completely in the safety of a studio,

162
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took,

163
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.

164
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Decelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.

165
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We fly people on wires, like this.

166
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite,

167
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
or moved around like a kite.

168
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And this is a Guinness World Record attempt.

169
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in 2004.

170
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters,

171
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and stop within a couple of feet of the ground

172
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
without melting the rope with the friction,

173
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because of the alloys I used in the descender device.

174
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And that's Centre Point in London.

175
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill.

176
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Helicopter stunts are always fun,

177
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
hanging out of them, whatever.

178
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.

179
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today:

180
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Project Space Jump.

181
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force

182
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
did the most spectacular thing.

183
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,

184
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and he did it to test high altitude systems

185
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
for military pilots

186
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.

187
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And I'd just like to show you a little footage

188
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of what he did back then.

189
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.

190
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Project Excelsior, it was called.

191
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
There were three jumps.

192
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They first dropped some dummies.

193
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So that's the balloon, big gas balloon.

194
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's that shape because the helium has to expand.

195
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
My balloon will expand to 500 times

196
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.

197
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,

198
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and there is the camera that's strapped to them.

199
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.

200
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet,

201
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
which is about 22 miles.

202
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You're in a near vacuum in that environment,

203
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
which is in minus 50 degrees.

204
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So it's an extremely hostile place to be.

205
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is Joe Kittenger himself.

206
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Bear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.

207
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.

208
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.

209
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
He's a very humble and wonderful human being.

210
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
He sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the ground

211
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I wish you all the best." And he signed it, "Happy landings,"

212
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
which I thought was quite lovely.

213
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
He's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy.

214
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This is him in a pressure suit.

215
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is

216
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? --

217
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.

218
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,

219
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
you need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.

220
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there,

221
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
pushing him in, those turned up jeans.

222
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You need a pressure suit.

223
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
You need a pressure breathing system

224
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
with a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe in

225
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and helps you to exhale.

226
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.

227
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.

228
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Not even a jet engine.

229
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things,

230
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
a great big gas balloon.

231
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It took me a while; it took me years to find the right balloon team

232
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to build the balloon that would do this job.

233
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I've found that team in America now.

234
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin.

235
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps,

236
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and two balloons for the main jump, because they

237
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
notoriously tear on takeoff.

238
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
They're just so, so delicate.

239
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is the step off. He's written on that thing,

240
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"The highest step in the world."

241
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And what must that feel like?

242
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'm excited and I'm scared,

243
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
both at the same time in equal measures.

244
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled

245
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.

246
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.

247
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You can just see them there, popping open.

248
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them.

249
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I did quite a lot of research.

250
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor.

251
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon,

252
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the little black dots are people.

253
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.

254
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
That's in New Mexico.

255
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.

256
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.

257
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
My gondola will be more simple than that.

258
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's a three sided box, basically.

259
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So I've had to do quite a lot of training.

260
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains,

261
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
training in preparation for some high altitude jumps.

262
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
This is what the view is going to be like

263
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
at 90,000 feet for me.

264
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now you may think this is just

265
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
a thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride,

266
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
just the world's biggest stunt.

267
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Well there's a little bit more to it than that.

268
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Trying to find a space suit to do this

269
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
has led me to an area of technology

270
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
that I never really expected when I set about doing this.

271
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I contacted a company in the States

272
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
who make suits for NASA.

273
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer.

274
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.

275
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it.

276
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So I've been stuck. For the past 15 years I've been trying to find a space suit

277
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that would do this job, or someone that will make one.

278
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Something revolutionary happened

279
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
a little while ago, at the same facility.

280
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
That's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one,

281
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world.

282
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It was made by a Russian that's designed

283
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
most of the suits of the past

284
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
18 years for the Soviets.

285
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
He left the company because he saw,

286
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
as some other people in the space suit industry,

287
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
an emerging market for space suits for space tourists.

288
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet

289
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.

290
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
If you're at 100,000 feet you die.

291
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead.

292
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization.

293
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The body swells up. It's awful.

294
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And so we expect -- it's not much fun.

295
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We expect, and others expect,

296
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that perhaps the FAA, the CAA

297
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
might say, "You need to put someone in a suit

298
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft."

299
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.

300
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And then if the cabin depressurizes

301
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
while the aircraft is coming back down,

302
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay.

303
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I would like to bring Costa on, if he's here,

304
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to show you the only one of its kind in the world.

305
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I was going to wear it,

306
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.

307
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.

308
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This is the communication headset you'll see

309
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
on lots of space suits.

310
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers.

311
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.

312
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.

313
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.

314
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Would you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa?

315
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Thank you very much.

316
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And it doesn't look far different when it's inflated,

317
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
as you can see from the picture down there.

318
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel,

319
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety,

320
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.

321
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Applause)

322
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me.

323
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The status of my mission at the moment

324
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
is it still needs a major sponsor.

325
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I'm confident that we'll find one.

326
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I think it's a great challenge.

327
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And I hope that you will agree with me,

328
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
it is the greatest stunt on Earth.

329
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Thank you very much for your time.

330
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Applause)

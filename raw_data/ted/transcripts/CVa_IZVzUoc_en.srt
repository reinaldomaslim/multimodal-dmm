1
0:00:13.037,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Two twin domes,

2
0:00:15.708,000 --> 0:00:18,000
two radically opposed design cultures.

3
0:00:19.709,000 --> 0:00:22,000
One is made of thousands of steel parts,

4
0:00:22.773,000 --> 0:00:24,000
the other of a single silk thread.

5
0:00:26.035,000 --> 0:00:28,000
One is synthetic, the other organic.

6
0:00:28.936,000 --> 0:00:3,000
One is imposed on the environment,

7
0:00:31.237,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the other creates it.

8
0:00:33.666,000 --> 0:00:36,000
One is designed for nature, the other is designed by her.

9
0:00:38.032,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble,

10
0:00:40.949,000 --> 0:00:42,000
he saw a figure struggling to be free.

11
0:00:43.425,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.

12
0:00:49.261,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But living things are not chiseled.

13
0:00:51.999,000 --> 0:00:52,000
They grow.

14
0:00:53.999,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information

15
0:00:59.489,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that's required for every other cell to function and to replicate.

16
0:01:06.155,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Tools also have consequences.

17
0:01:08.922,000 --> 0:01:12,000
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated

18
0:01:13.556,000 --> 0:01:15,000
by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production.

19
0:01:16.703,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts,

20
0:01:19.999,000 --> 0:01:21,000
framing the imagination of designers and architects

21
0:01:22.615,000 --> 0:01:25,000
who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies

22
0:01:25.743,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of discrete parts with distinct functions.

23
0:01:30.165,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But you don't find homogenous material assemblies in nature.

24
0:01:35.434,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Take human skin, for example.

25
0:01:38.054,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Our facial skins are thin with large pores.

26
0:01:41.999,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Our back skins are thicker, with small pores.

27
0:01:45.559,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One acts mainly as filter,

28
0:01:48.201,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the other mainly as barrier,

29
0:01:49.989,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and yet it's the same skin: no parts, no assemblies.

30
0:01:54.281,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's a system that gradually varies its functionality

31
0:01:57.67,000 --> 0:01:58,000
by varying elasticity.

32
0:01:59.835,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So here this is a split screen to represent my split world view,

33
0:02:03.801,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the split personality of every designer and architect operating today

34
0:02:08.229,000 --> 0:02:1,000
between the chisel and the gene,

35
0:02:10.572,000 --> 0:02:14,000
between machine and organism, between assembly and growth,

36
0:02:15.434,000 --> 0:02:17,000
between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.

37
0:02:18.734,000 --> 0:02:21,000
These two worldviews, my left brain and right brain,

38
0:02:21.76,000 --> 0:02:27,000
analysis and synthesis, will play out on the two screens behind me.

39
0:02:29.754,000 --> 0:02:31,000
My work, at its simplest level,

40
0:02:32.224,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is about uniting these two worldviews,

41
0:02:34.983,000 --> 0:02:36,000
moving away from assembly

42
0:02:37.221,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and closer into growth.

43
0:02:41.099,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You're probably asking yourselves:

44
0:02:43.235,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Why now?

45
0:02:44.766,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago?

46
0:02:50.451,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We live in a very special time in history,

47
0:02:52.603,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a rare time,

48
0:02:54.699,000 --> 0:02:58,000
a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools

49
0:02:59.302,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we've never had access to before.

50
0:03:02.205,000 --> 0:03:04,000
These fields are computational design,

51
0:03:05.093,000 --> 0:03:1,000
allowing us to design complex forms with simple code;

52
0:03:10.125,000 --> 0:03:14,000
additive manufacturing, letting us produce parts

53
0:03:14.183,000 --> 0:03:17,000
by adding material rather than carving it out;

54
0:03:17.833,000 --> 0:03:2,000
materials engineering, which lets us design the behavior of materials

55
0:03:21.301,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in high resolution;

56
0:03:23.042,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and synthetic biology,

57
0:03:24.923,000 --> 0:03:28,000
enabling us to design new biological functionality by editing DNA.

58
0:03:29.491,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And at the intersection of these four fields,

59
0:03:31.755,000 --> 0:03:32,000
my team and I create.

60
0:03:33.492,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Please meet the minds and hands

61
0:03:35.921,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of my students.

62
0:03:39.772,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We design objects and products and structures and tools across scales,

63
0:03:45.457,000 --> 0:03:46,000
from the large-scale,

64
0:03:47.252,000 --> 0:03:5,000
like this robotic arm with an 80-foot diameter reach

65
0:03:50.792,000 --> 0:03:54,000
with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings,

66
0:03:54.95,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms

67
0:03:59.061,000 --> 0:04:,000
that glow in the dark.

68
0:04:01.261,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya,

69
0:04:03.469,000 --> 0:04:06,000
an archetype of ancient Arabic architecture,

70
0:04:06.866,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized

71
0:04:10.454,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to shape the form of light and heat moving through it.

72
0:04:14.999,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In our next project,

73
0:04:16.739,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt --

74
0:04:19.973,000 --> 0:04:22,000
this was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen --

75
0:04:23.187,000 --> 0:04:25,000
like a second skin that are made of a single part,

76
0:04:25.999,000 --> 0:04:28,000
stiff at the contours, flexible around the waist.

77
0:04:29.589,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Together with my long-term 3D printing collaborator Stratasys,

78
0:04:33.813,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we 3D-printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells,

79
0:04:38.844,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I'll show more objects like it.

80
0:04:41.452,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This helmet combines stiff and soft materials

81
0:04:44.889,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in 20-micron resolution.

82
0:04:48.025,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This is the resolution of a human hair.

83
0:04:50.437,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It's also the resolution of a CT scanner.

84
0:04:53.531,000 --> 0:04:54,000
That designers have access

85
0:04:55.096,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to such high-resolution analytic and synthetic tools,

86
0:04:59.518,000 --> 0:05:03,000
enables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies,

87
0:05:04.104,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but also the physiological makeup of our tissues.

88
0:05:08.445,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Next, we designed an acoustic chair,

89
0:05:10.477,000 --> 0:05:13,000
a chair that would be at once structural, comfortable

90
0:05:13.713,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and would also absorb sound.

91
0:05:16.529,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Professor Carter, my collaborator, and I turned to nature for inspiration,

92
0:05:20.999,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and by designing this irregular surface pattern,

93
0:05:23.708,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it becomes sound-absorbent.

94
0:05:26.659,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We printed its surface out of 44 different properties,

95
0:05:30.583,000 --> 0:05:33,000
varying in rigidity, opacity and color,

96
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
corresponding to pressure points on the human body.

97
0:05:38.023,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Its surface, as in nature, varies its functionality

98
0:05:42.039,000 --> 0:05:45,000
not by adding another material or another assembly,

99
0:05:45.69,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but by continuously and delicately varying material property.

100
0:05:52.496,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But is nature ideal?

101
0:05:56.146,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Are there no parts in nature?

102
0:06:01.185,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home,

103
0:06:04.48,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but when I was young,

104
0:06:05.66,000 --> 0:06:08,000
my grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible,

105
0:06:09.081,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about.

106
0:06:13.11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
As she recounts:

107
0:06:15.142,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"On the third day of Creation, God commands the Earth

108
0:06:18.109,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree."

109
0:06:20.649,000 --> 0:06:23,000
For this first fruit tree, there was to be no differentiation

110
0:06:23.9,000 --> 0:06:27,000
between trunk, branches, leaves and fruit.

111
0:06:28.294,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The whole tree was a fruit.

112
0:06:32.229,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Instead, the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers.

113
0:06:38.337,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The land created a world made of parts.

114
0:06:42.514,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I often ask myself,

115
0:06:44.396,000 --> 0:06:48,000
"What would design be like if objects were made of a single part?

116
0:06:49.412,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Would we return to a better state of creation?"

117
0:06:54.999,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So we looked for that biblical material,

118
0:06:56.978,000 --> 0:07:,000
that fruit-bearing fruit tree kind of material, and we found it.

119
0:07:03.494,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The second-most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin,

120
0:07:07.274,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year

121
0:07:10.999,000 --> 0:07:13,000
by organisms such as shrimps, crabs, scorpions and butterflies.

122
0:07:15.259,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We thought if we could tune its properties,

123
0:07:17.999,000 --> 0:07:19,000
we could generate structures that are multifunctional

124
0:07:20.651,000 --> 0:07:21,000
out of a single part.

125
0:07:22.235,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So that's what we did.

126
0:07:24.999,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We called Legal Seafood --

127
0:07:27.016,000 --> 0:07:28,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:28.076,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,

129
0:07:30.957,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste.

130
0:07:34.583,000 --> 0:07:35,000
By varying chemical concentrations,

131
0:07:36.571,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we were able to achieve a wide array of properties --

132
0:07:39.889,000 --> 0:07:4,000
from dark, stiff and opaque,

133
0:07:41.69,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to light, soft and transparent.

134
0:07:44.689,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In order to print the structures in large scale,

135
0:07:47.653,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles.

136
0:07:52.39,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The robot would vary material properties on the fly

137
0:07:55.572,000 --> 0:08:,000
and create these 12-foot-long structures made of a single material,

138
0:08:00.699,000 --> 0:08:02,000
100 percent recyclable.

139
0:08:03.465,000 --> 0:08:05,000
When the parts are ready, they're left to dry

140
0:08:06.163,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and find a form naturally upon contact with air.

141
0:08:10.313,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So why are we still designing with plastics?

142
0:08:15.999,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process

143
0:08:19.486,000 --> 0:08:21,000
were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms

144
0:08:22.386,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that first appeared on our planet 3.5 billion year ago,

145
0:08:25.283,000 --> 0:08:26,000
as we learned yesterday.

146
0:08:27.999,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT,

147
0:08:30.61,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered

148
0:08:33.387,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere

149
0:08:36.553,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and convert it into sugar.

150
0:08:39.449,000 --> 0:08:4,000
For the first time,

151
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition

152
0:08:45.25,000 --> 0:08:48,000
from beam to mesh,

153
0:08:48.608,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and if scaled even larger, to windows.

154
0:08:52.019,000 --> 0:08:53,000
A fruit-bearing fruit tree.

155
0:08:54.626,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Working with an ancient material,

156
0:08:57.336,000 --> 0:08:59,000
one of the first lifeforms on the planet,

157
0:08:59.999,000 --> 0:09:02,000
plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology,

158
0:09:03.999,000 --> 0:09:06,000
we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells

159
0:09:07.53,000 --> 0:09:1,000
into an architecture that behaves like a tree.

160
0:09:11.724,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And here's the best part:

161
0:09:14.049,000 --> 0:09:15,000
for objects designed to biodegrade,

162
0:09:16.02,000 --> 0:09:18,000
put them in the sea, and they will nourish marine life;

163
0:09:19.74,000 --> 0:09:22,000
place them in soil, and they will help grow a tree.

164
0:09:24.415,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles

165
0:09:28.456,000 --> 0:09:29,000
was the solar system.

166
0:09:30.693,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We looked for the possibility of creating life-sustaining clothing

167
0:09:34.999,000 --> 0:09:36,000
for interplanetary voyages.

168
0:09:38.707,000 --> 0:09:43,000
To do that, we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow.

169
0:09:43.769,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So like the periodic table, we came up with our own table of the elements:

170
0:09:48.353,000 --> 0:09:51,000
new lifeforms that were computationally grown,

171
0:09:51.766,000 --> 0:09:53,000
additively manufactured

172
0:09:53.831,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and biologically augmented.

173
0:09:58.096,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy,

174
0:10:01.645,000 --> 0:10:03,000
only instead of transmuting precious metals,

175
0:10:04.408,000 --> 0:10:07,000
you're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels.

176
0:10:08.171,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's called microfluidics.

177
0:10:11.067,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We 3D-printed our own channels in order to control the flow

178
0:10:15.266,000 --> 0:10:17,000
of these liquid bacterial cultures.

179
0:10:19.432,000 --> 0:10:23,000
In our first piece of clothing, we combined two microorganisms.

180
0:10:23.457,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The first is cyanobacteria.

181
0:10:25.392,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds.

182
0:10:28.392,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And the second, E. coli, the bacterium that inhabits the human gut.

183
0:10:32.862,000 --> 0:10:35,000
One converts light into sugar, the other consumes that sugar

184
0:10:36.459,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and produces biofuels useful for the built environment.

185
0:10:39.832,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Now, these two microorganisms never interact in nature.

186
0:10:44.343,000 --> 0:10:45,000
In fact, they never met each other.

187
0:10:46.225,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They've been here, engineered for the first time,

188
0:10:49.428,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to have a relationship inside a piece of clothing.

189
0:10:53.34,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Think of it as evolution not by natural selection,

190
0:10:56.999,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but evolution by design.

191
0:10:59.515,000 --> 0:11:01,000
In order to contain these relationships,

192
0:11:01.738,000 --> 0:11:05,000
we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract,

193
0:11:05.867,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way.

194
0:11:10.822,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We then started growing these channels on the human body,

195
0:11:14.475,000 --> 0:11:17,000
varying material properties according to the desired functionality.

196
0:11:17.828,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Where we wanted more photosynthesis, we would design more transparent channels.

197
0:11:23.101,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This wearable digestive system, when it's stretched end to end,

198
0:11:28.229,000 --> 0:11:3,000
spans 60 meters.

199
0:11:30.317,000 --> 0:11:32,000
This is half the length of a football field,

200
0:11:32.999,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and 10 times as long as our small intestines.

201
0:11:37.612,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED --

202
0:11:40.344,000 --> 0:11:42,000
our first photosynthetic wearable,

203
0:11:42.471,000 --> 0:11:45,000
liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing.

204
0:11:46.694,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Applause)

205
0:11:47.846,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Thank you.

206
0:11:51.871,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Mary Shelley said, "We are unfashioned creatures, but only half made up."

207
0:11:55.871,000 --> 0:11:58,000
What if design could provide that other half?

208
0:11:59.776,000 --> 0:12:03,000
What if we could create structures that would augment living matter?

209
0:12:06.035,000 --> 0:12:09,000
What if we could create personal microbiomes

210
0:12:09.492,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that would scan our skins, repair damaged tissue

211
0:12:13.391,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and sustain our bodies?

212
0:12:16.062,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Think of this as a form of edited biology.

213
0:12:18.999,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This entire collection, Wanderers, that was named after planets,

214
0:12:22.999,000 --> 0:12:24,000
was not to me really about fashion per se,

215
0:12:25.681,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future

216
0:12:29.064,000 --> 0:12:31,000
of our race on our planet and beyond,

217
0:12:31.71,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery

218
0:12:35.465,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and to move away from the age of the machine

219
0:12:38.81,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies,

220
0:12:42.31,000 --> 0:12:44,000
the microorganisms that we inhabit,

221
0:12:44.773,000 --> 0:12:45,000
our products and even our buildings.

222
0:12:46.725,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I call this material ecology.

223
0:12:49.591,000 --> 0:12:53,000
To do this, we always need to return back to nature.

224
0:12:54.999,000 --> 0:12:57,000
By now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.

225
0:12:59.759,000 --> 0:13:,000
You also know that nature doesn't.

226
0:13:02.182,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It grows. It adds with sophistication.

227
0:13:06.102,000 --> 0:13:08,000
This silkworm cocoon, for example,

228
0:13:08.69,000 --> 0:13:11,000
creates a highly sophisticated architecture,

229
0:13:12.034,000 --> 0:13:14,000
a home inside which to metamorphisize.

230
0:13:14.859,000 --> 0:13:19,000
No additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication.

231
0:13:20.535,000 --> 0:13:23,000
It does so by combining not two materials,

232
0:13:23.631,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but two proteins in different concentrations.

233
0:13:27.487,000 --> 0:13:3,000
One acts as the structure, the other is the glue, or the matrix,

234
0:13:31.507,000 --> 0:13:33,000
holding those fibers together.

235
0:13:33.952,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And this happens across scales.

236
0:13:36.717,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment --

237
0:13:39.473,000 --> 0:13:41,000
it creates a tensile structure --

238
0:13:41.513,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon.

239
0:13:44.999,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Tension and compression, the two forces of life,

240
0:13:48.554,000 --> 0:13:51,000
manifested in a single material.

241
0:13:53.337,000 --> 0:13:56,000
In order to better understand how this complex process works,

242
0:13:56.572,000 --> 0:13:58,000
we glued a tiny earth magnet

243
0:13:58.783,000 --> 0:14:,000
to the head of a silkworm, to the spinneret.

244
0:14:01.806,000 --> 0:14:03,000
We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors,

245
0:14:04.778,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud

246
0:14:07.889,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon.

247
0:14:13.736,000 --> 0:14:16,000
However, when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch,

248
0:14:17.414,000 --> 0:14:18,000
not inside a box,

249
0:14:19.176,000 --> 0:14:22,000
we realized it would spin a flat cocoon

250
0:14:22.391,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and it would still healthily metamorphisize.

251
0:14:25.781,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolds,

252
0:14:29.79,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and we discovered that the shape, the composition,

253
0:14:32.549,000 --> 0:14:35,000
the structure of the cocoon, was directly informed by the environment.

254
0:14:36.866,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons,

255
0:14:41.243,000 --> 0:14:44,000
their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry.

256
0:14:44.933,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk

257
0:14:51.416,000 --> 0:14:54,000
without boiling a single cocoon.

258
0:14:54.95,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Applause)

259
0:14:58.217,000 --> 0:15:,000
They would healthily metamorphisize,

260
0:15:00.963,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and we would be able to create these things.

261
0:15:03.517,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So we scaled this process up to architectural scale.

262
0:15:07.17,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We had a robot spin the template out of silk,

263
0:15:10.325,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and we placed it on our site.

264
0:15:12.489,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas,

265
0:15:17.397,000 --> 0:15:2,000
so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution

266
0:15:20.741,000 --> 0:15:22,000
of light and heat on our structure.

267
0:15:23.692,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We then created holes, or apertures,

268
0:15:26.226,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that would lock in the rays of light and heat,

269
0:15:29.999,000 --> 0:15:32,000
distributing those silkworms on the structure.

270
0:15:34.777,000 --> 0:15:36,000
We were ready to receive the caterpillars.

271
0:15:37.174,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We ordered 6,500 silkworms from an online silk farm.

272
0:15:42.031,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And after four weeks of feeding, they were ready to spin with us.

273
0:15:45.983,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold,

274
0:15:49.539,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and as they spin they pupate, they mate, they lay eggs,

275
0:15:53.999,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and life begins all over again -- just like us but much, much shorter.

276
0:16:00.3,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Bucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity,

277
0:16:05.069,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and he was right.

278
0:16:06.716,000 --> 0:16:09,000
As they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk,

279
0:16:10.462,000 --> 0:16:12,000
they give this entire pavilion its integrity.

280
0:16:13.15,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And over two to three weeks,

281
0:16:15.024,000 --> 0:16:19,000
6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.

282
0:16:19.703,000 --> 0:16:22,000
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the Silk Road.

283
0:16:24.837,000 --> 0:16:27,000
The moths, after they hatch, produce 1.5 million eggs.

284
0:16:28.716,000 --> 0:16:32,000
This could be used for 250 additional pavilions for the future.

285
0:16:33.639,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So here they are, the two worldviews.

286
0:16:36.728,000 --> 0:16:39,000
One spins silk out of a robotic arm,

287
0:16:40.519,000 --> 0:16:42,000
the other fills in the gaps.

288
0:16:44.182,000 --> 0:16:47,000
If the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products

289
0:16:47.987,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and the buildings around us,

290
0:16:49.805,000 --> 0:16:51,000
to form a two-material ecology,

291
0:16:51.999,000 --> 0:16:54,000
then designers must unite these two worldviews.

292
0:16:55.627,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Which brings us back, of course, to the beginning.

293
0:17:00.121,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Here's to a new age of design, a new age of creation,

294
0:17:03.748,000 --> 0:17:06,000
that takes us from a nature-inspired design

295
0:17:07.12,000 --> 0:17:09,000
to a design-inspired nature,

296
0:17:09.999,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and that demands of us for the first time

297
0:17:13.999,000 --> 0:17:17,000
that we mother nature.

298
0:17:18.793,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Thank you.

299
0:17:19.851,000 --> 0:17:25,000
(Applause)

300
0:17:26.871,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

301
0:17:28.999,000 --> 0:17:31,000
(Applause)

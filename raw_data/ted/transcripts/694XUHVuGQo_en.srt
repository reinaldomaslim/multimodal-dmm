0:00:16.235,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti,

3
0:00:20.307,000 --> 0:00:23,000
my former professor of art history, and today

4
0:00:23.637,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.

5
0:00:27.823,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way

6
0:00:31.794,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to

7
0:00:35.582,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci,

8
0:00:38.395,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located

9
0:00:41.022,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.

10
0:00:43.968,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities

11
0:00:47.071,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so

12
0:00:50.998,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I decided, with some researchers from the United States

13
0:00:54.868,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals

14
0:00:59.079,000 --> 0:01:03,000
decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500

15
0:01:03.198,000 --> 0:01:05,000
searching for the lost Leonardo.

16
0:01:05.875,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Unfortunately, at that time we did not know that

17
0:01:09.329,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that was not exactly where we should be looking,

18
0:01:13.671,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research

19
0:01:17.809,000 --> 0:01:21,000
came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000

20
0:01:22.144,000 --> 0:01:26,000
thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.

21
0:01:26.375,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct

22
0:01:29.614,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling,

23
0:01:32.47,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494,

24
0:01:36.275,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and to find out the original doors, windows,

25
0:01:39.155,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model,

26
0:01:43.914,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and then, with thermography, we went on to discover

27
0:01:47.016,000 --> 0:01:5,000
hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall

28
0:01:50.247,000 --> 0:01:53,000
of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height

29
0:01:53.825,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore,

30
0:01:57.138,000 --> 0:01:59,000
all the layout of this original hall

31
0:01:59.786,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the way it was before there came Vasari,

32
0:02:03.341,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and restructured the whole thing,

33
0:02:05.936,000 --> 0:02:08,000
including a staircase that was very important

34
0:02:09.272,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari"

35
0:02:13.411,000 --> 0:02:17,000
on a specific area of one of the two walls.

36
0:02:17.675,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned

37
0:02:20.916,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574

38
0:02:25.404,000 --> 0:02:29,000
by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family,

39
0:02:29.736,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces

40
0:02:33.177,000 --> 0:02:36,000
specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it

41
0:02:36.434,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and leaving a small air gap.

42
0:02:38.799,000 --> 0:02:41,000
One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence,

43
0:02:42.487,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something

44
0:02:45.605,000 --> 0:02:48,000
like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo,

45
0:02:48.991,000 --> 0:02:5,000
since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.

46
0:02:51.476,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas

47
0:02:55.983,000 --> 0:03:,000
just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.

48
0:03:01.211,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall,

49
0:03:06.046,000 --> 0:03:08,000
an air gap, and that's where

50
0:03:08.668,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we believe "The Battle of Anghiari,"

51
0:03:10.218,000 --> 0:03:11,000
or at least the part that we know has been painted,

52
0:03:12.184,000 --> 0:03:15,000
which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.

53
0:03:15.512,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Well, from there, unfortunately,

54
0:03:19.105,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in 2004, the project

55
0:03:21.759,000 --> 0:03:24,000
came to a halt. Many political reasons.

56
0:03:24.906,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I decided to go back to my alma mater,

57
0:03:27.24,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and, at the University of California, San Diego,

58
0:03:29.912,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and I proposed to open up a research center

59
0:03:32.278,000 --> 0:03:34,000
for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.

60
0:03:35.09,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center

61
0:03:39.613,000 --> 0:03:41,000
for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture

62
0:03:42.426,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and archaeology. So students started to flow in,

63
0:03:45.189,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and we started to build technologies, because that's

64
0:03:47.323,000 --> 0:03:49,000
basically what we also needed in order to move forward

65
0:03:49.972,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and go and do fieldwork.

66
0:03:52.732,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011,

67
0:03:57.13,000 --> 0:04:,000
and this time, with a great group of students,

68
0:04:00.761,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester,

69
0:04:03.201,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who is now the director at CISA3, and we

70
0:04:05.903,000 --> 0:04:09,000
came back just since we knew already where to look for

71
0:04:10.076,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to find out if there was still something left.

72
0:04:13.056,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say,

73
0:04:17.189,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for several reasons that it's not worth explaining,

74
0:04:20.186,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had,

75
0:04:23.932,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and with a 4mm camera attached to it,

76
0:04:27.727,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we were successful in documenting and taking

77
0:04:32.516,000 --> 0:04:36,000
some fragments of what it turns out to be

78
0:04:37.32,000 --> 0:04:4,000
a reddish color, black color, and there is some

79
0:04:40.92,000 --> 0:04:43,000
beige fragments that later on

80
0:04:44.317,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we ran a much more sophisticated exams,

81
0:04:47.311,000 --> 0:04:52,000
XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive

82
0:04:52.551,000 --> 0:04:54,000
so far. It seems to indicate that indeed

83
0:04:55.214,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure

84
0:04:58.27,000 --> 0:05:,000
that no other artist has painted on that wall

85
0:05:00.571,000 --> 0:05:03,000
before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well,

86
0:05:04.09,000 --> 0:05:06,000
those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting

87
0:05:06.951,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and most likely to Leonardo.

88
0:05:09.566,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised

89
0:05:14.389,000 --> 0:05:17,000
work of art ever achieved by mankind.

90
0:05:17.63,000 --> 0:05:2,000
As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important

91
0:05:20.835,000 --> 0:05:22,000
commission that Leonardo has ever had,

92
0:05:23.671,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named

93
0:05:28.284,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the number one artist influence at the time.

94
0:05:33.089,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years

95
0:05:36.696,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me,

96
0:05:40.356,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example,

97
0:05:43.427,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the state of conservation. See here the face of the

98
0:05:45.983,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it

99
0:05:50.707,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you suddenly see another, different lady,

100
0:05:53.395,000 --> 0:05:55,000
aged lady, I should rather say.

101
0:05:55.69,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches,

102
0:05:59.279,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.

103
0:06:02.126,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But also, technology has helped to write new pages

104
0:06:05.883,000 --> 0:06:07,000
of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.

105
0:06:08.805,000 --> 0:06:1,000
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn,"

106
0:06:10.943,000 --> 0:06:12,000
another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.

107
0:06:13.421,000 --> 0:06:15,000
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but

108
0:06:15.893,000 --> 0:06:18,000
if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.

109
0:06:19.57,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And — (Laughter) — no problem, but, unfortunately,

110
0:06:23.929,000 --> 0:06:25,000
continuing with the scientific examination of this painting

111
0:06:26.707,000 --> 0:06:29,000
came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn,

112
0:06:29.707,000 --> 0:06:31,000
did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting

113
0:06:32.364,000 --> 0:06:36,000
unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol

114
0:06:37.1,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of the unicorn — (Laughter) — unfortunately,

115
0:06:39.991,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is not very reliable. (Laughter)

116
0:06:43.151,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment

117
0:06:45.751,000 --> 0:06:49,000
if science really could move in the field of authenticity

118
0:06:49.846,000 --> 0:06:52,000
of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution

119
0:06:53.234,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution,

120
0:06:56.395,000 --> 0:06:58,000
let me add. Take this example:

121
0:06:58.787,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life"

122
0:07:02.481,000 --> 0:07:06,000
at the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through,

123
0:07:06.576,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed

124
0:07:10.311,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says

125
0:07:12.911,000 --> 0:07:15,000
when it was made and also the location.

126
0:07:15.926,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So that was a good result. Sometimes, it's not that good,

127
0:07:20.325,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and so, again, authenticity and science could go together

128
0:07:25.489,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and change the way, not attributions being made,

129
0:07:29.786,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but at least lay the ground for a more objective,

130
0:07:33.629,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or, I should rather say, less subjective attribution,

131
0:07:37.35,000 --> 0:07:39,000
as it is done today.

132
0:07:40.098,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But I would say the discovery that really caught

133
0:07:43.392,000 --> 0:07:47,000
my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid

134
0:07:47.499,000 --> 0:07:5,000
drawing under this layer, brown layer,

135
0:07:51.111,000 --> 0:07:54,000
of "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see

136
0:07:54.363,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it,

137
0:07:58.793,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and just peering through this brown layer

138
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of this masterpiece to reveal

139
0:08:04.751,000 --> 0:08:06,000
what could have been underneath.

140
0:08:07.451,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Well, this happens to be the most important painting

141
0:08:09.803,000 --> 0:08:11,000
we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and

142
0:08:12.66,000 --> 0:08:16,000
look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen

143
0:08:17.396,000 --> 0:08:2,000
for five centuries. Look at these portraits.

144
0:08:21.087,000 --> 0:08:23,000
They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.

145
0:08:23.46,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You see the geniality of his creation, right directly

146
0:08:27.117,000 --> 0:08:29,000
on the ground layer of the panel, and see

147
0:08:30.024,000 --> 0:08:36,000
this cool thing, finding, I should rather say,

148
0:08:36.096,000 --> 0:08:39,000
an elephant. (Laughter) Because of this elephant,

149
0:08:39.358,000 --> 0:08:42,000
over 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.

150
0:08:43.127,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This was an epiphany. We came to understand

151
0:08:46.457,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and to prove that the brown coating that we see today

152
0:08:50.183,000 --> 0:08:52,000
was not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us

153
0:08:52.95,000 --> 0:08:54,000
only the other drawing that for five centuries

154
0:08:55.457,000 --> 0:09:,000
we were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.

155
0:09:00.667,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have

156
0:09:05.043,000 --> 0:09:07,000
this pleasure, this privilege to see all this,

157
0:09:07.821,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?

158
0:09:11.359,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So we thought of an augmented reality application

159
0:09:14.201,000 --> 0:09:18,000
using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating

160
0:09:18.489,000 --> 0:09:21,000
what we could be doing, any of us could be doing,

161
0:09:22.078,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in a museum environment.

162
0:09:24.253,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?

163
0:09:28.715,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And we just aim the camera of the tablet

164
0:09:32.011,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to the painting that we are interested to see, like this.

165
0:09:38.142,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Okay? And I will just click on it, we pause,

166
0:09:44.016,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and now let me turn to you so the moment the image,

167
0:09:48.178,000 --> 0:09:51,000
or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting,

168
0:09:51.531,000 --> 0:09:53,000
then the images you just saw up there in the drawing

169
0:09:54.197,000 --> 0:09:57,000
are being loaded. And so, see.

170
0:09:57.954,000 --> 0:10:,000
We can, as we said, we can zoom in. Then we can scroll.

171
0:10:01.757,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Okay? Let's go and find the elephant.

172
0:10:06.702,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off

173
0:10:09.959,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and we see the elephant. (Applause)

174
0:10:14.5,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Applause)

175
0:10:18.044,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Okay? And then if we want,

176
0:10:20.756,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we can continue the scroll to find out, for example,

177
0:10:23.536,000 --> 0:10:27,000
on the staircase, the whole iconography is going

178
0:10:27.631,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing

179
0:10:29.959,000 --> 0:10:31,000
from the ruins of an old temple a new temple,

180
0:10:32.59,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and there are a lot of figures showing up. See?

181
0:10:36.378,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes

182
0:10:39.584,000 --> 0:10:42,000
not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology,

183
0:10:42.632,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the meaning of the painting,

184
0:10:44.983,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and we believe this is a cool way, easy way,

185
0:10:47.773,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that everybody could have access to, to become more

186
0:10:50.913,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just

187
0:10:54.006,000 --> 0:10:57,000
be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through

188
0:10:57.38,000 --> 0:11:01,000
endless rooms of museums.

189
0:11:01.574,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Applause)

190
0:11:06.91,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds

191
0:11:10.667,000 --> 0:11:12,000
very obvious if we were to talk about real patients,

192
0:11:13.142,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately,

193
0:11:15.398,000 --> 0:11:17,000
it's never been tapped as an idea.

194
0:11:17.53,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning,

195
0:11:20.085,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the very first step, to do real conservation,

196
0:11:22.57,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and allowing us to really explore and to understand

197
0:11:26.058,000 --> 0:11:28,000
everything related to the state of our conservation,

198
0:11:28.849,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why

199
0:11:32.223,000 --> 0:11:36,000
we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on

200
0:11:36.814,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the environment surrounding the painting.

201
0:11:40.345,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Well, our vision is to rediscover

202
0:11:43.755,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline

203
0:11:46.164,000 --> 0:11:49,000
where engineering for cultural heritage is actually

204
0:11:49.773,000 --> 0:11:51,000
a symbol of blending art and science together.

205
0:11:52.475,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We definitely need a new breed of engineers

206
0:11:54.905,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that will go out and do this kind of work and

207
0:11:57.638,000 --> 0:12:01,000
rediscover for us these values, these cultural values

208
0:12:01.98,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that we badly need, especially today.

209
0:12:04.534,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And if you want to summarize in one just single word,

210
0:12:08.268,000 --> 0:12:1,000
well, this is what we're trying to do.

211
0:12:11.184,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We're trying to give a future to our past

212
0:12:13.422,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in order to have a future.

213
0:12:15.824,000 --> 0:12:18,000
As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion,

214
0:12:18.892,000 --> 0:12:22,000
there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you. (Applause)

215
0:12:23.078,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Applause)

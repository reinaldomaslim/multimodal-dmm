1
0:00:12.827,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was recently traveling in the Highlands of New Guinea,

2
0:00:15.912,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I was talking with a man who had three wives.

3
0:00:18.905,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I asked him, "How many wives would you like to have?"

4
0:00:22.34,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And there was this long pause,

5
0:00:23.798,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I thought to myself,

6
0:00:25.017,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"Is he going to say five?

7
0:00:26.592,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Is he going to say 10?

8
0:00:28.043,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Is he going to say 25?"

9
0:00:29.909,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And he leaned towards me

10
0:00:31.095,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and he whispered, "None."

11
0:00:32.629,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:35.514,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Eighty-six percent of human societies permit a man to have several wives:

13
0:00:39.913,000 --> 0:00:4,000
polygyny.

14
0:00:41.088,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But in the vast majority of these cultures,

15
0:00:43.221,000 --> 0:00:47,000
only about five or ten percent of men actually do have several wives.

16
0:00:47.543,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Having several partners can be a toothache.

17
0:00:49.914,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In fact, co-wives can fight with each other,

18
0:00:53.058,000 --> 0:00:55,000
sometimes they can even poison each other's children.

19
0:00:56.455,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And you've got to have a lot of cows, a lot of goats,

20
0:00:59.13,000 --> 0:01:,000
a lot of money, a lot of land,

21
0:01:01.119,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in order to build a harem.

22
0:01:03.017,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We are a pair-bonding species.

23
0:01:05.416,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Ninety-seven percent of mammals do not pair up to rear their young;

24
0:01:08.978,000 --> 0:01:09,000
human beings do.

25
0:01:10.83,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'm not suggesting that we're not --

26
0:01:13.004,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that we're necessarily sexually faithful to our partners.

27
0:01:16.175,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures,

28
0:01:18.947,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I understand, actually, some of the genetics of it,

29
0:01:21.406,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and some of the brain circuitry of it.

30
0:01:23.278,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's very common around the world,

31
0:01:25.245,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but we are built to love.

32
0:01:27.716,000 --> 0:01:3,000
How is technology changing love?

33
0:01:31.515,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I'm going to say almost not at all.

34
0:01:34.744,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I study the brain.

35
0:01:36.122,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I and my colleagues have put over 100 people into a brain scanner --

36
0:01:39.876,000 --> 0:01:42,000
people who had just fallen happily in love,

37
0:01:42.907,000 --> 0:01:44,000
people who had just been rejected in love

38
0:01:44.962,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and people who are in love long-term.

39
0:01:46.859,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And it is possible to remain "in love" long-term.

40
0:01:50.543,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I've long ago maintained

41
0:01:52.473,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that we've evolved three distinctly different brain systems

42
0:01:55.522,000 --> 0:01:56,000
for mating and reproduction:

43
0:01:57.383,000 --> 0:01:58,000
sex drive,

44
0:01:58.559,000 --> 0:01:59,000
feelings of intense romantic love

45
0:02:00.519,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and feelings of deep cosmic attachment to a long-term partner.

46
0:02:04.289,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And together, these three brain systems --

47
0:02:06.749,000 --> 0:02:08,000
with many other parts of the brain --

48
0:02:09.261,000 --> 0:02:14,000
orchestrate our sexual, our romantic and our family lives.

49
0:02:14.411,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But they lie way below the cortex,

50
0:02:16.828,000 --> 0:02:2,000
way below the limbic system where we feel our emotions,

51
0:02:21.073,000 --> 0:02:22,000
generate our emotions.

52
0:02:22.384,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They lie in the most primitive parts of the brain, linked with energy,

53
0:02:27.223,000 --> 0:02:32,000
focus, craving, motivation, wanting and drive.

54
0:02:32.503,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In this case,

55
0:02:33.68,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the drive to win life's greatest prize:

56
0:02:36.235,000 --> 0:02:37,000
a mating partner.

57
0:02:37.693,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They evolved over 4.4 million years ago among our first ancestors,

58
0:02:42.234,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and they're not going to change if you swipe left or right on Tinder.

59
0:02:46.72,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:48.291,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Applause)

61
0:02:50.761,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There's no question that technology is changing the way we court:

62
0:02:55.4,000 --> 0:02:56,000
emailing, texting,

63
0:02:57.348,000 --> 0:02:58,000
emojis to express your emotions,

64
0:02:59.347,000 --> 0:03:,000
sexting,

65
0:03:00.635,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"liking" a photograph, selfies ...

66
0:03:03.095,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We're seeing new rules and taboos for how to court.

67
0:03:07.936,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But, you know --

68
0:03:09.947,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is this actually dramatically changing love?

69
0:03:13.73,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What about the late 1940s,

70
0:03:16.118,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when the automobile became very popular

71
0:03:18.703,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms?

72
0:03:21.073,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:22.815,000 --> 0:03:26,000
How about the introduction of the birth control pill?

74
0:03:27.491,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Unchained from the great threat of pregnancy and social ruin,

75
0:03:32.812,000 --> 0:03:36,000
women could finally express their primitive and primal sexuality.

76
0:03:37.724,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Even dating sites are not changing love.

77
0:03:40.765,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com,

78
0:03:43.347,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I've been it for 11 years.

79
0:03:45.051,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I keep telling them and they agree with me,

80
0:03:47.079,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that these are not dating sites,

81
0:03:48.642,000 --> 0:03:5,000
they are introducing sites.

82
0:03:51.017,000 --> 0:03:53,000
When you sit down in a bar,

83
0:03:53.304,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in a coffee house,

84
0:03:54.912,000 --> 0:03:55,000
on a park bench,

85
0:03:56.292,000 --> 0:04:01,000
your ancient brain snaps into action like a sleeping cat awakened,

86
0:04:01.321,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and you smile

87
0:04:02.644,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and laugh

88
0:04:03.826,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and listen

89
0:04:05.032,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and parade the way our ancestors did 100,000 years ago.

90
0:04:10.424,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We can give you various people --

91
0:04:12.401,000 --> 0:04:13,000
all the dating sites can --

92
0:04:13.99,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but the only real algorithm is your own human brain.

93
0:04:17.927,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Technology is not going to change that.

94
0:04:21.041,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Technology is also not going to change who you choose to love.

95
0:04:25.709,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I study the biology of personality,

96
0:04:28.429,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and I've come to believe

97
0:04:29.665,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that we've evolved four very broad styles of thinking and behaving,

98
0:04:33.972,000 --> 0:04:34,000
linked with the dopamine, serotonin,

99
0:04:35.826,000 --> 0:04:37,000
testosterone and estrogen systems.

100
0:04:38.358,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So I created a questionnaire directly from brain science

101
0:04:42.535,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to measure the degree to which you express the traits --

102
0:04:45.701,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the constellation of traits --

103
0:04:47.479,000 --> 0:04:5,000
linked with each of these four brain systems.

104
0:04:50.829,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I then put that questionnaire on various dating sites

105
0:04:55.721,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in 40 countries.

106
0:04:57.969,000 --> 0:05:,000
Fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire,

107
0:05:01.883,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and I've been able to watch who's naturally drawn to whom.

108
0:05:06.462,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And as it turns out,

109
0:05:07.997,000 --> 0:05:09,000
those who were very expressive of the dopamine system

110
0:05:10.59,000 --> 0:05:13,000
tend to be curious, creative, spontaneous, energetic --

111
0:05:13.749,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I would imagine there's an awful lot of people like that in this room --

112
0:05:17.224,000 --> 0:05:18,000
they're drawn to people like themselves.

113
0:05:19.176,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Curious, creative people need people like themselves.

114
0:05:22.583,000 --> 0:05:24,000
People who are very expressive of the serotonin system

115
0:05:25.245,000 --> 0:05:27,000
tend to be traditional, conventional, they follow the rules,

116
0:05:28.148,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they respect authority,

117
0:05:30.05,000 --> 0:05:33,000
they tend to be religious -- religiosity is in the serotonin system --

118
0:05:33.46,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and traditional people go for traditional people.

119
0:05:36.821,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In that way, similarity attracts.

120
0:05:39.509,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In the other two cases, opposites attract.

121
0:05:41.755,000 --> 0:05:43,000
People very expressive of the testosterone system

122
0:05:44.076,000 --> 0:05:47,000
tend to be analytical, logical, direct, decisive,

123
0:05:48.023,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and they go for their opposite:

124
0:05:49.529,000 --> 0:05:51,000
they go for somebody who's high estrogen,

125
0:05:51.806,000 --> 0:05:53,000
somebody who's got very good verbal skills

126
0:05:54.072,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and people skills,

127
0:05:55.338,000 --> 0:05:56,000
who's very intuitive

128
0:05:56.81,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and who's very nurturing and emotionally expressive.

129
0:06:00.519,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We have natural patterns of mate choice.

130
0:06:03.468,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Modern technology is not going to change who we choose to love.

131
0:06:09.488,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But technology is producing one modern trend

132
0:06:12.065,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that I find particularly important.

133
0:06:14.151,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's associated with the concept of paradox of choice.

134
0:06:18.372,000 --> 0:06:19,000
For millions of years,

135
0:06:19.85,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we lived in little hunting and gathering groups.

136
0:06:22.141,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You didn't have the opportunity to choose

137
0:06:24.691,000 --> 0:06:27,000
between 1,000 people on a dating site.

138
0:06:28.261,000 --> 0:06:3,000
In fact, I've been studying this recently,

139
0:06:30.342,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and I actually think there's some sort of sweet spot in the brain;

140
0:06:33.521,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I don't know what it is, but apparently, from reading a lot of the data,

141
0:06:37.496,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we can embrace about five to nine alternatives, and after that,

142
0:06:42.671,000 --> 0:06:45,000
you get into what academics call "cognitive overload,"

143
0:06:45.915,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and you don't choose any.

144
0:06:48.175,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So I've come to think that due to this cognitive overload,

145
0:06:51.345,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we're ushering in a new form of courtship

146
0:06:54.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that I call "slow love."

147
0:06:57.219,000 --> 0:07:,000
I arrived at this during my work with Match.com.

148
0:07:01.4,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Every year for the last six years,

149
0:07:03.105,000 --> 0:07:05,000
we've done a study called "Singles in America."

150
0:07:05.822,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We don't poll the Match population,

151
0:07:07.654,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we poll the American population.

152
0:07:09.638,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We use 5,000-plus people,

153
0:07:12.631,000 --> 0:07:15,000
a representative sample of Americans based on the US census.

154
0:07:16.552,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We've got data now on over 30,000 people,

155
0:07:19.468,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and every single year,

156
0:07:21.959,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I see some of the same patterns.

157
0:07:24.509,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Every single year when I ask the question,

158
0:07:27.312,000 --> 0:07:29,000
over 50 percent of people have had a one-night stand --

159
0:07:30.099,000 --> 0:07:32,000
not necessarily last year, but in their lives --

160
0:07:32.79,000 --> 0:07:34,000
50 percent have had a friends with benefits

161
0:07:35.087,000 --> 0:07:36,000
during the course of their lives,

162
0:07:36.718,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and over 50 percent have lived with a person long-term

163
0:07:40.31,000 --> 0:07:41,000
before marrying.

164
0:07:41.77,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Americans think that this is reckless.

165
0:07:43.996,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I have doubted that for a long time;

166
0:07:46.939,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the patterns are too strong.

167
0:07:48.855,000 --> 0:07:5,000
There's got to be some Darwinian explanation --

168
0:07:51.607,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Not that many people are crazy.

169
0:07:53.957,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And I stumbled, then, on a statistic that really came home to me.

170
0:07:58.267,000 --> 0:08:,000
It was a very interesting academic article

171
0:08:00.89,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in which I found that 67 percent of singles in America today

172
0:08:05.927,000 --> 0:08:07,000
who are living long-term with somebody,

173
0:08:08.365,000 --> 0:08:12,000
have not yet married because they are terrified of divorce.

174
0:08:12.476,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They're terrified of the social,

175
0:08:14.356,000 --> 0:08:15,000
legal, emotional,

176
0:08:15.913,000 --> 0:08:17,000
economic consequences of divorce.

177
0:08:18.806,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So I came to realize that I don't think this is recklessness;

178
0:08:22.588,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I think it's caution.

179
0:08:24.791,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Today's singles want to know every single thing about a partner

180
0:08:29.837,000 --> 0:08:3,000
before they wed.

181
0:08:31.49,000 --> 0:08:32,000
You learn a lot between the sheets,

182
0:08:33.443,000 --> 0:08:35,000
not only about how somebody makes love,

183
0:08:35.979,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but whether they're kind,

184
0:08:37.373,000 --> 0:08:38,000
whether they can listen

185
0:08:38.739,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and at my age,

186
0:08:39.935,000 --> 0:08:4,000
whether they've got a sense of humor.

187
0:08:41.737,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Laughter)

188
0:08:43.164,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And in an age where we have too many choices,

189
0:08:47.075,000 --> 0:08:5,000
we have very little fear of pregnancy and disease

190
0:08:50.361,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and we've got no feeling of shame for sex before marriage,

191
0:08:54.093,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I think people are taking their time to love.

192
0:08:58.408,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And actually, what's happening is,

193
0:09:00.083,000 --> 0:09:03,000
what we're seeing is a real expansion of the precommitment stage

194
0:09:03.968,000 --> 0:09:04,000
before you tie the knot.

195
0:09:06.034,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship,

196
0:09:08.784,000 --> 0:09:09,000
now it's the finale.

197
0:09:11.413,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But the human brain --

198
0:09:13.177,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Laughter)

199
0:09:15.21,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The human brain always triumphs,

200
0:09:17.048,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and indeed, in the United States today,

201
0:09:18.967,000 --> 0:09:21,000
86 percent of Americans will marry by age 49.

202
0:09:22.489,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And even in cultures around the world where they're not marrying as often,

203
0:09:26.059,000 --> 0:09:29,000
they are settling down eventually with a long-term partner.

204
0:09:29.358,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So it began to occur to me:

205
0:09:31.217,000 --> 0:09:35,000
during this long extension of the precommitment stage,

206
0:09:35.808,000 --> 0:09:38,000
if you can get rid of bad relationships before you marry,

207
0:09:39.005,000 --> 0:09:41,000
maybe we're going to see more happy marriages.

208
0:09:41.838,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So I did a study of 1,100 married people in America --

209
0:09:46.737,000 --> 0:09:47,000
not on Match.com, of course --

210
0:09:48.488,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and I asked them a lot of questions.

211
0:09:50.628,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But one of the questions was,

212
0:09:52.159,000 --> 0:09:56,000
"Would you re-marry the person you're currently married to?"

213
0:09:56.755,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And 81 percent said, "Yes."

214
0:10:00.613,000 --> 0:10:06,000
In fact, the greatest change in modern romance and family life

215
0:10:07.116,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is not technology.

216
0:10:09.07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's not even slow love.

217
0:10:11.047,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's actually women piling into the job market

218
0:10:14.022,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in cultures around the world.

219
0:10:15.767,000 --> 0:10:16,000
For millions of years,

220
0:10:17.02,000 --> 0:10:19,000
our ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups.

221
0:10:20.014,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Women commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables.

222
0:10:22.943,000 --> 0:10:25,000
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.

223
0:10:26.477,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The double-income family was the rule.

224
0:10:29.194,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially

225
0:10:33.159,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and sexually powerful as men.

226
0:10:36.298,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Then the environment changed some 10,000 years ago,

227
0:10:39.424,000 --> 0:10:41,000
we began to settle down on the farm

228
0:10:41.677,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and both men and women became obliged, really,

229
0:10:44.892,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to marry the right person,

230
0:10:46.488,000 --> 0:10:47,000
from the right background,

231
0:10:47.942,000 --> 0:10:48,000
from the right religion

232
0:10:49.269,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and from the right kin and social and political connections.

233
0:10:52.831,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Men's jobs became more important:

234
0:10:54.449,000 --> 0:10:56,000
they had to move the rocks, fell the trees, plow the land.

235
0:10:57.21,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They brought the produce to local markets, and came home

236
0:11:00.158,000 --> 0:11:01,000
with the equivalent of money.

237
0:11:01.696,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Along with this,

238
0:11:03.266,000 --> 0:11:05,000
we see a rise of a host of beliefs:

239
0:11:06.267,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the belief of virginity at marriage,

240
0:11:08.473,000 --> 0:11:1,000
arranged marriages -- strictly arranged marriages --

241
0:11:11.44,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the belief that the man is the head of the household,

242
0:11:13.991,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that the wife's place is in the home

243
0:11:16.254,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and most important,

244
0:11:17.431,000 --> 0:11:2,000
honor thy husband, and 'til death do us part.

245
0:11:20.586,000 --> 0:11:21,000
These are gone.

246
0:11:22.332,000 --> 0:11:24,000
They are going, and in many places,

247
0:11:24.905,000 --> 0:11:25,000
they are gone.

248
0:11:26.317,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We are right now in a marriage revolution.

249
0:11:29.764,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We are shedding 10,000 years of our farming tradition

250
0:11:34.503,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes --

251
0:11:40.153,000 --> 0:11:44,000
something I regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.

252
0:11:45.562,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I'm not a Pollyanna;

253
0:11:47.288,000 --> 0:11:48,000
there's a great deal to cry about.

254
0:11:49.073,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I've studied divorce in 80 cultures,

255
0:11:50.843,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I've studied, as I say, adultery in many --

256
0:11:53.003,000 --> 0:11:54,000
there's a whole pile of problems.

257
0:11:54.843,000 --> 0:11:57,000
As William Butler Yeats, the poet, once said,

258
0:11:58.059,000 --> 0:12:,000
"Love is the crooked thing."

259
0:12:01.131,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I would add, "Nobody gets out alive."

260
0:12:03.945,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Laughter)

261
0:12:05.064,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We all have problems.

262
0:12:06.925,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But in fact, I think the poet Randall Jarrell really sums it up best.

263
0:12:10.553,000 --> 0:12:14,000
He said, "The dark, uneasy world of family life --

264
0:12:15.576,000 --> 0:12:19,000
where the greatest can fail, and the humblest succeed."

265
0:12:20.779,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But I will leave you with this:

266
0:12:22.69,000 --> 0:12:24,000
love and attachment will prevail,

267
0:12:25.442,000 --> 0:12:27,000
technology cannot change it.

268
0:12:27.999,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And I will conclude by saying

269
0:12:29.861,000 --> 0:12:34,000
any understanding of human relationships must take into account

270
0:12:35.131,000 --> 0:12:39,000
one the most powerful determinants of human behavior:

271
0:12:39.38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the unquenchable,

272
0:12:41.217,000 --> 0:12:42,000
adaptable

273
0:12:42.789,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and primordial human drive to love.

274
0:12:45.819,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Thank you.

275
0:12:46.995,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Applause)

276
0:12:51.915,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you so much for that, Helen.

277
0:12:54.32,000 --> 0:12:56,000
As you know, there's another speaker here with us

278
0:12:56.653,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that works in your same field.

279
0:12:58.227,000 --> 0:13:,000
She comes at it from a different perspective.

280
0:13:00.682,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Esther Perel is a psychotherapist who works with couples.

281
0:13:05.749,000 --> 0:13:06,000
You study data,

282
0:13:07.066,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Esther studies the stories the couples tell her

283
0:13:09.59,000 --> 0:13:11,000
when they come to her for help.

284
0:13:11.642,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Let's have her join us on the stage.

285
0:13:13.39,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Esther?

286
0:13:14.565,000 --> 0:13:17,000
(Applause)

287
0:13:22.249,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So Esther,

288
0:13:23.519,000 --> 0:13:25,000
when you were watching Helen's talk,

289
0:13:25.815,000 --> 0:13:26,000
was there any part of it

290
0:13:27.045,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that resonated with you through the lens of your own work

291
0:13:29.836,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that you'd like to comment on?

292
0:13:32.062,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Esther Perel: It's interesting, because on the one hand,

293
0:13:35.665,000 --> 0:13:38,000
the need for love is ubiquitous and universal.

294
0:13:39.965,000 --> 0:13:4,000
But the way we love --

295
0:13:41.953,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the meaning we make out of it --

296
0:13:43.507,000 --> 0:13:45,000
the rules that govern our relationships, I think,

297
0:13:45.856,000 --> 0:13:47,000
are changing fundamentally.

298
0:13:47.907,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We come from a model that, until now,

299
0:13:50.831,000 --> 0:13:53,000
was primarily regulated around duty and obligation,

300
0:13:54.318,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the needs of the collective and loyalty.

301
0:13:56.739,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And we have shifted it

302
0:13:57.943,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to a model of free choice and individual rights,

303
0:14:02.297,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and self-fulfillment and happiness.

304
0:14:05.397,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And so, that was the first thing I thought,

305
0:14:07.741,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that the need doesn't change,

306
0:14:09.533,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but the context and the way we regulate these relationships

307
0:14:13.365,000 --> 0:14:14,000
changes a lot.

308
0:14:14.667,000 --> 0:14:15,000
On the paradox of choice --

309
0:14:18.682,000 --> 0:14:2,000
you know, on the one hand we relish the novelty

310
0:14:21.033,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and the playfulness, I think,

311
0:14:22.649,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to be able to have so many options.

312
0:14:25.384,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And at the same time,

313
0:14:26.769,000 --> 0:14:28,000
as you talk about this cognitive overload,

314
0:14:29.207,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I see many, many people who ...

315
0:14:34.391,000 --> 0:14:38,000
who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt

316
0:14:38.521,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that comes with this massa of choice,

317
0:14:41.094,000 --> 0:14:43,000
creating a case of "FOMO"

318
0:14:43.377,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and then leading us --

319
0:14:45.043,000 --> 0:14:48,000
FOMO, fear of missed opportunity, or fear of missing out --

320
0:14:48.382,000 --> 0:14:5,000
it's like, "How do I know I have found 'the one' --

321
0:14:51.364,000 --> 0:14:52,000
the right one?"

322
0:14:52.56,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So we've created what I call this thing of "stable ambiguity."

323
0:14:56.6,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Stable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone

324
0:15:00.329,000 --> 0:15:04,000
but also not really willing to engage in intimacy-building.

325
0:15:04.388,000 --> 0:15:09,000
It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship

326
0:15:09.706,000 --> 0:15:11,000
but also the uncertainty of the breakup.

327
0:15:12.337,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So, here on the internet you have three major ones.

328
0:15:15.343,000 --> 0:15:17,000
One is icing and simmering,

329
0:15:17.688,000 --> 0:15:19,000
which are great stalling tactics

330
0:15:20.587,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that offer a kind of holding pattern

331
0:15:23.088,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship

332
0:15:26.906,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency

333
0:15:31.037,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries.

334
0:15:33.818,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Laughter)

335
0:15:36.07,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Yeah?

336
0:15:37.264,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And then comes ghosting.

337
0:15:38.836,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And ghosting is, basically,

338
0:15:40.832,000 --> 0:15:44,000
you disappear from this massa of texts on the spot,

339
0:15:45.376,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and you don't have to deal with the pain that you inflict on another,

340
0:15:49.185,000 --> 0:15:51,000
because you're making it invisible even to yourself.

341
0:15:51.807,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Laughter)

342
0:15:53.018,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Yeah?

343
0:15:54.2,000 --> 0:15:58,000
So I was thinking -- these words came up for me as I was listening to you,

344
0:15:58.961,000 --> 0:16:03,000
like how a vocabulary also creates a reality,

345
0:16:04.148,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and at the same time,

346
0:16:05.727,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that's my question to you:

347
0:16:07.435,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Do you think when the context changes,

348
0:16:10.399,000 --> 0:16:13,000
it still means that the nature of love remains the same?

349
0:16:14.063,000 --> 0:16:18,000
You study the brain and I study people's relationships and stories,

350
0:16:18.185,000 --> 0:16:21,000
so I think it's everything you say, plus.

351
0:16:22.691,000 --> 0:16:25,000
But I don't always know the degree to which a changing context ...

352
0:16:27.451,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Does it at some point begin to change --

353
0:16:30.005,000 --> 0:16:32,000
If the meaning changes, does it change the need,

354
0:16:32.642,000 --> 0:16:34,000
or is the need clear of the entire context?

355
0:16:35.797,000 --> 0:16:36,000
HF: Wow! Well --

356
0:16:37.241,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Laughter)

357
0:16:39.696,000 --> 0:16:42,000
(Applause)

358
0:16:42.895,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Well, I've got three points here, right?

359
0:16:46.736,000 --> 0:16:47,000
First of all, to your first one:

360
0:16:48.586,000 --> 0:16:51,000
there's no question that we've changed, that we now want a person to love,

361
0:16:52.203,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and for thousands of years, we had to marry the right person

362
0:16:55.072,000 --> 0:16:57,000
from the right background and right kin connection.

363
0:16:57.497,000 --> 0:17:,000
And in fact, in my studies of 5,000 people every year,

364
0:17:00.742,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I ask them, "What are you looking for?"

365
0:17:02.892,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And every single year, over 97 percent say --

366
0:17:05.674,000 --> 0:17:06,000
EP: The list grows --

367
0:17:06.908,000 --> 0:17:07,000
HF: Well, no.

368
0:17:08.092,000 --> 0:17:11,000
The basic thing is over 97 percent of people

369
0:17:11.439,000 --> 0:17:13,000
want somebody that respects them,

370
0:17:13.554,000 --> 0:17:15,000
somebody they can trust and confide in,

371
0:17:15.866,000 --> 0:17:16,000
somebody who makes them laugh,

372
0:17:17.546,000 --> 0:17:18,000
somebody who makes enough time for them

373
0:17:19.452,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and somebody who they find physically attractive.

374
0:17:23.473,000 --> 0:17:24,000
That never changes.

375
0:17:24.78,000 --> 0:17:27,000
And there's certainly -- you know, there's two parts --

376
0:17:27.982,000 --> 0:17:28,000
EP: But you know how I call that?

377
0:17:29.586,000 --> 0:17:31,000
That's not what people used to say --

378
0:17:31.86,000 --> 0:17:32,000
HF: That's exactly right.

379
0:17:33.114,000 --> 0:17:36,000
EP: They said they wanted somebody with whom they have companionship,

380
0:17:36.437,000 --> 0:17:37,000
economic support, children.

381
0:17:37.752,000 --> 0:17:39,000
We went from a production economy to a service economy.

382
0:17:40.362,000 --> 0:17:41,000
(Laughter)

383
0:17:41.395,000 --> 0:17:43,000
We did it in the larger culture, and we're doing it in marriage.

384
0:17:44.4,000 --> 0:17:45,000
HF: Right, no question about it.

385
0:17:45.972,000 --> 0:17:48,000
But it's interesting, the millennials actually want to be very good parents,

386
0:17:49.906,000 --> 0:17:53,000
whereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage

387
0:17:54.05,000 --> 0:17:56,000
but is not as focused on being a good parent.

388
0:17:56.296,000 --> 0:17:58,000
You see all of these nuances.

389
0:17:58.403,000 --> 0:18:,000
There's two basic parts of personality:

390
0:18:00.983,000 --> 0:18:03,000
there's your culture -- everything you grew up to do and believe and say --

391
0:18:04.582,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and there's your temperament.

392
0:18:06.005,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Basically, what I've been talking about is your temperament.

393
0:18:08.856,000 --> 0:18:11,000
And that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times

394
0:18:12.198,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and changing beliefs.

395
0:18:13.891,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And in terms of the paradox of choice,

396
0:18:17.062,000 --> 0:18:19,000
there's no question about it that this is a pickle.

397
0:18:19.493,000 --> 0:18:21,000
There were millions of years where you found that sweet boy

398
0:18:22.381,000 --> 0:18:23,000
at the other side of the water hole,

399
0:18:24.13,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and you went for it.

400
0:18:25.305,000 --> 0:18:26,000
EP: Yes, but you --

401
0:18:26.48,000 --> 0:18:27,000
HF: I do want to say one more thing.

402
0:18:28.251,000 --> 0:18:3,000
The bottom line is, in hunting and gathering societies,

403
0:18:30.892,000 --> 0:18:33,000
they tended to have two or three partners during the course of their lives.

404
0:18:34.514,000 --> 0:18:35,000
They weren't square!

405
0:18:35.696,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And I'm not suggesting that we do,

406
0:18:37.376,000 --> 0:18:4,000
but the bottom line is, we've always had alternatives.

407
0:18:41.376,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Mankind is always --

408
0:18:42.879,000 --> 0:18:45,000
in fact, the brain is well-built to what we call "equilibrate,"

409
0:18:46.095,000 --> 0:18:47,000
to try and decide:

410
0:18:47.27,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay?

411
0:18:49.728,000 --> 0:18:5,000
What are the opportunities here?

412
0:18:51.3,000 --> 0:18:52,000
How do I handle this there?

413
0:18:52.626,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And so I think we're seeing another play-out of that now.

414
0:18:56.052,000 --> 0:18:57,000
KS: Well, thank you both so much.

415
0:18:57.699,000 --> 0:19:,000
I think you're going to have a million dinner partners for tonight!

416
0:19:00.929,000 --> 0:19:01,000
(Applause)

417
0:19:02.932,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Thank you, thank you.

1
0:00:13.111,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So in the winter of 2012,

2
0:00:15.667,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I went to visit my grandmother's house

3
0:00:17.708,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in South India,

4
0:00:19.375,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a place, by the way,

5
0:00:20.708,000 --> 0:00:23,000
where the mosquitos have a special taste for the blood of the American-born.

6
0:00:24.417,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:25.542,000 --> 0:00:26,000
No joke.

8
0:00:27.375,000 --> 0:00:3,000
When I was there, I got an unexpected gift.

9
0:00:31.583,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It was this antique instrument

10
0:00:34.125,000 --> 0:00:35,000
made more than a century ago,

11
0:00:36.083,000 --> 0:00:38,000
hand-carved from a rare wood,

12
0:00:38.75,000 --> 0:00:39,000
inlaid with pearls

13
0:00:40.125,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and with dozens of metal strings.

14
0:00:43.958,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's a family heirloom,

15
0:00:46.083,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a link between my past,

16
0:00:48.208,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the country where my parents were born,

17
0:00:50.458,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the future,

18
0:00:52.083,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the unknown places I'll take it.

19
0:00:55.125,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I didn't actually realize it at the time I got it,

20
0:00:58.083,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but it would later become a powerful metaphor for my work.

21
0:01:02.917,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We all know the saying,

22
0:01:04.708,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"There's no time like the present."

23
0:01:08.167,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But nowadays, it can feel like there's no time but the present.

24
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What's immediate and ephemeral seems to dominate our lives,

25
0:01:17.75,000 --> 0:01:19,000
our economy and our politics.

26
0:01:21.821,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's so easy to get caught up in the number of steps we took today

27
0:01:26.297,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or the latest tweet from a high-profile figure.

28
0:01:30.518,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's easy for businesses to get caught up in making immediate profits

29
0:01:35.914,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and neglect what's good for future invention.

30
0:01:40.247,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And it's far too easy for governments to stand by

31
0:01:44.294,000 --> 0:01:46,000
while fisheries and farmland are depleted

32
0:01:47.532,000 --> 0:01:49,000
instead of conserved to feed future generations.

33
0:01:52.428,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I have a feeling that, at this rate,

34
0:01:54.649,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it's going to be hard for our generation to be remembered as good ancestors.

35
0:02:00.777,000 --> 0:02:04,000
If you think about it, our species evolved to think ahead,

36
0:02:04.861,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to chart the stars,

37
0:02:07.069,000 --> 0:02:09,000
dream of the afterlife,

38
0:02:09.236,000 --> 0:02:11,000
sow seeds for later harvest.

39
0:02:12.569,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Some scientists call this superpower that we have "mental time travel,"

40
0:02:17.611,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and it's responsible for pretty much everything we call human civilization,

41
0:02:21.902,000 --> 0:02:23,000
from farming to the Magna Carta

42
0:02:24.486,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to the internet --

43
0:02:26.194,000 --> 0:02:28,000
all first conjured in the minds of humans.

44
0:02:30.361,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But let's get real:

45
0:02:31.652,000 --> 0:02:33,000
if we look around us today,

46
0:02:34.277,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we don't exactly seem to be using this superpower quite enough,

47
0:02:40.069,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and that begs the question: Why not?

48
0:02:44.569,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What's wrong is how our communities, businesses and institutions are designed.

49
0:02:49.819,000 --> 0:02:52,000
They're designed in a way that's impairing our foresight.

50
0:02:54.444,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I want to talk to you about the three key mistakes

51
0:02:57.069,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that I think we're making.

52
0:02:59.569,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The first mistake is what we measure.

53
0:03:03.569,000 --> 0:03:06,000
When we look at the quarterly profits of a company

54
0:03:06.986,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or its near-term stock price,

55
0:03:09.527,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that's often not a great measure

56
0:03:11.319,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of whether that company is going to grow its market share

57
0:03:14.069,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or be inventive in the long run.

58
0:03:16.361,000 --> 0:03:21,000
When we glue ourselves to the test scores that kids bring back from school,

59
0:03:21.486,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that's not necessarily what's great for those kids' learning

60
0:03:24.486,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and curiosity in the long run.

61
0:03:27.402,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We're not measuring what really matters in the future.

62
0:03:31.861,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The second mistake we're making that impairs our foresight

63
0:03:34.944,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is what we reward.

64
0:03:37.652,000 --> 0:03:4,000
When we celebrate a political leader or a business leader

65
0:03:40.819,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for the disaster she just cleaned up

66
0:03:44.069,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or the announcement she just made,

67
0:03:46.611,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we're not motivating that leader

68
0:03:48.194,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to invest in preventing those disasters in the first place,

69
0:03:52.194,000 --> 0:03:56,000
or to put down payments on the future by protecting communities from floods

70
0:03:56.902,000 --> 0:03:57,000
or fighting inequality

71
0:03:58.694,000 --> 0:04:,000
or investing in research and education.

72
0:04:02.861,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The third mistake that impairs our foresight

73
0:04:06.861,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is what we fail to imagine.

74
0:04:10.402,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, when we do think about the future,

75
0:04:12.319,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we tend to focus on predicting exactly what's next,

76
0:04:15.111,000 --> 0:04:18,000
whether we're using horoscopes or algorithms to do that.

77
0:04:19.569,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But we spend a lot less time imagining all the possibilities the future holds.

78
0:04:26.319,000 --> 0:04:3,000
When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014 in West Africa,

79
0:04:31.319,000 --> 0:04:34,000
public health officials around the world had early warning signs

80
0:04:34.986,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and predictive tools

81
0:04:37.236,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that showed how that outbreak might spread,

82
0:04:40.277,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but they failed to fathom that it would,

83
0:04:44.236,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and they failed to act in time to intervene,

84
0:04:46.402,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the epidemic grew to kill more than 11,000 people.

85
0:04:50.611,000 --> 0:04:53,000
When people with lots of resources and good forecasts

86
0:04:53.944,000 --> 0:04:55,000
don't prepare for deadly hurricanes,

87
0:04:56.777,000 --> 0:05:,000
they're often failing to imagine how dangerous they can be.

88
0:05:03.152,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now, none of these mistakes that I've described,

89
0:05:05.527,000 --> 0:05:07,000
as dismal as they might sound,

90
0:05:07.902,000 --> 0:05:08,000
are inevitable.

91
0:05:09.86,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In fact, they're all avoidable.

92
0:05:13.402,000 --> 0:05:15,000
What we need to make better decisions about the future

93
0:05:15.986,000 --> 0:05:16,000
are tools that can aid our foresight,

94
0:05:17.819,000 --> 0:05:19,000
tools that can help us think ahead.

95
0:05:20.194,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Think of these as something like the telescopes

96
0:05:22.652,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that ship captains of yore used when they scanned the horizon.

97
0:05:26.819,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Only instead of for looking across distance and the ocean,

98
0:05:31.194,000 --> 0:05:34,000
these tools are for looking across time to the future.

99
0:05:35.986,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I want to share with you a few of the tools

100
0:05:38.069,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that I've found in my research

101
0:05:40.111,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that I think can help us with foresight.

102
0:05:43.736,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The first tool I want to share with you

103
0:05:45.861,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I think of as making the long game pay now.

104
0:05:49.444,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is Wes Jackson, a farmer I spent some time with in Kansas.

105
0:05:53.444,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And Jackson knows

106
0:05:54.902,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that the way that most crops are grown around the world today

107
0:05:58.736,000 --> 0:06:,000
is stripping the earth of the fertile topsoil

108
0:06:01.527,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we need to feed future generations.

109
0:06:04.569,000 --> 0:06:06,000
He got together with a group of scientists,

110
0:06:06.902,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and they bred perennial grain crops which have deep roots

111
0:06:11.069,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that anchor the fertile topsoil of a farm,

112
0:06:13.444,000 --> 0:06:15,000
preventing erosion and protecting future harvests.

113
0:06:17.277,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But they also knew

114
0:06:18.944,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that in order to get farmers to grow these crops in the short run,

115
0:06:22.902,000 --> 0:06:24,000
they needed to boost the annual yields of the crops

116
0:06:25.819,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and find companies willing to make cereal and beer using the grains

117
0:06:30.236,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so that farmers could reap profits today by doing what's good for tomorrow.

118
0:06:35.402,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And this is a tried-and-true strategy.

119
0:06:37.486,000 --> 0:06:39,000
In fact, it was used by George Washington Carver

120
0:06:40.319,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in the South of the United States after the Civil War

121
0:06:43.819,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in the early 20th century.

122
0:06:45.861,000 --> 0:06:5,000
A lot of people have probably heard of Carver's 300 uses for the peanut,

123
0:06:50.986,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the products and recipes that he came up with

124
0:06:53.861,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that made the peanut so popular.

125
0:06:56.402,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But not everyone knows why Carver did that.

126
0:06:59.986,000 --> 0:07:01,000
He was trying to help poor Alabama sharecroppers

127
0:07:02.777,000 --> 0:07:04,000
whose cotton yields were declining,

128
0:07:05.027,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and he knew that planting peanuts in their fields

129
0:07:07.652,000 --> 0:07:08,000
would replenish those soils

130
0:07:09.027,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so that their cotton yields would be better a few years later.

131
0:07:12.069,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But he also knew it needed to be lucrative for them in the short run.

132
0:07:16.277,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Alright, so let's talk about another tool for foresight.

133
0:07:19.944,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This one I like to think of as keeping the memory of the past alive

134
0:07:24.194,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to help us imagine the future.

135
0:07:27.069,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So I went to Fukushima, Japan

136
0:07:29.152,000 --> 0:07:32,000
on the sixth anniversary of the nuclear reactor disaster there

137
0:07:32.277,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that followed the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011.

138
0:07:37.319,000 --> 0:07:41,000
When I was there, I learned about the Onagawa Nuclear Power Station,

139
0:07:41.736,000 --> 0:07:43,000
which was even closer to the epicenter of that earthquake

140
0:07:44.569,000 --> 0:07:46,000
than the infamous Fukushima Daiichi that we all know about.

141
0:07:48.319,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In Onagawa, people in the city actually fled to the nuclear power plant

142
0:07:53.402,000 --> 0:07:54,000
as a place of refuge.

143
0:07:55.402,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It was that safe.

144
0:07:57.277,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It was spared by the tsunamis.

145
0:08:00.111,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It was the foresight of just one engineer,

146
0:08:02.652,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Yanosuke Hirai,

147
0:08:04.652,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that made that happen.

148
0:08:06.986,000 --> 0:08:09,000
In the 1960s, he fought to build that power plant

149
0:08:10.777,000 --> 0:08:11,000
farther back from the coast

150
0:08:12.486,000 --> 0:08:14,000
at higher elevation and with a higher sea wall.

151
0:08:16.402,000 --> 0:08:19,000
He knew the story of his hometown shrine,

152
0:08:20.069,000 --> 0:08:23,000
which had flooded in the year 869 after a tsunami.

153
0:08:24.694,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It was his knowledge of history that allowed him to imagine

154
0:08:28.486,000 --> 0:08:29,000
what others could not.

155
0:08:31.986,000 --> 0:08:32,000
OK, one more tool of foresight.

156
0:08:34.777,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This one I think of as creating shared heirlooms.

157
0:08:38.819,000 --> 0:08:4,000
These are lobster fishermen on the Pacific coast of Mexico,

158
0:08:41.694,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and they're the ones who taught me this.

159
0:08:44.152,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They have protected their lobster harvest there

160
0:08:46.902,000 --> 0:08:48,000
for nearly a century,

161
0:08:49.069,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and they've done that by treating it as a shared resource

162
0:08:52.527,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that they're passing on to their collected children and grandchildren.

163
0:08:55.944,000 --> 0:08:57,000
They carefully measure what they catch

164
0:08:58.361,000 --> 0:09:01,000
so that they're not taking the breeding lobster out of the ocean.

165
0:09:02.569,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Across North America, there are more than 30 fisheries

166
0:09:05.527,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that are doing something vaguely similar to this.

167
0:09:08.569,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They're creating long-term stakes in the fisheries known as catch shares

168
0:09:13.152,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which get fishermen to be motivated

169
0:09:15.402,000 --> 0:09:18,000
not just in taking whatever they can from the ocean today

170
0:09:19.069,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but in its long-term survival.

171
0:09:23.027,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now there are many, many more tools of foresight

172
0:09:25.736,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I would love to share with you,

173
0:09:27.276,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and they come from all kinds of places:

174
0:09:29.194,000 --> 0:09:32,000
investment firms that look beyond near-term stock prices,

175
0:09:32.611,000 --> 0:09:33,000
states that have freed their elections

176
0:09:34.611,000 --> 0:09:36,000
from the immediate interests of campaign financiers.

177
0:09:39.111,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And we're going to need to marshal as many of these tools as we can

178
0:09:43.069,000 --> 0:09:45,000
if we want to rethink what we measure,

179
0:09:45.527,000 --> 0:09:46,000
change what we reward

180
0:09:47.486,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and be brave enough to imagine what lies ahead.

181
0:09:52.402,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Not all this is going to be easy, as you can imagine.

182
0:09:57.111,000 --> 0:10:,000
Some of these tools we can pick up in our own lives,

183
0:10:00.402,000 --> 0:10:04,000
some we're going to need to do in businesses or in communities,

184
0:10:05.319,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and some we need to do as a society.

185
0:10:09.569,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The future is worth this effort.

186
0:10:15.194,000 --> 0:10:19,000
My own inspiration to keep up this effort is the instrument I shared with you.

187
0:10:19.777,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's called a dilruba,

188
0:10:22.027,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and it was custom-made for my great-grandfather.

189
0:10:25.736,000 --> 0:10:27,000
He was a well-known music and art critic in India

190
0:10:28.527,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in the early 20th century.

191
0:10:32.319,000 --> 0:10:36,000
My great-grandfather had the foresight to protect this instrument

192
0:10:37.736,000 --> 0:10:41,000
at a time when my great-grandmother was pawning off all their belongings,

193
0:10:41.902,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but that's another story.

194
0:10:45.652,000 --> 0:10:48,000
He protected it by giving it to the next generation,

195
0:10:48.694,000 --> 0:10:49,000
by giving it to my grandmother,

196
0:10:50.402,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and she gave it to me.

197
0:10:54.777,000 --> 0:10:56,000
When I first heard the sound of this instrument,

198
0:10:57.694,000 --> 0:10:58,000
it haunted me.

199
0:10:59.944,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It felt like hearing a wanderer in the Himalayan fog.

200
0:11:05.361,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It felt like hearing a voice from the past.

201
0:11:08.986,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Music)

202
0:11:44.902,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Music ends)

203
0:11:49.069,000 --> 0:11:52,000
That's my friend Simran Singh playing the dilruba.

204
0:11:53.027,000 --> 0:11:56,000
When I play it, it sounds like a cat's dying somewhere,

205
0:11:56.277,000 --> 0:11:57,000
so you're welcome.

206
0:11:57.569,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Laughter)

207
0:12:00.236,000 --> 0:12:02,000
This instrument is in my home today,

208
0:12:03.236,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but it doesn't actually belong to me.

209
0:12:06.777,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It's my role to shepherd it in time,

210
0:12:10.444,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and that feels more meaningful to me than just owning it for today.

211
0:12:15.986,000 --> 0:12:2,000
This instrument positions me as both a descendant and an ancestor.

212
0:12:23.236,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It makes me feel part of a story bigger than my own.

213
0:12:28.652,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And this, I believe,

214
0:12:30.152,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is the single most powerful way we can reclaim foresight:

215
0:12:35.861,000 --> 0:12:38,000
by seeing ourselves as the good ancestors we long to be,

216
0:12:41.527,000 --> 0:12:43,000
ancestors not just to our own children

217
0:12:45.569,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but to all humanity.

218
0:12:48.944,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Whatever your heirloom is,

219
0:12:52.111,000 --> 0:12:54,000
however big or small,

220
0:12:55.736,000 --> 0:12:56,000
protect it

221
0:12:58.527,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and know that its music can resonate for generations.

222
0:13:02.569,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Thank you.

223
0:13:03.861,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

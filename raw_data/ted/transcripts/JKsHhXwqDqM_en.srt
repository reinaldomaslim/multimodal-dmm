1
0:00:12.915,000 --> 0:00:13,000
It's very nice to be here tonight.

2
0:00:14.88,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I've been working on the history of income

3
0:00:18.596,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and wealth distribution for the past 15 years,

4
0:00:21.915,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and one of the interesting lessons

5
0:00:25.016,000 --> 0:00:27,000
coming from this historical evidence

6
0:00:27.517,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is indeed that, in the long run,

7
0:00:29.53,000 --> 0:00:32,000
there is a tendency for the rate of return of capital

8
0:00:33.25,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to exceed the economy's growth rate,

9
0:00:35.92,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and this tends to lead to high concentration of wealth.

10
0:00:38.665,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Not infinite concentration of wealth,

11
0:00:40.498,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but the higher the gap between r and g,

12
0:00:43.289,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the higher the level of inequality of wealth

13
0:00:46.224,000 --> 0:00:49,000
towards which society tends to converge.

14
0:00:49.431,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So this is a key force that I'm going to talk about today,

15
0:00:52.985,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but let me say right away

16
0:00:54.954,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that this is not the only important force

17
0:00:57.284,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in the dynamics of income and wealth distribution,

18
0:00:59.757,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and there are many other forces that play

19
0:01:01.782,000 --> 0:01:03,000
an important role in the long-run dynamics

20
0:01:04.763,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of income and wealth distribution.

21
0:01:06.338,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Also there is a lot of data

22
0:01:08.307,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that still needs to be collected.

23
0:01:09.863,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We know a little bit more today

24
0:01:12.795,000 --> 0:01:14,000
than we used to know, but we still know too little,

25
0:01:15.316,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and certainly there are many different processes —

26
0:01:17.992,000 --> 0:01:19,000
economic, social, political —

27
0:01:20.29,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that need to be studied more.

28
0:01:21.717,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force,

29
0:01:24.697,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but that doesn't mean that other important forces

30
0:01:26.958,000 --> 0:01:27,000
do not exist.

31
0:01:28.162,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So most of the data I'm going to present

32
0:01:30.434,000 --> 0:01:32,000
comes from this database

33
0:01:32.639,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that's available online:

34
0:01:33.899,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the World Top Incomes Database.

35
0:01:35.384,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So this is the largest existing

36
0:01:37.487,000 --> 0:01:39,000
historical database on inequality,

37
0:01:39.94,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and this comes from the effort

38
0:01:41.29,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.

39
0:01:45.182,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So let me show you a couple of facts

40
0:01:47.96,000 --> 0:01:48,000
coming from this database,

41
0:01:49.105,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and then we'll return to r bigger than g.

42
0:01:51.179,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So fact number one is that there has been

43
0:01:53.689,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality

44
0:01:56.74,000 --> 0:01:57,000
between the United States and Europe

45
0:01:58.645,000 --> 0:01:59,000
over the past century.

46
0:02:00.4,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually

47
0:02:03.905,000 --> 0:02:05,000
much higher in Europe than in the United States,

48
0:02:06.17,000 --> 0:02:09,000
whereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.

49
0:02:09.28,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So let me be very clear:

50
0:02:10.946,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.

51
0:02:13.77,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It has more to do with changing supply and demand

52
0:02:17.267,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for skill, the race between education and technology,

53
0:02:20.72,000 --> 0:02:23,000
globalization, probably more unequal access

54
0:02:24.3,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to skills in the U.S.,

55
0:02:25.906,000 --> 0:02:27,000
where you have very good, very top universities

56
0:02:28.493,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but where the bottom part of the educational system

57
0:02:30.735,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is not as good,

58
0:02:31.5,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so very unequal access to skills,

59
0:02:33.861,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and also an unprecedented rise

60
0:02:35.78,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of top managerial compensation of the United States,

61
0:02:38.8,000 --> 0:02:4,000
which is difficult to account for just on the basis of education.

62
0:02:41.65,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So there is more going on here,

63
0:02:43.604,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but I'm not going to talk too much about this today,

64
0:02:46.213,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because I want to focus on wealth inequality.

65
0:02:48.879,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So let me just show you a very simple indicator

66
0:02:51.86,000 --> 0:02:53,000
about the income inequality part.

67
0:02:54.21,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So this is the share of total income

68
0:02:56.664,000 --> 0:02:57,000
going to the top 10 percent.

69
0:02:58.452,000 --> 0:03:,000
So you can see that one century ago,

70
0:03:00.624,000 --> 0:03:03,000
it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe

71
0:03:04.201,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,

72
0:03:06.939,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so there was more inequality in Europe.

73
0:03:09.21,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Then there was a sharp decline

74
0:03:11.234,000 --> 0:03:13,000
during the first half of the 20th century,

75
0:03:13.765,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and in the recent decade, you can see that

76
0:03:16.128,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,

77
0:03:19.63,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and this is the first fact I just talked about.

78
0:03:22.3,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,

79
0:03:26.211,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and here the central fact is that wealth inequality

80
0:03:29.301,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is always a lot higher than income inequality,

81
0:03:31.907,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and also that wealth inequality,

82
0:03:34.292,000 --> 0:03:36,000
although it has also increased in recent decades,

83
0:03:36.945,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is still less extreme today

84
0:03:38.801,000 --> 0:03:39,000
than what it was a century ago,

85
0:03:40.68,000 --> 0:03:42,000
although the total quantity of wealth

86
0:03:43.199,000 --> 0:03:45,000
relative to income has now recovered

87
0:03:45.224,000 --> 0:03:46,000
from the very large shocks

88
0:03:46.855,000 --> 0:03:48,000
caused by World War I, the Great Depression,

89
0:03:48.88,000 --> 0:03:49,000
World War II.

90
0:03:50.099,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So let me show you two graphs

91
0:03:52.143,000 --> 0:03:54,000
illustrating fact number two and fact number three.

92
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,

93
0:03:59.39,000 --> 0:04:02,000
this is the share of total wealth

94
0:04:02.548,000 --> 0:04:04,000
going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,

95
0:04:05.07,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so you can see the same kind of reversal

96
0:04:07.779,000 --> 0:04:09,000
between the U.S. and Europe that we had before

97
0:04:10.344,000 --> 0:04:11,000
for income inequality.

98
0:04:12.02,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So wealth concentration was higher

99
0:04:15.57,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,

100
0:04:17.813,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and now it is the opposite.

101
0:04:19.647,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But you can also show two things:

102
0:04:21.638,000 --> 0:04:24,000
First, the general level of wealth inequality

103
0:04:25.339,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is always higher than income inequality.

104
0:04:27.994,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So remember, for income inequality,

105
0:04:30.334,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the share going to the top 10 percent

106
0:04:32.662,000 --> 0:04:36,000
was between 30 and 50 percent of total income,

107
0:04:36.96,000 --> 0:04:38,000
whereas for wealth, the share is always

108
0:04:39.772,000 --> 0:04:41,000
between 60 and 90 percent.

109
0:04:41.831,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Okay, so that's fact number one,

110
0:04:43.347,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and that's very important for what follows.

111
0:04:45.273,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Wealth concentration is always

112
0:04:46.994,000 --> 0:04:47,000
a lot higher than income concentration.

113
0:04:48.873,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Fact number two is that the rise

114
0:04:52.259,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in wealth inequality in recent decades

115
0:04:55.206,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is still not enough to get us back to 1910.

116
0:04:59.492,000 --> 0:05:,000
So the big difference today,

117
0:05:01.269,000 --> 0:05:02,000
wealth inequality is still very large,

118
0:05:03.182,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,

119
0:05:06.444,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but the good news is that it's actually

120
0:05:08.289,000 --> 0:05:09,000
better than one century ago,

121
0:05:10.07,000 --> 0:05:13,000
where you had 90 percent in Europe going to the top 10.

122
0:05:13.441,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So today what you have

123
0:05:15.432,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is what I call the middle 40 percent,

124
0:05:17.434,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the people who are not in the top 10

125
0:05:19.347,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and who are not in the bottom 50,

126
0:05:21.12,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and what you can view as the wealth middle class

127
0:05:23.386,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that owns 20 to 30 percent

128
0:05:26.529,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of total wealth, national wealth,

129
0:05:28.391,000 --> 0:05:31,000
whereas they used to be poor, a century ago,

130
0:05:31.722,000 --> 0:05:33,000
when there was basically no wealth middle class.

131
0:05:34.34,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So this is an important change,

132
0:05:35.917,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality

133
0:05:40.532,000 --> 0:05:43,000
has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,

134
0:05:43.838,000 --> 0:05:46,000
although the total quantity of wealth has recovered.

135
0:05:47.347,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Okay? So this is the total value

136
0:05:49.294,000 --> 0:05:51,000
of wealth relative to income,

137
0:05:51.51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and you can see that in particular in Europe,

138
0:05:53.623,000 --> 0:05:56,000
we are almost back to the pre-World War I level.

139
0:05:57.483,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So there are really two

140
0:05:59.328,000 --> 0:06:01,000
different parts of the story here.

141
0:06:01.859,000 --> 0:06:02,000
One has to do with

142
0:06:02.978,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,

143
0:06:05.42,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and there is nothing bad per se, of course,

144
0:06:07.098,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in accumulating a lot of wealth,

145
0:06:08.845,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and in particular if it is more diffuse

146
0:06:11.713,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and less concentrated.

147
0:06:13.107,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So what we really want to focus on

148
0:06:15.852,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,

149
0:06:18.233,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and what's going to happen in the future.

150
0:06:20.533,000 --> 0:06:22,000
How can we account for the fact that

151
0:06:22.558,000 --> 0:06:25,000
until World War I, wealth inequality was so high

152
0:06:26.22,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,

153
0:06:29.41,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and how can we think about the future?

154
0:06:32.737,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So let me come to some of the explanations

155
0:06:36.623,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and speculations about the future.

156
0:06:38.759,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Let me first say that

157
0:06:40.354,000 --> 0:06:41,000
probably the best model to explain

158
0:06:42.341,000 --> 0:06:44,000
why wealth is so much

159
0:06:44.438,000 --> 0:06:46,000
more concentrated than income

160
0:06:46.624,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is a dynamic, dynastic model

161
0:06:49.736,000 --> 0:06:51,000
where individuals have a long horizon

162
0:06:52.2,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.

163
0:06:54.956,000 --> 0:06:56,000
If people were accumulating wealth

164
0:06:57.566,000 --> 0:06:59,000
only for life cycle reasons,

165
0:06:59.569,000 --> 0:07:01,000
you know, to be able to consume

166
0:07:01.582,000 --> 0:07:02,000
when they are old,

167
0:07:03.169,000 --> 0:07:05,000
then the level of wealth inequality

168
0:07:05.542,000 --> 0:07:07,000
should be more or less in line

169
0:07:07.859,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with the level of income inequality.

170
0:07:09.828,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But it will be very difficult to explain

171
0:07:11.756,000 --> 0:07:13,000
why you have so much more wealth inequality

172
0:07:13.95,000 --> 0:07:14,000
than income inequality

173
0:07:15.434,000 --> 0:07:16,000
with a pure life cycle model,

174
0:07:16.71,000 --> 0:07:18,000
so you need a story

175
0:07:18.741,000 --> 0:07:19,000
where people also care

176
0:07:20.429,000 --> 0:07:22,000
about wealth accumulation for other reasons.

177
0:07:22.96,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So typically, they want to transmit

178
0:07:24.884,000 --> 0:07:27,000
wealth to the next generation, to their children,

179
0:07:28.21,000 --> 0:07:29,000
or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth

180
0:07:29.978,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because of the prestige, the power that goes with wealth.

181
0:07:32.746,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So there must be other reasons

182
0:07:34.13,000 --> 0:07:35,000
for accumulating wealth than just life cycle

183
0:07:36.12,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to explain what we see in the data.

184
0:07:38.888,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now, in a large class of dynamic models

185
0:07:42.234,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of wealth accumulation

186
0:07:44.21,000 --> 0:07:47,000
with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth,

187
0:07:47.768,000 --> 0:07:49,000
you will have all sorts of random,

188
0:07:50.614,000 --> 0:07:5,000
multiplicative shocks.

189
0:07:51.537,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So for instance, some families

190
0:07:53.786,000 --> 0:07:54,000
have a very large number of children,

191
0:07:55.473,000 --> 0:07:56,000
so the wealth will be divided.

192
0:07:57.239,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Some families have fewer children.

193
0:07:59.129,000 --> 0:08:01,000
You also have shocks to rates of return.

194
0:08:01.357,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Some families make huge capital gains.

195
0:08:03.454,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Some made bad investments.

196
0:08:05.249,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So you will always have some mobility

197
0:08:07.49,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in the wealth process.

198
0:08:08.928,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Some people will move up, some people will move down.

199
0:08:11.303,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The important point is that,

200
0:08:12.955,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in any such model,

201
0:08:13.965,000 --> 0:08:15,000
for a given variance of such shocks,

202
0:08:16.521,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the equilibrium level of wealth inequality

203
0:08:18.557,000 --> 0:08:22,000
will be a steeply rising function of r minus g.

204
0:08:23.394,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And intuitively, the reason why the difference

205
0:08:26.263,000 --> 0:08:27,000
between the rate of return to wealth

206
0:08:28.107,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and the growth rate is important

207
0:08:29.862,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is that initial wealth inequalities

208
0:08:32.174,000 --> 0:08:34,000
will be amplified at a faster pace

209
0:08:34.565,000 --> 0:08:36,000
with a bigger r minus g.

210
0:08:36.634,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So take a simple example,

211
0:08:38.108,000 --> 0:08:41,000
with r equals five percent and g equals one percent,

212
0:08:41.874,000 --> 0:08:43,000
wealth holders only need to reinvest

213
0:08:43.982,000 --> 0:08:45,000
one fifth of their capital income to ensure

214
0:08:46.621,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that their wealth rises as fast

215
0:08:49.354,000 --> 0:08:5,000
as the size of the economy.

216
0:08:51.267,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So this makes it easier

217
0:08:52.65,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to build and perpetuate large fortunes

218
0:08:54.416,000 --> 0:08:55,000
because you can consume four fifths,

219
0:08:56.371,000 --> 0:08:57,000
assuming zero tax,

220
0:08:58.11,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and you can just reinvest one fifth.

221
0:08:59.771,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So of course some families will consume more than that,

222
0:09:02.359,000 --> 0:09:03,000
some will consume less, so there will be

223
0:09:04.102,000 --> 0:09:05,000
some mobility in the distribution,

224
0:09:05.857,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,

225
0:09:08.703,000 --> 0:09:11,000
so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.

226
0:09:12.472,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now, you should not be surprised

227
0:09:14.969,000 --> 0:09:17,000
by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,

228
0:09:18.505,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because, in fact, this is what happened

229
0:09:20.121,000 --> 0:09:22,000
during most of the history of mankind.

230
0:09:22.192,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And this was in a way very obvious to everybody

231
0:09:25.543,000 --> 0:09:26,000
for a simple reason, which is that growth

232
0:09:27.321,000 --> 0:09:29,000
was close to zero percent

233
0:09:29.509,000 --> 0:09:3,000
during most of the history of mankind.

234
0:09:31.13,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Growth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,

235
0:09:34.662,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but very slow growth of population

236
0:09:36.658,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and output per capita,

237
0:09:38.655,000 --> 0:09:39,000
whereas the rate of return on capital

238
0:09:40.539,000 --> 0:09:41,000
of course was not zero percent.

239
0:09:42.395,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It was, for land assets, which was

240
0:09:44.431,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the traditional form

241
0:09:46.24,000 --> 0:09:48,000
of assets in preindustrial societies,

242
0:09:48.641,000 --> 0:09:49,000
it was typically five percent.

243
0:09:50.404,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Any reader of Jane Austen would know that.

244
0:09:54.19,000 --> 0:09:56,000
If you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds,

245
0:09:57.098,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you should have a capital value

246
0:09:58.74,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of 20,000 pounds so that

247
0:10:00.596,000 --> 0:10:02,000
five percent of 20,000 is 1,000.

248
0:10:03.146,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And in a way, this was

249
0:10:05.163,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the very foundation of society,

250
0:10:06.941,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because r bigger than g

251
0:10:09.976,000 --> 0:10:13,000
was what allowed holders of wealth and assets

252
0:10:14.1,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to live off their capital income

253
0:10:16.79,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and to do something else in life

254
0:10:19.49,000 --> 0:10:22,000
than just to care about their own survival.

255
0:10:22.685,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now, one important conclusion

256
0:10:24.845,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of my historical research is that

257
0:10:26.836,000 --> 0:10:28,000
modern industrial growth did not change

258
0:10:29.547,000 --> 0:10:31,000
this basic fact as much as one might have expected.

259
0:10:32.371,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Of course, the growth rate

260
0:10:34.05,000 --> 0:10:35,000
following the Industrial Revolution

261
0:10:35.858,000 --> 0:10:39,000
rose, typically from zero to one to two percent,

262
0:10:40.18,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but at the same time, the rate of return

263
0:10:42.11,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to capital also rose

264
0:10:43.755,000 --> 0:10:45,000
so that the gap between the two

265
0:10:46.18,000 --> 0:10:47,000
did not really change.

266
0:10:47.636,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So during the 20th century,

267
0:10:49.886,000 --> 0:10:51,000
you had a very unique combination of events.

268
0:10:52.53,000 --> 0:10:54,000
First, a very low rate of return

269
0:10:54.547,000 --> 0:10:57,000
due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,

270
0:10:57.563,000 --> 0:10:59,000
destruction of wealth, inflation,

271
0:10:59.868,000 --> 0:11:,000
bankruptcy during the Great Depression,

272
0:11:01.848,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and all of this reduced

273
0:11:03.513,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the private rate of return to wealth

274
0:11:05.263,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to unusually low levels

275
0:11:07.158,000 --> 0:11:09,000
between 1914 and 1945.

276
0:11:09.497,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And then, in the postwar period,

277
0:11:11.333,000 --> 0:11:14,000
you had unusually high growth rate,

278
0:11:14.57,000 --> 0:11:16,000
partly due to the reconstruction.

279
0:11:16.944,000 --> 0:11:17,000
You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,

280
0:11:18.869,000 --> 0:11:19,000
you had five percent growth rate

281
0:11:20.42,000 --> 0:11:23,000
between 1950 and 1980

282
0:11:23.57,000 --> 0:11:24,000
largely due to reconstruction,

283
0:11:25.213,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and also due to very large demographic growth,

284
0:11:27.564,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the Baby Boom Cohort effect.

285
0:11:29.705,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Now, apparently that's not going to last for very long,

286
0:11:32.143,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or at least the population growth

287
0:11:33.818,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is supposed to decline in the future,

288
0:11:36.586,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and the best projections we have is that

289
0:11:40.242,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the long-run growth is going to be closer

290
0:11:42.07,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to one to two percent

291
0:11:43.493,000 --> 0:11:44,000
rather than four to five percent.

292
0:11:45.439,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So if you look at this,

293
0:11:48.116,000 --> 0:11:5,000
these are the best estimates we have

294
0:11:50.257,000 --> 0:11:51,000
of world GDP growth

295
0:11:51.913,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and rate of return on capital,

296
0:11:54.272,000 --> 0:11:56,000
average rates of return on capital,

297
0:11:56.36,000 --> 0:11:57,000
so you can see that during most

298
0:11:57.428,000 --> 0:11:58,000
of the history of mankind,

299
0:11:58.945,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the growth rate was very small,

300
0:12:00.558,000 --> 0:12:01,000
much lower than the rate of return,

301
0:12:02.392,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and then during the 20th century,

302
0:12:04.754,000 --> 0:12:06,000
it is really the population growth,

303
0:12:06.925,000 --> 0:12:08,000
very high in the postwar period,

304
0:12:09.197,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and the reconstruction process

305
0:12:10.797,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that brought growth

306
0:12:12.37,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to a smaller gap with the rate of return.

307
0:12:15.441,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Here I use the United Nations population projections,

308
0:12:18.964,000 --> 0:12:2,000
so of course they are uncertain.

309
0:12:21.44,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It could be that we all start

310
0:12:22.831,000 --> 0:12:24,000
having a lot of children in the future,

311
0:12:24.937,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and the growth rates are going to be higher,

312
0:12:27.702,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but from now on,

313
0:12:28.951,000 --> 0:12:3,000
these are the best projections we have,

314
0:12:31.753,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and this will make global growth

315
0:12:33.687,000 --> 0:12:35,000
decline and the gap between

316
0:12:36.443,000 --> 0:12:38,000
the rate of return go up.

317
0:12:38.446,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Now, the other unusual event

318
0:12:41.308,000 --> 0:12:42,000
during the 20th century

319
0:12:42.979,000 --> 0:12:43,000
was, as I said,

320
0:12:44.308,000 --> 0:12:46,000
destruction, taxation of capital,

321
0:12:46.624,000 --> 0:12:48,000
so this is the pre-tax rate of return.

322
0:12:49.359,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This is the after-tax rate of return,

323
0:12:52.338,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and after destruction,

324
0:12:53.904,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and this is what brought

325
0:12:55.681,000 --> 0:12:56,000
the average rate of return

326
0:12:57.369,000 --> 0:12:58,000
after tax, after destruction,

327
0:12:59.158,000 --> 0:13:01,000
below the growth rate during a long time period.

328
0:13:01.578,000 --> 0:13:02,000
But without the destruction,

329
0:13:03.252,000 --> 0:13:05,000
without the taxation, this would not have happened.

330
0:13:05.727,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So let me say that the balance between

331
0:13:08.97,000 --> 0:13:1,000
returns on capital and growth

332
0:13:11.326,000 --> 0:13:12,000
depends on many different factors

333
0:13:13.188,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that are very difficult to predict:

334
0:13:15.273,000 --> 0:13:17,000
technology and the development

335
0:13:17.388,000 --> 0:13:19,000
of capital-intensive techniques.

336
0:13:19.972,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So right now, the most capital-intensive sectors

337
0:13:22.991,000 --> 0:13:25,000
in the economy are the real estate sector, housing,

338
0:13:26.367,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the energy sector, but it could be in the future

339
0:13:29.229,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors

340
0:13:32.941,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and that this would be a bigger share

341
0:13:34.83,000 --> 0:13:35,000
of the total capital stock that it is today.

342
0:13:36.74,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Well, we are very far from this,

343
0:13:38.734,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and from now, what's going on

344
0:13:40.5,000 --> 0:13:41,000
in the real estate sector, the energy sector,

345
0:13:42.289,000 --> 0:13:44,000
is much more important for the total capital stock

346
0:13:44.415,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and capital share.

347
0:13:45.549,000 --> 0:13:47,000
The other important issue

348
0:13:47.582,000 --> 0:13:49,000
is that there are scale effects in portfolio management,

349
0:13:49.732,000 --> 0:13:51,000
together with financial complexity,

350
0:13:52.151,000 --> 0:13:53,000
financial deregulation,

351
0:13:53.601,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that make it easier to get higher rates of return

352
0:13:56.31,000 --> 0:13:57,000
for a large portfolio,

353
0:13:57.937,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and this seems to be particularly strong

354
0:14:00.6,000 --> 0:14:01,000
for billionaires, large capital endowments.

355
0:14:02.582,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Just to give you one example,

356
0:14:04.872,000 --> 0:14:07,000
this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings

357
0:14:08.205,000 --> 0:14:11,000
over the 1987-2013 period,

358
0:14:11.535,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and you can see the very top wealth holders

359
0:14:14.323,000 --> 0:14:17,000
have been going up at six, seven percent per year

360
0:14:17.44,000 --> 0:14:19,000
in real terms above inflation,

361
0:14:19.831,000 --> 0:14:21,000
whereas average income in the world,

362
0:14:22.203,000 --> 0:14:23,000
average wealth in the world,

363
0:14:23.566,000 --> 0:14:26,000
have increased at only two percent per year.

364
0:14:26.949,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And you find the same

365
0:14:28.678,000 --> 0:14:29,000
for large university endowments —

366
0:14:29.954,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the bigger the initial endowments,

367
0:14:32.222,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the bigger the rate of return.

368
0:14:34.29,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Now, what could be done?

369
0:14:35.968,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The first thing is that I think we need

370
0:14:38.364,000 --> 0:14:4,000
more financial transparency.

371
0:14:40.479,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We know too little about global wealth dynamics,

372
0:14:44.32,000 --> 0:14:45,000
so we need international transmission

373
0:14:46.22,000 --> 0:14:47,000
of bank information.

374
0:14:47.482,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We need a global registry of financial assets,

375
0:14:50.168,000 --> 0:14:52,000
more coordination on wealth taxation,

376
0:14:52.659,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and even wealth tax with a small tax rate

377
0:14:55.771,000 --> 0:14:57,000
will be a way to produce information

378
0:14:57.987,000 --> 0:14:59,000
so that then we can adapt our policies

379
0:15:00.669,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to whatever we observe.

380
0:15:02.505,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And to some extent, the fight

381
0:15:04.343,000 --> 0:15:05,000
against tax havens

382
0:15:05.824,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and automatic transmission of information

383
0:15:07.639,000 --> 0:15:08,000
is pushing us in this direction.

384
0:15:09.49,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,

385
0:15:11.814,000 --> 0:15:13,000
which it can be tempting to use.

386
0:15:14.771,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Inflation:

387
0:15:16.127,000 --> 0:15:17,000
it's much easier to print money

388
0:15:17.826,000 --> 0:15:19,000
than to write a tax code, so that's very tempting,

389
0:15:19.981,000 --> 0:15:21,000
but sometimes you don't know what you do with the money.

390
0:15:22.101,000 --> 0:15:23,000
This is a problem.

391
0:15:23.748,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Expropriation is very tempting.

392
0:15:25.611,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Just when you feel some people get too wealthy,

393
0:15:27.872,000 --> 0:15:28,000
you just expropriate them.

394
0:15:29.166,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But this is not a very efficient way

395
0:15:30.878,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics.

396
0:15:33.711,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So war is an even less efficient way,

397
0:15:36.19,000 --> 0:15:38,000
so I tend to prefer progressive taxation,

398
0:15:38.526,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but of course, history — (Laughter) —

399
0:15:41.1,000 --> 0:15:42,000
history will invent its own best ways,

400
0:15:42.835,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and it will probably involve

401
0:15:44.533,000 --> 0:15:45,000
a combination of all of these.

402
0:15:46.267,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Thank you.

403
0:15:48.133,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Applause)

404
0:15:50.27,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Bruno Giussani: Thomas Piketty. Thank you.

405
0:15:55.829,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Thomas, I want to ask you two or three questions,

406
0:15:57.708,000 --> 0:16:,000
because it's impressive how you're in command of your data, of course,

407
0:16:01.567,000 --> 0:16:04,000
but basically what you suggest is

408
0:16:05.361,000 --> 0:16:06,000
growing wealth concentration is kind of

409
0:16:06.934,000 --> 0:16:07,000
a natural tendency of capitalism,

410
0:16:08.858,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and if we leave it to its own devices,

411
0:16:12.396,000 --> 0:16:14,000
it may threaten the system itself,

412
0:16:14.636,000 --> 0:16:15,000
so you're suggesting that we need to act

413
0:16:16.362,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to implement policies that redistribute wealth,

414
0:16:19.4,000 --> 0:16:2,000
including the ones we just saw:

415
0:16:21.121,000 --> 0:16:22,000
progressive taxation, etc.

416
0:16:22.592,000 --> 0:16:24,000
In the current political context,

417
0:16:24.731,000 --> 0:16:25,000
how realistic are those?

418
0:16:26.722,000 --> 0:16:27,000
How likely do you think that it is

419
0:16:28.533,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that they will be implemented?

420
0:16:30.277,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Thomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think

421
0:16:31.488,000 --> 0:16:32,000
if you look back through time,

422
0:16:33.269,000 --> 0:16:35,000
the history of income, wealth and taxation

423
0:16:35.92,000 --> 0:16:36,000
is full of surprise.

424
0:16:37.522,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So I am not terribly impressed

425
0:16:40.127,000 --> 0:16:41,000
by those who know in advance

426
0:16:41.695,000 --> 0:16:42,000
what will or will not happen.

427
0:16:43.326,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I think one century ago,

428
0:16:45.03,000 --> 0:16:46,000
many people would have said

429
0:16:46.599,000 --> 0:16:48,000
that progressive income taxation would never happen

430
0:16:48.737,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and then it happened.

431
0:16:50.257,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And even five years ago,

432
0:16:52.246,000 --> 0:16:54,000
many people would have said that bank secrecy

433
0:16:54.598,000 --> 0:16:56,000
will be with us forever in Switzerland,

434
0:16:56.623,000 --> 0:16:57,000
that Switzerland was too powerful

435
0:16:58.411,000 --> 0:16:59,000
for the rest of the world,

436
0:16:59.9,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions

437
0:17:02.861,000 --> 0:17:04,000
against Swiss banks for a big change to happen,

438
0:17:05.483,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and now we are moving toward

439
0:17:07.186,000 --> 0:17:08,000
more financial transparency.

440
0:17:08.862,000 --> 0:17:12,000
So I think it's not that difficult

441
0:17:13.143,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to better coordinate politically.

442
0:17:15.612,000 --> 0:17:17,000
We are going to have a treaty

443
0:17:17.67,000 --> 0:17:2,000
with half of the world GDP around the table

444
0:17:20.719,000 --> 0:17:22,000
with the U.S. and the European Union,

445
0:17:22.721,000 --> 0:17:24,000
so if half of the world GDP is not enough

446
0:17:24.847,000 --> 0:17:26,000
to make progress on financial transparency

447
0:17:27.513,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits,

448
0:17:31.597,000 --> 0:17:32,000
what does it take?

449
0:17:33.261,000 --> 0:17:36,000
So I think these are not technical difficulties.

450
0:17:36.884,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I think we can make progress

451
0:17:38.808,000 --> 0:17:4,000
if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions

452
0:17:41.395,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and we have the proper sanctions

453
0:17:43.296,000 --> 0:17:45,000
on those who benefit from financial opacity.

454
0:17:46.287,000 --> 0:17:47,000
BG: One of the arguments

455
0:17:47.94,000 --> 0:17:48,000
against your point of view

456
0:17:49.373,000 --> 0:17:5,000
is that economic inequality

457
0:17:50.815,000 --> 0:17:53,000
is not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines.

458
0:17:54.452,000 --> 0:17:56,000
So we take measures to lower inequality,

459
0:17:57.253,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and at the same time we lower growth, potentially.

460
0:17:59.66,000 --> 0:18:,000
What do you answer to that?

461
0:18:01.22,000 --> 0:18:02,000
TP: Yeah, I think inequality

462
0:18:02.949,000 --> 0:18:03,000
is not a problem per se.

463
0:18:04.838,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I think inequality up to a point

464
0:18:06.878,000 --> 0:18:08,000
can actually be useful for innovation and growth.

465
0:18:09.53,000 --> 0:18:11,000
The problem is, it's a question of degree.

466
0:18:11.723,000 --> 0:18:13,000
When inequality gets too extreme,

467
0:18:14.267,000 --> 0:18:16,000
then it becomes useless for growth

468
0:18:17.156,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and it can even become bad

469
0:18:18.618,000 --> 0:18:21,000
because it tends to lead to high perpetuation

470
0:18:21.675,000 --> 0:18:22,000
of inequality over time

471
0:18:23.311,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and low mobility.

472
0:18:25.177,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations

473
0:18:28.463,000 --> 0:18:3,000
that we had in the 19th century

474
0:18:31.34,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and pretty much until World War I

475
0:18:33.265,000 --> 0:18:34,000
in every European country

476
0:18:35.03,000 --> 0:18:37,000
was, I think, not useful for growth.

477
0:18:37.124,000 --> 0:18:39,000
This was destroyed by a combination

478
0:18:39.226,000 --> 0:18:41,000
of tragic events and policy changes,

479
0:18:41.567,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and this did not prevent growth from happening.

480
0:18:43.839,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And also, extreme inequality can be bad

481
0:18:47.282,000 --> 0:18:49,000
for our democratic institutions

482
0:18:49.48,000 --> 0:18:51,000
if it creates very unequal access to political voice,

483
0:18:51.863,000 --> 0:18:52,000
and the influence of private money

484
0:18:53.728,000 --> 0:18:55,000
in U.S. politics, I think,

485
0:18:55.73,000 --> 0:18:57,000
is a matter of concern right now.

486
0:18:58.27,000 --> 0:19:01,000
So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme,

487
0:19:01.346,000 --> 0:19:03,000
pre-World War I inequality.

488
0:19:03.436,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Having a decent share of the national wealth

489
0:19:07.11,000 --> 0:19:1,000
for the middle class is not bad for growth.

490
0:19:10.5,000 --> 0:19:11,000
It is actually useful

491
0:19:11.781,000 --> 0:19:14,000
both for equity and efficiency reasons.

492
0:19:14.865,000 --> 0:19:15,000
BG: I said at the beginning

493
0:19:16.53,000 --> 0:19:18,000
that your book has been criticized.

494
0:19:18.639,000 --> 0:19:19,000
Some of your data has been criticized.

495
0:19:19.88,000 --> 0:19:21,000
Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized.

496
0:19:22.346,000 --> 0:19:23,000
You have been accused of cherry-picking data

497
0:19:24.222,000 --> 0:19:26,000
to make your case. What do you answer to that?

498
0:19:26.959,000 --> 0:19:27,000
TP: Well, I answer that I am very happy

499
0:19:28.886,000 --> 0:19:3,000
that this book is stimulating debate.

500
0:19:31.353,000 --> 0:19:33,000
This is part of what it is intended for.

501
0:19:33.834,000 --> 0:19:36,000
Look, the reason why I put all the data online

502
0:19:37.128,000 --> 0:19:38,000
with all of the detailed computation

503
0:19:38.974,000 --> 0:19:4,000
is so that we can have an open and transparent

504
0:19:41.308,000 --> 0:19:42,000
debate about this.

505
0:19:42.977,000 --> 0:19:43,000
So I have responded point by point

506
0:19:44.743,000 --> 0:19:45,000
to every concern.

507
0:19:46.535,000 --> 0:19:49,000
Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today,

508
0:19:49.648,000 --> 0:19:5,000
I would actually conclude

509
0:19:51.189,000 --> 0:19:53,000
that the rise in wealth inequality,

510
0:19:53.383,000 --> 0:19:54,000
particularly in the United States,

511
0:19:55.31,000 --> 0:19:57,000
has been actually higher than what I report in my book.

512
0:19:57.683,000 --> 0:20:,000
There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman

513
0:20:00.928,000 --> 0:20:01,000
showing, with new data

514
0:20:02.52,000 --> 0:20:03,000
which I didn't have at the time of the book,

515
0:20:04.297,000 --> 0:20:06,000
that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen

516
0:20:06.824,000 --> 0:20:07,000
even more than what I report.

517
0:20:08.76,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And there will be other data in the future.

518
0:20:10.791,000 --> 0:20:12,000
Some of it will go in different directions.

519
0:20:12.942,000 --> 0:20:16,000
Look, we put online almost every week

520
0:20:17.041,000 --> 0:20:19,000
new, updated series on the World Top Income Database

521
0:20:19.975,000 --> 0:20:2,000
and we will keep doing so in the future,

522
0:20:21.875,000 --> 0:20:23,000
in particular in emerging countries,

523
0:20:24.181,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and I welcome all of those who want to contribute

524
0:20:27.11,000 --> 0:20:29,000
to this data collection process.

525
0:20:29.456,000 --> 0:20:31,000
In fact, I certainly agree

526
0:20:32.264,000 --> 0:20:33,000
that there is not enough

527
0:20:33.878,000 --> 0:20:34,000
transparency about wealth dynamics,

528
0:20:35.756,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and a good way to have better data

529
0:20:37.671,000 --> 0:20:38,000
would be to have a wealth tax

530
0:20:39.536,000 --> 0:20:4,000
with a small tax rate to begin with

531
0:20:41.107,000 --> 0:20:43,000
so that we can all agree

532
0:20:43.446,000 --> 0:20:44,000
about this important evolution

533
0:20:45.01,000 --> 0:20:48,000
and adapt our policies to whatever we observe.

534
0:20:48.337,000 --> 0:20:5,000
So taxation is a source of knowledge,

535
0:20:50.399,000 --> 0:20:52,000
and that's what we need the most right now.

536
0:20:53.335,000 --> 0:20:54,000
BG: Thomas Piketty, merci beaucoup.

537
0:20:55.15,000 --> 0:20:59,000
Thank you. TP: Thank you. (Applause)

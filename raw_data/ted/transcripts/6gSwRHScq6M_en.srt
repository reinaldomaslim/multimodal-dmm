1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Now this is a very un-TED-like thing to do,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but let's kick off the afternoon

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with a message

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from a mystery sponsor.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Anonymous: Dear Fox News,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
it has come to our unfortunate attention

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that both the name and nature of Anonymous

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
has been ravaged.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We are everyone. We are no one.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We are anonymous. We are legion.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We do not forgive. We do not forget.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We are but the base of chaos.

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Misha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen --

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
a sophisticated group

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of politically motivated hackers

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
who have emerged in 2011.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And they're pretty scary.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
You never know when they're going to attack next,

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who or what the consequences will be.

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But interestingly,

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they have a sense of humor.

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to announce President Obama's assassination.

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in the newsroom at Fox.

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"What do we do now?

27
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?"

28
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And of course, who could escape the irony

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
being a victim of hacking for a change.

32
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Applause)

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Sometimes you turn on the news

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?"

36
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Sony Playstation Network -- done,

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the government of Turkey -- tick,

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency -- a breeze,

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the CIA -- falling off a log.

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
In fact, a friend of mine from the security industry

41
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
told me the other day

42
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that there are two types of companies in the world:

43
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
those that know they've been hacked, and those that don't.

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I mean three companies

45
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
providing cybersecurity services to the FBI

46
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
have been hacked.

47
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake?

48
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Anyway, this mysterious group Anonymous --

49
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and they would say this themselves --

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
they are providing a service

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
by demonstrating how useless companies are

52
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
at protecting our data.

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous --

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
they are ideologically driven.

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They claim that they are battling

56
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
a dastardly conspiracy.

57
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They say that governments are trying

58
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to take over the Internet and control it,

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and that they, Anonymous,

60
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
are the authentic voice of resistance --

61
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships,

62
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
against global media corporations,

63
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or against intelligence agencies,

64
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or whoever it is.

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And their politics are not entirely unattractive.

66
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Okay, they're a little inchoate.

67
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
There's a strong whiff

68
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of half-baked anarchism about them.

69
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But one thing is true:

70
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we are at the beginning

71
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of a mighty struggle

72
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for control of the Internet.

73
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The Web links everything,

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and very soon

75
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it will mediate most human activity.

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Because the Internet has fashioned

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a new and complicated environment

78
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
for an old-age dilemma

79
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that pits the demands of security

80
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
with the desire for freedom.

81
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now this is a very complicated struggle.

82
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me,

83
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we probably can't understand it very well.

84
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Nonetheless,

85
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in an unexpected attack of hubris

86
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
a couple of years ago,

87
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I decided I would try and do that.

88
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I sort of get it.

89
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
These were the various things that I was looking at

90
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
as I was trying to understand it.

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But in order to try and explain the whole thing,

92
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it,

93
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion,

94
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and let me assure you that all of these issues

95
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet

96
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
one way or the other,

97
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but in a configuration

98
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty

99
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
trying to get his head around.

100
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So there you are.

101
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And as you see, in the middle,

102
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
there is our old friend, the hacker.

103
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The hacker is absolutely central

104
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to many of the political, social

105
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and economic issues affecting the Net.

106
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so I thought to myself,

107
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to."

108
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And what do you know,

109
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
nobody else does talk to the hackers.

110
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
They're completely anonymous, as it were.

111
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So despite the fact

112
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that we are beginning to pour billions,

113
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
hundreds of billions of dollars,

114
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
into cybersecurity --

115
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
for the most extraordinary technical solutions --

116
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
no one wants to talk

117
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to these guys, the hackers,

118
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who are doing everything.

119
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Instead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions,

120
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
which cost a huge amount of money.

121
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And so nothing is going into the hackers.

122
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Well, I say nothing,

123
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit

124
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in Turin, Italy

125
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
called the Hackers Profiling Project.

126
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And they are doing some fantastic research

127
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
into the characteristics,

128
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
into the abilities

129
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and the socialization of hackers.

130
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But because they're a U.N. operation,

131
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
maybe that's why governments and corporations

132
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
are not that interested in them.

133
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Because it's a U.N. operation,

134
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
of course, it lacks funding.

135
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But I think they're doing very important work.

136
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Because where we have a surplus of technology

137
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in the cybersecurity industry,

138
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we have a definite lack of --

139
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
call me old-fashioned --

140
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
human intelligence.

141
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, so far I've mentioned

142
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the hackers Anonymous

143
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
who are a politically motivated hacking group.

144
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Of course, the criminal justice system

145
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
treats them as common old garden criminals.

146
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But interestingly,

147
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information

148
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
for financial gain.

149
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But what about the real cybercriminals?

150
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Well real organized crime on the Internet

151
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
goes back about 10 years

152
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers

153
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
developed a website,

154
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which led to the industrialization

155
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
of cybercrime.

156
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.

157
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is how they were advertising themselves

158
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
a decade ago on the Net.

159
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.

160
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Cybercriminals would go there

161
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to buy and sell stolen credit card details,

162
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to exchange information

163
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
about new malware that was out there.

164
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And remember, this is a time

165
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
when we're seeing for the first time

166
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
so-called off-the-shelf malware.

167
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff,

168
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
which you can deploy

169
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker.

170
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket

171
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
for cybercriminals.

172
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And its creators

173
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial,

174
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because they were faced

175
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.

176
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And that challenge is:

177
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
How do you do business,

178
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
how do you trust

179
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
somebody on the Web who you want to do business with

180
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
when you know that they're a criminal?

181
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

182
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's axiomatic that they're dodgy,

183
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and they're going to want to try and rip you off.

184
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known,

185
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
came up with this brilliant idea

186
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
called the escrow system.

187
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
They appointed an officer

188
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.

189
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details;

190
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.

191
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The purchaser would send the administrative officer

192
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
some dollars digitally,

193
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.

194
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And the officer would then verify

195
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
if the stolen credit card worked.

196
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And if they did,

197
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
he then passed on the money to the vendor

198
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.

199
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And it was this

200
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.

201
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And after that, it just went wild.

202
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We had a champagne decade

203
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
for people who we know as Carders.

204
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now I spoke to one of these Carders

205
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
who we'll call RedBrigade --

206
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
although that wasn't even his proper nickname --

207
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was.

208
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004

209
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
he would go on sprees in New York,

210
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
taking out $10,000 from an ATM here,

211
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
$30,000 from an ATM there,

212
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
using cloned credit cards.

213
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
He was making, on average a week,

214
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
$150,000 --

215
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
tax free of course.

216
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And he said

217
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that he had so much money

218
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point

219
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that he just didn't know what to do with it

220
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and actually fell into a depression.

221
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But that's a slightly different story,

222
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which I won't go into now.

223
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade

224
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is that he wasn't an advanced hacker.

225
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
He sort of understood the technology,

226
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and he realized that security was very important

227
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
if you were going to be a Carder,

228
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but he didn't spend his days and nights

229
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
bent over a computer, eating pizza,

230
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
drinking coke and that sort of thing.

231
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
He was out there on the town

232
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
having a fab time enjoying the high life.

233
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And this is because

234
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
hackers are only one element

235
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in a cybercriminal enterprise.

236
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And often they're the most vulnerable element of all.

237
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And I want to explain this to you

238
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
by introducing you to six characters

239
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
who I met

240
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
while I was doing this research.

241
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Dimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT --

242
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.

243
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Now he developed his social and moral compass

244
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
on the Black Sea port during the 1990s.

245
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This was a sink-or-swim environment

246
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities

247
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
was entirely necessary

248
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
if you wanted to survive.

249
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
As an accomplished computer user,

250
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
what Dimitry did

251
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown

252
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
onto the Worldwide Web.

253
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And he did a great job in it.

254
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
You have to understand though

255
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that from his ninth birthday,

256
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the only environment he knew

257
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
was gangsterism.

258
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
He knew no other way of making a living

259
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and making money.

260
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam,

261
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
aka JiLsi --

262
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
founder of DarkMarket,

263
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
born in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

264
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
As an eight year-old,

265
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital

266
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city,

267
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
looking for Tamils like Renu to murder.

268
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
At 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military,

269
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
accused of being a terrorist,

270
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and his parents sent him on his own to Britain

271
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
as a refugee seeking political asylum.

272
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
At 13,

273
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
with only little English and being bullied at school,

274
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
he escaped into a world of computers

275
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
where he showed great technical ability,

276
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but he was soon being seduced

277
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
by people on the Internet.

278
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud,

279
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London

280
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in 2012.

281
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Matrix001,

282
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
who was an administrator at DarkMarket.

283
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Born in Southern Germany

284
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to a stable and well-respected middle class family,

285
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
his obsession with gaming as a teenager

286
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
led him to hacking.

287
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world

288
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
where he stored his games

289
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that he had cracked and pirated.

290
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
His slide into criminality

291
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
was incremental.

292
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And when he finally woke up to his situation

293
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and understood the implications,

294
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
he was already in too deep.

295
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Max Vision, aka ICEMAN --

296
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
mastermind of CardersMarket.

297
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Born in Meridian, Idaho.

298
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers

299
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
working out of Santa Clara, California

300
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
in the late 90s for private companies

301
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and voluntarily for the FBI.

302
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Now in the late 1990s,

303
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
he discovered a vulnerability

304
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
on all U.S. government networks,

305
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and he went in and patched it up --

306
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
because this included nuclear research facilities --

307
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
sparing the American government

308
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
a huge security embarrassment.

309
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But also, because he was an inveterate hacker,

310
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
he left a tiny digital wormhole

311
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
through which he alone could crawl.

312
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator,

313
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and he was convicted.

314
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
At his open prison,

315
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
he came under the influence of financial fraudsters,

316
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and those financial fraudsters

317
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
persuaded him to work for them

318
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
on his release.

319
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And this man with a planetary-sized brain

320
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
is now serving a 13-year sentence

321
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in California.

322
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Adewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB --

323
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
master bank account cracker

324
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
from Abuja in Nigeria.

325
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup,

326
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
bankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk

327
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
before arriving in Britain

328
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
in 2005

329
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to take a Masters in chemical engineering

330
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
at Manchester University.

331
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
He impressed in the private sector,

332
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
developing chemical applications for the oil industry

333
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
while simultaneously running

334
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions

335
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
until his arrest in 2008.

336
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And then finally, Cagatay Evyapan,

337
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
aka Cha0 --

338
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
one of the most remarkable hackers ever,

339
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
from Ankara in Turkey.

340
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
He combined the tremendous skills of a geek

341
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
with the suave social engineering skills

342
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
of the master criminal.

343
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
One of the smartest people I've ever met.

344
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
He also had the most effective

345
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
virtual private network security arrangement

346
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
the police have ever encountered

347
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
amongst global cybercriminals.

348
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Now the important thing

349
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
about all of these people

350
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
is they share certain characteristics

351
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
despite the fact that they come from very different environments.

352
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
They are all people who learned their hacking skills

353
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
in their early to mid-teens.

354
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
They are all people

355
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
who demonstrate advanced ability

356
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
in maths and the sciences.

357
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills,

358
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
their moral compass had not yet developed.

359
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0,

360
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
they did not demonstrate

361
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
any real social skills in the outside world --

362
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
only on the Web.

363
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And the other thing is

364
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
the high incidence of hackers like these

365
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
who have characteristics which are consistent

366
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
with Asperger's syndrome.

367
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now I discussed this

368
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen

369
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.

370
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And he has done path-breaking work on autism

371
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and confirmed, also for the authorities here,

372
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that Gary McKinnon --

373
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
who is wanted by the United States

374
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
for hacking into the Pentagon --

375
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
suffers from Asperger's

376
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and a secondary condition

377
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
of depression.

378
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And Baron-Cohen explained

379
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that certain disabilities

380
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world

381
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
as tremendous skills,

382
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and that we should not be throwing in jail

383
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
people who have such disabilities and skills

384
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
because they have lost their way socially

385
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
or been duped.

386
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Now I think we're missing a trick here,

387
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail.

388
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And let me be blunt about this.

389
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
In China, in Russia and in loads of other countries

390
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities,

391
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
this is exactly what they are doing.

392
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
They are recruiting hackers

393
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
both before and after they become involved

394
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in criminal and industrial espionage activities --

395
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
are mobilizing them

396
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
on behalf of the state.

397
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
We need to engage

398
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and find ways of offering guidance

399
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
to these young people,

400
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
because they are a remarkable breed.

401
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And if we rely, as we do at the moment,

402
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
solely on the criminal justice system

403
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and the threat of punitive sentences,

404
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.

405
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Thank you very much for listening.

406
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
(Applause)

407
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Chris Anderson: So your idea worth spreading

408
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
is hire hackers.

409
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
How would someone get over that kind of fear

410
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
that the hacker they hire

411
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
might preserve that little teensy wormhole?

412
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
MG: I think to an extent,

413
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
you have to understand

414
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that.

415
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
They're just relentless and obsessive

416
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
about what they do.

417
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
But all of the people who I've spoken to

418
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
who have fallen foul of the law,

419
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
they have all said, "Please, please give us a chance

420
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
to work in the legitimate industry.

421
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.

422
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
We want to work with you."

423
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Chris Anderson: Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha.

424
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
(Applause)

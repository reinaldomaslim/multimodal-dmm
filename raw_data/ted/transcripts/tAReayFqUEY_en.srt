1
0:00:12.606,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well.

2
0:00:18.519,000 --> 0:00:22,000
After one trillion dollars in African development-related aid

3
0:00:22.971,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the last 60 years,

4
0:00:25.099,000 --> 0:00:29,000
real per capita income today is lower than it was in the 1970s.

5
0:00:30.867,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Aid is not doing too well.

6
0:00:33.17,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In response,

7
0:00:34.588,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the Bretton Woods institutions -- the IMF and the World Bank --

8
0:00:38.672,000 --> 0:00:41,000
pushed for free trade not aid,

9
0:00:42.226,000 --> 0:00:46,000
yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence

10
0:00:46.451,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that free trade leads to economic growth.

11
0:00:50.561,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit.

12
0:00:54.46,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea

13
0:00:58.177,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur.

14
0:01:02.031,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:05.328,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Yet my work and travel in 40-plus countries across Africa

16
0:01:10.698,000 --> 0:01:14,000
have taught me that most people want jobs instead.

17
0:01:15.615,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.

18
0:01:19.19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Let's invest in building pan-African titans

19
0:01:22.836,000 --> 0:01:26,000
like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.

20
0:01:27.061,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '98

21
0:01:32.959,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and built it into a mobile cellular provider

22
0:01:36.494,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with 24 million subscribers across 14 African countries by 2004.

23
0:01:44.076,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model,

24
0:01:47.745,000 --> 0:01:5,000
which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.

25
0:01:51.741,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa

26
0:01:54.357,000 --> 0:01:59,000
where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition.

27
0:01:59.624,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Consider these two alternative scenarios.

28
0:02:03.034,000 --> 0:02:09,000
One: You loan 200 dollars to each of 500 banana farmers

29
0:02:09.07,000 --> 0:02:11,000
allowing them to dry their surplus bananas

30
0:02:11.967,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market.

31
0:02:16.295,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Or two: You give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur

32
0:02:22.477,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income

33
0:02:27.695,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs.

34
0:02:33.747,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We invested in the second scenario,

35
0:02:36.371,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and backed 26-year-old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi

36
0:02:40.867,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to set up an agro-processing factory called Stawi

37
0:02:44.536,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to produce gluten-free banana-based flour and baby food.

38
0:02:50.242,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Stawi is leveraging economies of scale

39
0:02:53.283,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners

40
0:02:58.164,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but its workers, who have an ownership in the business.

41
0:03:02.579,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim,

42
0:03:08.708,000 --> 0:03:13,000
which requires skill, financing, local and global partnerships,

43
0:03:13.855,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and extraordinary perseverance.

44
0:03:16.525,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But why pan-African?

45
0:03:19.59,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of 1884 --

46
0:03:24.188,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where, quite frankly, we Africans were not exactly consulted --

47
0:03:28.924,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter) (Applause) --

48
0:03:35.542,000 --> 0:03:37,000
resulted in massive fragmentation

49
0:03:38.003,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and many sovereign states with small populations:

50
0:03:40.534,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Liberia, four million; Cape Verde, 500,000.

51
0:03:43.576,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Pan-Africa gives you one billion people,

52
0:03:46.315,000 --> 0:03:5,000
granted across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments,

53
0:03:50.472,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but our ancestors traded across the continent

54
0:03:53.705,000 --> 0:03:55,000
before Europeans drew lines around us.

55
0:03:56.282,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The pan-African opportunities outweigh the challenges,

56
0:03:59.719,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya

57
0:04:03.155,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, and anywhere else that will buy our food.

58
0:04:07.52,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We hope to help solve food security, empower farmers, create jobs,

59
0:04:11.514,000 --> 0:04:15,000
develop the local economy, and we hope to become rich in the process.

60
0:04:15.948,000 --> 0:04:17,000
While it's not the sexiest approach,

61
0:04:18.167,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel-good

62
0:04:20.415,000 --> 0:04:23,000
as giving a woman 100 dollars to buy a goat on kiva.org,

63
0:04:24.306,000 --> 0:04:27,000
perhaps supporting fewer, higher-impact entrepreneurs

64
0:04:28.231,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to build massive businesses that scale pan-Africa

65
0:04:31.204,000 --> 0:04:34,000
can help change this.

66
0:04:34.364,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The political freedom for which our forebearers fought

67
0:04:38.918,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is meaningless without economic freedom.

68
0:04:43.326,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom

69
0:04:46.136,000 --> 0:04:48,000
by building world-class businesses,

70
0:04:48.597,000 --> 0:04:49,000
creating indigenous wealth,

71
0:04:50.571,000 --> 0:04:53,000
providing jobs that we so desperately need,

72
0:04:53.705,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and hopefully helping achieve this.

73
0:04:57.792,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Africa shall rise.

74
0:05:00.694,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Thank you.

75
0:05:02.25,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Applause)

76
0:05:09.471,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course, this is strong rhetoric.

77
0:05:13.465,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You're making 100 percent contrast between microcredit

78
0:05:16.46,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and regular investment and growing regular investment.

79
0:05:20.825,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all?

80
0:05:23.277,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.

81
0:05:25.539,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Microcredit has been a great, innovative way

82
0:05:28.093,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid.

83
0:05:32.063,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But for the problems we face in Africa,

84
0:05:34.315,000 --> 0:05:35,000
when we are looking at the Marshall Plan

85
0:05:36.204,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to revitalize war-torn Europe,

86
0:05:37.821,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it was not full of donations of sheep.

87
0:05:39.904,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We need more than just microcredit.

88
0:05:41.626,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We need more than just give 200 dollars.

89
0:05:43.757,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We need to build big businesses, and we need jobs.

90
0:05:46.831,000 --> 0:05:48,000
TR: Very good. Thank you so much.

91
0:05:49.227,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

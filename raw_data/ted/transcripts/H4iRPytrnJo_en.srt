0:00:16.05,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.

3
0:00:22.141,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic.

4
0:00:28.901,000 --> 0:00:33,000
With complete control of everything the audience can see,

5
0:00:34.382,000 --> 0:00:38,000
moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques

6
0:00:38.739,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to further their deceptions.

7
0:00:43.033,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life,

8
0:00:47.848,000 --> 0:00:5,000
produced by the sequential projection of still frames,

9
0:00:51.691,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and they astonished the Lumière brothers' early audiences.

10
0:00:56.559,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Even today's sophisticated moviegoers

11
0:00:59.255,000 --> 0:01:01,000
still lose themselves to the screen,

12
0:01:02.175,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality

13
0:01:05.855,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to great effect.

14
0:01:08.402,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now imaginative people have been having fun with this

15
0:01:12.712,000 --> 0:01:14,000
for over 400 years.

16
0:01:14.781,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar

17
0:01:18.582,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world

18
0:01:24.184,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and saw how it could be manipulated.

19
0:01:27.831,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Playing with the world, and our perception of it,

20
0:01:31.247,000 --> 0:01:34,000
really is the essence of visual effects.

21
0:01:34.537,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So digging deeper into this

22
0:01:36.719,000 --> 0:01:38,000
with the Science and Technology Council

23
0:01:39.071,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

24
0:01:42.231,000 --> 0:01:46,000
reveals some truth behind the trickery.

25
0:01:46.719,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions:

26
0:01:52.063,000 --> 0:01:55,000
assumption, things are as we know them;

27
0:01:55.743,000 --> 0:01:59,000
presumption, things will behave as we expect;

28
0:01:59.816,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and context in reality,

29
0:02:02.313,000 --> 0:02:04,000
our knowledge of the world as we know it,

30
0:02:04.905,000 --> 0:02:05,000
such as scale.

31
0:02:06.507,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession,

32
0:02:10.584,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which is, never betray the illusion.

33
0:02:14.689,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And that last point has made visual effects

34
0:02:17.792,000 --> 0:02:2,000
a constant quest for perfection.

35
0:02:21.144,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema

36
0:02:25.871,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps

37
0:02:30.951,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects.

38
0:02:36.158,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I hope you will enjoy.

0:00:15.773,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka,

3
0:00:18.526,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I write and illustrate books for children for a living.

4
0:00:22.992,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So I use my imagination as my full-time job.

5
0:00:27.152,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But well before my imagination was my vocation,

6
0:00:30.481,000 --> 0:00:32,000
my imagination saved my life.

7
0:00:33.209,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When I was a kid, I loved to draw,

8
0:00:35.696,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and the most talented artist I knew

9
0:00:38.562,000 --> 0:00:39,000
was my mother,

10
0:00:40.396,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but my mother was addicted to heroin.

11
0:00:43.712,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And when your parent is a drug addict,

12
0:00:47.157,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football,

13
0:00:50.496,000 --> 0:00:52,000
because as much as you want to love on that person,

14
0:00:52.992,000 --> 0:00:54,000
as much as you want to receive love from that person,

15
0:00:55.23,000 --> 0:00:58,000
every time you open your heart, you end up on your back.

16
0:00:58.483,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So throughout my childhood, my mother was incarcerated

17
0:01:02.703,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I didn't have my father because

18
0:01:04.129,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade.

19
0:01:07.789,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But I had my grandparents,

20
0:01:10.109,000 --> 0:01:12,000
my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley,

21
0:01:12.68,000 --> 0:01:15,000
who adopted me just before my third birthday

22
0:01:15.962,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and took me in as their own,

23
0:01:17.424,000 --> 0:01:18,000
after they had already raised five children.

24
0:01:19.352,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So two people who grew up in the Great Depression,

25
0:01:22.562,000 --> 0:01:27,000
there in the very, very early '80s took on a new kid.

26
0:01:27.6,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom

27
0:01:29.658,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of the Krosoczka family,

28
0:01:31.764,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the new kid who came out of nowhere.

29
0:01:34.345,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them.

30
0:01:38.488,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They each smoked two packs a day, each, nonfiltered,

31
0:01:41.581,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and by the time I was six,

32
0:01:43.784,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan,

33
0:01:45.887,000 --> 0:01:47,000
dry with a twist, rocks on the side,

34
0:01:48.04,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink.

35
0:01:52.021,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much.

36
0:01:55.36,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And they supported my creative efforts,

37
0:01:57.72,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because my grandfather was a self-made man.

38
0:02:00.209,000 --> 0:02:01,000
He ran and worked in a factory.

39
0:02:01.929,000 --> 0:02:03,000
My grandmother was a homemaker.

40
0:02:04.392,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But here was this kid who loved Transformers

41
0:02:06.97,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles,

42
0:02:11.111,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and the characters that I read about, I fell in love with,

43
0:02:15.912,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and they became my friends.

44
0:02:18.987,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So my best friends in life were the characters

45
0:02:21.289,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I read about in books.

46
0:02:23.76,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts,

47
0:02:26.847,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and I had wonderful teachers there,

48
0:02:29.543,000 --> 0:02:32,000
most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch.

49
0:02:32.944,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I just, I can just remember the love that she offered

50
0:02:36.703,000 --> 0:02:38,000
us as her students.

51
0:02:39.45,000 --> 0:02:41,000
When I was in the third grade,

52
0:02:42.349,000 --> 0:02:43,000
a monumental event happened.

53
0:02:44.092,000 --> 0:02:46,000
An author visited our school, Jack Gantos.

54
0:02:46.436,000 --> 0:02:49,000
A published author of books came to talk to us

55
0:02:49.876,000 --> 0:02:51,000
about what he did for a living.

56
0:02:52.374,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And afterwards, we all went back to our classrooms

57
0:02:55.748,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and we drew our own renditions of his main character,

58
0:02:58.322,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Rotten Ralph.

59
0:02:59.771,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway,

60
0:03:02.628,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles,

61
0:03:05.58,000 --> 0:03:08,000
going from kid to kid looking at the desks, not saying a word.

62
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But he stopped next to my desk,

63
0:03:12.397,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and he tapped on my desk, and he said,

64
0:03:14.897,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"Nice cat." (Laughter)

65
0:03:17.251,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And he wandered away.

66
0:03:19.99,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Two words that made a colossal difference in my life.

67
0:03:25.326,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When I was in the third grade, I wrote a book for the first time,

68
0:03:28.165,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer." (Laughter)

69
0:03:31.847,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We had to write our own Greek myth,

70
0:03:34.132,000 --> 0:03:36,000
our own creation story, so I wrote a story about an owl

71
0:03:36.975,000 --> 0:03:39,000
who challenged Hermes to a flying race,

72
0:03:40.918,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and the owl cheated,

73
0:03:43.029,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and Hermes, being a Greek god, grew angry and bitter,

74
0:03:46.751,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and turned the owl into a moon,

75
0:03:48.62,000 --> 0:03:49,000
so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon

76
0:03:50.559,000 --> 0:03:53,000
while he watched his family and friends play at night.

77
0:03:53.602,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Yeah. (Laughter)

78
0:03:57.014,000 --> 0:03:59,000
My book had a title page.

79
0:03:59.166,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight.

80
0:04:03.468,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:06.599,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And it was a story that was told with words and pictures,

82
0:04:09.846,000 --> 0:04:11,000
exactly what I do now for a living,

83
0:04:12.034,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own,

84
0:04:15.721,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own

85
0:04:18.791,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to tell the story.

86
0:04:21.026,000 --> 0:04:24,000
My favorite page is the "About the author" page.

87
0:04:24.372,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:26.611,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So I learned to write about myself in third person

89
0:04:29.454,000 --> 0:04:32,000
at a young age.

90
0:04:32.574,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So I love that last sentence: "He liked making this book."

91
0:04:36.098,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination,

92
0:04:40.029,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and that's what writing is.

93
0:04:41.214,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Writing is using your imagination on paper,

94
0:04:43.729,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now

95
0:04:46.7,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids,

96
0:04:49.757,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that writing would be using your imagination on paper,

97
0:04:53.571,000 --> 0:04:57,000
if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours.

98
0:04:57.65,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school,

99
0:04:59.838,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and I would take out pieces of paper,

100
0:05:02.333,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and I would staple them together,

101
0:05:04.254,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures

102
0:05:07.094,000 --> 0:05:1,000
just because I loved using my imagination.

103
0:05:10.77,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And so these characters would become my friends.

104
0:05:12.882,000 --> 0:05:15,000
There was an egg, a tomato, a head of lettuce and a pumpkin,

105
0:05:15.942,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and they all lived in this refrigerator city,

106
0:05:18.416,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house

107
0:05:21.238,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that was filled with so many dangers

108
0:05:22.641,000 --> 0:05:26,000
like an evil blender who tried to chop them up,

109
0:05:27.325,000 --> 0:05:32,000
an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple,

110
0:05:33.267,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend

111
0:05:35.622,000 --> 0:05:38,000
who was a stick of butter. (Laughter)

112
0:05:39.019,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And I'd make my own comics too,

113
0:05:41.222,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and this was another way for me to tell stories,

114
0:05:43.359,000 --> 0:05:46,000
through words and through pictures.

115
0:05:46.59,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now when I was in sixth grade,

116
0:05:48.374,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets

117
0:05:51.23,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in the Worcester public school system.

118
0:05:53.274,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I went from having art once a week

119
0:05:56.658,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to twice a month

120
0:05:58.255,000 --> 0:06:,000
to once a month to not at all.

121
0:06:01.101,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And my grandfather, he was a wise man,

122
0:06:02.973,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and he saw that as a problem, because he knew

123
0:06:04.808,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that was, like, the one thing I had. I didn't play sports.

124
0:06:08.388,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I had art.

125
0:06:11.17,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So he walked into my room one evening,

126
0:06:13.628,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and he sat on the edge of my bed,

127
0:06:15.173,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and he said, "Jarrett, it's up to you, but if you'd like to,

128
0:06:17.412,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum."

129
0:06:19.901,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I was so thrilled.

130
0:06:21.498,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So from sixth through 12th grade,

131
0:06:23.168,000 --> 0:06:25,000
once, twice, sometimes three times a week,

132
0:06:25.169,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I would take classes at the art museum,

133
0:06:26.888,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw,

134
0:06:29.92,000 --> 0:06:32,000
other kids who shared a similar passion.

135
0:06:33.324,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now my publishing career began when I designed the cover

136
0:06:36.283,000 --> 0:06:38,000
for my eighth grade yearbook,

137
0:06:38.894,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in,

138
0:06:42.161,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer

139
0:06:44.769,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and Vanilla Ice at the time. (Laughter)

140
0:06:48.63,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And to this day, I still can do karaoke to "Ice, Ice Baby"

141
0:06:52.523,000 --> 0:06:54,000
without looking at the screen.

142
0:06:55.066,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Don't tempt me, because I will do it.

143
0:06:58.576,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So I get shipped off to private school,

144
0:07:00.498,000 --> 0:07:02,000
K through eight, public schools, but for some reason

145
0:07:02.721,000 --> 0:07:04,000
my grandfather was upset that somebody

146
0:07:05.096,000 --> 0:07:07,000
at the local high school had been stabbed and killed,

147
0:07:07.457,000 --> 0:07:09,000
so he didn't want me to go there.

148
0:07:10.153,000 --> 0:07:12,000
He wanted me to go to a private school, and he gave me an option.

149
0:07:12.964,000 --> 0:07:13,000
You can go to Holy Name, which is coed,

150
0:07:14.7,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or St. John's, which is all boys.

151
0:07:17.073,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Very wise man, because he knew I would,

152
0:07:19.273,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I felt like I was making the decision on my own,

153
0:07:22.009,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's,

154
0:07:23.805,000 --> 0:07:24,000
so I went to Holy Name High School,

155
0:07:25.503,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which was a tough transition because, like I said,

156
0:07:28.271,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I didn't play sports,

157
0:07:29.831,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and it was very focused on sports,

158
0:07:32.312,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room.

159
0:07:36.476,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And I just flourished here.

160
0:07:38.974,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day.

161
0:07:42.133,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So how did I make friends?

162
0:07:44.42,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I drew funny pictures of my teachers -- (Laughter) --

163
0:07:48.653,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and I passed them around.

164
0:07:51.41,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Well, in English class, in ninth grade,

165
0:07:55.208,000 --> 0:07:56,000
my friend John, who was sitting next to me,

166
0:07:57.184,000 --> 0:07:59,000
laughed a little bit too hard.

167
0:07:59.899,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Mr. Greenwood was not pleased.

168
0:08:02.18,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:06.087,000 --> 0:08:09,000
He instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion,

170
0:08:09.472,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and for the first time in my life, I was sent to the hall,

171
0:08:13.487,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and I thought, "Oh no, I'm doomed.

172
0:08:15.669,000 --> 0:08:18,000
My grandfather's just going to kill me."

173
0:08:18.874,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And he came out to the hallway and he said,

174
0:08:20.435,000 --> 0:08:21,000
"Let me see the paper."

175
0:08:21.553,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I thought, "Oh no. He thinks it's a note."

176
0:08:26.617,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And so I took this picture, and I handed it to him.

177
0:08:29.453,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And we sat in silence for that brief moment,

178
0:08:32.666,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and he said to me,

179
0:08:34.814,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"You're really talented." (Laughter)

180
0:08:38.177,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"You're really good. You know, the school newspaper

181
0:08:40.866,000 --> 0:08:42,000
needs a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist.

182
0:08:43.249,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Just stop drawing in my class."

183
0:08:46.875,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So my parents never found out about it.

184
0:08:49.209,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey,

185
0:08:52.435,000 --> 0:08:53,000
who ran the school newspaper,

186
0:08:54.099,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and I was for three and a half years

187
0:08:58.671,000 --> 0:09:,000
the cartoonist for my school paper,

188
0:09:01.047,000 --> 0:09:03,000
handling such heavy issues as,

189
0:09:03.219,000 --> 0:09:06,000
seniors are mean,

190
0:09:06.327,000 --> 0:09:08,000
freshmen are nerds,

191
0:09:08.923,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom.

192
0:09:14.728,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And I took the headmaster to task

193
0:09:18.312,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley

194
0:09:22.175,000 --> 0:09:25,000
who was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down

195
0:09:25.421,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that this wasn't about me,

196
0:09:27.537,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but all these years later it was totally me.

197
0:09:31.339,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But it was so cool because I could write these stories,

198
0:09:33.467,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I could come up with these ideas,

199
0:09:34.645,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and they'd be published in the school paper,

200
0:09:36.948,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and people who I didn't know could read them.

201
0:09:39.558,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I loved that thought, of being able to share my ideas

202
0:09:42.613,000 --> 0:09:44,000
through the printed page.

203
0:09:44.958,000 --> 0:09:47,000
On my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother

204
0:09:48.139,000 --> 0:09:5,000
gave me the best birthday present ever:

205
0:09:50.384,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a drafting table that I have worked on ever since.

206
0:09:55.303,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Here I am, 20 years later,

207
0:09:56.559,000 --> 0:10:,000
and I still work on this table every day.

208
0:10:01.103,000 --> 0:10:03,000
On the evening of my 14th birthday,

209
0:10:03.513,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I was given this table, and we had Chinese food.

210
0:10:07.678,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And this was my fortune:

211
0:10:11.298,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"You will be successful in your work."

212
0:10:13.575,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I taped it to the top left hand of my table,

213
0:10:16.403,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and as you can see, it's still there.

214
0:10:18.362,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything.

215
0:10:22.263,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Well, two things: Rusty, who was a great hamster

216
0:10:24.607,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade.

217
0:10:28.743,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Laughter)

218
0:10:31.562,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And a video camera.

219
0:10:34.759,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I just wanted a video camera.

220
0:10:36.999,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And after begging and pleading for Christmas,

221
0:10:39.48,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I got a second-hand video camera,

222
0:10:41.911,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and I instantly started making my own animations

223
0:10:45.743,000 --> 0:10:47,000
on my own,

224
0:10:47.943,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and all throughout high school I made my own animations.

225
0:10:50.623,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I convinced my 10th grade English teacher to allow me

226
0:10:53.72,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to do my book report on Stephen King's "Misery"

227
0:10:56.047,000 --> 0:11:,000
as an animated short. (Laughter)

228
0:11:00.811,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And I kept making comics.

229
0:11:03.667,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum,

230
0:11:07.611,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given.

231
0:11:11.844,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Mark Lynch, he's an amazing teacher

232
0:11:14.733,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and he's still a dear friend of mine,

233
0:11:16.948,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and I was 14 or 15,

234
0:11:19.355,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course,

235
0:11:22.376,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and I was so excited, I was beaming.

236
0:11:24.19,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way,

237
0:11:27.491,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and it taught me how to draw superheroes,

238
0:11:29.796,000 --> 0:11:31,000
how to draw a woman, how to draw muscles

239
0:11:32.124,000 --> 0:11:33,000
just the way they were supposed to be

240
0:11:34.05,000 --> 0:11:36,000
if I were to ever draw for X-Men or Spiderman.

241
0:11:36.875,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And all the color just drained from his face,

242
0:11:39.767,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and he looked at me, and he said,

243
0:11:41.506,000 --> 0:11:43,000
"Forget everything you learned."

244
0:11:44.276,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And I didn't understand. He said, "You have a great style.

245
0:11:48.1,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Celebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw.

246
0:11:52.262,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it,

247
0:11:54.42,000 --> 0:11:56,000
because you're really good."

248
0:11:56.869,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Now when I was a teenager, I was angsty as any teenager was,

249
0:12:00.443,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but after 17 years of having a mother

250
0:12:03.956,000 --> 0:12:05,000
who was in and out of my life like a yo-yo

251
0:12:06.118,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and a father who was faceless, I was angry.

252
0:12:10.019,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And when I was 17, I met my father for the first time,

253
0:12:12.741,000 --> 0:12:15,000
upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about.

254
0:12:16.642,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And on the day I met my father for the first time,

255
0:12:18.562,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design,

256
0:12:21.326,000 --> 0:12:24,000
my one and only choice for college.

257
0:12:25.077,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine

258
0:12:27.469,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids,

259
0:12:29.969,000 --> 0:12:32,000
kids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life.

260
0:12:33.041,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Eric didn't live to see his sixth birthday,

261
0:12:35.606,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and Eric lives with me every day.

262
0:12:38.171,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So after this experience, my art teacher, Mr. Shilale,

263
0:12:41.86,000 --> 0:12:42,000
he brought in these picture books,

264
0:12:43.052,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and I thought, "Picture books for kids!"

265
0:12:44.902,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and I started writing books for young readers

266
0:12:49.97,000 --> 0:12:5,000
when I was a senior in high school.

267
0:12:51.699,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Well, I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design.

268
0:12:54.487,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I transferred to RISD as a sophomore,

269
0:12:56.591,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing,

270
0:13:00.222,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug

271
0:13:04.255,000 --> 0:13:05,000
who wanted to be friends with this kid.

272
0:13:05.907,000 --> 0:13:06,000
The kid had no patience for him.

273
0:13:07.416,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers

274
0:13:10.655,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and it was rejected every single time,

275
0:13:13.199,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp,

276
0:13:15.952,000 --> 0:13:17,000
an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses,

277
0:13:18.937,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and it's those kids at the camp that read my stories,

278
0:13:22.185,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and I read to them, and I saw that they responded to my work.

279
0:13:25.952,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud,

280
0:13:29.688,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and I moved to Boston, and I set up shop.

281
0:13:32.306,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I set up a studio and I tried to get published.

282
0:13:34.481,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards

283
0:13:37.522,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to editors and art directors,

284
0:13:39.919,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but they would go unanswered.

285
0:13:41.559,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And my grandfather would call me every week,

286
0:13:43.414,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and he would say, "Jarrett, how's it going? Do you have a job yet?"

287
0:13:47.745,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Because he had just invested a significant amount of money

288
0:13:50.009,000 --> 0:13:51,000
in my college education.

289
0:13:51.93,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And I said, "Yes, I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books."

290
0:13:55.785,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And he said, "Well, who pays you for that?"

291
0:13:59.303,000 --> 0:14:,000
And I said, "No one, no one, no one just yet.

292
0:14:01.269,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But I know it's going to happen."

293
0:14:02.429,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now, I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off-season programming

294
0:14:05.922,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground,

295
0:14:09.105,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and this kid who was just this really hyper kid,

296
0:14:12.857,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I started calling him "Monkey Boy,"

297
0:14:15.729,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and I went home and wrote a book called "Good Night, Monkey Boy."

298
0:14:19.41,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And I sent out one last batch of postcards.

299
0:14:22.692,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And I received an email from an editor at Random House

300
0:14:26.066,000 --> 0:14:29,000
with a subject line, "Nice work!" Exclamation point.

301
0:14:29.817,000 --> 0:14:3,000
"Dear Jarrett, I received your postcard.

302
0:14:31.605,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I liked your art, so I went to your website

303
0:14:34.368,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories,

304
0:14:38.329,000 --> 0:14:4,000
because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them.

305
0:14:40.995,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Please let me know if you're ever in New York City."

306
0:14:45.066,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books.

307
0:14:48.368,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So the next week I "happened" to be in New York.

308
0:14:50.704,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Laughter)

309
0:14:53.648,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And I met with this editor,

310
0:14:55.96,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and I left New York for a contract for my first book,

311
0:14:59.184,000 --> 0:15:,000
"Good Night, Monkey Boy,"

312
0:15:00.217,000 --> 0:15:03,000
which was published on June 12, 2001.

313
0:15:03.679,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And my local paper celebrated the news.

314
0:15:09.374,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The local bookstore made a big deal of it.

315
0:15:13.639,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They sold out of all of their books.

316
0:15:15.528,000 --> 0:15:18,000
My friend described it as a wake, but happy,

317
0:15:19.305,000 --> 0:15:21,000
because everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me,

318
0:15:21.882,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but I wasn't dead. I was just signing books.

319
0:15:24.906,000 --> 0:15:25,000
My grandparents, they were in the middle of it.

320
0:15:26.453,000 --> 0:15:28,000
They were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud.

321
0:15:29.042,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there.

322
0:15:32.794,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Mrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said,

323
0:15:34.233,000 --> 0:15:37,000
"I taught him how to read." (Laughter)

324
0:15:37.49,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And then something happened that changed my life.

325
0:15:40.034,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I got my first piece of significant fan mail,

326
0:15:42.25,000 --> 0:15:45,000
where this kid loved Monkey Boy so much

327
0:15:45.525,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake.

328
0:15:49.121,000 --> 0:15:53,000
For a two-year-old, that is like a tattoo. (Laughter)

329
0:15:53.508,000 --> 0:15:56,000
You know? You only get one birthday per year.

330
0:15:56.569,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And for him, it's only his second.

331
0:15:59.414,000 --> 0:16:,000
And I got this picture, and I thought,

332
0:16:00.42,000 --> 0:16:02,000
"This picture is going to live within his consciousness

333
0:16:02.462,000 --> 0:16:05,000
for his entire life. He will forever have this photo

334
0:16:06.138,000 --> 0:16:08,000
in his family photo albums."

335
0:16:09.094,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So that photo, since that moment,

336
0:16:11.762,000 --> 0:16:14,000
is framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books.

337
0:16:14.809,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I have 10 picture books out.

338
0:16:17.369,000 --> 0:16:2,000
"Punk Farm," "Baghead," "Ollie the Purple Elephant."

339
0:16:20.769,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I just finished the ninth book

340
0:16:23.053,000 --> 0:16:25,000
in the "Lunch Lady" series, which is a graphic novel series

341
0:16:25.546,000 --> 0:16:27,000
about a lunch lady who fights crime.

342
0:16:28.13,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I'm expecting the release of a chapter book

343
0:16:30.946,000 --> 0:16:33,000
called "Platypus Police Squad: The Frog Who Croaked."

344
0:16:34.626,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And I travel the country visiting countless schools,

345
0:16:38.196,000 --> 0:16:42,000
letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats.

346
0:16:42.706,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And I meet Bagheads.

347
0:16:45.234,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Lunch ladies treat me really well.

348
0:16:49.805,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And I got to see my name in lights

349
0:16:54.329,000 --> 0:16:55,000
because kids put my name in lights.

350
0:16:56.179,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Twice now, the "Lunch Lady" series has won

351
0:16:58.269,000 --> 0:17:,000
the Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category,

352
0:17:01.25,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and those winners were displayed

353
0:17:03.22,000 --> 0:17:07,000
on a jumbotron screen in Times Square.

354
0:17:07.48,000 --> 0:17:09,000
"Punk Farm" and "Lunch Lady" are in development to be movies,

355
0:17:10.204,000 --> 0:17:12,000
so I am a movie producer

356
0:17:12.778,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and I really do think, thanks to that video camera

357
0:17:15.511,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I was given in ninth grade.

358
0:17:18.075,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I've seen people have "Punk Farm" birthday parties,

359
0:17:20.845,000 --> 0:17:22,000
people have dressed up as "Punk Farm" for Halloween,

360
0:17:23.732,000 --> 0:17:24,000
a "Punk Farm" baby room,

361
0:17:25.361,000 --> 0:17:29,000
which makes me a little nervous for the child's well-being in the long term.

362
0:17:30.176,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And I get the most amazing fan mail,

363
0:17:32.647,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and I get the most amazing projects,

364
0:17:35.055,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and the biggest moment for me came last Halloween.

365
0:17:38.407,000 --> 0:17:4,000
The doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater

366
0:17:40.561,000 --> 0:17:44,000
dressed as my character. It was so cool.

367
0:17:44.718,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Now my grandparents are no longer living,

368
0:17:47.832,000 --> 0:17:5,000
so to honor them, I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum

369
0:17:50.896,000 --> 0:17:53,000
for kids who are in difficult situations

370
0:17:54.171,000 --> 0:17:56,000
but whose caretakers can't afford the classes.

371
0:17:56.879,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing,

372
0:17:59.47,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and you know who was there to celebrate? Mrs. Alisch.

373
0:18:02.566,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I said, "Mrs. Alisch, how are you?"

374
0:18:04.253,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And she responded with, "I'm here." (Laughter)

375
0:18:07.359,000 --> 0:18:13,000
That's true. You are alive, and that's pretty good right now.

376
0:18:13.973,000 --> 0:18:14,000
So the biggest moment for me, though,

377
0:18:15.649,000 --> 0:18:16,000
my most important job now is I am a dad myself,

378
0:18:17.635,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and I have two beautiful daughters,

379
0:18:19.983,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and my goal is to surround them by inspiration,

380
0:18:22.774,000 --> 0:18:25,000
by the books that are in every single room of our house

381
0:18:25.896,000 --> 0:18:27,000
to the murals I painted in their rooms

382
0:18:28.486,000 --> 0:18:31,000
to the moments for creativity where you find, in quiet times,

383
0:18:32.125,000 --> 0:18:35,000
by making faces on the patio

384
0:18:35.61,000 --> 0:18:37,000
to letting her sit in the very desk

385
0:18:37.934,000 --> 0:18:39,000
that I've sat in for the past 20 years.

386
0:18:40.622,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.996,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Tonight, I'm going to try to make the case

2
0:00:15.073,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger

3
0:00:19.699,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to record a meaningful interview with you

4
0:00:22.13,000 --> 0:00:26,000
just might turn out to be one of the most important moments in that person's life,

5
0:00:26.536,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and in yours.

6
0:00:29.481,000 --> 0:00:32,000
When I was 22 years old, I was lucky enough to find my calling

7
0:00:32.825,000 --> 0:00:34,000
when I fell into making radio stories.

8
0:00:35.285,000 --> 0:00:37,000
At almost the exact same time,

9
0:00:37.719,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I found out that my dad, who I was very, very close to, was gay.

10
0:00:42.688,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was taken completely by surprise.

11
0:00:44.99,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We were a very tight-knit family,

12
0:00:47.498,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I was crushed.

13
0:00:49.889,000 --> 0:00:51,000
At some point, in one of our strained conversations,

14
0:00:52.234,000 --> 0:00:54,000
my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots.

15
0:00:54.904,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He told me that one night in 1969,

16
0:00:58.178,000 --> 0:01:,000
a group of young black and Latino drag queens

17
0:01:00.883,000 --> 0:01:03,000
fought back against the police at a gay bar in Manhattan

18
0:01:04.529,000 --> 0:01:06,000
called the Stonewall Inn,

19
0:01:06.549,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement.

20
0:01:10.078,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It was an amazing story, and it piqued my interest.

21
0:01:13.417,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So I decided to pick up my tape recorder and find out more.

22
0:01:17.628,000 --> 0:01:21,000
With the help of a young archivist named Michael Shirker,

23
0:01:21.804,000 --> 0:01:23,000
we tracked down all of the people we could find

24
0:01:24.381,000 --> 0:01:27,000
who had been at the Stonewall Inn that night.

25
0:01:27.817,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Recording these interviews,

26
0:01:29.814,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I saw how the microphone gave me the license

27
0:01:32.043,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to go places I otherwise never would have gone

28
0:01:34.779,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to.

29
0:01:38.912,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I had the privilege of getting to know

30
0:01:40.754,000 --> 0:01:43,000
some of the most amazing, fierce and courageous human beings

31
0:01:44.648,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I had ever met.

32
0:01:46.83,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It was the first time the story of Stonewall

33
0:01:48.934,000 --> 0:01:5,000
had been told to a national audience.

34
0:01:50.986,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I dedicated the program to my dad,

35
0:01:53.249,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it changed my relationship with him, and it changed my life.

36
0:02:00.181,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Over the next 15 years, I made many more radio documentaries,

37
0:02:03.617,000 --> 0:02:07,000
working to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media.

38
0:02:07.681,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Over and over again,

39
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I'd see how this simple act of being interviewed

40
0:02:11.86,000 --> 0:02:13,000
could mean so much to people,

41
0:02:14.02,000 --> 0:02:17,000
particularly those who had been told that their stories didn't matter.

42
0:02:17.711,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I could literally see people's back straighten

43
0:02:20.08,000 --> 0:02:22,000
as they started to speak into the microphone.

44
0:02:22.866,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In 1998, I made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels

45
0:02:27.371,000 --> 0:02:29,000
on the Bowery in Manhattan.

46
0:02:29.762,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades.

47
0:02:32.432,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They lived in cubicles the size of prison cells

48
0:02:34.824,000 --> 0:02:35,000
covered with chicken wire

49
0:02:36.124,000 --> 0:02:38,000
so you couldn't jump from one room into the next.

50
0:02:39.088,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Later, I wrote a book on the men with the photographer Harvey Wang.

51
0:02:43.067,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book

52
0:02:47.491,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and showing one of the guys his page.

53
0:02:50.079,000 --> 0:02:52,000
He stood there staring at it in silence,

54
0:02:52.354,000 --> 0:02:54,000
then he grabbed the book out of my hand

55
0:02:54.653,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and started running down the long, narrow hallway

56
0:02:58.136,000 --> 0:02:59,000
holding it over his head

57
0:02:59.645,000 --> 0:03:03,000
shouting, "I exist! I exist."

58
0:03:04.01,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Applause)

59
0:03:08.863,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In many ways, "I exist" became the clarion call for StoryCorps,

60
0:03:12.694,000 --> 0:03:15,000
this crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago.

61
0:03:16.27,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The thought was to take documentary work

62
0:03:18.499,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and turn it on its head.

63
0:03:20.356,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Traditionally, broadcast documentary

64
0:03:22.61,000 --> 0:03:26,000
has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment

65
0:03:26.696,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people,

66
0:03:30.944,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but I wanted to try something

67
0:03:32.325,000 --> 0:03:35,000
where the interview itself was the purpose of this work,

68
0:03:35.473,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and see if we could give many, many, many people the chance

69
0:03:38.445,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to be listened to in this way.

70
0:03:41.069,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago,

71
0:03:44.119,000 --> 0:03:48,000
we built a booth where anyone can come to honor someone else

72
0:03:48.492,000 --> 0:03:51,000
by interviewing them about their life.

73
0:03:51.503,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You come to this booth and you're met by a facilitator who brings you inside.

74
0:03:55.334,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You sit across from, say, your grandfather

75
0:03:57.911,000 --> 0:04:,000
for close to an hour and you listen and you talk.

76
0:04:00.953,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Many people think of it as, if this was to be our last conversation,

77
0:04:04.645,000 --> 0:04:06,000
what would I want to ask of and say to this person

78
0:04:07.64,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who means so much to me?

79
0:04:09.916,000 --> 0:04:12,000
At the end of the session, you walk away with a copy of the interview

80
0:04:13.203,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and another copy goes to the American Folklife Center

81
0:04:15.861,000 --> 0:04:17,000
at the Library of Congress

82
0:04:18.119,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so that your great-great-great-grandkids can someday get to know your grandfather

83
0:04:22.175,000 --> 0:04:24,000
through his voice and story.

84
0:04:25.548,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world

85
0:04:28.705,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation

86
0:04:32.188,000 --> 0:04:33,000
with another human being.

87
0:04:33.419,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I had no idea if it would work, but from the very beginning, it did.

88
0:04:38.225,000 --> 0:04:4,000
People treated the experience with incredible respect,

89
0:04:41.104,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and amazing conversations happened inside.

90
0:04:44.471,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I want to play just one animated excerpt

91
0:04:47.002,000 --> 0:04:5,000
from an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth.

92
0:04:50.763,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This is 12-year-old Joshua Littman interviewing his mother, Sarah.

93
0:04:55.291,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Josh has Asperger's syndrome.

94
0:04:57.497,000 --> 0:05:,000
As you may know, kids with Asperger's are incredibly smart

95
0:05:00.562,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but have a tough time socially.

96
0:05:02.721,000 --> 0:05:03,000
They usually have obsessions.

97
0:05:04.37,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In Josh's case, it's with animals,

98
0:05:06.576,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah

99
0:05:09.199,000 --> 0:05:12,000
at Grand Central nine years ago.

100
0:05:12.499,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Video) Josh Littman: From a scale of one to 10,

101
0:05:14.776,000 --> 0:05:16,000
do you think your life would be different without animals?

102
0:05:17.758,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Sarah Littman: I think it would be an eight without animals,

103
0:05:20.565,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because they add so much pleasure to life.

104
0:05:22.699,000 --> 0:05:25,000
JL: How else do you think your life would be different without them?

105
0:05:25.898,000 --> 0:05:27,000
SL: I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes.

106
0:05:28.617,000 --> 0:05:3,000
JL: Well, I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous

107
0:05:31.518,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or constrict you or anything.

108
0:05:32.919,000 --> 0:05:33,000
SL: Yeah, I'm not a big snake person --

109
0:05:34.778,000 --> 0:05:36,000
JL: But cockroach is just the insect we love to hate.

110
0:05:37.288,000 --> 0:05:38,000
SL: Yeah, it really is.

111
0:05:38.821,000 --> 0:05:41,000
JL: Have you ever thought you couldn't cope with having a child?

112
0:05:41.955,000 --> 0:05:44,000
SL: I remember when you were a baby, you had really bad colic,

113
0:05:45.345,000 --> 0:05:46,000
so you would just cry and cry.

114
0:05:46.948,000 --> 0:05:49,000
JL: What's colic? SL: It's when you get this stomach ache

115
0:05:50.105,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and all you do is scream for, like, four hours.

116
0:05:52.59,000 --> 0:05:53,000
JL: Even louder than Amy does?

117
0:05:54.563,000 --> 0:05:57,000
SL: You were pretty loud, but Amy's was more high-pitched.

118
0:05:57.907,000 --> 0:06:,000
JL: I think it feels like everyone seems to like Amy more,

119
0:06:01.111,000 --> 0:06:03,000
like she's the perfect little angel.

120
0:06:03.781,000 --> 0:06:06,000
SL: Well, I can understand why you think that people like Amy more,

121
0:06:07.644,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome,

122
0:06:10.483,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but being friendly comes easily to Amy,

123
0:06:13.487,000 --> 0:06:15,000
whereas I think for you it's more difficult,

124
0:06:15.902,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much.

125
0:06:19.942,000 --> 0:06:21,000
JL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos? SL: Yeah --

126
0:06:22.357,000 --> 0:06:26,000
JL: Like I have better quality friends but less quantity? (Laughter)

127
0:06:26.838,000 --> 0:06:28,000
SL: I wouldn't judge the quality, but I think --

128
0:06:29.119,000 --> 0:06:32,000
JL: I mean, first it was like, Amy loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia,

129
0:06:32.887,000 --> 0:06:34,000
she loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia.

130
0:06:34.914,000 --> 0:06:35,000
SL: Part of that's a girl thing, honey.

131
0:06:36.802,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends,

132
0:06:40.134,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and really that's what you need in life.

133
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
JL: Did I turn out to be the son you wanted when I was born?

134
0:06:46.409,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Did I meet your expectations?

135
0:06:49.311,000 --> 0:06:51,000
SL: You've exceeded my expectations, sweetie,

136
0:06:52.074,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because, sure, you have these fantasies of what your child's going to be like,

137
0:06:56.834,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but you have made me grow so much as a parent, because you think --

138
0:07:00.727,000 --> 0:07:02,000
JL: Well, I was the one who made you a parent.

139
0:07:02.888,000 --> 0:07:05,000
SL: You were the one who made me a parent. That's a good point. (Laughter)

140
0:07:06.375,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But also because you think differently

141
0:07:08.199,000 --> 0:07:1,000
from what they tell you in the parenting books,

142
0:07:11.102,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I really had to learn to think outside of the box with you,

143
0:07:14.562,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and it's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person,

144
0:07:19.368,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and I'll always thank you for that.

145
0:07:21.036,000 --> 0:07:22,000
JL: And that helped when Amy was born?

146
0:07:22.966,000 --> 0:07:26,000
SL: And that helped when Amy was born, but you are so incredibly special to me

147
0:07:27.8,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and I'm so lucky to have you as my son.

148
0:07:31.163,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Applause)

149
0:07:38.98,000 --> 0:07:4,000
David Isay: After this story ran on public radio,

150
0:07:41.287,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Josh received hundreds of letters

151
0:07:43.051,000 --> 0:07:45,000
telling him what an amazing kid he was.

152
0:07:45.373,000 --> 0:07:47,000
His mom, Sarah, bound them together in a book,

153
0:07:47.602,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and when Josh got picked on at school, they would read the letters together.

154
0:07:51.648,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes

155
0:07:53.915,000 --> 0:07:54,000
are here with us tonight.

156
0:07:55.218,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Sarah Littman and her son Josh, who is now an honors student in college.

157
0:08:00.019,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Applause)

158
0:08:03.809,000 --> 0:08:06,000
You know, a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories,

159
0:08:07.691,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and it's not because they're sad.

160
0:08:09.638,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Most of them aren't.

161
0:08:10.962,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure

162
0:08:14.015,000 --> 0:08:16,000
at this moment, when sometimes it's hard to tell

163
0:08:16.406,000 --> 0:08:18,000
what's real and what's an advertisement.

164
0:08:19.402,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's kind of the anti-reality TV.

165
0:08:21.793,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich.

166
0:08:23.906,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Nobody comes to get famous.

167
0:08:25.787,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's simply an act of generosity and love.

168
0:08:28.991,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So many of these are just everyday people

169
0:08:31.243,000 --> 0:08:36,000
talking about lives lived with kindness, courage, decency and dignity,

170
0:08:36.375,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and when you hear that kind of story,

171
0:08:38.372,000 --> 0:08:42,000
it can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground.

172
0:08:42.755,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So this experiment in Grand Central worked,

173
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and we expanded across the country.

174
0:08:47.65,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Today, more than 100,000 people in all 50 states

175
0:08:50.863,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in thousands of cities and towns across America

176
0:08:53.719,000 --> 0:08:55,000
have recorded StoryCorps interviews.

177
0:08:56.064,000 --> 0:09:,000
It's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered.

178
0:09:00.987,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Applause)

179
0:09:06.815,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators

180
0:09:09.253,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to help guide people through the experience.

181
0:09:11.969,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps

182
0:09:14.384,000 --> 0:09:17,000
traveling the country, gathering the wisdom of humanity.

183
0:09:17.821,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They call it bearing witness,

184
0:09:19.98,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and if you ask them,

185
0:09:21.385,000 --> 0:09:24,000
all of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing

186
0:09:24.659,000 --> 0:09:26,000
they've learned from being present during these interviews

187
0:09:27.527,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is that people are basically good.

188
0:09:30.963,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And I think for the first years of StoryCorps, you could argue

189
0:09:33.921,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that there was some kind of a selection bias happening,

190
0:09:36.557,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person

191
0:09:39.833,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in every part of the country --

192
0:09:41.482,000 --> 0:09:44,000
rich, poor, five years old to 105,

193
0:09:44.918,000 --> 0:09:47,000
80 different languages, across the political spectrum --

194
0:09:49.063,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something.

195
0:09:53.277,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I've also learned so much from these interviews.

196
0:09:56.568,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace

197
0:09:59.772,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that can be found in the words of people all around us

198
0:10:02.512,000 --> 0:10:05,000
when we simply take the time to listen,

199
0:10:05.809,000 --> 0:10:08,000
like this interview

200
0:10:09.042,000 --> 0:10:12,000
between a betting clerk in Brooklyn named Danny Perasa

201
0:10:12.38,000 --> 0:10:17,000
who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps to talk about his love for her.

202
0:10:18.632,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Audio) Danny Perasa: You see, the thing of it is,

203
0:10:20.974,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you.

204
0:10:23.45,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I say it so often. I say it to remind you

205
0:10:26.358,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me.

206
0:10:29.214,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,

207
0:10:32.668,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.

208
0:10:35.295,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Annie Perasa: If I don't have a note on the kitchen table,

209
0:10:38.101,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I think there's something wrong.

210
0:10:39.688,000 --> 0:10:41,000
You write a love letter to me every morning.

211
0:10:41.742,000 --> 0:10:43,000
DP: Well, the only thing that could possibly be wrong

212
0:10:44.271,000 --> 0:10:45,000
is I couldn't find a silly pen.

213
0:10:45.804,000 --> 0:10:46,000
AP: To my princess:

214
0:10:46.831,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The weather outside today is extremely rainy.

215
0:10:49.048,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I'll call you at 11:20 in the morning.

216
0:10:51.001,000 --> 0:10:52,000
DP: It's a romantic weather report.

217
0:10:52.817,000 --> 0:10:54,000
AP: And I love you. I love you. I love you.

218
0:10:55.567,000 --> 0:10:58,000
DP: When a guy is happily married, no matter what happens at work,

219
0:10:58.666,000 --> 0:11:,000
no matter what happens in the rest of the day,

220
0:11:00.823,000 --> 0:11:01,000
there's a shelter when you get home,

221
0:11:02.544,000 --> 0:11:04,000
there's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody

222
0:11:05.097,000 --> 0:11:08,000
without them throwing you downstairs and saying, "Get your hands off me."

223
0:11:08.644,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Being married is like having a color television set.

224
0:11:11.271,000 --> 0:11:13,000
You never want to go back to black and white.

225
0:11:13.478,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Laughter)

226
0:11:16.82,000 --> 0:11:18,000
DI: Danny was about five feet tall

227
0:11:18.956,000 --> 0:11:21,000
with crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth,

228
0:11:22.369,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but Danny Perasa had more romance in his little pinky

229
0:11:26.061,000 --> 0:11:29,000
than all of Hollywood's leading men put together.

230
0:11:29.174,000 --> 0:11:3,000
What else have I learned?

231
0:11:31.077,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity

232
0:11:33.979,000 --> 0:11:35,000
for the human spirit to forgive.

233
0:11:36.162,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I've learned about resilience and I've learned about strength.

234
0:11:39.807,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Like an interview with Oshea Israel and Mary Johnson.

235
0:11:43.15,000 --> 0:11:47,000
When Oshea was a teenager, he murdered Mary's only son,

236
0:11:47.701,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Laramiun Byrd, in a gang fight.

237
0:11:50.186,000 --> 0:11:52,000
A dozen years later, Mary went to prison

238
0:11:52.786,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to meet Oshea and find out who this person was

239
0:11:55.526,000 --> 0:11:57,000
who had taken her son's life.

240
0:11:58.475,000 --> 0:12:,000
Slowly and remarkably, they became friends,

241
0:12:01.261,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and when he was finally released from the penitentiary,

242
0:12:03.955,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary.

243
0:12:07.321,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had

244
0:12:10.526,000 --> 0:12:12,000
soon after Oshea was freed.

245
0:12:14.079,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Video) Mary Johnson: My natural son is no longer here.

246
0:12:17.051,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I didn't see him graduate, and now you're going to college.

247
0:12:20.835,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I'll have the opportunity to see you graduate.

248
0:12:24.132,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I didn't see him get married.

249
0:12:26.593,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Hopefully one day, I'll be able to experience that with you.

250
0:12:30.502,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Oshea Israel: Just to hear you say those things and to be

251
0:12:33.199,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation.

252
0:12:36.859,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.

253
0:12:41.616,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You still believe in me,

254
0:12:43.543,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you,

255
0:12:47.119,000 --> 0:12:49,000
it's amazing.

256
0:12:49.209,000 --> 0:12:54,000
MJ: I know it's not an easy thing to be able to share our story together,

257
0:12:55.106,000 --> 0:12:57,000
even with us sitting here looking at each other right now.

258
0:12:57.869,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I know it's not an easy thing, so I admire that you can do this.

259
0:13:03.616,000 --> 0:13:08,000
OI: I love you, lady. MJ: I love you too, son.

260
0:13:12.156,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Applause)

261
0:13:18.372,000 --> 0:13:23,000
DI: And I've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people,

262
0:13:23.526,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice.

263
0:13:28.588,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Like the story of Alexis Martinez, who was born Arthur Martinez

264
0:13:33.069,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago.

265
0:13:35.693,000 --> 0:13:37,000
In the interview, she talks with her daughter Lesley

266
0:13:38.526,000 --> 0:13:4,000
about joining a gang as a young man,

267
0:13:40.894,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be.

268
0:13:45.724,000 --> 0:13:47,000
This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley.

269
0:13:48.223,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Audio) Alexis Martinez: One of the most difficult things for me was

270
0:13:51.482,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I was always afraid that I wouldn't be allowed

271
0:13:54.408,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to be in my granddaughters' lives,

272
0:13:57.287,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and you blew that completely out of the water,

273
0:13:59.585,000 --> 0:14:,000
you and your husband.

274
0:14:00.909,000 --> 0:14:03,000
One of the fruits of that is, in my relationship with my granddaughters,

275
0:14:04.369,000 --> 0:14:07,000
they fight with each other sometimes over whether I'm he or she.

276
0:14:07.946,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Lesley Martinez: But they're free to talk about it.

277
0:14:10.433,000 --> 0:14:13,000
AM: They're free to talk about it, but that, to me, is a miracle.

278
0:14:13.489,000 --> 0:14:16,000
LM: You don't have to apologize. You don't have to tiptoe.

279
0:14:16.791,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We're not going to cut you off, and that's something I've always

280
0:14:21.372,000 --> 0:14:23,000
wanted you to just know, that you're loved.

281
0:14:24.337,000 --> 0:14:26,000
AM: You know, I live this every day now.

282
0:14:26.682,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I walk down the streets as a woman, and I really am at peace with who I am.

283
0:14:31.806,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I mean, I wish I had a softer voice maybe,

284
0:14:34.46,000 --> 0:14:39,000
but now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day.

285
0:14:43.562,000 --> 0:14:46,000
DI: Now I walk in love.

286
0:14:46.906,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I'm going to tell you a secret about StoryCorps.

287
0:14:49.808,000 --> 0:14:52,000
It takes some courage to have these conversations.

288
0:14:53.193,000 --> 0:14:55,000
StoryCorps speaks to our mortality.

289
0:14:55.584,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Participants know this recording will be heard long after they're gone.

290
0:14:59.601,000 --> 0:15:01,000
There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock

291
0:15:02.285,000 --> 0:15:04,000
who has worked closely with us on recording interviews

292
0:15:04.829,000 --> 0:15:05,000
with people who are dying.

293
0:15:06.286,000 --> 0:15:08,000
He wrote a book called "The Four Things That Matter Most"

294
0:15:09.051,000 --> 0:15:12,000
about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life

295
0:15:12.882,000 --> 0:15:15,000
before they or you die:

296
0:15:15.924,000 --> 0:15:17,000
thank you, I love you,

297
0:15:18.455,000 --> 0:15:21,000
forgive me, I forgive you.

298
0:15:21.682,000 --> 0:15:24,000
They're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another,

299
0:15:25.212,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth.

300
0:15:28.718,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It's a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about --

301
0:15:32.095,000 --> 0:15:34,000
no regrets, nothing left unsaid.

302
0:15:34.917,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And it's hard and it takes courage,

303
0:15:38.354,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but that's why we're alive, right?

304
0:15:43.299,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So, the TED Prize.

305
0:15:45.802,000 --> 0:15:47,000
When I first heard from TED and Chris a few months ago

306
0:15:48.779,000 --> 0:15:51,000
about the possibility of the Prize, I was completely floored.

307
0:15:52.615,000 --> 0:15:55,000
They asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity,

308
0:15:56.186,000 --> 0:15:57,000
no more than 50 words.

309
0:15:57.95,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So I thought about it, I wrote my 50 words,

310
0:16:00.694,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and a few weeks later, Chris called and said, "Go for it."

311
0:16:05.381,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So here is my wish:

312
0:16:08.329,000 --> 0:16:1,000
that you will help us

313
0:16:11.278,000 --> 0:16:13,000
take everything we've learned through StoryCorps

314
0:16:14.018,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and bring it to the world

315
0:16:16.781,000 --> 0:16:2,000
so that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview

316
0:16:20.798,000 --> 0:16:24,000
with another human being which will then be archived for history.

317
0:16:25.715,000 --> 0:16:29,000
How are we going to do that? With this.

318
0:16:30.393,000 --> 0:16:33,000
We're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world

319
0:16:34.071,000 --> 0:16:36,000
will have access to one of these,

320
0:16:36.114,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and it has powers I never could have imagined 11 years ago

321
0:16:39.945,000 --> 0:16:4,000
when I started StoryCorps.

322
0:16:41.895,000 --> 0:16:42,000
It has a microphone,

323
0:16:43.358,000 --> 0:16:45,000
it can tell you how to do things,

324
0:16:45.669,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and it can send audio files.

325
0:16:48.2,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Those are the key ingredients.

326
0:16:50.522,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So the first part of the wish is already underway.

327
0:16:53.726,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Over the past couple of months,

328
0:16:55.305,000 --> 0:16:57,000
the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously

329
0:16:58.3,000 --> 0:17:01,000
to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths

330
0:17:01.76,000 --> 0:17:06,000
so that it can be experienced by anyone, anywhere, anytime.

331
0:17:07.193,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Remember, StoryCorps has always been two people and a facilitator

332
0:17:10.874,000 --> 0:17:13,000
helping them record their conversation, which is preserved forever,

333
0:17:14.839,000 --> 0:17:16,000
but at this very moment,

334
0:17:16.887,000 --> 0:17:19,000
we're releasing a public beta version of the StoryCorps app.

335
0:17:20.533,000 --> 0:17:23,000
The app is a digital facilitator that walks you through

336
0:17:23.72,000 --> 0:17:25,000
the StoryCorps interview process,

337
0:17:26.105,000 --> 0:17:27,000
helps you pick questions,

338
0:17:27.777,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and gives you all the tips you need

339
0:17:29.867,000 --> 0:17:31,000
to record a meaningful StoryCorps interview,

340
0:17:32.676,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and then with one tap upload it to our archive at the Library of Congress.

341
0:17:38.197,000 --> 0:17:41,000
That's the easy part, the technology.

342
0:17:41.337,000 --> 0:17:43,000
The real challenge is up to you:

343
0:17:43.715,000 --> 0:17:46,000
to take this tool and figure out how we can use it

344
0:17:46.913,000 --> 0:17:48,000
all across America and around the world,

345
0:17:49.878,000 --> 0:17:52,000
so that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year,

346
0:17:53.462,000 --> 0:17:55,000
we could potentially record tens of thousands

347
0:17:56.232,000 --> 0:17:57,000
or hundreds of thousands

348
0:17:58.188,000 --> 0:17:59,000
or maybe even more.

349
0:18:01.355,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Imagine, for example, a national homework assignment

350
0:18:05.093,000 --> 0:18:08,000
where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country

351
0:18:09.087,000 --> 0:18:11,000
records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving,

352
0:18:11.989,000 --> 0:18:13,000
so that in one single weekend

353
0:18:14.892,000 --> 0:18:19,000
an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured.

354
0:18:19.977,000 --> 0:18:24,000
(Applause)

355
0:18:27.812,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Or imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world

356
0:18:31.354,000 --> 0:18:34,000
sitting down not to talk about that conflict

357
0:18:34.976,000 --> 0:18:36,000
but to find out who they are as people,

358
0:18:37.173,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and in doing so, begin to build bonds of trust;

359
0:18:41.128,000 --> 0:18:43,000
or that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world

360
0:18:44.014,000 --> 0:18:46,000
that people are honored with a StoryCorps interview

361
0:18:46.522,000 --> 0:18:48,000
on their 75th birthday;

362
0:18:48.765,000 --> 0:18:5,000
or that people in your community

363
0:18:51.041,000 --> 0:18:56,000
go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons

364
0:18:56.195,000 --> 0:18:59,000
armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society

365
0:18:59.725,000 --> 0:19:01,000
and ask them who they are, what they've learned in life,

366
0:19:02.711,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and how they want to be remembered.

367
0:19:05.172,000 --> 0:19:1,000
(Applause)

368
0:19:12.947,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Ten years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad

369
0:19:16.224,000 --> 0:19:2,000
who was a psychiatrist, and became a well-known gay activist.

370
0:19:21.019,000 --> 0:19:24,000
This is the picture of us at that interview.

371
0:19:24.456,000 --> 0:19:27,000
I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago,

372
0:19:27.637,000 --> 0:19:29,000
when my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health

373
0:19:30.632,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and was still seeing patients 40 hours a week,

374
0:19:33.233,000 --> 0:19:35,000
was diagnosed with cancer.

375
0:19:35.996,000 --> 0:19:38,000
He passed away very suddenly a few days later.

376
0:19:39.386,000 --> 0:19:41,000
It was June 28, 2012,

377
0:19:41.661,000 --> 0:19:45,000
the anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

378
0:19:46.041,000 --> 0:19:49,000
I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning

379
0:19:49.398,000 --> 0:19:5,000
on the day that he died.

380
0:19:51.126,000 --> 0:19:52,000
I have a couple of young kids at home,

381
0:19:53.123,000 --> 0:19:56,000
and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person

382
0:19:56.582,000 --> 0:20:,000
who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session.

383
0:20:01.428,000 --> 0:20:04,000
I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did,

384
0:20:05.173,000 --> 0:20:06,000
but it was at that moment

385
0:20:06.961,000 --> 0:20:1,000
that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings.

386
0:20:11.82,000 --> 0:20:13,000
Every day, people come up to me

387
0:20:13.913,000 --> 0:20:17,000
and say, "I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother,

388
0:20:18.074,000 --> 0:20:2,000
but I waited too long."

389
0:20:20.342,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Now, no one has to wait anymore.

390
0:20:22.478,000 --> 0:20:23,000
At this moment,

391
0:20:24.158,000 --> 0:20:27,000
when so much of how we communicate is fleeting and inconsequential,

392
0:20:27.7,000 --> 0:20:29,000
join us in creating this digital archive

393
0:20:30.197,000 --> 0:20:34,000
of conversations that are enduring and important.

394
0:20:34.514,000 --> 0:20:36,000
Help us create this gift to our children,

395
0:20:37.344,000 --> 0:20:4,000
this testament to who we are as human beings.

396
0:20:41.342,000 --> 0:20:44,000
I hope you'll help us make this wish come true.

397
0:20:45.268,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Interview a family member, a friend or even a stranger.

398
0:20:49.779,000 --> 0:20:55,000
Together, we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity,

399
0:20:56.069,000 --> 0:20:57,000
and maybe in doing so,

400
0:20:57.703,000 --> 0:21:,000
we'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less.

401
0:21:01.665,000 --> 0:21:05,000
Maybe these conversations will remind us what's really important.

402
0:21:06.193,000 --> 0:21:08,000
And maybe, just maybe,

403
0:21:08.956,000 --> 0:21:1,000
it will help us recognize that simple truth

404
0:21:11.742,000 --> 0:21:14,000
that every life, every single life,

405
0:21:15.689,000 --> 0:21:17,000
matters equally and infinitely.

406
0:21:18.624,000 --> 0:21:2,000
Thank you very much.

407
0:21:20.755,000 --> 0:21:22,000
(Applause)

408
0:21:22.905,000 --> 0:21:26,000
Thank you. Thank you.

409
0:21:27.113,000 --> 0:21:29,000
(Applause)

410
0:21:29.389,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Thank you.

411
0:21:31.571,000 --> 0:21:36,000
(Applause)

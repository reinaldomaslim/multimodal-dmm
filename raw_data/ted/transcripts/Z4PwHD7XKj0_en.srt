1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You will understand nothing with my type of English.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people.

3
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I must tell you I am like that, not very comfortable,

4
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because usually, in life, I think my job is absolutely useless.

5
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I mean, I feel useless.

6
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now after Carolyn, and all the other guys, I feel like shit.

7
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And definitively, I don't know why I am here,

8
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor,

9
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!"

10
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I don't know. (Laughter)

11
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So, so, because I have nothing to show, nothing to say,

12
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we shall try to speak about something else.

13
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We can start, if you want, by understanding --

14
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it's just to start, it's not interesting, but -- how I work.

15
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known,

16
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats,

17
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and why not -- a toothbrush?

18
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I don't try to design the toothbrush.

19
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I don't try to say, "Oh, that will be a beautiful object," or something like that.

20
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That doesn't interest me.

21
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Because there is different types of design.

22
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The one, we can call it the cynical design,

23
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '50s,

24
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
who said, what is ugly is a bad sale, la laideur se vend mal, which is terrible.

25
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing,

26
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
for producer to make product more sexy, like that,

27
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
they sell more: it's shit, it's obsolete, it's ridiculous.

28
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I call that the cynical design.

29
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
After, there is the narcissistic design:

30
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers. (Laughter)

31
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
After, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist,

32
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way,

33
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result,

34
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
for the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.

35
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
If we take the toothbrush -- I don't think about the toothbrush.

36
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I think, "What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth?"

37
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth,

38
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I must imagine: Who owns this mouth?

39
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
What is the life of the owner of this mouth? In what society [does] this guy live?

40
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What civilization creates this society?

41
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
What animal species creates this civilization?

42
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
When I arrive -- and I take one minute, I am not so intelligent --

43
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
when I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes real interesting.

44
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Me, I have strictly no power to change anything.

45
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But when I come back, I can understand why I shall not do it,

46
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because today to not do it, it's more positive than do it, or how I shall do it.

47
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But to come back, where I am at the animal species, there is things to see.

48
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
There is things to see, there is the big challenge.

49
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The big challenge in front of us.

50
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Because there is not a human production

51
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
which exists outside of what I call "the big image."

52
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism.

53
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Our poetry is our mutation, our life.

54
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We must remember, and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old,

55
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that life appears four billion years ago, around -- four billion point two?

56
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Voice offstage: Four point five.

57
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Yes, point five, OK, OK, OK! (Laughter) I'm a designer,

58
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that's all, of Christmas gifts.

59
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And before, there was this soup, called "soupe primordiale,"

60
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop --

61
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
sort of dirty mud, no life, nothing.

62
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So then -- pshoo-shoo -- lightning -- pshoo -- arrive --

63
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
pshoo-shoo -- makes life -- bloop bloop -- and that dies.

64
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Some million years after -- pshoo-shoo, bloop-bloop -- ah, wake up!

65
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
At the end, finally, that succeeds, and life appears.

66
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We was so, so stupid. The most stupid bacteria.

67
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Even, I think, we copy our way to reproduce, you know what I mean,

68
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and something of -- oh no, forget it.

69
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
After, we become a fish; after, we become a frog;

70
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
after, we become a monkey; after, we become what we are today: a super-monkey,

71
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and the fun is, the super-monkey we are today, is at half of the story.

72
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Can you imagine? From that stupid bacteria to us,

73
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with a microphone, with a computer, with an iPod: four billion years.

74
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And we know, and especially Carolyn knows, that when the sun will implode,

75
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the earth will burn, explode, I don't know what,

76
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and this is scheduled for four, four billion years?

77
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Yes, she said, something like that. OK, that means we are at half of the story.

78
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Fantastic! It's a beauty!

79
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Can you imagine? It's very symbolic.

80
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today.

81
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And today, we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years.

82
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
And this territory is fantastic.

83
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
That is our poetry. That is our beautiful story.

84
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It's our romanticism. Mu-ta-tion. We are mutants.

85
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants,

86
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
we completely miss the story.

87
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Because every generation thinks we are the final one.

88
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We have a way to look at Earth like that, you know,

89
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"I am the man. The final man.

90
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter)

91
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
For the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket."

92
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Something like that. I am not sure of that. (Laughter)

93
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.

94
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
There is so many things to do; it's so fresh.

95
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And here is something: nobody is obliged to be a genius,

96
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but everybody is obliged to participate.

97
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And to participate, for a mutant, there is a minimum of exercise, a minimum of sport.

98
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We can say that.

99
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The first, if you want -- there is so many --

100
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision.

101
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I can explain you. I shall try.

102
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
If you walk like that, it's OK, it's OK, you can walk,

103
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but perhaps, because you walk with the eyes like that, you will not see, oh, there is a hole.

104
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And you will fall, and you will die. Dangerous.

105
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That's why, perhaps, you will try to have this angle of vision.

106
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
OK, I can see, if I found something, up, up, and they continue, up up up.

107
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I raise the angle of vision, but it's still very -- selfish, selfish, egoiste -- yes, selfish.

108
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You, you survive. It's OK.

109
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go,

110
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"I see you, oh my God you are here, how are you, I can help you,

111
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I can design for you a new toothbrush, new toilet brush," something like that.

112
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I live in society; I live in community.

113
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say.

114
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
From this level, the more you can raise this angle of view,

115
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the more you will be important for the society.

116
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The more you will rise, the more you will be important for the civilization.

117
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The more you will rise, to see far and high, like that,

118
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the more you will be important for the story of our mutation.

119
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
That means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence.

120
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
From this to here, that, it's genius.

121
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Ptolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.

122
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Nobody's obliged to be a genius.

123
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's better, but nobody.

124
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Take care, in this training, to be a good mutant.

125
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
There is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical.

126
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Because at the vertical of us, if you look like that,

127
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"Ah! my God, there is God. Ah! God!"

128
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer.

129
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That means, when your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand,

130
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
you go, "Ah, it's God, it's God." That's ridiculous.

131
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
That's why -- jump, like that? No, don't jump.

132
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Come back. Because, after, there is another trap.

133
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
If you look like that, you look to the past,

134
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
or you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself.

135
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It's called schizophrenia, and you are dead also.

136
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
That's why every morning, now, because you are a good mutant,

137
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
you will raise your angle of view.

138
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Out, more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence.

139
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Never forget -- like that, like that.

140
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It's very, very, very important.

141
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
What, what else we can say about that? Why do that?

142
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's because we -- if we look from far, we see our line of evolution.

143
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
This line of evolution is clearly positive.

144
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
From far, this line looks very smooth, like that.

145
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But if you take a lens, like that, this line is ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. Like that.

146
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's made of light and shadow.

147
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We can say light is civilization, shadow is barbaria.

148
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And it's very important to know where we are.

149
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Because some cycle, there is a spot in the cycle,

150
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle.

151
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
That means, we can imagine -- I don't say it was fantastic,

152
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
but in the '80s, there was not too much war, like that, it was --

153
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized.

154
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
In this case, people like me are acceptable.

155
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We can say, "It's luxurious time."

156
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We have time to think, we have time to I don't know what,

157
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
speak about art and things like that.

158
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's OK. We are in the light.

159
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But sometimes, like today, we fall, we fall so fast, so fast to shadow, we fall so fast to barbaria.

160
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
With many, many, many, many face of barbaria.

161
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Because it's not, the barbaria we have today, it's perhaps not the barbaria we think.

162
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
There is different type of barbaria.

163
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
That's why we must adapt.

164
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
That means, when barbaria is back, forget the beautiful chairs, forget the beautiful hotel,

165
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
forget design, even -- I'm sorry to say -- forget art.

166
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Forget all that. There is priority; there is urgency.

167
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
You must go back to politics, you must go back to radicalization,

168
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I'm sorry if that's not very English.

169
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
You must go back to fight, to battle.

170
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
That's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job.

171
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
That's why I am here, to try to do it the best possible.

172
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But I know that even I do it the best possible

173
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
-- that's why I'm the best -- it's nothing.

174
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Because it's not the right time.

175
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
That's why I say that. I say that, because, I repeat, nothing exist if it's not in the good rhythym,

176
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
the rhythym of our beautiful dream, of this civilization.

177
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And because we must all work to finish this story.

178
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Because the scenario of this civilization

179
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
-- about love, progress, and things like that -- it's OK,

180
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
but there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations.

181
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
This scenario, of this civilization, was about becoming powerful, intelligent,

182
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
like this idea we have invented, this concept of God.

183
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We are God now. We are. It's almost done.

184
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
We have just to finish the story.

185
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
That is very, very important.

186
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And when you don't understand really what's happened,

187
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that.

188
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
You go to the future back, back, back, back, like that.

189
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And you can fall, and it's very dangerous.

190
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
No, you must really understand that.

191
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Because we have almost finished, I'll repeat this story.

192
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization,

193
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story,

194
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
a new poetry, a new romanticism.

195
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
With billions of people who have been born, worked, lived and died before us,

196
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
these people who have worked so much,

197
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
we have now bring beautiful things, beautiful gifts, we know so many things.

198
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We can say to our children, OK, done, that was our story. That passed.

199
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Now you have a duty: invent a new story. Invent a new poetry.

200
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
The only rule is, we have not to have any idea about the next story.

201
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
We give you white pages. Invent.

202
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We give you the best tools, the best tools, and now, do it.

203
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
That's why I continue to work, even if it's for toilet brush.

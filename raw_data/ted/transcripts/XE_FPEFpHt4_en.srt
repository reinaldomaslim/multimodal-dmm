2
0:00:16.087,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've always written primarily about architecture,

3
0:00:18.118,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about buildings, and writing about architecture

4
0:00:20.643,000 --> 0:00:22,000
is based on certain assumptions.

5
0:00:23.384,000 --> 0:00:25,000
An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place,

6
0:00:25.842,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes

7
0:00:28.322,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces

8
0:00:31.596,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of politics and culture and economics that shapes

9
0:00:33.993,000 --> 0:00:36,000
these places, at the end of the day, you can go

10
0:00:36.996,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and you can visit them. You can walk around them.

11
0:00:39.652,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.

12
0:00:41.325,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You can experience their sense of place.

13
0:00:44.818,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But what was striking to me over the last several years

14
0:00:47.167,000 --> 0:00:5,000
was that less and less was I going out into the world,

15
0:00:50.542,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.

16
0:00:53.771,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone,

17
0:00:58.091,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day,

18
0:00:59.967,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but I was also getting up at the end of the day

19
0:01:02.064,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.

20
0:01:05.364,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And what was surprising to me was how quickly

21
0:01:08.223,000 --> 0:01:1,000
my relationship to the physical world had changed.

22
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
In this very short period of time, you know, whether you

23
0:01:12.935,000 --> 0:01:15,000
call it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last,

24
0:01:16.391,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you know, four or five years of being online all the time,

25
0:01:19.35,000 --> 0:01:22,000
our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that

26
0:01:22.524,000 --> 0:01:23,000
our attention is constantly divided. You know,

27
0:01:24.323,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking

28
0:01:26.887,000 --> 0:01:27,000
out in the world around us.

29
0:01:28.719,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And what was even more striking to me, and what I really

30
0:01:31.246,000 --> 0:01:34,000
got hung up on, was that the world inside the screen

31
0:01:34.248,000 --> 0:01:37,000
seemed to have no physical reality of its own.

32
0:01:38.037,000 --> 0:01:4,000
If you went and looked for images of the Internet,

33
0:01:40.805,000 --> 0:01:43,000
this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte

34
0:01:43.923,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse

35
0:01:47.053,000 --> 0:01:49,000
where we don't seem to be anywhere on it.

36
0:01:49.149,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.

37
0:01:51.573,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth,

38
0:01:55.19,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest,

39
0:01:57.92,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.

40
0:02:00.617,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.

41
0:02:04.302,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So if there was this world and this screen, and if there was

42
0:02:07.667,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them

43
0:02:10.524,000 --> 0:02:12,000
together in the same place.

44
0:02:13.505,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And then this happened.

45
0:02:16.712,000 --> 0:02:18,000
My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does,

46
0:02:19.31,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with

47
0:02:22.044,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the dusty clump of cables behind the couch,

48
0:02:24.171,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard,

49
0:02:27.381,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.

50
0:02:30.257,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire,

51
0:02:32.811,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and he said, "There's your problem.

52
0:02:35.602,000 --> 0:02:39,000
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet." (Laughter)

53
0:02:40.023,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And this seemed astounding. The Internet is

54
0:02:43.15,000 --> 0:02:46,000
a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed

55
0:02:46.524,000 --> 0:02:49,000
everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.

56
0:02:49.979,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It was unequivocally not something

57
0:02:52.608,000 --> 0:02:55,000
a squirrel could chew on. (Laughter)

58
0:02:55.919,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But that in fact seemed to be the case.

59
0:02:57.797,000 --> 0:03:,000
A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet. (Laughter)

60
0:03:00.999,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And then I got this image in my head of what would happen

61
0:03:03.186,000 --> 0:03:05,000
if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started

62
0:03:05.366,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to follow it. Where would it go?

63
0:03:06.97,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?

64
0:03:10.478,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Could I go there? Who would I meet?

65
0:03:11.827,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You know, was there something actually out there?

66
0:03:15.203,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And the answer, by all accounts, was no.

67
0:03:18.24,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it,

68
0:03:21.02,000 --> 0:03:24,000
as represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."

69
0:03:24.45,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben,

70
0:03:28.009,000 --> 0:03:31,000
because that's where you get the best reception,

71
0:03:31.091,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it

72
0:03:34.396,000 --> 0:03:37,000
for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.

73
0:03:37.568,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it

74
0:03:39.942,000 --> 0:03:41,000
for a short while, and she looks at it and she says,

75
0:03:42.808,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"

76
0:03:46.198,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."

77
0:03:50.158,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing

78
0:03:52.475,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that only fools seem to look for.

79
0:03:54.771,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly

80
0:03:57.606,000 --> 0:03:59,000
black box with a blinking red light on it.

81
0:03:59.852,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It wasn't a real world out there.

82
0:04:02.18,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there,

83
0:04:05.492,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that's what I spent about two years visiting,

84
0:04:07.258,000 --> 0:04:1,000
these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers

85
0:04:10.803,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that use as much power as the cities in which they sit,

86
0:04:13.448,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York,

87
0:04:16.637,000 --> 0:04:17,000
which is one of the buildings in the world,

88
0:04:18.345,000 --> 0:04:2,000
one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings,

89
0:04:21.243,000 --> 0:04:23,000
where more networks of the Internet connect to each other

90
0:04:23.887,000 --> 0:04:24,000
than anywhere else.

91
0:04:25.245,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.

92
0:04:27.862,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or

93
0:04:30.347,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is,

94
0:04:33.289,000 --> 0:04:35,000
connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into

95
0:04:35.72,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the ceiling and down into the router of another network,

96
0:04:38.414,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.

97
0:04:42.791,000 --> 0:04:45,000
A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others,

98
0:04:46.084,000 --> 0:04:48,000
has 10 times more networks connecting within it

99
0:04:48.41,000 --> 0:04:49,000
than the next tier of buildings.

100
0:04:50.258,000 --> 0:04:52,000
There's a very short list of these places.

101
0:04:52.326,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home

102
0:04:55.234,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to about a half a dozen very important networks,

103
0:04:57.823,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which are the networks which serve the undersea cables

104
0:05:00.121,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that travel underneath the ocean

105
0:05:02.469,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that connect Europe and America and connect all of us.

106
0:05:04.722,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.

107
0:05:08.309,000 --> 0:05:11,000
If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live

108
0:05:12.185,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath

109
0:05:14.625,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the ocean, cables like this.

110
0:05:16.73,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.

111
0:05:19.616,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.

112
0:05:22.558,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive,

113
0:05:26.621,000 --> 0:05:27,000
as expansive as you can imagine.

114
0:05:28.261,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five

115
0:05:30.816,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or eight thousand miles in length, and

116
0:05:33.427,000 --> 0:05:35,000
if the material science and the computational technology

117
0:05:36.036,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is incredibly complicated, the basic physical process

118
0:05:39.569,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean

119
0:05:43.349,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and comes out on the other, and it usually comes

120
0:05:46.634,000 --> 0:05:48,000
from a building called a landing station that's often

121
0:05:49.267,000 --> 0:05:51,000
tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood,

122
0:05:52.214,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor

123
0:05:54.948,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles

124
0:05:57.468,000 --> 0:06:,000
they amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission

125
0:06:01.125,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second

126
0:06:04.331,000 --> 0:06:06,000
wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own

127
0:06:06.829,000 --> 0:06:09,000
connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams,

128
0:06:10.013,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light

129
0:06:13.291,000 --> 0:06:15,000
through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe

130
0:06:16.248,000 --> 0:06:19,000
50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light

131
0:06:19.267,000 --> 0:06:21,000
through a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe

132
0:06:22.135,000 --> 0:06:24,000
eight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.

133
0:06:24.737,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.

134
0:06:28.227,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And then they connect to the continent somewhere.

135
0:06:30.056,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They connect in a manhole like this. Literally,

136
0:06:32.394,000 --> 0:06:35,000
this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.

137
0:06:35.483,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.

138
0:06:39.973,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago,

139
0:06:42.954,000 --> 0:06:43,000
when I started thinking about this, there was one cable

140
0:06:44.85,000 --> 0:06:47,000
down the Western coast of Africa, represented

141
0:06:48.017,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.

142
0:06:50.891,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.

143
0:06:55.736,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable,

144
0:06:58.367,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build

145
0:07:00.167,000 --> 0:07:02,000
an industry around it, they need to know that their connection

146
0:07:02.983,000 --> 0:07:04,000
isn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks,

147
0:07:05.693,000 --> 0:07:07,000
you have to send a ship out into the water, throw

148
0:07:07.76,000 --> 0:07:09,000
a grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end,

149
0:07:10.675,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.

150
0:07:13.718,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's an intensely, intensely physical process.

151
0:07:18.258,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently

152
0:07:22.556,000 --> 0:07:24,000
worked for Tata Communications, the communications wing

153
0:07:25.228,000 --> 0:07:27,000
of Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.

154
0:07:28.226,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And I've never met him. We've only communicated

155
0:07:31.208,000 --> 0:07:34,000
via this telepresence system, which always makes me

156
0:07:34.665,000 --> 0:07:37,000
think of him as the man inside the Internet. (Laughter)

157
0:07:38.561,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And he is English. The undersea cable industry

158
0:07:41.758,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.

159
0:07:45.403,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter) Because they all started at the same time

160
0:07:48.578,000 --> 0:07:5,000
with the boom about 20 years ago.

161
0:07:51.078,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business

162
0:07:54.338,000 --> 0:07:56,000
when they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic

163
0:07:56.803,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces

164
0:07:59.963,000 --> 0:08:02,000
onto them, until they had built a belt around the world,

165
0:08:03.507,000 --> 0:08:05,000
which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.

166
0:08:05.604,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world,

167
0:08:07.827,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around

168
0:08:10.038,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the other direction. And then having done that,

169
0:08:13.223,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they started to look for places to wire next.

170
0:08:17.167,000 --> 0:08:19,000
They looked for the unwired places, and that's meant

171
0:08:19.657,000 --> 0:08:21,000
North and South, primarily these cables to Africa.

172
0:08:22.451,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.

173
0:08:26.222,000 --> 0:08:28,000
He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.

174
0:08:29.181,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see

175
0:08:32.494,000 --> 0:08:34,000
one of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time

176
0:08:35.346,000 --> 0:08:37,000
online we experience these fleeting moments of connection,

177
0:08:37.666,000 --> 0:08:4,000
these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post

178
0:08:40.96,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.

179
0:08:44.8,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It seemed like there was a moment when the continent

180
0:08:46.876,000 --> 0:08:48,000
was being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.

181
0:08:49.223,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And Simon was working on a new cable,

182
0:08:51.508,000 --> 0:08:53,000
WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched

183
0:08:54.019,000 --> 0:08:56,000
from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa,

184
0:08:56.14,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.

185
0:08:59.009,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And he said there was coming soon, depending

186
0:09:01.342,000 --> 0:09:03,000
on the weather, but he'd let me know when,

187
0:09:03.536,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and so with about four days notice, he said to go

188
0:09:06.737,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9,

189
0:09:09.568,000 --> 0:09:12,000
this guy will walk out of the water. (Laughter)

190
0:09:13.264,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line,

191
0:09:17.584,000 --> 0:09:19,000
called a messenger line, and that was the first link

192
0:09:20.297,000 --> 0:09:22,000
between sea and land, this link that would then be

193
0:09:22.85,000 --> 0:09:25,000
leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.

194
0:09:26.713,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this

195
0:09:29.303,000 --> 0:09:32,000
specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated

196
0:09:32.66,000 --> 0:09:34,000
on these buoys until it was in the right place.

197
0:09:35.408,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Then you can see the English engineers looking on.

198
0:09:38.15,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And then, once it was in the right place, he got back

199
0:09:40.963,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off,

200
0:09:44.322,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable

201
0:09:46.621,000 --> 0:09:47,000
dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out

202
0:09:48.526,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to the ship, and when he got there,

203
0:09:50.399,000 --> 0:09:52,000
they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie,

204
0:09:52.812,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,

205
0:09:55.231,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and then he lit a cigarette. (Laughter)

206
0:10:02.391,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And then once that cable was on shore,

207
0:10:05.103,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they began to prepare to connect it to the other side,

208
0:10:08.607,000 --> 0:10:1,000
for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.

209
0:10:11.564,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start

210
0:10:14.422,000 --> 0:10:16,000
sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a --

211
0:10:17.358,000 --> 0:10:19,000
sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working

212
0:10:19.42,000 --> 0:10:21,000
like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up

213
0:10:22.128,000 --> 0:10:23,000
with the cable that had come down,

214
0:10:23.805,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.

215
0:10:26.796,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw,

216
0:10:30.127,000 --> 0:10:32,000
you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.

217
0:10:32.77,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.

218
0:10:36.707,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And what surprised me as well was that as much as this

219
0:10:39.215,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is based on the most sophisticated technology, as much

220
0:10:42.062,000 --> 0:10:44,000
as this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process

221
0:10:44.967,000 --> 0:10:47,000
itself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.

222
0:10:48.734,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer

223
0:10:50.723,000 --> 0:10:53,000
giving directions in the background. And more importantly,

224
0:10:53.898,000 --> 0:10:55,000
the places are the same. These cables still connect

225
0:10:56.541,000 --> 0:10:59,000
these classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa,

226
0:10:59.591,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Mumbai, Singapore, New York.

227
0:11:02.75,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And then the process on shore takes around three or four days,

228
0:11:06.836,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover

229
0:11:11.027,000 --> 0:11:13,000
back on top, and they push the sand over that,

230
0:11:13.998,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and we all forget about it.

231
0:11:17.08,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud,

232
0:11:19.331,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but every time we put something on the cloud,

233
0:11:21.241,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we give up some responsibility for it.

234
0:11:23.443,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.

235
0:11:27.307,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And that doesn't seem right.

236
0:11:28.59,000 --> 0:11:3,000
There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says

237
0:11:30.932,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that wired people should know something about wires.

238
0:11:35.329,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And we should know, I think, we should know

239
0:11:37.599,000 --> 0:11:39,000
where our Internet comes from, and we should know

240
0:11:40.352,000 --> 0:11:44,000
what it is that physically, physically connects us all.

241
0:11:45.174,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Thank you. (Applause)

242
0:11:47.513,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

243
0:11:49.91,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Thanks. (Applause)

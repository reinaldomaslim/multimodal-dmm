1
0:00:12.48,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In 2015, the leaders of the world made a big promise.

2
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A promise that over the next 15 years,

3
0:00:20.76,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the lives of billions of people are going to get better

4
0:00:24.36,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with no one left behind.

5
0:00:27.2,000 --> 0:00:3,000
That promise is the Sustainable Development Goals --

6
0:00:30.44,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the SDGs.

7
0:00:32.48,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We're now three years in;

8
0:00:34.32,000 --> 0:00:36,000
a fifth of the way into the journey.

9
0:00:36.68,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The clock is ticking.

10
0:00:38.4,000 --> 0:00:39,000
If we offtrack now,

11
0:00:39.96,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it's going to get harder and harder to hit those goals.

12
0:00:44.32,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So what I want to do for you today is give you a snapshot

13
0:00:47.12,000 --> 0:00:48,000
on where we are today,

14
0:00:48.88,000 --> 0:00:51,000
some projections on where we're heading

15
0:00:52.04,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and some ideas on things we might need to do differently.

16
0:00:57.44,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now, the SDGs are of course spectacularly complicated.

17
0:01:01.28,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I would expect nothing less from the United Nations.

18
0:01:03.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:04.8,000 --> 0:01:05,000
How many goals?

20
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Maybe something tried and tested, like three, seven or 10.

21
0:01:09.88,000 --> 0:01:12,000
No, let's pick a prime number higher than 10.

22
0:01:13.32,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Seventeen goals.

23
0:01:15.96,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I congratulate those of you who've memorized them already.

24
0:01:18.92,000 --> 0:01:2,000
For the rest of us, here they are.

25
0:01:21.08,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Seventeen goals ranging from ending poverty

26
0:01:24.12,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to inclusive cities

27
0:01:25.52,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to sustainable fisheries;

28
0:01:27.36,000 --> 0:01:3,000
all a comprehensive plan for the future of our world.

29
0:01:31.72,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But sadly, a plan without the data to measure it.

30
0:01:36.28,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So how are we going to track progress?

31
0:01:38.88,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Well, I'm going to use today the Social Progress Index.

32
0:01:42.8,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's a measure of the quality of life of countries,

33
0:01:45.92,000 --> 0:01:48,000
ranging from the basic needs of survival --

34
0:01:48.96,000 --> 0:01:5,000
food, water, shelter, safety --

35
0:01:51.76,000 --> 0:01:53,000
through to the foundations of well-being --

36
0:01:54.04,000 --> 0:01:57,000
education, information, health and the environment --

37
0:01:57.4,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and opportunity --

38
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:04,000
rights, freedom of choice, inclusiveness and access to higher education.

39
0:02:05.24,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, the Social Progress Index doesn't look like the SDGs,

40
0:02:08.76,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but fundamentally, it's measuring the same concepts,

41
0:02:12.12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and the Social Progress Index has the advantage that we have the data.

42
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We have 51 indicators drawn from trusted sources

43
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to measure these concepts.

44
0:02:21.479,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And also, what we can do because it's an index,

45
0:02:24.08,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is add together all those indicators to give us an aggregate score

46
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
about how we're performing against the total package of the SDGs.

47
0:02:33.12,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Now, one caveat.

48
0:02:34.6,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The Social Progress Index is a measure of quality of life.

49
0:02:37.48,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We're not looking at whether this can be achieved

50
0:02:39.84,000 --> 0:02:4,000
within the planet's environmental limits.

51
0:02:41.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You will need other tools to do that.

52
0:02:45.2,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So how are we doing on the SDGs?

53
0:02:48.32,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Well, I'm going to put the SDGs on a scale of zero to 100.

54
0:02:52.64,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And zero is the absolute worst score on each of those 51 indicators:

55
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:02:59,000
absolute social progress, zero.

56
0:02:59.6,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And then 100 is the minimum standard required to achieve those SDGs.

57
0:03:04.72,000 --> 0:03:06,000
A hundred is where we want to get to by 2030.

58
0:03:08.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So, where did we start on this journey?

59
0:03:10.84,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Fortunately, not at zero.

60
0:03:12.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In 2015, the world score against the SDGs was 69.1.

61
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Some way on the way there but quite a long way to go.

62
0:03:22.32,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now let me also emphasize that this world forecast,

63
0:03:24.96,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which is based on data from 180 countries,

64
0:03:27.36,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is population weighted.

65
0:03:29.08,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So China has more weight in than Comoros;

66
0:03:31.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
India has more weight in than Iceland.

67
0:03:34.08,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But we could unpack this and see how the countries are doing.

68
0:03:37.96,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And the country today that is closest to achieving the SDGs is Denmark.

69
0:03:43.6,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And the country with the furthest to go is Central African Republic.

70
0:03:47.92,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And everyone else is somewhere in between.

71
0:03:51.595,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So the challenge for the SDGs

72
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is to try and sweep all these dots across to the right, to 100 by 2030.

73
0:03:59.12,000 --> 0:04:,000
Can we get there?

74
0:04:01.04,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Well, with the Social Progress Index, we've got some time series data.

75
0:04:04.4,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So we have some idea of the trend that the countries are on,

76
0:04:07.72,000 --> 0:04:09,000
on which we can build some projections.

77
0:04:10.88,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So let's have a look.

78
0:04:12.12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Let's start with our top-performing country, Denmark.

79
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And yes, I'm pleased to say that Denmark is forecast to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

80
0:04:20.8,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Maybe not surprising, but I'll take a win.

81
0:04:23.96,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Let's look at some of the other richer countries of the world --

82
0:04:27.04,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the G7.

83
0:04:28.279,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And we find that Germany and Japan will get there or thereabouts.

84
0:04:33.079,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But Canada, France, the UK and Italy are all going to fall short.

85
0:04:39.52,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And the United States?

86
0:04:41.28,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Quite some way back.

87
0:04:43.88,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, this is sort of worrying news.

88
0:04:46.64,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But these are the richest countries in the world,

89
0:04:49.04,000 --> 0:04:5,000
not the most populous.

90
0:04:50.88,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So let's take a look now at the biggest countries in the world,

91
0:04:53.88,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the ones that will most affect whether or not we achieve the SDGs.

92
0:04:57.24,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And here they are --

93
0:04:58.68,000 --> 0:05:01,000
countries in the world with a population of higher than 100 million,

94
0:05:01.92,000 --> 0:05:03,000
ranging from China to Ethiopia.

95
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Obviously, the US and Japan would be in that list,

96
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but we've looked at them already.

97
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So here we are.

98
0:05:09.4,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The biggest countries in the world; the dealbreakers for the SDGs.

99
0:05:12.96,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And the country that's going to make most progress towards the SDGs

100
0:05:16.68,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is Mexico.

101
0:05:18.84,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Mexico is going to get to about 87,

102
0:05:20.88,000 --> 0:05:22,000
so just shy of where the US is going to get

103
0:05:23.28,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but quite some way off our SDG target.

104
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Russia comes next.

105
0:05:27.96,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Then China and Indonesia.

106
0:05:30.6,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Then Brazil -- might've expected Brazil to do a bit better.

107
0:05:33.68,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Philippines,

108
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and then a step down to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria,

109
0:05:40.44,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and then Ethiopia.

110
0:05:42.96,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So none of these countries are going to hit the SDGs.

111
0:05:46.32,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And we can then take these numbers in all the countries of the world

112
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to give ourselves a world forecast

113
0:05:51.4,000 --> 0:05:53,000
on achieving that total package of the SDGs.

114
0:05:54.32,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So remember, in 2015 we started at 69.1.

115
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I'm pleased to say that over the last three years,

116
0:06:01.4,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we have made some progress.

117
0:06:02.92,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In 2018, we've hit 70.5,

118
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and if we project that rate of progress forward to 2030,

119
0:06:10.44,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that's going to get us to 75.2,

120
0:06:13.96,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which is obviously a long way short of our target.

121
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Indeed, on current trends, we won't hit the 2030 targets until 2094.

122
0:06:26.36,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, I don't know about you,

123
0:06:27.76,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but I certainly don't want to wait that long.

124
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So what can we do about this?

125
0:06:32.48,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Well, the first thing to do is we've got to call out the rich countries.

126
0:06:35.92,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Here are the countries closest to the SDGs,

127
0:06:38.76,000 --> 0:06:39,000
with the greatest resources,

128
0:06:40.48,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and they're falling short.

129
0:06:42.44,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Maybe they think that this is like the Old World

130
0:06:45.36,000 --> 0:06:48,000
where goals for the UN are just for poor countries and not for them.

131
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Well, you're wrong.

132
0:06:50.4,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The SDGs are for every country,

133
0:06:52.52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and it's shameful that these wealthy countries are falling short.

134
0:06:55.64,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Every country needs a plan to implement the SDGs

135
0:06:58.56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and deliver them for their citizens.

136
0:07:00.48,000 --> 0:07:02,000
G7, other rich countries --

137
0:07:02.56,000 --> 0:07:03,000
get your act together.

138
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The second thing we can do is look a bit further into the data

139
0:07:08.6,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and see where there are opportunities to accelerate progress

140
0:07:11.72,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or there are negative trends that we can reverse.

141
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So I'm going to take you into three areas.

142
0:07:17.08,000 --> 0:07:19,000
One where we're doing quite well,

143
0:07:19.2,000 --> 0:07:21,000
one where we really should be doing better

144
0:07:21.48,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and another where we've got some real problems.

145
0:07:25.4,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Let's start with the good news,

146
0:07:27.04,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and I want to talk about what we call nutrition and basic medical care.

147
0:07:31.36,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This covers SDG 2 on no hunger

148
0:07:33.84,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and the basic elements of SDG 3 on health,

149
0:07:36.2,000 --> 0:07:4,000
so maternal and child mortality, infectious diseases, etc ...

150
0:07:40.64,000 --> 0:07:44,000
This is an area where most of the rich world has hit the SDGs.

151
0:07:44.84,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And we also find, looking at our big countries,

152
0:07:47.4,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that the most advanced have got pretty close.

153
0:07:50.56,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Here are our 11 big countries,

154
0:07:52.56,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and if you look at the top,

155
0:07:53.92,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Brazil and Russia are pretty close to the SDG target.

156
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But at the bottom --

157
0:07:58.28,000 --> 0:08:,000
Ethiopia, Pakistan -- a long way to go.

158
0:08:00.6,000 --> 0:08:01,000
That's where we are in 2018.

159
0:08:02.4,000 --> 0:08:03,000
What's our trajectory?

160
0:08:03.68,000 --> 0:08:04,000
On the current trajectory,

161
0:08:05.36,000 --> 0:08:07,000
how far are we going to get by 2030?

162
0:08:07.8,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Well, let's have a look.

163
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Well, what we see is a lot of progress.

164
0:08:11.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
See Bangladesh in the middle.

165
0:08:13.64,000 --> 0:08:16,000
If Bangladesh maintains its current rate of progress,

166
0:08:16.72,000 --> 0:08:19,000
it could get very close to that SDG target.

167
0:08:19.84,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And Ethiopia at the bottom is making a huge amount of progress

168
0:08:23.32,000 --> 0:08:24,000
at the moment.

169
0:08:24.56,000 --> 0:08:27,000
If that can be maintained, Ethiopia could get a long way.

170
0:08:28.64,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We add this all up for all the countries of the world

171
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and our projection is a score of 94.5 by 2030.

172
0:08:36.88,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And if countries like the Philippines, which have grown more slowly,

173
0:08:40.12,000 --> 0:08:41,000
could accelerate progress,

174
0:08:41.44,000 --> 0:08:43,000
then we could get a lot closer.

175
0:08:43.8,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So there are reasons to be optimistic about SDGs 2 and 3.

176
0:08:48.48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But there's another very basic area of the SDGs where we're doing less well,

177
0:08:52.88,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which is SDG 6, on water and sanitation.

178
0:08:56.56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Again, it's an SDG where most of the rich countries

179
0:08:59.32,000 --> 0:09:,000
have already achieved the targets.

180
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And again, for our big countries --

181
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
our big 11 emerging countries,

182
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we see that some of the countries, like Russia and Mexico,

183
0:09:07.92,000 --> 0:09:09,000
are very close to the target,

184
0:09:10.04,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but Nigeria and other countries are a very long way back.

185
0:09:14.44,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So how are we doing on this target?

186
0:09:16.36,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What progress are we going to make over the next 12 years

187
0:09:19.56,000 --> 0:09:2,000
based on the current direction of travel?

188
0:09:22.08,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Well, here we go ...

189
0:09:23.72,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and yes, there is some progress.

190
0:09:25.52,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Our top four countries are all hitting the SDG targets --

191
0:09:28.24,000 --> 0:09:3,000
some are moving forward quite quickly.

192
0:09:30.48,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But it's not enough to really move us forward significantly.

193
0:09:33.88,000 --> 0:09:35,000
What we see is that for the world as a whole,

194
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we're forecasting a score of around 85, 86 by 2030 --

195
0:09:41.6,000 --> 0:09:42,000
not fast enough.

196
0:09:43.88,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now, obviously this is not good news,

197
0:09:45.88,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but I think what this data also shows is that we could be doing a lot better.

198
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Water and sanitation is a solved problem.

199
0:09:52.76,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's about scaling that solution everywhere.

200
0:09:55.36,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So if we could accelerate progress in some of those countries

201
0:09:58.28,000 --> 0:09:59,000
who are improving more slowly --

202
0:09:59.88,000 --> 0:10:,000
Nigeria, the Philippines, etc. --

203
0:10:01.56,000 --> 0:10:03,000
then we could get a lot closer to the goal.

204
0:10:04.48,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Indeed, I think SDG 6 is probably the biggest opportunity

205
0:10:08.92,000 --> 0:10:1,000
of all the SDGs for a step change.

206
0:10:13.92,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So that's an area we could do better.

207
0:10:16.8,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Let's look finally at an area where we are struggling,

208
0:10:19.64,000 --> 0:10:22,000
which is what we call personal rights and inclusiveness.

209
0:10:23.44,000 --> 0:10:25,000
This is covering concepts across a range of SDGs.

210
0:10:26.2,000 --> 0:10:3,000
SDG 1 on poverty, SDG 5 on gender equality,

211
0:10:30.56,000 --> 0:10:32,000
SDG 10 on inequality,

212
0:10:32.68,000 --> 0:10:34,000
SDG 11 on inclusive cities

213
0:10:35.04,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and SDG 16 on peace and justice.

214
0:10:38.72,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So across those SDGs there are themes around rights and inclusiveness,

215
0:10:42.56,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and those may seem less immediate or pressing

216
0:10:45.04,000 --> 0:10:47,000
than things like hunger and disease,

217
0:10:47.2,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but rights and inclusion are critical to an agenda of no one left behind.

218
0:10:53.24,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So how are we doing on those issues?

219
0:10:55.52,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Let's start off with personal rights.

220
0:10:57.56,000 --> 0:11:01,000
What I'm going to do first is show you our big countries in 2015.

221
0:11:01.84,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So here they are,

222
0:11:03.08,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and I've put the USA and Japan back in,

223
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:07,000
so it's our 13 biggest countries in the world.

224
0:11:07.2,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And we see a wide range of scores.

225
0:11:09.04,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The United States at the top with Japan hitting the goals;

226
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
China a long way behind.

227
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So what's been our direction of travel

228
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
on the rights agenda over the last three years?

229
0:11:18.68,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Let's have a look.

230
0:11:19.96,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Well, what we see is actually pretty ugly.

231
0:11:23.08,000 --> 0:11:26,000
The majority of the countries are standing still or moving backwards,

232
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and big countries like Brazil, India, China, Bangladesh

233
0:11:30.92,000 --> 0:11:32,000
have all seen significant declines.

234
0:11:34.24,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This is worrying.

235
0:11:36.48,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Let's have a look now at inclusiveness.

236
0:11:39.44,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And inclusiveness is looking at things

237
0:11:41.32,000 --> 0:11:43,000
like violence and discrimination against minorities,

238
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:47,000
gender equity, LGBT inclusion, etc...

239
0:11:47.24,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And as a result, we see that the scores for our big countries are generally lower.

240
0:11:51.56,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Every country, rich and poor alike, is struggling

241
0:11:54.08,000 --> 0:11:55,000
with building an inclusive society.

242
0:11:56.72,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But what's our direction of travel?

243
0:11:58.44,000 --> 0:12:,000
Are we building more inclusive countries?

244
0:12:00.56,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Let's have a look -- progress to 2018.

245
0:12:03.28,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And again we see the world moving backwards:

246
0:12:05.64,000 --> 0:12:06,000
most countries static,

247
0:12:07.4,000 --> 0:12:08,000
a lot of countries going backwards --

248
0:12:09.36,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Bangladesh moving backwards --

249
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but also, two of the countries that were leading --

250
0:12:13.72,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Brazil and the United States --

251
0:12:15.36,000 --> 0:12:16,000
have gone backwards significantly

252
0:12:17.2,000 --> 0:12:18,000
over the last three years.

253
0:12:19.76,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Let's sum this up now for the world as a whole.

254
0:12:22.28,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And what we see on personal rights for the whole world

255
0:12:25.2,000 --> 0:12:28,000
is we're forecasting actually a decline in the score on personal rights

256
0:12:28.84,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to about 60,

257
0:12:30.28,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and then this decline in the score of inclusiveness to about 42.

258
0:12:35.48,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Now, obviously these things can change quite quickly

259
0:12:37.96,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with rights and with changes in law, changes in attitudes,

260
0:12:41.92,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but we have to accept that on current trends,

261
0:12:44.24,000 --> 0:12:47,000
this is probably the most worrying aspect of the SDGs.

262
0:12:49.72,000 --> 0:12:5,000
How I've depressed you ...

263
0:12:51.04,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Laughter)

264
0:12:52.36,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I hope not because I think what we do see

265
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
is that progress is happening in a lot of places

266
0:12:58.44,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and there are opportunities for accelerating progress.

267
0:13:01.56,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We are living in a world that is tantalizingly close

268
0:13:05.32,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to ensuring that no one need die of hunger or malaria or diarrhea.

269
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
If we can focus our efforts, mobilize resources,

270
0:13:14.4,000 --> 0:13:15,000
galvanize the political will,

271
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that step change is possible.

272
0:13:19.64,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But in focusing on those really basic, solvable SDGs,

273
0:13:23.44,000 --> 0:13:25,000
we mustn't forget the whole package.

274
0:13:25.76,000 --> 0:13:3,000
The goals are an unwieldy set of indicators, goals and targets,

275
0:13:30.88,000 --> 0:13:33,000
but they also include the challenges our world faces.

276
0:13:34.44,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The fact that the SDGs are focusing attention

277
0:13:36.96,000 --> 0:13:4,000
on the fact that we face a crisis in personal rights and inclusiveness

278
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is a positive.

279
0:13:43.2,000 --> 0:13:44,000
If we forget that,

280
0:13:44.48,000 --> 0:13:48,000
if we choose to double down on the SDGs that we can solve,

281
0:13:48.52,000 --> 0:13:53,000
if we go for SDG à la carte and pick the most easy SDGs,

282
0:13:54.2,000 --> 0:13:57,000
then we will have missed the point of the SDGs,

283
0:13:57.6,000 --> 0:13:58,000
we will miss the goals

284
0:13:59.32,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and we will have failed on the promise of the SDGs.

285
0:14:03.6,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you.

286
0:14:04.84,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Applause)

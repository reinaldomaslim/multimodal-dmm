1
0:00:12.721,000 --> 0:00:13,000
How did you discover your passion

2
0:00:14.398,000 --> 0:00:15,000
or find your career?

3
0:00:15.951,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Were you exposed to it?

4
0:00:17.391,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Or was it trial and error?

5
0:00:19.38,000 --> 0:00:22,000
As child rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman said,

6
0:00:22.573,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"You can't be what you can't see."

7
0:00:25.573,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Fortunately, we now live in a time

8
0:00:27.812,000 --> 0:00:3,000
when emerging technologies may help us to solve this problem.

9
0:00:32.023,000 --> 0:00:33,000
For the past two years,

10
0:00:33.41,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've been developing an extended reality program

11
0:00:36.181,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that enables middle school students from across the country

12
0:00:39.587,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to take on the role of a marine biologist --

13
0:00:42.209,000 --> 0:00:44,000
even if they've never seen the ocean.

14
0:00:45.454,000 --> 0:00:48,000
As one seventh grader who recently completed our program said,

15
0:00:48.867,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"I could see myself as a scientist,

16
0:00:50.996,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because I enjoyed this game."

17
0:00:53.838,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This feedback really excited me,

18
0:00:55.826,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because too few students do see themselves as scientists.

19
0:00:59.849,000 --> 0:01:04,000
A 2014 study showed that 57 percent of eighth- and ninth-grade students

20
0:01:05.632,000 --> 0:01:06,000
said, "Science isn't me."

21
0:01:08.118,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Coincidentally, also in 2014,

22
0:01:10.584,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I met Mandë Holford, a marine biochemist,

23
0:01:13.559,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and Lindsay Portnoy, an educational psychologist.

24
0:01:16.74,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The three of us shared a passion

25
0:01:18.662,000 --> 0:01:22,000
for getting students excited by and comfortable with science.

26
0:01:23.259,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We thought about how we could give children

27
0:01:25.512,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the most realistic experience of a scientific career.

28
0:01:28.825,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We discussed the research;

29
0:01:30.184,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it showed that students felt comfortable taking risks when playing games.

30
0:01:35.02,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So the three of us started an educational games company

31
0:01:38.617,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to bring science to life.

32
0:01:41.37,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Virtual reality seemed like a low-cost way of increasing access.

33
0:01:45.782,000 --> 0:01:47,000
In addition, academic research has shown

34
0:01:48.45,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that virtual reality may lead to increases in learning retention.

35
0:01:52.368,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This was perfect for us, as we wanted to be in schools

36
0:01:55.179,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so that we could reach the most number of students possible,

37
0:01:58.039,000 --> 0:02:01,000
particularly students who have been underrepresented in science.

38
0:02:01.622,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, with funding from the National Science Foundation,

39
0:02:04.707,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we began developing our extended reality program

40
0:02:07.438,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that combined virtual reality

41
0:02:09.327,000 --> 0:02:11,000
with personalized digital journaling.

42
0:02:12.035,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We worked with teachers while developing it

43
0:02:14.106,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to ensure that it would fit seamlessly into existing curricula

44
0:02:18.13,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and empower teachers to use cutting-edge technology in their classroom.

45
0:02:22.686,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We designed the virtual reality for Google Cardboard,

46
0:02:25.265,000 --> 0:02:27,000
which requires only a smartphone

47
0:02:27.301,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and a 10 dollar VR viewer made of cardboard.

48
0:02:31.833,000 --> 0:02:32,000
With this inexpensive headset,

49
0:02:33.768,000 --> 0:02:36,000
students are transported to an underwater expedition.

50
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Students use their digital journal

51
0:02:39.153,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to write down their notes,

52
0:02:41.005,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to answer questions,

53
0:02:42.415,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to construct models

54
0:02:43.756,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and to develop hypotheses.

55
0:02:45.692,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Students then go to the virtual world to test their hypotheses

56
0:02:48.989,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and see if they're accurate,

57
0:02:50.479,000 --> 0:02:52,000
much as scientists go to the field

58
0:02:52.653,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in their careers.

59
0:02:55.054,000 --> 0:02:57,000
When students return to their digital journal,

60
0:02:57.239,000 --> 0:02:59,000
they share their observations, claims,

61
0:02:59.597,000 --> 0:03:,000
reasoning and evidence.

62
0:03:01.925,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The students' written answers and virtual interactions

63
0:03:06.11,000 --> 0:03:07,000
are all updated live

64
0:03:07.888,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in an educator assessment dashboard,

65
0:03:09.889,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so that teachers can follow their progress

66
0:03:12.426,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and support them as needed.

67
0:03:15.061,000 --> 0:03:17,000
To give you a better sense, I'm going to show you

68
0:03:17.391,000 --> 0:03:18,000
a little bit of what students see.

69
0:03:20.139,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This is the virtual reality when they're underwater

70
0:03:22.673,000 --> 0:03:24,000
observing the flora and fauna.

71
0:03:26.615,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is the digital journal where they're constructing their models

72
0:03:29.807,000 --> 0:03:31,000
based on this abiotic data to show what they expect to see.

73
0:03:33.705,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Here, they're supporting that with qualitative statements.

74
0:03:36.459,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And this is the educator dashboard that shows progress

75
0:03:39.228,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and enables [teachers] to see the students' answers as they go.

76
0:03:44.767,000 --> 0:03:46,000
When we were creating BioDive,

77
0:03:46.822,000 --> 0:03:48,000
again, we really wanted to focus on access,

78
0:03:49.01,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so we designed it to require only one phone for every four students.

79
0:03:53.42,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We also knew how collaborative science work is,

80
0:03:56.983,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so we constructed the experience to only be solved

81
0:03:59.871,000 --> 0:04:,000
through collaborative teamwork,

82
0:04:01.4,000 --> 0:04:04,000
as each student is an expert in a different geographic location.

83
0:04:06.044,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Given that these children's brains are still developing,

84
0:04:09.081,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we limited each experience to last a maximum of two minutes.

85
0:04:13.243,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And finally, because we know the importance of repeated exposure

86
0:04:17.414,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for internalizing knowledge,

87
0:04:19.11,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we constructed BioDive to take place over five class periods.

88
0:04:23.642,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We started piloting BioDive in 2017

89
0:04:27.19,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in 20 schools in New York and New Jersey.

90
0:04:29.829,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We wanted to see students as they were using this new technology.

91
0:04:33.827,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In 2019, now,

92
0:04:36.047,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we are now piloting in 26 states.

93
0:04:39.995,000 --> 0:04:41,000
What we have heard from teachers who have taught our program:

94
0:04:42.896,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"It was a nice way to show ocean dynamics without the luxury of actually being there

95
0:04:46.953,000 --> 0:04:47,000
since we are in Ohio."

96
0:04:48.152,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:49.251,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"It's pretty mind-blowing."

98
0:04:50.601,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"The students were totally engaged."

99
0:04:53.27,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But what really gives us hope is what we're hearing from students.

100
0:04:57.209,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"I liked how it felt like I was there."

101
0:04:59.123,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"It's interactive and a fun way to learn."

102
0:05:01.624,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"It really gave me realistic examples of how these organisms appear."

103
0:05:06.102,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"I could see myself as a scientist because it seems really fun."

104
0:05:11.22,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Our feedback wasn't always so positive.

105
0:05:13.94,000 --> 0:05:14,000
When we began developing,

106
0:05:15.542,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we started off by asking students

107
0:05:17.533,000 --> 0:05:18,000
what they liked,

108
0:05:18.711,000 --> 0:05:19,000
what they didn't like

109
0:05:19.886,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and what they found confusing.

110
0:05:21.742,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Eventually we began asking what they wished they could do.

111
0:05:26.149,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Their feedback gave us concrete items to build in

112
0:05:29.593,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to be sure that we were including student voices in what we were designing.

113
0:05:34.03,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Overall, what we have learned is that this is the beginning of a new platform

114
0:05:38.651,000 --> 0:05:4,000
for giving students both voice and ownership

115
0:05:41.573,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in deciding how they want to have impact

116
0:05:43.847,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in their careers.

117
0:05:45.693,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We focused on science,

118
0:05:47.277,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because we know we need scientists

119
0:05:48.967,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to help us solve our current and future challenges.

120
0:05:52.537,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But virtual reality could support students in any area.

121
0:05:56.66,000 --> 0:06:,000
How could we support students in exploring all of their desires

122
0:06:01.216,000 --> 0:06:05,000
with these eye-opening experiences and chances to learn from primary sources?

123
0:06:05.36,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Could we create VR for inexpensive headsets

124
0:06:09.974,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that lets them be immersed in oral literature

125
0:06:12.755,000 --> 0:06:14,000
or in critical moments of human history?

126
0:06:15.59,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Extended reality has the potential to change the trajectory

127
0:06:19.589,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of our children's lives

128
0:06:21.084,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and lead them to careers they never imagined

129
0:06:24.11,000 --> 0:06:27,000
by giving them the chance to see what they can be.

130
0:06:27.793,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Thank you.

131
0:06:29.029,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.079,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.

3
0:00:18.03,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I've spent hundreds of days

4
0:00:19.839,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in psychiatric hospitals.

5
0:00:21.326,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I might have ended up spending

6
0:00:23.131,000 --> 0:00:24,000
most of my life on the back ward of a hospital,

7
0:00:24.958,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but that isn't how my life turned out.

8
0:00:27.158,000 --> 0:00:3,000
In fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals

9
0:00:30.606,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for almost three decades,

10
0:00:32.095,000 --> 0:00:33,000
perhaps my proudest accomplishment.

11
0:00:34.038,000 --> 0:00:36,000
That's not to say that I've remained clear

12
0:00:36.232,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of all psychiatric struggles.

13
0:00:37.839,000 --> 0:00:39,000
After I graduated from the Yale Law School and

14
0:00:40.264,000 --> 0:00:43,000
got my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,

15
0:00:43.27,000 --> 0:00:45,000
announced to me that he was going to close his practice

16
0:00:45.855,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in three months, several years

17
0:00:47.735,000 --> 0:00:48,000
before I had planned to leave New Haven.

18
0:00:49.432,000 --> 0:00:51,000
White had been enormously helpful to me,

19
0:00:52.201,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the thought of his leaving

20
0:00:53.258,000 --> 0:00:54,000
shattered me.

21
0:00:55.144,000 --> 0:00:56,000
My best friend Steve,

22
0:00:56.614,000 --> 0:00:57,000
sensing that something was terribly wrong,

23
0:00:58.366,000 --> 0:00:59,000
flew out to New Haven to be with me.

24
0:01:00.198,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings:

25
0:01:02.286,000 --> 0:01:04,000
"I opened the door to my studio apartment.

26
0:01:04.801,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Steve would later tell me that,

27
0:01:06.974,000 --> 0:01:08,000
for all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing

28
0:01:09.71,000 --> 0:01:11,000
could have prepared him for what he saw that day.

29
0:01:11.711,000 --> 0:01:13,000
For a week or more, I had barely eaten.

30
0:01:14.384,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I was gaunt. I walked

31
0:01:16.944,000 --> 0:01:17,000
as though my legs were wooden.

32
0:01:18.558,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My face looked and felt like a mask.

33
0:01:21.585,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so

34
0:01:24.429,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in the middle of the day

35
0:01:25.384,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the apartment was in near total darkness.

36
0:01:27.398,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The air was fetid, the room a shambles.

37
0:01:30.15,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated

38
0:01:33.466,000 --> 0:01:36,000
many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day

39
0:01:36.599,000 --> 0:01:38,000
he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.

40
0:01:39.287,000 --> 0:01:42,000
'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch,

41
0:01:42.366,000 --> 0:01:44,000
where I sat in silence for several moments.

42
0:01:44.49,000 --> 0:01:45,000
'Thank you for coming, Steve.

43
0:01:46.335,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Crumbling world, word, voice.

44
0:01:50.386,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Tell the clocks to stop.

45
0:01:52.255,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Time is. Time has come.'

46
0:01:54.046,000 --> 0:01:57,000
'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.

47
0:01:57.287,000 --> 0:02:,000
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.

48
0:02:00.718,000 --> 0:02:01,000
'Gravity is pulling me down.

49
0:02:02.345,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'"

50
0:02:04.478,000 --> 0:02:07,000
As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital

51
0:02:08.19,000 --> 0:02:1,000
on three different occasions for lengthy periods.

52
0:02:10.694,000 --> 0:02:12,000
My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,

53
0:02:13.486,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and gave me a prognosis of "grave."

54
0:02:16.081,000 --> 0:02:19,000
That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,

55
0:02:19.511,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and work at menial jobs.

56
0:02:21.215,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Fortunately, I did not actually

57
0:02:23.215,000 --> 0:02:24,000
enact that grave prognosis.

58
0:02:24.99,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Instead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology

59
0:02:27.831,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,

60
0:02:30.456,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I have many close friends

61
0:02:32.086,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.

62
0:02:35.271,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Applause) Thank you.

63
0:02:41.814,000 --> 0:02:44,000
He's definitely the star of my show.

64
0:02:45.072,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I'd like to share with you how that happened, and also

65
0:02:47.87,000 --> 0:02:49,000
describe my experience of being psychotic.

66
0:02:50.639,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I hasten to add that it's my experience,

67
0:02:53.119,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.

68
0:02:55.775,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia.

69
0:02:58.836,000 --> 0:03:,000
Schizophrenia is a brain disease.

70
0:03:01.057,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Its defining feature is psychosis, or being

71
0:03:03.482,000 --> 0:03:04,000
out of touch with reality.

72
0:03:05.074,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Delusions and hallucinations

73
0:03:06.896,000 --> 0:03:07,000
are hallmarks of the illness.

74
0:03:08.45,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive

75
0:03:11.202,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.

76
0:03:15.018,000 --> 0:03:17,000
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have

77
0:03:17.368,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands

78
0:03:19.619,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of people with my thoughts.

79
0:03:21.196,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I sometimes have the idea that

80
0:03:22.901,000 --> 0:03:24,000
nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.

81
0:03:25.396,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Occasionally, I have hallucinations,

82
0:03:27.732,000 --> 0:03:28,000
like one time I turned around and saw a man

83
0:03:29.5,000 --> 0:03:3,000
with a raised knife.

84
0:03:31.077,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake.

85
0:03:33.869,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Often, speech and thinking become disorganized

86
0:03:37.079,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to the point of incoherence.

87
0:03:38.625,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Loose associations involves putting together words

88
0:03:41.504,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense,

89
0:03:44.287,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."

90
0:03:46.677,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Contrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not

91
0:03:51.115,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.

92
0:03:54.53,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.

93
0:03:58.081,000 --> 0:04:,000
Everyone has seen a street person,

94
0:04:00.66,000 --> 0:04:02,000
unkempt, probably ill-fed,

95
0:04:02.683,000 --> 0:04:04,000
standing outside of an office building muttering

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to himself or shouting.

97
0:04:07.073,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.

98
0:04:09.67,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array

99
0:04:12.001,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of socioeconomic status, and there are people

100
0:04:14.825,000 --> 0:04:16,000
with the illness who are full-time professionals

101
0:04:17.355,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with major responsibilities.

102
0:04:19.707,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Several years ago, I decided

103
0:04:20.918,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to write down my experiences and my personal journey,

104
0:04:24.353,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and I want to share some more of that story with you today

105
0:04:26.651,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to convey the inside view.

106
0:04:28.314,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So the following episode happened the seventh week

107
0:04:31.099,000 --> 0:04:33,000
of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.

108
0:04:33.962,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Quoting from my writings:

109
0:04:36.167,000 --> 0:04:39,000
"My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date

110
0:04:39.636,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to meet in the law school library on Friday night

111
0:04:42.597,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to work on our memo assignment together.

112
0:04:44.881,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways

113
0:04:46.683,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that made no sense.

114
0:04:48.206,000 --> 0:04:51,000
'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.

115
0:04:51.27,000 --> 0:04:53,000
'They make certain points. The point is on your head.

116
0:04:53.79,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?'

117
0:04:56.245,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Rebel and Val looked at me

118
0:04:58.261,000 --> 0:04:59,000
as if they or I had been

119
0:04:59.932,000 --> 0:05:,000
splashed in the face with cold water.

120
0:05:01.512,000 --> 0:05:02,000
'What are you talking about, Elyn?'

121
0:05:03.068,000 --> 0:05:06,000
'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who,

122
0:05:06.077,000 --> 0:05:08,000
heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.

123
0:05:08.332,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's a flat surface. It's safe.'

124
0:05:09.908,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Rebel and Val followed

125
0:05:11.492,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and they asked what had gotten into me.

126
0:05:12.941,000 --> 0:05:13,000
'This is the real me,' I announced,

127
0:05:14.804,000 --> 0:05:15,000
waving my arms above my head.

128
0:05:16.349,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And then, late on a Friday night, on the roof

129
0:05:19.124,000 --> 0:05:2,000
of the Yale Law School,

130
0:05:20.281,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I began to sing, and not quietly either.

131
0:05:22.573,000 --> 0:05:25,000
'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.

132
0:05:25.677,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Do you want to dance?'

133
0:05:26.988,000 --> 0:05:28,000
'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?'

134
0:05:29.463,000 --> 0:05:31,000
'High? Me? No way, no drugs.

135
0:05:31.919,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Come to the Florida sunshine bush,

136
0:05:34.486,000 --> 0:05:37,000
where there are lemons, where they make demons.'

137
0:05:37.759,000 --> 0:05:39,000
'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val

138
0:05:40.453,000 --> 0:05:41,000
headed back into the library.

139
0:05:42.232,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I shrugged and followed them.

140
0:05:44.349,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Back inside, I asked my classmates if they were

141
0:05:47.716,000 --> 0:05:49,000
having the same experience of words jumping around

142
0:05:49.933,000 --> 0:05:5,000
our cases as I was.

143
0:05:51.277,000 --> 0:05:55,000
'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.

144
0:05:55.3,000 --> 0:05:56,000
'We've got to case the joint.

145
0:05:56.804,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I don't believe in joints, but

146
0:05:58.387,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they do hold your body together.'" --

147
0:05:59.852,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's an example of loose associations. --

148
0:06:02.221,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room,

149
0:06:04.605,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and once there, I couldn't settle down.

150
0:06:06.964,000 --> 0:06:07,000
My head was too full of noise,

151
0:06:08.789,000 --> 0:06:11,000
too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write

152
0:06:12.476,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.

153
0:06:15.108,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,

154
0:06:18.453,000 --> 0:06:2,000
moaning in fear and isolation."

155
0:06:20.485,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.

156
0:06:23.612,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I had two earlier in England.

157
0:06:25.852,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Continuing with the writings:

158
0:06:27.413,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask

159
0:06:29.877,000 --> 0:06:3,000
for an extension on the memo assignment,

160
0:06:31.454,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and I began gibbering unintelligably

161
0:06:33.611,000 --> 0:06:34,000
as I had the night before,

162
0:06:34.957,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.

163
0:06:36.63,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor'

164
0:06:40.431,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and his whole team of goons swooped down,

165
0:06:42.398,000 --> 0:06:43,000
lifted me high into the air,

166
0:06:43.807,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and slammed me down on a metal bed

167
0:06:45.48,000 --> 0:06:47,000
with such force that I saw stars.

168
0:06:47.832,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed

169
0:06:50.39,000 --> 0:06:51,000
with thick leather straps.

170
0:06:52.057,000 --> 0:06:55,000
A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before:

171
0:06:55.403,000 --> 0:06:57,000
half groan, half scream,

172
0:06:57.431,000 --> 0:07:,000
barely human and pure terror.

173
0:07:00.775,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Then the sound came again,

174
0:07:02.446,000 --> 0:07:03,000
forced from somewhere deep inside my belly

175
0:07:04.37,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and scraping my throat raw."

176
0:07:05.967,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.

177
0:07:10.246,000 --> 0:07:13,000
One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me

178
0:07:13.787,000 --> 0:07:14,000
against my will was that I was

179
0:07:15.072,000 --> 0:07:16,000
"gravely disabled."

180
0:07:16.479,000 --> 0:07:19,000
To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable

181
0:07:19.575,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to do my Yale Law School homework.

182
0:07:21.367,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.

183
0:07:24.408,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:26.014,000 --> 0:07:28,000
During the next year, I would

185
0:07:28.703,000 --> 0:07:3,000
spend five months in a psychiatric hospital.

186
0:07:30.855,000 --> 0:07:33,000
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,

187
0:07:34.334,000 --> 0:07:37,000
arms tied, arms and legs tied down,

188
0:07:37.824,000 --> 0:07:39,000
arms and legs tied down with a net tied

189
0:07:40.343,000 --> 0:07:41,000
tightly across my chest.

190
0:07:42.151,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I never struck anyone.

191
0:07:44.198,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.

192
0:07:47.104,000 --> 0:07:49,000
If you've never been restrained yourself, you may have

193
0:07:49.878,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a benign image of the experience.

194
0:07:52.575,000 --> 0:07:53,000
There's nothing benign about it.

195
0:07:54.55,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Every week in the United States,

196
0:07:56.335,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.

197
0:07:59.255,000 --> 0:08:01,000
They strangle, they aspirate their vomit,

198
0:08:01.871,000 --> 0:08:03,000
they suffocate, they have a heart attack.

199
0:08:04.024,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints

200
0:08:06.55,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is actually saving lives or costing lives.

201
0:08:09.07,000 --> 0:08:11,000
While I was preparing to write my student note

202
0:08:11.864,000 --> 0:08:13,000
for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,

203
0:08:14.064,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I consulted an eminent law professor who was also

204
0:08:16.416,000 --> 0:08:17,000
a psychiatrist,

205
0:08:17.501,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and said surely he would agree

206
0:08:19.214,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that restraints must be degrading,

207
0:08:21.51,000 --> 0:08:22,000
painful and frightening.

208
0:08:23.046,000 --> 0:08:25,000
He looked at me in a knowing way, and said,

209
0:08:25.157,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"Elyn, you don't really understand:

210
0:08:27.486,000 --> 0:08:28,000
These people are psychotic.

211
0:08:29.224,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They're different from me and you.

212
0:08:30.745,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."

213
0:08:33.509,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that,

214
0:08:36.343,000 --> 0:08:38,000
no, we're not that different from him.

215
0:08:38.344,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We don't like to be strapped down to a bed

216
0:08:40.702,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and left to suffer for hours any more than he would.

217
0:08:43.032,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In fact, until very recently,

218
0:08:45.184,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,

219
0:08:47.166,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.

220
0:08:50.198,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I've never met a psychiatric patient

221
0:08:52.63,000 --> 0:08:53,000
who agreed with that view.

222
0:08:54.024,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Today, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry

223
0:08:56.735,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but very anti-force.

224
0:08:58.238,000 --> 0:09:,000
I don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think

225
0:09:01.229,000 --> 0:09:03,000
using force is a terrible thing to do to another person

226
0:09:03.966,000 --> 0:09:04,000
with a terrible illness.

227
0:09:05.325,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Eventually, I came to Los Angeles

228
0:09:08.046,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to teach at the University of Southern California Law School.

229
0:09:10.544,000 --> 0:09:12,000
For years, I had resisted medication,

230
0:09:12.864,000 --> 0:09:13,000
making many, many efforts to get off.

231
0:09:14.854,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I felt that if I could manage without medication,

232
0:09:17.529,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I could prove that, after all,

233
0:09:19.567,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.

234
0:09:22.317,000 --> 0:09:25,000
My motto was the less medicine, the less defective.

235
0:09:25.624,000 --> 0:09:28,000
My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me

236
0:09:28.712,000 --> 0:09:3,000
just to stay on medication and get on with my life,

237
0:09:31.212,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.

238
0:09:34.687,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Quoting from the text:

239
0:09:36.119,000 --> 0:09:39,000
"I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time

240
0:09:39.759,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I began feeling the effects.

241
0:09:41.871,000 --> 0:09:43,000
After returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into

242
0:09:44.712,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Kaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,

243
0:09:48.089,000 --> 0:09:5,000
covered my face, and began shaking.

244
0:09:50.322,000 --> 0:09:53,000
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.

245
0:09:53.477,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They'd slice me up in thin slices

246
0:09:55.645,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or make me swallow hot coals.

247
0:09:57.287,000 --> 0:10:,000
Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.'

248
0:10:00.664,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Even in this state, what he accurately described as

249
0:10:03.749,000 --> 0:10:04,000
acutely and forwardly psychotic,

250
0:10:05.44,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I refused to take more medication.

251
0:10:07.453,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The mission is not yet complete.

252
0:10:10.253,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan,

253
0:10:12.871,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert

254
0:10:15.169,000 --> 0:10:17,000
who was following me for medication side effects.

255
0:10:17.477,000 --> 0:10:2,000
He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.

256
0:10:20.498,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Once in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over,

257
0:10:23.926,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and began muttering.

258
0:10:25.565,000 --> 0:10:27,000
'Head explosions and people trying to kill.

259
0:10:27.795,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Is it okay if I totally trash your office?'

260
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,'

261
0:10:32.892,000 --> 0:10:32,000
said Marder.

262
0:10:33.875,000 --> 0:10:36,000
'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.

263
0:10:37.027,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?

264
0:10:38.675,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Hundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.'

265
0:10:41.252,000 --> 0:10:42,000
'Elyn, do you feel like you're

266
0:10:42.987,000 --> 0:10:43,000
dangerous to yourself or others?

267
0:10:44.484,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I think you need to be in the hospital.

268
0:10:46.899,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing

269
0:10:48.756,000 --> 0:10:49,000
could be very discrete.'

270
0:10:49.891,000 --> 0:10:5,000
'Ha, ha, ha.

271
0:10:51.572,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You're offering to put me in hospitals?

272
0:10:53.909,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.

273
0:10:56.852,000 --> 0:10:59,000
One must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'"

274
0:11:00.516,000 --> 0:11:01,000
At that point in the text,

275
0:11:02.099,000 --> 0:11:03,000
where I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband

276
0:11:04.004,000 --> 0:11:05,000
made a marginal note.

277
0:11:05.029,000 --> 0:11:06,000
He said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"

278
0:11:06.636,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Laughter)

279
0:11:08.867,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"'I give life and I take it away.

280
0:11:12.619,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Forgive me, for I know not what I do.'

281
0:11:14.316,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Eventually, I broke down in front of friends, and

282
0:11:17.63,000 --> 0:11:19,000
everybody convinced me to take more medication.

283
0:11:20.138,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I could no longer deny the truth,

284
0:11:22.084,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and I could not change it.

285
0:11:23.606,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks,

286
0:11:26.255,000 --> 0:11:29,000
separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past,

287
0:11:29.368,000 --> 0:11:31,000
lay smashed and in ruins."

288
0:11:31.479,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here,

289
0:11:34.152,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons:

290
0:11:37.026,000 --> 0:11:39,000
First, I've had excellent treatment.

291
0:11:39.418,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy

292
0:11:42.364,000 --> 0:11:44,000
for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.

293
0:11:45.348,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Second, I have many close family members and friends who know me

294
0:11:49.392,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and know my illness.

295
0:11:50.646,000 --> 0:11:52,000
These relationships have given my life a meaning

296
0:11:52.97,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and a depth, and they also helped me navigate

297
0:11:55.137,000 --> 0:11:56,000
my life in the face of symptoms.

298
0:11:57.105,000 --> 0:12:,000
Third, I work at an enormously supportive workplace

299
0:12:00.273,000 --> 0:12:01,000
at USC Law School.

300
0:12:01.858,000 --> 0:12:04,000
This is a place that not only accommodates my needs

301
0:12:04.883,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but actually embraces them.

302
0:12:06.274,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's also a very intellectually stimulating place,

303
0:12:09.305,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and occupying my mind with complex problems

304
0:12:11.897,000 --> 0:12:14,000
has been my best and most powerful and most reliable

305
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
defense against my mental illness.

306
0:12:17.05,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family and

307
0:12:20.353,000 --> 0:12:21,000
friends, supportive work environment —

308
0:12:22.269,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I did not make my illness public

309
0:12:24.602,000 --> 0:12:25,000
until relatively late in life,

310
0:12:26.035,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and that's because the stigma against mental illness

311
0:12:28.554,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.

312
0:12:31.162,000 --> 0:12:33,000
If you hear nothing else today,

313
0:12:33.578,000 --> 0:12:36,000
please hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."

314
0:12:37.012,000 --> 0:12:4,000
There are people with schizophrenia, and these people

315
0:12:40.163,000 --> 0:12:42,000
may be your spouse, they may be your child,

316
0:12:42.258,000 --> 0:12:44,000
they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,

317
0:12:44.682,000 --> 0:12:45,000
they may be your coworker.

318
0:12:46.106,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So let me share some final thoughts.

319
0:12:48.962,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We need to invest more resources into research and treatment

320
0:12:52.394,000 --> 0:12:53,000
of mental illness.

321
0:12:53.634,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The better we understand these illnesses, the better

322
0:12:55.69,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments

323
0:12:57.898,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we can provide, the more we can offer people care,

324
0:13:00.338,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and not have to use force.

325
0:13:01.786,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.

326
0:13:04.738,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail

327
0:13:08.786,000 --> 0:13:1,000
is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.

328
0:13:11.428,000 --> 0:13:14,000
American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer

329
0:13:15.344,000 --> 0:13:17,000
from severe mental illness, and many of them are there

330
0:13:17.828,000 --> 0:13:18,000
because they never received adequate treatment.

331
0:13:19.805,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.

332
0:13:23.234,000 --> 0:13:26,000
A message to the entertainment industry and to the press:

333
0:13:26.458,000 --> 0:13:3,000
On the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma

334
0:13:30.522,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and prejudice of many kinds.

335
0:13:32.338,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies,

336
0:13:35.338,000 --> 0:13:37,000
your plays, your columns,

337
0:13:37.466,000 --> 0:13:38,000
who suffer with severe mental illness.

338
0:13:39.29,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Portray them sympathetically,

339
0:13:41.05,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and portray them in all the richness and depth

340
0:13:43.689,000 --> 0:13:46,000
of their experience as people and not as diagnoses.

341
0:13:47.216,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Recently, a friend posed a question:

342
0:13:49.492,000 --> 0:13:5,000
If there were a pill I could take

343
0:13:51.267,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that would instantly cure me, would I take it?

344
0:13:53.078,000 --> 0:13:55,000
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke

345
0:13:55.771,000 --> 0:13:56,000
was offered psychoanalysis.

346
0:13:57.243,000 --> 0:13:59,000
He declined, saying, "Don't take my devils away,

347
0:13:59.555,000 --> 0:14:,000
because my angels may flee too."

348
0:14:01.314,000 --> 0:14:03,000
My psychosis, on the other hand,

349
0:14:03.507,000 --> 0:14:05,000
is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying

350
0:14:06.179,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that all my angels have already fled.

351
0:14:08.115,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So would I take the pill? In an instant.

352
0:14:12.019,000 --> 0:14:14,000
That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting

353
0:14:14.7,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill,

354
0:14:17.093,000 --> 0:14:19,000
nor am I asking anyone for their pity.

355
0:14:19.375,000 --> 0:14:22,000
What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share

356
0:14:22.521,000 --> 0:14:24,000
is more important than the mental illness we may not.

357
0:14:25.139,000 --> 0:14:27,000
What those of us who suffer with mental illness want

358
0:14:27.597,000 --> 0:14:28,000
is what everybody wants:

359
0:14:29.051,000 --> 0:14:31,000
in the words of Sigmund Freud, "to work and to love."

360
0:14:31.585,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Thank you. (Applause)

361
0:14:34.608,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Applause)

362
0:14:35.285,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind. (Applause)

363
0:14:40.078,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Thank you. (Applause)

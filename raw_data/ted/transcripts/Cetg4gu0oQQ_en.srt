1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As an actor, I get scripts

2
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and it's my job to stay on script,

3
0:00:18.2,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to say my lines

4
0:00:19.84,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and bring to life a character that someone else wrote.

5
0:00:23.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Over the course of my career,

6
0:00:25.28,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I've had the great honor

7
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:31,000
playing some of the greatest male role models ever

8
0:00:31.08,000 --> 0:00:32,000
represented on television.

9
0:00:33.28,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You might recognize me as "Male Escort #1."

10
0:00:36.36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:38.88,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"Photographer Date Rapist,"

12
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:43,000
"Shirtless Date Rapist"

13
0:00:43.32,000 --> 0:00:45,000
from the award-winning "Spring Break Shark Attack."

14
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:48.12,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"Shirtless Medical Student,"

16
0:00:49.52,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"Shirtless Steroid-Using Con Man"

17
0:00:51.48,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and, in my most well-known role, as Rafael.

18
0:00:55.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Applause)

19
0:00:58.6,000 --> 0:01:,000
A brooding, reformed playboy

20
0:01:01.24,000 --> 0:01:02,000
who falls for, of all things, a virgin,

21
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and who is only occasionally shirtless.

22
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:08.6,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now, these roles don't represent the kind of man I am in my real life,

24
0:01:12.92,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but that's what I love about acting.

25
0:01:14.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I get to live inside characters very different than myself.

26
0:01:18.88,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But every time I got one of these roles, I was surprised,

27
0:01:22.28,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because most of the men I play ooze machismo,

28
0:01:25.24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
charisma and power,

29
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and when I look in the mirror, that's just not how I see myself.

30
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But it was how Hollywood saw me,

31
0:01:32.44,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and over time, I noticed a parallel

32
0:01:34.76,000 --> 0:01:36,000
between the roles I would play as a man

33
0:01:36.88,000 --> 0:01:38,000
both on-screen and off.

34
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I've been pretending to be a man that I'm not my entire life.

35
0:01:45.76,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I've been pretending to be strong when I felt weak,

36
0:01:49.44,000 --> 0:01:51,000
confident when I felt insecure

37
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and tough when really I was hurting.

38
0:01:56.04,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I think for the most part I've just been kind of putting on a show,

39
0:02:00.76,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but I'm tired of performing.

40
0:02:03.4,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I can tell you right now

41
0:02:05.08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that it is exhausting trying to be man enough for everyone all the time.

42
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now -- right?

43
0:02:13.8,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
My brother heard that.

45
0:02:18.12,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, for as long as I can remember, I've been told

46
0:02:20.96,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the kind of man that I should grow up to be.

47
0:02:23.72,000 --> 0:02:27,000
As a boy, all I wanted was to be accepted and liked by the other boys,

48
0:02:28.04,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but that acceptance meant I had to acquire

49
0:02:30.12,000 --> 0:02:32,000
this almost disgusted view of the feminine,

50
0:02:32.6,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and since we were told that feminine is the opposite of masculine,

51
0:02:35.76,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I either had to reject embodying any of these qualities

52
0:02:38.96,000 --> 0:02:39,000
or face rejection myself.

53
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is the script that we've been given.

54
0:02:44.32,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Right? Girls are weak, and boys are strong.

55
0:02:48.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This is what's being subconsciously communicated

56
0:02:50.4,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to hundreds of millions of young boys and girls all over the world,

57
0:02:54.2,000 --> 0:02:55,000
just like it was with me.

58
0:02:56.96,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Well, I came here today to say, as a man

59
0:03:01.72,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that this is wrong, this is toxic,

60
0:03:04.96,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and it has to end.

61
0:03:06.4,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Applause)

62
0:03:12.72,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, I'm not here to give a history lesson.

63
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We likely all know how we got here, OK?

64
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But I'm just a guy that woke up after 30 years and realized

65
0:03:21.72,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that I was living in a state of conflict,

66
0:03:23.72,000 --> 0:03:25,000
conflict with who I feel I am in my core

67
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and conflict with who the world tells me as a man I should be.

68
0:03:30.36,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But I don't have a desire

69
0:03:31.6,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to fit into the current broken definition of masculinity,

70
0:03:35.68,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because I don't just want to be a good man.

71
0:03:39.76,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I want to be a good human.

72
0:03:42.28,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And I believe the only way that can happen

73
0:03:44.32,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is if men learn to not only embrace the qualities

74
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that we were told are feminine in ourselves

75
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but to be willing to stand up,

76
0:03:52.2,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to champion and learn from the women who embody them.

77
0:03:57.08,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now, men --

78
0:03:58.36,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I am not saying that everything we have learned is toxic. OK?

80
0:04:03.68,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with you or me,

81
0:04:06.72,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and men, I'm not saying we have to stop being men.

82
0:04:09.72,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But we need balance, right?

83
0:04:12.76,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We need balance,

84
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and the only way things will change is if we take a real honest look

85
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
at the scripts that have been passed down to us

86
0:04:20.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
from generation to generation

87
0:04:22.24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and the roles that, as men, we choose to take on

88
0:04:25.48,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in our everyday lives.

89
0:04:27.32,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So speaking of scripts,

90
0:04:28.6,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the first script I ever got came from my dad.

91
0:04:32.079,000 --> 0:04:33,000
My dad is awesome.

92
0:04:33.76,000 --> 0:04:39,000
He's loving, he's kind, he's sensitive, he's nurturing,

93
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:41,000
he's here.

94
0:04:42.04,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Applause)

95
0:04:48.6,000 --> 0:04:49,000
He's crying.

96
0:04:49.84,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:52.6,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But, sorry, Dad, as a kid I resented him for it,

98
0:04:56.8,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because I blamed him for making me soft,

99
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:01,000
which wasn't welcomed in the small town in Oregon

100
0:05:01.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that we had moved to.

101
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Because being soft meant that I was bullied.

102
0:05:06.04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
See, my dad wasn't traditionally masculine,

103
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:1,000
so he didn't teach me how to use my hands.

104
0:05:10.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
He didn't teach me how to hunt, how to fight,

105
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you know, man stuff.

106
0:05:17.08,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Instead he taught me what he knew:

107
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that being a man was about sacrifice

108
0:05:23.24,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and doing whatever you can

109
0:05:24.52,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to take care of and provide for your family.

110
0:05:27.04,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But there was another role I learned how to play from my dad,

111
0:05:29.96,000 --> 0:05:31,000
who, I discovered, learned it from his dad,

112
0:05:32.04,000 --> 0:05:33,000
a state senator

113
0:05:33.92,000 --> 0:05:34,000
who later in life

114
0:05:35.64,000 --> 0:05:37,000
had to work nights as a janitor to support his family,

115
0:05:39.2,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and he never told a soul.

116
0:05:41.52,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That role was to suffer in secret.

117
0:05:43.92,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And now three generations later,

118
0:05:46.36,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I find myself playing that role, too.

119
0:05:49.24,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So why couldn't my grandfather just reach out to another man

120
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and ask for help?

121
0:05:54.8,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Why does my dad to this day still think he's got to do it all on his own?

122
0:05:58.6,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I know a man who would rather die

123
0:06:01.36,000 --> 0:06:03,000
than tell another man that they're hurting.

124
0:06:04.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But it's not because we're just all, like, strong silent types.

125
0:06:08.28,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's not. A lot of us men are really good at making friends, and talking,

126
0:06:13.24,000 --> 0:06:14,000
just not about anything real.

127
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:17.04,000 --> 0:06:21,000
If it's about work or sports or politics or women,

129
0:06:21.56,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we have no problem sharing our opinions,

130
0:06:24.76,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but if it's about our insecurities or our struggles,

131
0:06:27.96,000 --> 0:06:28,000
our fear of failure,

132
0:06:30.56,000 --> 0:06:32,000
then it's almost like we become paralyzed.

133
0:06:33.24,000 --> 0:06:34,000
At least, I do.

134
0:06:37.2,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So some of the ways that I have been practicing

135
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:41,000
breaking free of this behavior

136
0:06:41.48,000 --> 0:06:44,000
are by creating experiences that force me to be vulnerable.

137
0:06:46.28,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So if there's something I'm experiencing shame around in my life,

138
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I practice diving straight into it,

139
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
no matter how scary it is --

140
0:06:55.2,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and sometimes, even publicly.

141
0:06:58.56,000 --> 0:07:,000
Because then in doing so

142
0:07:00.64,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I take away its power,

143
0:07:02.52,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and my display of vulnerability

144
0:07:04.88,000 --> 0:07:07,000
can in some cases give other men permission to do the same.

145
0:07:09.32,000 --> 0:07:11,000
As an example, a little while ago

146
0:07:11.88,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I was wrestling with an issue in my life

147
0:07:13.84,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that I knew I needed to talk to my guy friends about,

148
0:07:17.84,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but I was so paralyzed by fear

149
0:07:21.24,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that they would judge me and see me as weak

150
0:07:23.32,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and I would lose my standing as a leader

151
0:07:27.2,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that I knew I had to take them out of town on a three-day guys trip --

152
0:07:32.48,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:33.52,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Just to open up. And guess what?

154
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It wasn't until the end of the third day

155
0:07:38.8,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that I finally found the strength to talk to them

156
0:07:42.96,000 --> 0:07:43,000
about what I was going through.

157
0:07:45.48,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But when I did, something amazing happened.

158
0:07:47.56,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I realized that I wasn't alone,

159
0:07:50.24,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because my guys had also been struggling.

160
0:07:53.28,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And as soon as I found the strength and the courage to share my shame,

161
0:07:57.28,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it was gone.

162
0:07:59.68,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now, I've learned over time

163
0:08:01.04,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that if I want to practice vulnerability,

164
0:08:03.08,000 --> 0:08:05,000
then I need to build myself a system of accountability.

165
0:08:06.36,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So I've been really blessed as an actor.

166
0:08:10.28,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I've built a really wonderful fan base,

167
0:08:13.44,000 --> 0:08:15,000
really, really sweet and engaged,

168
0:08:15.72,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and so I decided to use my social platform

169
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
as kind of this Trojan horse

170
0:08:20.24,000 --> 0:08:24,000
wherein I could create a daily practice of authenticity and vulnerability.

171
0:08:25.32,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The response has been incredible.

172
0:08:27.76,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's been affirming, it's been heartwarming.

173
0:08:31.12,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I get tons of love and press and positive messages daily.

174
0:08:36.52,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But it's all from a certain demographic:

175
0:08:40.2,000 --> 0:08:41,000
women.

176
0:08:41.44,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:44.159,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This is real.

178
0:08:47.559,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Why are only women following me?

179
0:08:50.52,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Where are the men?

180
0:08:51.84,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:54.48,000 --> 0:08:56,000
About a year ago, I posted this photo.

182
0:08:58.32,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now, afterwards, I was scrolling through some of the comments,

183
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and I noticed that one of my female fans had tagged her boyfriend in the picture,

184
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and her boyfriend responded by saying,

185
0:09:07.36,000 --> 0:09:1,000
"Please stop tagging me in gay shit.

186
0:09:11.28,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Thx."

187
0:09:12.52,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:14.56,000 --> 0:09:16,000
As if being gay makes you less of a man, right?

189
0:09:18.44,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So I took a deep breath,

190
0:09:21.2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and I responded.

191
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I said,

192
0:09:26.28,000 --> 0:09:27,000
very politely, that I was just curious,

193
0:09:28.2,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because I'm on an exploration of masculinity,

194
0:09:30.44,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and I wanted to know why my love for my wife

195
0:09:32.76,000 --> 0:09:34,000
qualified as gay shit.

196
0:09:34.88,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And then I said, honestly I just wanted to learn.

197
0:09:37.56,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

198
0:09:42.56,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now, he immediately wrote me back.

199
0:09:45.72,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I thought he was going to go off on me, but instead he apologized.

200
0:09:51.12,000 --> 0:09:53,000
He told me how, growing up,

201
0:09:53.8,000 --> 0:09:56,000
public displays of affection were looked down on.

202
0:09:57.28,000 --> 0:10:,000
He told me that he was wrestling and struggling with his ego,

203
0:10:01.48,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and how much he loved his girlfriend

204
0:10:03.32,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and how thankful he was for her patience.

205
0:10:07.56,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And then a few weeks later,

206
0:10:09.28,000 --> 0:10:1,000
he messaged me again.

207
0:10:12.08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This time he sent me a photo

208
0:10:15.04,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of him on one knee proposing.

209
0:10:16.88,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Applause)

210
0:10:22.04,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And all he said was, "Thank you."

211
0:10:25.44,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I've been this guy.

212
0:10:27.44,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I get it.

213
0:10:28.68,000 --> 0:10:3,000
See, publicly, he was just playing his role,

214
0:10:30.8,000 --> 0:10:32,000
rejecting the feminine, right?

215
0:10:32.92,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But secretly he was waiting for permission to express himself,

216
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to be seen, to be heard,

217
0:10:38.24,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and all he needed was another man

218
0:10:39.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
holding him accountable and creating a safe space for him to feel,

219
0:10:43.04,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and the transformation was instant.

220
0:10:45.44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I loved this experience,

221
0:10:47.56,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because it showed me that transformation is possible,

222
0:10:50.08,000 --> 0:10:51,000
even over direct messages.

223
0:10:52.68,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So I wanted to figure out how I could reach more men,

224
0:10:55.56,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but of course none of them were following me.

225
0:10:57.72,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Laughter)

226
0:10:59.6,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So I tried an experiment.

227
0:11:01.8,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I started posting more stereotypically masculine things --

228
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:07.36,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Like my challenging workouts, my meal plans,

230
0:11:11.08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
my journey to heal my body after an injury.

231
0:11:14.52,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And guess what happened?

232
0:11:17.2,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Men started to write me.

233
0:11:19.44,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And then, out of the blue, for the first time in my entire career,

234
0:11:22.8,000 --> 0:11:23,000
a male fitness magazine called me,

235
0:11:25.84,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and they said they wanted to honor me as one of their game-changers.

236
0:11:31.44,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:35.08,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Was that really game-changing?

238
0:11:38.56,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Or is it just conforming?

239
0:11:40.88,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And see, that's the problem.

240
0:11:42.28,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It's totally cool for men to follow me

241
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
when I talk about guy stuff

242
0:11:47.32,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and I conform to gender norms.

243
0:11:50.08,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But if I talk about how much I love my wife

244
0:11:54.32,000 --> 0:11:56,000
or my daughter or my 10-day-old son,

245
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
how I believe that marriage is challenging but beautiful,

246
0:12:02.76,000 --> 0:12:05,000
or how as a man I struggle with body dysmorphia,

247
0:12:06.04,000 --> 0:12:08,000
or if I promote gender equality, then only the women show up.

248
0:12:10.2,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Where are the men?

249
0:12:12.92,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So men, men, men,

250
0:12:17.96,000 --> 0:12:18,000
men!

251
0:12:19.2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Applause)

252
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I understand.

253
0:12:29.08,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Growing up, we tend to challenge each other.

254
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We've got to be the toughest,

255
0:12:33.6,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the strongest, the bravest men that we can be.

256
0:12:36.6,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And for many of us, myself included, our identities are wrapped up

257
0:12:40.68,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in whether or not at the end of the day we feel like we're man enough.

258
0:12:45.04,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But I've got a challenge for all the guys,

259
0:12:47.72,000 --> 0:12:49,000
because men love challenges.

260
0:12:49.8,000 --> 0:12:5,000
(Laughter)

261
0:12:52.32,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I challenge you to see if you can use the same qualities

262
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that you feel make you a man

263
0:12:57.08,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to go deeper into yourself.

264
0:13:00.6,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Your strength, your bravery, your toughness:

265
0:13:03.8,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Can we redefine what those mean and use them to explore our hearts?

266
0:13:10.24,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Are you brave enough

267
0:13:12.36,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to be vulnerable?

268
0:13:15.84,000 --> 0:13:17,000
To reach out to another man when you need help?

269
0:13:18.96,000 --> 0:13:19,000
To dive headfirst into your shame?

270
0:13:22.12,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Are you strong enough to be sensitive,

271
0:13:25.32,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to cry whether you are hurting

272
0:13:27.48,000 --> 0:13:28,000
or you're happy,

273
0:13:28.84,000 --> 0:13:29,000
even if it makes you look weak?

274
0:13:31.84,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Are you confident enough

275
0:13:34.24,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to listen to the women in your life?

276
0:13:37.76,000 --> 0:13:38,000
To hear their ideas and their solutions?

277
0:13:39.72,000 --> 0:13:4,000
To hold their anguish

278
0:13:41.72,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and actually believe them,

279
0:13:44.04,000 --> 0:13:46,000
even if what they're saying is against you?

280
0:13:47.32,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And will you be man enough

281
0:13:49.68,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to stand up to other men when you hear "locker room talk,"

282
0:13:53.48,000 --> 0:13:55,000
when you hear stories of sexual harassment?

283
0:13:55.84,000 --> 0:13:58,000
When you hear your boys talking about grabbing ass or getting her drunk,

284
0:13:59.28,000 --> 0:14:01,000
will you actually stand up and do something

285
0:14:01.36,000 --> 0:14:03,000
so that one day we don't have to live in a world

286
0:14:03.64,000 --> 0:14:04,000
where a woman has to risk everything

287
0:14:05.4,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and come forward to say the words "me too?"

288
0:14:07.48,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Applause)

289
0:14:18.32,000 --> 0:14:19,000
This is serious stuff.

290
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I've had to take a real, honest look

291
0:14:22.92,000 --> 0:14:26,000
at the ways that I've unconsciously been hurting the women in my life,

292
0:14:28.36,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and it's ugly.

293
0:14:31.48,000 --> 0:14:36,000
My wife told me that I had been acting in a certain way that hurt her

294
0:14:36.92,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and not correcting it.

295
0:14:39.48,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Basically, sometimes when she would go to speak,

296
0:14:43.08,000 --> 0:14:45,000
at home or in public,

297
0:14:45.12,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I would just cut her off mid-sentence and finish her thought for her.

298
0:14:51.52,000 --> 0:14:52,000
It's awful.

299
0:14:53.4,000 --> 0:14:56,000
The worst part was that I was completely unaware when I was doing it.

300
0:14:56.68,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It was unconscious.

301
0:14:58.12,000 --> 0:15:,000
So here I am doing my part,

302
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
trying to be a feminist,

303
0:15:01.72,000 --> 0:15:03,000
amplifying the voices of women around the world,

304
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and yet at home,

305
0:15:05.64,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I am using my louder voice to silence the woman I love the most.

306
0:15:11.76,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So I had to ask myself a tough question:

307
0:15:14.96,000 --> 0:15:15,000
am I man enough

308
0:15:16.88,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to just shut the hell up and listen?

309
0:15:18.64,000 --> 0:15:19,000
(Laughter)

310
0:15:20.6,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Applause)

311
0:15:24.36,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I've got to be honest. I wish that didn't get an applause.

312
0:15:27.12,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

313
0:15:29.76,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Guys,

314
0:15:31.76,000 --> 0:15:32,000
this is real.

315
0:15:33.84,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And I'm just scratching the surface here,

316
0:15:35.84,000 --> 0:15:37,000
because the deeper we go, the uglier it gets, I guarantee you.

317
0:15:38.8,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I don't have time to get into porn and violence against women

318
0:15:41.72,000 --> 0:15:44,000
or the split of domestic duties

319
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:46,000
or the gender pay gap.

320
0:15:48.28,000 --> 0:15:49,000
But I believe that as men,

321
0:15:50.08,000 --> 0:15:52,000
it's time we start to see past our privilege

322
0:15:52.56,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and recognize that we are not just part of the problem.

323
0:15:55.2,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Fellas, we are the problem.

324
0:15:56.92,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The glass ceiling exists because we put it there,

325
0:16:00.12,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and if we want to be a part of the solution,

326
0:16:02.24,000 --> 0:16:03,000
then words are no longer enough.

327
0:16:05.72,000 --> 0:16:08,000
There's a quote that I love that I grew up with from the Bahá'í writings.

328
0:16:10.08,000 --> 0:16:13,000
It says that "the world of humanity is possessed of two wings,

329
0:16:14.76,000 --> 0:16:15,000
the male and the female.

330
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:21,000
So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength,

331
0:16:21.2,000 --> 0:16:22,000
the bird will not fly."

332
0:16:25.44,000 --> 0:16:26,000
So women,

333
0:16:27.72,000 --> 0:16:3,000
on behalf of men all over the world

334
0:16:31.52,000 --> 0:16:32,000
who feel similar to me,

335
0:16:34.68,000 --> 0:16:35,000
please forgive us

336
0:16:36.88,000 --> 0:16:38,000
for all the ways that we have not relied on your strength.

337
0:16:41.52,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And now I would like to ask you to formally help us,

338
0:16:44.24,000 --> 0:16:46,000
because we cannot do this alone.

339
0:16:46.36,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We are men. We're going to mess up.

340
0:16:48.12,000 --> 0:16:51,000
We're going to say the wrong thing. We're going to be tone-deaf.

341
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
We're more than likely, probably, going to offend you.

342
0:16:53.76,000 --> 0:16:54,000
But don't lose hope.

343
0:16:56.84,000 --> 0:16:57,000
We're only here because of you,

344
0:16:59.56,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and like you, as men, we need to stand up and become your allies

345
0:17:02.64,000 --> 0:17:04,000
as you fight against

346
0:17:05.28,000 --> 0:17:06,000
pretty much everything.

347
0:17:08.12,000 --> 0:17:11,000
We need your help in celebrating our vulnerability

348
0:17:11.56,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and being patient with us

349
0:17:13.32,000 --> 0:17:16,000
as we make this very, very long journey

350
0:17:17.28,000 --> 0:17:19,000
from our heads to our hearts.

351
0:17:20.92,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And finally to parents:

352
0:17:25.079,000 --> 0:17:26,000
instead of teaching our children

353
0:17:27.839,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to be brave boys or pretty girls,

354
0:17:33.119,000 --> 0:17:35,000
can we maybe just teach them how to be good humans?

355
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
So back to my dad.

356
0:17:41.24,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Growing up, yeah, like every boy, I had my fair share of issues,

357
0:17:45.72,000 --> 0:17:48,000
but now I realize that it was even thanks to his sensitivity

358
0:17:48.88,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and emotional intelligence

359
0:17:50.64,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that I am able to stand here right now talking to you in the first place.

360
0:17:55.08,000 --> 0:17:58,000
The resentment I had for my dad I now realize had nothing to do with him.

361
0:17:58.72,000 --> 0:18:03,000
It had everything to do with me and my longing to be accepted

362
0:18:04.04,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and to play a role that was never meant for me.

363
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:1,000
So while my dad may have not taught me how to use my hands,

364
0:18:11.56,000 --> 0:18:12,000
he did teach me how to use my heart,

365
0:18:14.4,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and to me that makes him more a man than anything.

366
0:18:17.8,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Thank you.

367
0:18:19.04,000 --> 0:18:21,000
(Applause)

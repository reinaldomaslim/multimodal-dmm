1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My doctors told me that my lung capacity

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
had gone down to 70 percent,

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and it was killing me.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
With the help of IIT,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
TERI, and learnings from NASA,

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
we discovered that there are three

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
basic green plants,

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
common green plants, with which

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we can grow all the fresh air

11
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
we need indoors to keep us healthy.

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We've also found that you can

13
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
reduce the fresh air requirements

14
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
into the building, while maintaining

15
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
industry indoor air-quality standards.

16
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The three plants are Areca palm,

17
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Mother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant.

18
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The botanical names are in front of you.

19
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
Areca palm is a plant which

20
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen.

21
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We need four shoulder-high plants per person,

22
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and in terms of plant care,

23
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we need to wipe the leaves

24
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
every day in Delhi, and perhaps

25
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
once a week in cleaner-air cities.

26
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We had to grow them in vermi manure,

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which is sterile, or hydroponics,

28
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and take them outdoors every three to four months.

29
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue,

30
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which is again a very common plant,

31
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and we call it a bedroom plant,

32
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night.

33
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person.

34
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The third plant is money plant,

35
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and this is again a very common plant;

36
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
preferably grows in hydroponics.

37
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes

38
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and other volatile chemicals.

39
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
With these three plants,

40
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you can grow all the fresh air you need.

41
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
In fact, you could be in a bottle

42
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
with a cap on top, and you would not die at all,

43
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and you would not need any fresh air.

44
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We have tried these plants at our

45
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
own building in Delhi, which is a

46
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building.

47
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants.

48
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Our studies have found that there is

49
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen

50
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
going up by one percent if one stays indoors

51
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in this building for 10 hours.

52
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The government of India has discovered

53
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or published a study to show

54
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi.

55
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And the study showed that,

56
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
compared to other buildings,

57
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
there is a reduced incidence of

58
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
eye irritation by 52 percent,

59
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
respiratory systems by 34 percent,

60
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
headaches by 24 percent,

61
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent.

62
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And this study has been published on September 8, 2008,

63
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
and it's available on the government of India website.

64
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Our experience points to an

65
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
amazing increase in human productivity

66
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
by over 20 percent by using these plants.

67
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings

68
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air.

69
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We are now replicating this in a

70
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
1.75-million-square-feet building,

71
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which will have 60,000 indoor plants.

72
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Why is this important?

73
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It is also important for the environment,

74
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
because the world's energy

75
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
requirements are expected to grow

76
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
by 30 percent in the next decade.

77
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
40 percent of the world's energy is taken

78
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
up by buildings currently,

79
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and 60 percent of the world's population

80
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
will be living in buildings in cities

81
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with a population of over one million in the next 15 years.

82
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And there is a growing preference for living

83
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and working in air-conditioned places.

84
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"Be the change you want to see in the world,"

85
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
said Mahatma Gandhi.

86
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And thank you for listening.

87
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Applause)

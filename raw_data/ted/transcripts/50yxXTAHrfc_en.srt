1
0:00:14.063,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I opened a blind man's head.

2
0:00:17.363,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I didn't make him think or reflect -- I cracked his head open, literally.

3
0:00:22.564,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We were walking with him holding onto my shoulder,

4
0:00:24.993,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I miscalculated how much space there was between us,

5
0:00:27.857,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I knocked him into a gate.

6
0:00:29.646,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:30.837,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Five stitches in his forehead.

8
0:00:33.863,000 --> 0:00:36,000
At that moment, I felt like the worst teacher in the world.

9
0:00:36.96,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I really didn't know how to apologize.

10
0:00:39.845,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Luckily, El Pulga is one of those people who takes things quite well.

11
0:00:46.228,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And to this day, he says that I was the coach

12
0:00:48.776,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who left the most important mark on his career.

13
0:00:51.244,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:53.441,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The truth is, when I started working at the institute for the blind,

15
0:00:56.747,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I was surprised by a lot of things.

16
0:00:58.926,000 --> 0:01:01,000
A lot of the things they did, I never imagined they could:

17
0:01:02.474,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they swam, did exercise, played cards.

18
0:01:06.97,000 --> 0:01:07,000
They drank mate, and could pour it

19
0:01:08.648,000 --> 0:01:1,000
without burning themselves in the process.

20
0:01:10.736,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But when I saw them playing soccer --

21
0:01:12.553,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that was amazing.

22
0:01:14.672,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They had a dirt field, rusty goalposts and broken nets.

23
0:01:19.054,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The blind who attended the institute would play their games there,

24
0:01:22.225,000 --> 0:01:24,000
just like I did at a field near my house.

25
0:01:24.824,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But they played without being able to see.

26
0:01:27.534,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The ball made a sound so they could locate it.

27
0:01:31.039,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They had a guide behind the rival team's goal

28
0:01:34.074,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to know where to kick the ball.

29
0:01:36.102,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And they used eye masks.

30
0:01:38.004,000 --> 0:01:4,000
There were guys who could still see a little,

31
0:01:40.264,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and they wore eye masks so everyone was equal.

32
0:01:44.524,000 --> 0:01:48,000
When I was more at ease with them, I asked for a mask myself.

33
0:01:49.2,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I put it on and tried to play.

34
0:01:51.87,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I had played soccer all my life.

35
0:01:54.272,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is where it got even more amazing:

36
0:01:56.342,000 --> 0:01:58,000
within two seconds, I didn't know where I was standing.

37
0:02:02.126,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I had studied physical education because I loved high performance.

38
0:02:05.904,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I started working at the institute by chance.

39
0:02:08.143,000 --> 0:02:1,000
My other job was with the Argentinian National Rowing Team,

40
0:02:11.014,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and I felt that was my thing.

41
0:02:13.262,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Here, everything was twice as hard.

42
0:02:15.785,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I'll never forget the first day I did the warm-up with the team.

43
0:02:19.564,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I lined them up in front of me --

44
0:02:21.3,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I used to do that with the rowing team --

45
0:02:24.193,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I said, "OK, everyone bend down," going like this.

46
0:02:27.472,000 --> 0:02:28,000
When I looked up, two guys were seated,

47
0:02:29.438,000 --> 0:02:31,000
three were lying down and others were squatting.

48
0:02:31.771,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:33.161,000 --> 0:02:36,000
How could I do here the same things I was doing there?

50
0:02:38.907,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It took me a while.

51
0:02:40.314,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I started looking for tools to learn from them,

52
0:02:43.802,000 --> 0:02:45,000
from the teachers who worked with them.

53
0:02:46.394,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I learned I couldn't explain a play on a chalkboard like a coach does,

54
0:02:51.064,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but I could use a plastic tray and some bottle caps

55
0:02:53.868,000 --> 0:02:55,000
so they could follow me by way of touch.

56
0:02:56.779,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I also learned they could run on a track

57
0:02:59.956,000 --> 0:03:01,000
if I ran with them, holding a rope.

58
0:03:02.656,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So we started looking for volunteers to help us run with them.

59
0:03:06.312,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I was enjoying it,

60
0:03:09.764,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and finding purpose and meaning in what we were doing.

61
0:03:13.805,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It was hard at first, it was uncomfortable,

62
0:03:15.931,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but I decided to overcome the discomfort.

63
0:03:18.098,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And there came a time

64
0:03:19.544,000 --> 0:03:21,000
when it became the most fascinating job I'd ever had.

65
0:03:23.249,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I think that's when I wondered:

66
0:03:25.63,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Why couldn't we be a high-performance team as well?

67
0:03:30.966,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Of course, one thing was missing:

68
0:03:32.723,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I needed to find out what they wanted,

69
0:03:34.817,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the real protagonists of this story.

70
0:03:38.823,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Three hours of training, playing soccer on that field,

71
0:03:42.349,000 --> 0:03:43,000
were not going to be enough.

72
0:03:43.984,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We would have to train differently.

73
0:03:46.143,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We started to train harder, and the results were great;

74
0:03:49.906,000 --> 0:03:5,000
they asked for more.

75
0:03:51.733,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I came to understand that they, too, wondered

76
0:03:53.879,000 --> 0:03:54,000
why they couldn't do high-performance.

77
0:03:57.151,000 --> 0:04:,000
When we felt ready, we knocked at CENARD's door.

78
0:04:01.174,000 --> 0:04:03,000
CENARD is the National Center for High-Performance Sports

79
0:04:03.938,000 --> 0:04:04,000
here in Argentina.

80
0:04:05.306,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It was hard to get them to hear what we had to say.

81
0:04:07.747,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But it was considerably more difficult

82
0:04:10.227,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to get the other athletes training there to consider us their equals.

83
0:04:14.662,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In fact, they would let us use the field

84
0:04:16.622,000 --> 0:04:18,000
only when no other teams were using it.

85
0:04:19.367,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And we were known as "the blind ones."

86
0:04:21.724,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Not everyone knew exactly what we were doing there.

87
0:04:25.622,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The 2006 World Championship was a turning point in the team's history.

88
0:04:30.449,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It was held in Buenos Aires for the first time.

89
0:04:33.257,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It was our chance to show everyone

90
0:04:36.08,000 --> 0:04:37,000
what we had been doing all that time.

91
0:04:38.947,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We made it to the finals.

92
0:04:41.02,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We were growing as a team.

93
0:04:43.374,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It was us against Brazil in the finals.

94
0:04:46.406,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They were the best team in the tournament.

95
0:04:49.033,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They won every game by a landslide.

96
0:04:52.264,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Hardly anyone believed we could win that game.

97
0:04:57.942,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Hardly anyone -- except for us.

98
0:05:00.935,000 --> 0:05:01,000
During pre-game meetings,

99
0:05:02.833,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in the locker room,

100
0:05:04.5,000 --> 0:05:05,000
during each warm-up,

101
0:05:06.592,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it smelled of victory.

102
0:05:10.079,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I swear that smell exists.

103
0:05:12.433,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I smelled it several times with the team,

104
0:05:15.079,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but I remember it in particular, the day before we played that final.

105
0:05:19.328,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The Argentine Football Association had opened their doors to us.

106
0:05:22.464,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We were training at AFA,

107
0:05:23.954,000 --> 0:05:25,000
where Verón, Higuain and Messi trained.

108
0:05:26.472,000 --> 0:05:27,000
For the first time ever,

109
0:05:29.081,000 --> 0:05:31,000
we felt like a true national team.

110
0:05:32.214,000 --> 0:05:34,000
At 7:30pm, the day before the game,

111
0:05:34.695,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we were in the lounge discussing strategy,

112
0:05:38.547,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and a waiter knocks on the door, interrupting our conversation.

113
0:05:42.646,000 --> 0:05:43,000
He suggested we go to church.

114
0:05:44.354,000 --> 0:05:45,000
He came to invite us to church.

115
0:05:47.253,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I tried to get rid of him, saying it wasn't a good time,

116
0:05:51.139,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that we better leave it for another day.

117
0:05:53.992,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He kept insisting, asking me to please let him take the guys to church,

118
0:05:59.507,000 --> 0:06:02,000
because that day, a pastor who performed miracles would be there.

119
0:06:04.4,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I was slightly afraid to ask what type of miracles he meant,

120
0:06:07.816,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and he replied nonchalantly,

121
0:06:10.076,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"Coach, let me take the team to the church,

122
0:06:12.3,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and when we return, I guarantee that half of them will be able to see."

123
0:06:16.129,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:20.655,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Some of the guys laughed,

125
0:06:22.125,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but imagine being a blind person and someone says that to you.

126
0:06:25.299,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I didn't know what to say.

127
0:06:26.708,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I said nothing; it was an awkward silence.

128
0:06:29.376,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I didn't want to make him feel bad,

129
0:06:31.144,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because he truly believed this could happen.

130
0:06:34.032,000 --> 0:06:35,000
One of the players saved me,

131
0:06:36.694,000 --> 0:06:37,000
when he stood up and confidently said,

132
0:06:38.664,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"Juan," -- that was the kid's name --

133
0:06:40.572,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Gonza already told you it's not the best time to go to church.

134
0:06:43.549,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Besides, let me make this clear:

135
0:06:45.354,000 --> 0:06:48,000
if we go to that church, and I end up being able to see when we return,

136
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I will beat you so hard if I can't play tomorrow."

137
0:06:52.302,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:54.03,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Applause)

139
0:07:04.998,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Juan left, laughing in resignation,

140
0:07:08.966,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and we continued with our pregame talk.

141
0:07:11.687,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That night when I went to sleep,

142
0:07:14.604,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I began to dream about the next day's game,

143
0:07:17.949,000 --> 0:07:19,000
imagining what could happen, how we would play.

144
0:07:20.652,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And that's when I noticed that smell of victory

145
0:07:23.132,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I mentioned a while ago.

146
0:07:24.806,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And it's because at that moment, I thought:

147
0:07:26.993,000 --> 0:07:3,000
if the other players had the same desire as Diego going into the game,

148
0:07:32.261,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it was impossible for us not to win.

149
0:07:35.779,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The next day was going to be wonderful.

150
0:07:38.446,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm,

151
0:07:41.526,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and we were already eager to play.

152
0:07:44.227,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We left AFA, and the bus was full of flags that people had given to us.

153
0:07:50.608,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We were talking about the game,

154
0:07:52.791,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and we could hear people honking and cheering,

155
0:07:55.355,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"Go Murciélagos! Today's the day! The final challenge!"

156
0:07:58.689,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The guys asked me, "Do they know us? Do they know we're playing?"

157
0:08:03.134,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Some people followed the bus to CENARD.

158
0:08:07.237,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We arrived and found an amazing scene.

159
0:08:11.247,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In the corridor leading from the locker room to the game field,

160
0:08:14.337,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I was walking with Silvio,

161
0:08:16.313,000 --> 0:08:19,000
who was holding onto my shoulder, so I could guide him.

162
0:08:19.425,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Fortunately, there were no gates along the way.

163
0:08:21.712,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:22.736,000 --> 0:08:25,000
When we reached the field, he asked me about everything.

165
0:08:25.872,000 --> 0:08:26,000
He didn't want to miss a single detail.

166
0:08:27.832,000 --> 0:08:3,000
He said, "Tell me what you see, tell me who's playing the drums."

167
0:08:31.675,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I tried to explain what was happening with as much detail as possible.

168
0:08:35.594,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I told him, "The stands are packed, a lot of people couldn't get in,

169
0:08:40.418,000 --> 0:08:42,000
there are blue and white balloons all over the field,

170
0:08:43.036,000 --> 0:08:47,000
they're opening a giant Argentine flag that covers the entire grandstand."

171
0:08:47.201,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Suddenly, he cuts me off and says,

172
0:08:49.322,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?"

173
0:08:54.674,000 --> 0:08:55,000
That's the city where he lives.

174
0:08:56.641,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I started looking into the stands

175
0:08:58.48,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I spotted a little white flag

176
0:09:01.013,000 --> 0:09:04,000
with lettering done in black spray paint, that read:

177
0:09:04.087,000 --> 0:09:07,000
"Silvio, your family and all of San Pedro are here."

178
0:09:08.227,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I told him that and he replied,

179
0:09:10.983,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"That's my mom, tell me where she is, I want to I wave at her."

180
0:09:15.564,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I pointed him toward the flag

181
0:09:17.02,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and showed him with his arm where they were sitting,

182
0:09:19.59,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and he waved his arms in that direction.

183
0:09:21.598,000 --> 0:09:24,000
About 20 or 30 people stood up and gave him an ovation.

184
0:09:25.341,000 --> 0:09:26,000
When that happened,

185
0:09:26.754,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I saw how his face changed, how moved he was.

186
0:09:29.615,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It was moving for me, too;

187
0:09:32.106,000 --> 0:09:34,000
two seconds later, I had a lump in my throat.

188
0:09:35.318,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It was strange -- I felt both the excitement of what was happening,

189
0:09:38.628,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and the anger and the anguish that he could not see it.

190
0:09:43.457,000 --> 0:09:48,000
A few days later when I told him what I had experienced,

191
0:09:49.266,000 --> 0:09:52,000
he tried to reassure me, saying,

192
0:09:52.534,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them.

193
0:09:55.135,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Differently, but I swear to you that I saw them all."

194
0:09:59.248,000 --> 0:10:,000
The game started.

195
0:10:00.668,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We could not fail; it was the final.

196
0:10:03.53,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The audience was quiet, like here,

197
0:10:05.979,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because in soccer for the blind,

198
0:10:07.647,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the public has to be quiet so the players can hear the ball.

199
0:10:11.064,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They're only allowed to cheer when the game is over.

200
0:10:14.265,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And when there were eight minutes to go,

201
0:10:17.747,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the crowd did all the cheering they hadn't done in the first 32 minutes.

202
0:10:21.218,000 --> 0:10:24,000
When pigeon-toed Silvio nailed the ball at an angle,

203
0:10:24.871,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they cheered with all their heart,

204
0:10:26.983,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in an incredible way.

205
0:10:30.848,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Today, if you go to CENARD, you'll see a huge poster on the door,

206
0:10:35.49,000 --> 0:10:36,000
with a photo of our team, Los Murciélagos.

207
0:10:38.227,000 --> 0:10:42,000
They're a model national team, everyone in CENARD knows who they are,

208
0:10:42.895,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and after having won two World Championships

209
0:10:45.502,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and two Paralympic medals,

210
0:10:46.923,000 --> 0:10:48,000
no one doubts they are high-performance athletes.

211
0:10:49.406,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Applause)

212
0:11:04.001,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Applause ends)

213
0:11:07.148,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I was lucky to train this team for 10 years,

214
0:11:10.86,000 --> 0:11:13,000
first as a trainer and later as their coach.

215
0:11:15.11,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I feel that they've given me much more

216
0:11:19.993,000 --> 0:11:2,000
than what I've given them.

217
0:11:22.209,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Last year, they asked me to coach another national team, Power Soccer.

218
0:11:29.394,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's a national team of young men who play soccer in wheelchairs.

219
0:11:33.824,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They use motorized wheelchairs that they drive with a joystick,

220
0:11:36.895,000 --> 0:11:38,000
because they don't have enough strength in their arms

221
0:11:39.477,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to use conventional chairs.

222
0:11:40.794,000 --> 0:11:43,000
They added a bumper to the chair, a safeguard that protects their feet,

223
0:11:44.528,000 --> 0:11:46,000
while allowing them to kick the ball.

224
0:11:47.548,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It's the first time that, instead of being the spectators,

225
0:11:51.739,000 --> 0:11:52,000
they're now the main characters.

226
0:11:53.58,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It's the first time their parents, friends and siblings can see them play.

227
0:11:59.76,000 --> 0:12:01,000
For me, it's a new challenge,

228
0:12:02.127,000 --> 0:12:05,000
with the same discomfort, insecurity, and fear I had

229
0:12:05.395,000 --> 0:12:06,000
when I started working with the blind.

230
0:12:07.86,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But I approach it all from a more experienced position.

231
0:12:10.601,000 --> 0:12:15,000
That's why from day one, I treat them as athletes on the field,

232
0:12:15.827,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and off the field, I try to put myself in their shoes

233
0:12:18.461,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and behave without prejudice,

234
0:12:19.912,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because treating them naturally feels best to them.

235
0:12:25.326,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Both teams play soccer; something once unthinkable for them.

236
0:12:30.303,000 --> 0:12:33,000
They had to adapt the rules to do so.

237
0:12:35.129,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And both teams broke the same rule --

238
0:12:37.677,000 --> 0:12:39,000
the one that said they couldn't play soccer.

239
0:12:41.589,000 --> 0:12:45,000
When you see them play, you see competition, not disability.

240
0:12:46.568,000 --> 0:12:49,000
The problem starts when the game is over,

241
0:12:49.746,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and they leave the field.

242
0:12:51.245,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Then they step in to play our game,

243
0:12:53.765,000 --> 0:12:56,000
in a society whose rules don't really take them into account

244
0:12:57.743,000 --> 0:12:58,000
or care for them.

245
0:12:59.52,000 --> 0:13:,000
I learned from sports

246
0:13:01.364,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that disability greatly depends on the rules of the game.

247
0:13:05.512,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I believe that if we change some of the rules of our game,

248
0:13:09.6,000 --> 0:13:11,000
we can make life a little easier for them.

249
0:13:13.209,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We all know there are people with disabilities; we see them daily.

250
0:13:18.644,000 --> 0:13:2,000
But by having no direct contact with them,

251
0:13:21.629,000 --> 0:13:24,000
we're not aware of the problems they face every day,

252
0:13:25.203,000 --> 0:13:27,000
like how hard it is for them to get on a bus,

253
0:13:27.334,000 --> 0:13:28,000
find a job,

254
0:13:29.009,000 --> 0:13:3,000
take the subway

255
0:13:30.186,000 --> 0:13:31,000
or cross the street.

256
0:13:32.367,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It's true that there is an increasing social responsibility

257
0:13:35.562,000 --> 0:13:38,000
regarding the inclusion of people with disabilities.

258
0:13:40.466,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But I think it's still not enough.

259
0:13:42.983,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I think change needs to come from every one of us.

260
0:13:46.046,000 --> 0:13:49,000
First, by leaving behind our indifference toward the disabled,

261
0:13:49.716,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and then by respecting the rules that do take them into account.

262
0:13:53.091,000 --> 0:13:54,000
They are few, but they do exist.

263
0:13:57.158,000 --> 0:14:,000
I cracked a blind man's head open -- El Pulga's head.

264
0:14:00.669,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I can assure you these two teams opened mine as well.

265
0:14:04.547,000 --> 0:14:05,000
They taught me that above all,

266
0:14:06.008,000 --> 0:14:08,000
you have to get out there and play every game

267
0:14:08.156,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in this beautiful tournament that we call life.

268
0:14:10.41,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Thank you.

269
0:14:11.59,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Applause)

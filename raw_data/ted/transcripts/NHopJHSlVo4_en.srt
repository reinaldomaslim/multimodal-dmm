1
0:00:16.371,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.

2
0:00:20.117,000 --> 0:00:23,000
For real -- you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it.

3
0:00:23.689,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay?

4
0:00:27.427,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it.

5
0:00:30.132,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.

6
0:00:33.425,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Imagine their congratulations,

7
0:00:35.684,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and their high image of you.

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?

9
0:00:39.633,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Don't you feel one step closer already,

10
0:00:42.123,000 --> 0:00:44,000
like it's already becoming part of your identity?

11
0:00:44.601,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut,

12
0:00:48.621,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because that good feeling

13
0:00:50.074,000 --> 0:00:52,000
now will make you less likely to do it.

14
0:00:52.755,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The repeated psychology tests have proven

15
0:00:55.105,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen.

16
0:00:59.366,000 --> 0:01:,000
Any time you have a goal,

17
0:01:00.695,000 --> 0:01:02,000
there are some steps that need to be done,

18
0:01:02.743,000 --> 0:01:04,000
some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it.

19
0:01:05.348,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.

20
0:01:08.668,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it,

21
0:01:11.564,000 --> 0:01:13,000
psychologists have found that it's called a "social reality."

22
0:01:14.491,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.

23
0:01:17.525,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And then because you've felt that satisfaction,

24
0:01:19.804,000 --> 0:01:21,000
you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.

25
0:01:22.776,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:24.109,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So this goes against conventional wisdom

27
0:01:26.165,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that we should tell our friends our goals, right?

28
0:01:28.578,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So they hold us to it.

29
0:01:31.127,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So, let's look at the proof.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
1926: Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology,

31
0:01:36.11,000 --> 0:01:37,000
called this "substitution."

32
0:01:37.614,000 --> 0:01:4,000
1933: Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others,

33
0:01:41.003,000 --> 0:01:42,000
it felt real in the mind.

34
0:01:42.742,000 --> 0:01:44,000
1982, Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this,

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and in 2009,

36
0:01:46.827,000 --> 0:01:48,000
he did some new tests that were published.

37
0:01:49.398,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It goes like this:

38
0:01:50.89,000 --> 0:01:52,000
163 people across four separate tests.

39
0:01:54.476,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Everyone wrote down their personal goal.

40
0:01:56.794,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room,

41
0:02:00.705,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and half didn't.

42
0:02:02.76,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work

43
0:02:04.815,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that would directly lead them towards their goal,

44
0:02:07.134,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but they were told that they could stop at any time.

45
0:02:09.602,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, those who kept their mouths shut

46
0:02:11.509,000 --> 0:02:13,000
worked the entire 45 minutes on average,

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and when asked afterward,

48
0:02:15.821,000 --> 0:02:17,000
said that they felt that they had a long way to go still

49
0:02:18.509,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to achieve their goal.

50
0:02:19.686,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But those who had announced it

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
quit after only 33 minutes, on average,

52
0:02:24.126,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and when asked afterward,

53
0:02:25.88,000 --> 0:02:27,000
said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.

54
0:02:28.615,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So if this is true, what can we do?

55
0:02:31.899,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal.

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings,

57
0:02:40.568,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.

58
0:02:44.959,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But if you do need to talk about something,

59
0:02:47.332,000 --> 0:02:51,000
you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction,

60
0:02:51.703,000 --> 0:02:53,000
such as, "I really want to run this marathon,

61
0:02:53.846,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so I need to train five times a week

62
0:02:55.6,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"

63
0:02:57.97,000 --> 0:03:,000
So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal,

64
0:03:01.095,000 --> 0:03:02,000
what will you say?

65
0:03:02.269,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Silence)

66
0:03:03.294,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Exactly! Well done.

67
0:03:04.57,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Applause)

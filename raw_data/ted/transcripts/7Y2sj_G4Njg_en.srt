1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Contagious is a good word.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Inspiration is contagious.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.

6
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But for me, what was contagious about all of them

7
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
was that they were infected by something I call the

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"I Can" bug.

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So, the question is, why only them?

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In a country of a billion people and some,

11
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
why so few?

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Is it luck? Is it chance?

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Can we all not systematically and consciously

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
get infected?

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I got infected when I was 17,

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
when, as a student of the design college,

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and how contagious that feeling was.

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,

24
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a lab to prototype and refine a design process

25
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.

26
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I uncovered

27
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that if learning is embedded in real-world context,

28
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that if you blur the boundaries between school and life,

29
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
then children go through a journey of "aware,"

30
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
where they can see the change,

31
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"enable," be changed,

32
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and then "empower," lead the change.

33
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And that directly increased student wellbeing.

34
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Children became more competent,

35
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and less helpless.

36
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But this was all common sense.

37
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what

38
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
common practice looks like at Riverside.

39
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,

40
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
they were made to roll incense sticks,

41
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
agarbattis, for eight hours

42
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to experience what it means to be a child laborer.

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey,

44
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and then their utter conviction

45
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that they could go out and change the world.

46
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Music)

47
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's them rolling.

48
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And in two hours, after their backs were broke,

49
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
they were changed.

50
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And once that happened,

51
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
they were out in the city convincing everybody

52
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that child labor just had to be abolished.

53
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes

54
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because he's been able to understand that he

55
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
has shifted that man's mindset.

56
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And that can't happen in a classroom.

57
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So, when Ragav experienced that

58
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
he went from "teacher told me,"

59
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.

60
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.

61
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But we had parents who said,

62
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,

63
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but what about math and science and English?

64
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Show us the grades."

65
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And we did. The data was conclusive.

66
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
When children are empowered,

67
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
not only do they do good,

68
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
they do well, in fact very well,

69
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment

70
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
taken by over 2,000 schools in India,

71
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India

72
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in math, English and science.

73
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.

74
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,

75
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.

76
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now it was not about Riverside school.

77
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.

78
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,

79
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
the press, businesses,

80
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and basically said, "When are you going to wake up

81
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and recognize the potential that resides in every child?

82
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
When will you include the child in the city?

83
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."

84
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So, how did the city respond?

85
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Since 2007 every other month

86
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic

87
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.

88
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."

89
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.

90
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Video: [Unclear]

91
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So, the busiest streets closed down.

92
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.

93
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It gets taken over by children.

94
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They are skating. They are doing street plays.

95
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They are playing, all free, for all children.

96
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Music)

97
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.

98
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.

99
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Music)

100
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.

101
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.

102
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,

103
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in the future the children will give back to the city.

104
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Music)

105
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
KBS: And because of that,

106
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.

107
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.

108
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.

109
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It was time now to infect India.

110
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So, on August 15th,

111
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
again, Independence Day, 2009,

112
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
empowered with the same process,

113
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."

114
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
How? We designed a simple toolkit,

115
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
converted it into eight languages,

116
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and reached 32,000 schools.

117
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.

118
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We said, take one idea,

119
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
anything that bothers you,

120
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
choose one week,

121
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and change a billion lives.

122
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And they did. Stories of change

123
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
poured in from all over India,

124
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
from Nagaland in the east,

125
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to Jhunjhunu in the west,

126
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.

127
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.

128
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street

129
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to alcoholism,

130
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages

131
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in Rajasthan.

132
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I mean, it was incredible.

133
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children

134
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and say, "You can," then they will.

135
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Infection in India.

136
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.

137
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.

138
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school --

139
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.

140
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Look at what their parents says.

141
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Man: This program is wonderful.

142
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.

143
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.

144
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.

145
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
See? They have done it.

146
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
KBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad.

147
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...

148
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We have to start collecting from 555.

149
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
KBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out,

150
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
pretty difficult, but they did it.

151
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Woman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.

152
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.

153
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Woman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me

154
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that they had so much inside them.

155
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

156
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,

157
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
for a very good cause,

158
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.

159
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!

160
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!

161
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!

162
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.

163
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Street plays, auctions, petitions.

164
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I mean, they were changing lives.

165
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It was incredible.

166
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So, how can we still stay immune?

167
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?

168
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I know it's obvious,

169
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.

170
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
70 years ago, it took one man

171
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to infect an entire nation

172
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with the power of "We can."

173
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So, today who is it going to take

174
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to spread the infection from 100,000 children

175
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to the 200 million children in India?

176
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?

177
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So, if not us, then who?

178
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
If not now, then when?

179
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Like I said, contagious is a good word.

180
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Thank you.

181
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:13.11,000 --> 0:00:21,000
hello everyone.welcome is the latest of

3
0:00:18.13,000 --> 0:00:24,000
our Ted connects a daily conversation

4
0:00:21.3,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with you the global Ted community in

5
0:00:24.34,000 --> 0:00:31,000
this strange era of the virus goodness I

6
0:00:29.17,000 --> 0:00:36,000
hope everyone's doing okay you got a

7
0:00:31.71,000 --> 0:00:37,000
safe weekend that you're managing this

8
0:00:36.19,000 --> 0:00:43,000
crazy emotional roller coaster we're all

9
0:00:38.379,000 --> 0:00:46,000
on that your loved ones are safe and

10
0:00:43.199,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you're finding Tom at least some new

11
0:00:46.989,000 --> 0:00:49,000
ways to engage that you hadn't thought

12
0:00:48.46,000 --> 0:00:51,000
about before this all happened

13
0:00:50.019,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I don't know we're all trying to figure

14
0:00:52.089,000 --> 0:00:57,000
out new things together by not touching

15
0:00:54.67,000 --> 0:00:58,000
your face like I just did I'm still by

16
0:00:57.22,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the end of this I swear I will have this

17
0:00:59.049,000 --> 0:01:03,000
under control or me maybe not

18
0:01:03.39,000 --> 0:01:1,000
so last week I was joined here by

19
0:01:06.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Whitney Pennington Rogers you'll be back

20
0:01:10.78,000 --> 0:01:13,000
really soon but because we're it looks

21
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
like we're going to do this for a while

22
0:01:14.53,000 --> 0:01:19,000
yet we thought it'd be good to share

23
0:01:17.71,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with you some of the broader faces among

24
0:01:20.14,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the Ted curation team it takes a lot of

25
0:01:22.99,000 --> 0:01:26,000
people it turns out to put together wise

26
0:01:26.32,000 --> 0:01:3,000
voices from all around the world and

27
0:01:27.91,000 --> 0:01:33,000
today my co-host is the head of that

28
0:01:31.03,000 --> 0:01:4,000
team Ted's head of curation Helen

33
0:01:49.36,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and she really you know she's created

34
0:01:54.1,000 --> 0:01:56,000
this extraordinary team of curators

35
0:01:55.18,000 --> 0:02:,000
specializing in these different areas

36
0:01:56.98,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and holds the thread together the

37
0:02:00.34,000 --> 0:02:07,000
strategic direction Helen it's been

38
0:02:02.35,000 --> 0:02:1,000
great working with you you do swear a

39
0:02:08.05,000 --> 0:02:13,000
lot you promised me that maybe live here

40
0:02:10.929,000 --> 0:02:13,000
you're you may succeed in controlling

41
0:02:13.269,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that but we'll see now I make no

42
0:02:14.59,000 --> 0:02:2,000
promises at all

43
0:02:15.909,000 --> 0:02:2,000
not a one oh how are you how have you

44
0:02:20.68,000 --> 0:02:22,000
survived

45
0:02:21.13,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we can want you what what struck you

46
0:02:23.32,000 --> 0:02:25,000
this weekend about this hope is our

47
0:02:24.67,000 --> 0:02:28,000
situation we're in

48
0:02:25.54,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I mean bizarre cold bizarre situation is

49
0:02:28.75,000 --> 0:02:32,000
right I am in Brooklyn I am here with my

50
0:02:33.25,000 --> 0:02:36,000
family

51
0:02:33.7,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and we had a very quiet weekend the

52
0:02:37.03,000 --> 0:02:42,000
social distancing measures are in place

53
0:02:40.39,000 --> 0:02:45,000
as I went to the pharmacy this weekend

54
0:02:42.7,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and you see they taped out moments on

55
0:02:46.21,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the street where you can stand but it

56
0:02:47.8,000 --> 0:02:52,000
was pretty quiet here I actually stayed

57
0:02:51.76,000 --> 0:02:55,000
away from the news as much as possible I

58
0:02:53.56,000 --> 0:02:57,000
kind of can't really handle read in the

59
0:02:56.32,000 --> 0:03:,000
news so I'm getting news via various

60
0:02:58.15,000 --> 0:03:02,000
groups that I'm in and also I'm noticing

61
0:03:00.4,000 --> 0:03:03,000
whenever whenever a news announcement is

62
0:03:02.32,000 --> 0:03:06,000
made there'll be a flurry of incoming

63
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
texts and communications from my family

64
0:03:06.82,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in England and elsewhere of like

65
0:03:08.23,000 --> 0:03:12,000
everything okay how you doing

66
0:03:10.99,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and so I'm trying to keep my sanity that

67
0:03:12.79,000 --> 0:03:17,000
way but how about you well I mean

68
0:03:16.21,000 --> 0:03:2,000
unfortunately haven't been giving our

69
0:03:18.49,000 --> 0:03:23,000
friend the news and it doesn't make you

70
0:03:21.09,000 --> 0:03:25,000
lots of emotions of leading and going

71
0:03:23.8,000 --> 0:03:26,000
clipping frustration including some hope

72
0:03:25.75,000 --> 0:03:29,000
like there seems to be some kind of

73
0:03:27.39,000 --> 0:03:32,000
consensus emerging among many experts as

74
0:03:30.64,000 --> 0:03:34,000
far as I can see of you know how

75
0:03:32.85,000 --> 0:03:36,000
countries can tackle this you know it's

76
0:03:35.53,000 --> 0:03:4,000
some form of shut down really hard

77
0:03:37.57,000 --> 0:03:43,000
probably for at least two months but

78
0:03:41.11,000 --> 0:03:45,000
then you can probably bring people back

79
0:03:44.05,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to us so long as you have massive

80
0:03:45.46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
testing available so that you can

81
0:03:46.99,000 --> 0:03:5,000
quickly find out if someone's sick live

82
0:03:49.78,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that in the bud and then maybe also

83
0:03:51.91,000 --> 0:03:54,000
there's a change in conversation about

84
0:03:53.65,000 --> 0:03:56,000
face masks as well which is interesting

85
0:03:55.3,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in that like we were all told in the

86
0:03:56.86,000 --> 0:03:59,000
West don't don't bother with them

87
0:03:58.48,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they're not they don't really help you

88
0:04:00.37,000 --> 0:04:03,000
then I'll protect you dudes like there's

89
0:04:02.2,000 --> 0:04:06,000
a lot of people shifting on that now

90
0:04:03.91,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that as a group if we wear them we

91
0:04:06.22,000 --> 0:04:09,000
reduce the chances of spreading the bug

92
0:04:08.35,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that certainly seems to have played a

93
0:04:09.55,000 --> 0:04:13,000
role in in Asia anyway that'll be an

94
0:04:12.88,000 --> 0:04:15,000
interesting conversation for a future

95
0:04:14.17,000 --> 0:04:17,000
one of these but I am now going to get

96
0:04:16.66,000 --> 0:04:2,000
out of your hair and let you introduce

97
0:04:17.799,000 --> 0:04:22,000
today's extraordinary guests so do you

98
0:04:21.37,000 --> 0:04:24,000
see one agent thank you so much for

99
0:04:23.77,000 --> 0:04:25,000
getting out of my hair Chris I've been

100
0:04:25.18,000 --> 0:04:29,000
waiting for that moment for some time

101
0:04:26.62,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Allah at last so it gives me great

102
0:04:29.77,000 --> 0:04:33,000
pleasure to welcome our guest today he

103
0:04:32.59,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is a spiritual leader he's the four

104
0:04:34.48,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Chief Rabbi of the United debreu

105
0:04:37.66,000 --> 0:04:4,000
congregations of the Commonwealth so I

106
0:04:39.31,000 --> 0:04:41,000
had to read that to check I didn't get

107
0:04:40.78,000 --> 0:04:44,000
it wrong he's a writer

108
0:04:42.07,000 --> 0:04:47,000
he's a thinker he's a moral leader he's

109
0:04:45.22,000 --> 0:04:49,000
just an all-round wonderful person I

110
0:04:48.01,000 --> 0:04:52,000
have had the pleasure of working with

111
0:04:49.39,000 --> 0:04:57,000
him on his TED talk back in 2017 I'd

112
0:04:52.54,000 --> 0:05:01,000
love to welcome rabbi sacks Alan it's

113
0:04:57.91,000 --> 0:05:06,000
great to be with you sorry it's in these

114
0:05:02.47,000 --> 0:05:11,000
circumstances I'm equally sorry but you

115
0:05:07.42,000 --> 0:05:14,000
know somehow the technology has arrived

116
0:05:11.8,000 --> 0:05:14,000
at exactly the right time for us to stay

117
0:05:14.95,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in touch

118
0:05:15.67,000 --> 0:05:21,000
virtually if not physically and this is

119
0:05:19.66,000 --> 0:05:23,000
one of the things you do at Ted

120
0:05:21.76,000 --> 0:05:26,000
reach out to so many people and connect

121
0:05:24.4,000 --> 0:05:28,000
them with one another well we're so

122
0:05:27.46,000 --> 0:05:3,000
grateful that you can join us where

123
0:05:28.81,000 --> 0:05:33,000
exactly are you right now and most

124
0:05:30.85,000 --> 0:05:35,000
importantly how are you well I'm in my

125
0:05:34.42,000 --> 0:05:42,000
study in our home in golden screen on

126
0:05:36.67,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the edge of the Jewish ghetto and doing

127
0:05:42.49,000 --> 0:05:49,000
fine actually I kind of you know and I'm

128
0:05:47.86,000 --> 0:05:51,000
used to being the lonely man of faith

129
0:05:49.75,000 --> 0:05:56,000
kind of thing so you know in a sense I

130
0:05:52.72,000 --> 0:05:59,000
am used to it but hearing the real real

131
0:05:57.28,000 --> 0:06:05,000
pain of our community and of the country

132
0:06:00.18,000 --> 0:06:09,000
going through this terrible ordeal yeah

133
0:06:05.86,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it's real so back in 2017 you opened

134
0:06:09.73,000 --> 0:06:13,000
your TED talk with a quote from Thomas

135
0:06:12.4,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Paine referring to these at the times

136
0:06:14.68,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that try men's souls and pain of course

137
0:06:17.44,000 --> 0:06:21,000
was referring to British tyranny in the

138
0:06:20.11,000 --> 0:06:24,000
18th century and you were referring to

139
0:06:22.09,000 --> 0:06:27,000
divided political times in the 21st it's

140
0:06:25.03,000 --> 0:06:29,000
it's not really a stretch sadly to shift

141
0:06:27.58,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that from politics to the pandemic but I

142
0:06:29.8,000 --> 0:06:32,000
wonder can you give us a sense of what

143
0:06:31.78,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you make of these times and more

144
0:06:33.43,000 --> 0:06:38,000
importantly well you make of our

145
0:06:34.87,000 --> 0:06:43,000
response to these times well I apologize

146
0:06:38.5,000 --> 0:06:48,000
for 1776 I really do apologize

147
0:06:44.13,000 --> 0:06:52,000
lin-manuel Miranda got his own back

148
0:06:48.57,000 --> 0:06:57,000
deftly and beautifully done I think this

149
0:06:53.08,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is a traumatic time for the entire globe

150
0:06:57.79,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and people are going through every

151
0:07:01.45,000 --> 0:07:09,000
dimension of suffering there is physical

152
0:07:06.48,000 --> 0:07:12,000
psychological economic the uncertainty

153
0:07:09.91,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and anxiety about the future they're not

154
0:07:12.76,000 --> 0:07:17,000
knowing how long the pandemic will last

155
0:07:15.55,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they're not knowing how and when or if

156
0:07:18.55,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the economy will ever get back in shape

157
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
again these are horrific times these are

158
0:07:23.83,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a collective trauma and the real

159
0:07:26.89,000 --> 0:07:32,000
distinction is between events that you

160
0:07:29.89,000 --> 0:07:36,000
live through and events that change you

161
0:07:33.79,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and I'm hoping that this will come under

162
0:07:37.78,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the second category because they really

163
0:07:40.36,000 --> 0:07:45,000
ought to changes it's not as if we were

164
0:07:43.27,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in great shape just before all this

165
0:07:45.97,000 --> 0:07:51,000
began Lobley we weren't nationally we

166
0:07:49.87,000 --> 0:07:54,000
weren't our politics were dysfunctional

167
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:58,000
our economics for inequitable and

168
0:07:55.3,000 --> 0:08:,000
sometimes iniquitous so we were in a bad

169
0:07:58.27,000 --> 0:08:03,000
place and now we've come through a bad

170
0:08:00.73,000 --> 0:08:05,000
experience together I think there will

171
0:08:03.91,000 --> 0:08:1,000
be a collective resolve to move to a

172
0:08:06.58,000 --> 0:08:12,000
better place in the future do you wrote

173
0:08:10.96,000 --> 0:08:14,000
a piece at the weekend talking about the

174
0:08:12.94,000 --> 0:08:16,000
how the response to the corona virus

175
0:08:15.49,000 --> 0:08:19,000
could in fact be similar to the response

176
0:08:17.41,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we saw after World War two and in

177
0:08:19.54,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Britain of course the that response

178
0:08:21.49,000 --> 0:08:24,000
included the launch of the National

179
0:08:23.11,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Health Service which there's something I

180
0:08:25.03,000 --> 0:08:29,000
think many countries are sorely in need

181
0:08:26.8,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of today but if you had your druthers

182
0:08:29.41,000 --> 0:08:34,000
how would you see leaders step up to

183
0:08:32.14,000 --> 0:08:36,000
both deal with the pandemic in its

184
0:08:34.479,000 --> 0:08:38,000
moment and then also in its aftermath

185
0:08:36.69,000 --> 0:08:39,000
what would you like to see the leaders

186
0:08:39.01,000 --> 0:08:42,000
leaders do well don't forget this

187
0:08:40.51,000 --> 0:08:44,000
there's a difference between two kinds

188
0:08:42.61,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of leadership the leadership that gets

189
0:08:45.25,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you through the crisis and the

190
0:08:47.59,000 --> 0:08:52,000
leadership that rebuilds after the

191
0:08:50.17,000 --> 0:08:55,000
crisis one of the strangest phenomena of

192
0:08:53.35,000 --> 0:08:58,000
all was the fact that Winston Churchill

193
0:08:55.96,000 --> 0:08:59,000
whom everyone knew had

194
0:08:58.56,000 --> 0:09:03,000
can Britain triumphantly through World

195
0:09:00.3,000 --> 0:09:05,000
War two was not elected as Prime

196
0:09:03.57,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Minister mediately after the war yes he

197
0:09:06.24,000 --> 0:09:1,000
was a great leader for war he was not

198
0:09:08.73,000 --> 0:09:12,000
necessarily a great leader for peace I

199
0:09:10.95,000 --> 0:09:15,000
don't think any political leader in the

200
0:09:13.38,000 --> 0:09:19,000
world right now has a mind to think long

201
0:09:16.589,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and therefore they will get through the

202
0:09:19.44,000 --> 0:09:23,000
crisis living from day to day being

203
0:09:21.63,000 --> 0:09:26,000
guided by scientific experts and we've

204
0:09:24.3,000 --> 0:09:3,000
seen the rebirth of respect for

205
0:09:26.67,000 --> 0:09:33,000
expertise which is not unimportant but I

206
0:09:30.51,000 --> 0:09:37,000
hope a new kind of political leader is

207
0:09:34.65,000 --> 0:09:4,000
about to emerge the young people who

208
0:09:37.92,000 --> 0:09:42,000
really will be changed by this I don't

209
0:09:40.68,000 --> 0:09:45,000
say I've got to give back and the first

210
0:09:43.41,000 --> 0:09:48,000
thing they have to look at is a National

211
0:09:45.99,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Health Service I mean we in Britain know

212
0:09:48.63,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the National Health Service is being

213
0:09:50.91,000 --> 0:09:55,000
overwhelmed at the moment but to think

214
0:09:53.49,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that 27 million Americans don't have

215
0:09:56.43,000 --> 0:10:02,000
health care don't have health insurance

216
0:09:58.38,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I mean I'm sorry that is morally

217
0:10:02.9,000 --> 0:10:09,000
unintelligible to me and so somehow or

218
0:10:06.81,000 --> 0:10:13,000
other we need a new politics but the day

219
0:10:10.56,000 --> 0:10:16,000
after and this will come from places

220
0:10:13.98,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we're not expecting they certainly not

221
0:10:16.68,000 --> 0:10:2,000
going to come from the existing

222
0:10:18.21,000 --> 0:10:22,000
political leadership but I think that

223
0:10:21.15,000 --> 0:10:25,000
they will have to look at it they'll

224
0:10:22.35,000 --> 0:10:27,000
also have to have to look at the economy

225
0:10:25.17,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as well first of all we were building up

226
0:10:28.23,000 --> 0:10:33,000
an unsustainable level of individual and

227
0:10:30.78,000 --> 0:10:34,000
national debt anyway and all of that is

228
0:10:33.48,000 --> 0:10:35,000
seeing companies collapsing all over the

229
0:10:35.49,000 --> 0:10:38,000
world

230
0:10:35.82,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it was untenable before this happened

231
0:10:38.99,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and finally we're seeing an American

232
0:10:42.03,000 --> 0:10:47,000
president you know sending out checks to

233
0:10:44.85,000 --> 0:10:48,000
people the beginning of what you've

234
0:10:47.49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
spoken about in Ted before you've had

235
0:10:49.709,000 --> 0:10:53,000
speakers dealing with this a guaranteed

236
0:10:51.66,000 --> 0:10:56,000
basic income who knows if that's what I

237
0:10:54.54,000 --> 0:10:59,000
gained to emerge from it new things are

238
0:10:56.91,000 --> 0:11:,000
going to emerge no existing leader is

239
0:10:59.61,000 --> 0:11:04,000
going to have the headspace to see this

240
0:11:01.65,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but I expect a new kind of political

241
0:11:05.07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
leadership to emerge in every country

242
0:11:08.43,000 --> 0:11:11,000
where people have really taken this to

243
0:11:10.2,000 --> 0:11:14,000
heart

244
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and I suppose the problem is that we

245
0:11:15.08,000 --> 0:11:18,000
know one cannot take this to heart right

246
0:11:17.12,000 --> 0:11:21,000
this is really impacting everybody and

247
0:11:19.04,000 --> 0:11:22,000
some of what's alarming about some of

248
0:11:21.14,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the antagonistic rhetoric that we're

249
0:11:22.76,000 --> 0:11:26,000
seeing say between the US and China or

250
0:11:24.86,000 --> 0:11:29,000
you know national leaders trying to

251
0:11:27.74,000 --> 0:11:3,000
close their borders or look inwards is

252
0:11:30.17,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that the virus doesn't care about

253
0:11:31.43,000 --> 0:11:36,000
borders it doesn't care about anything

254
0:11:33.64,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I'm interested in do you see any grass

255
0:11:36.59,000 --> 0:11:39,000
roots or shoots of this type of

256
0:11:38.21,000 --> 0:11:41,000
leadership emerging or has anything have

257
0:11:40.19,000 --> 0:11:43,000
you seen anything that's given you hope

258
0:11:42.08,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that this might emerge or that maybe

259
0:11:44.09,000 --> 0:11:47,000
there are people who might even be able

260
0:11:46.13,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to overtake some of the national leaders

261
0:11:47.72,000 --> 0:11:52,000
who are who are maybe not doing what we

262
0:11:50.09,000 --> 0:11:57,000
might think of as the best job

263
0:11:52.84,000 --> 0:11:59,000
look I when I was a student which is an

264
0:11:57.77,000 --> 0:12:03,000
awfully long time ago the early Jurassic

265
0:12:00.11,000 --> 0:12:07,000
age we had 767 the Six Day War I'm

266
0:12:04.4,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Jewish we had this nightmare and the

267
0:12:07.13,000 --> 0:12:14,000
weeks leading up to it we who had been

268
0:12:11.75,000 --> 0:12:16,000
born after the Holocaust with thinking

269
0:12:14.51,000 --> 0:12:2,000
given NASA's threats that we were about

270
0:12:17.54,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to witness another whole course now that

271
0:12:20.81,000 --> 0:12:25,000
happened in my first year at university

272
0:12:22.88,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I think if it hadn't happened I would be

273
0:12:26.45,000 --> 0:12:33,000
an accountant I realize you know the

274
0:12:31.64,000 --> 0:12:35,000
world has changed we can't you can't go

275
0:12:33.62,000 --> 0:12:39,000
through an experience like that and stay

276
0:12:36.56,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the same so it happens to people when

277
0:12:40.31,000 --> 0:12:45,000
they say you know we can't go back to

278
0:12:42.92,000 --> 0:12:48,000
the way things were so I do see this

279
0:12:45.62,000 --> 0:12:5,000
happening I do not think the political

280
0:12:48.95,000 --> 0:12:52,000
leadership of let's say the United

281
0:12:50.69,000 --> 0:12:55,000
States and China are behaving terribly

282
0:12:53.36,000 --> 0:13:04,000
responsibly if the world is suffering

283
0:12:55.7,000 --> 0:13:06,000
now's not the time to play ping pong for

284
0:13:05.12,000 --> 0:13:09,000
years now about the need for a balance

285
0:13:07.07,000 --> 0:13:12,000
between rights and responsibilities and

286
0:13:09.95,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I wonder how do you define our personal

287
0:13:13.01,000 --> 0:13:2,000
responsibility in this moment I think

288
0:13:19.55,000 --> 0:13:23,000
good

289
0:13:20.06,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to ask I know it's a difficult one is

290
0:13:23.75,000 --> 0:13:32,000
what does this moment ask of me that it

291
0:13:30.23,000 --> 0:13:34,000
wouldn't have done at some other time so

292
0:13:33.23,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I'm doing stuff that I never did before

293
0:13:34.9,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I'm using I'm using FaceTime live I'm

294
0:13:40.79,000 --> 0:13:45,000
using zoom I never heard of zoom before

295
0:13:43.46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I'm using every means of communication I

296
0:13:46.7,000 --> 0:13:51,000
can to communicate to as many people as

297
0:13:49.28,000 --> 0:13:56,000
possible at different level and that is

298
0:13:52.49,000 --> 0:13:59,000
what I hear me being called to our

299
0:13:56.96,000 --> 0:14:01,000
neighbors are doing incredible things

300
0:14:00.05,000 --> 0:14:04,000
just being neighborly because we've got

301
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
old people living alone here and they're

302
0:14:04.52,000 --> 0:14:09,000
just knocking on the doors of getting in

303
0:14:06.44,000 --> 0:14:12,000
touch with them and so on just listen to

304
0:14:09.71,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the call what does this moment ask of me

305
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
why was I put in this place at this time

306
0:14:16.64,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I love that and I think it's one of the

307
0:14:21.59,000 --> 0:14:25,000
things that has been heartening about

308
0:14:23.15,000 --> 0:14:27,000
this crisis is seeing how the community

309
0:14:25.88,000 --> 0:14:29,000
steps up I'm in Brooklyn and New York

310
0:14:27.83,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and just seeing how people are leaving

311
0:14:30.23,000 --> 0:14:33,000
notes for neighbors and just checking in

312
0:14:32.24,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to see if they're okay or if they need

313
0:14:34.07,000 --> 0:14:37,000
anything if we can you know those who

314
0:14:35.63,000 --> 0:14:38,000
are able to go out to the pharmacy or

315
0:14:37.34,000 --> 0:14:42,000
whatever can go pick something up it

316
0:14:39.59,000 --> 0:14:44,000
kind of is heartening even though we're

317
0:14:42.56,000 --> 0:14:46,000
all scared you know everybody is

318
0:14:44.9,000 --> 0:14:47,000
frightened of kind of what's happening

319
0:14:47.12,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and what's to come and it's this weird

320
0:14:48.88,000 --> 0:14:52,000
hinterland that we're all in where you

321
0:14:51.32,000 --> 0:14:55,000
know you kind of know that a crisis is

322
0:14:53.36,000 --> 0:14:57,000
coming even if it hasn't hit but we're

323
0:14:55.76,000 --> 0:15:,000
seeing the news and seeing the

324
0:14:57.68,000 --> 0:15:03,000
overwhelmed you know health services do

325
0:15:00.77,000 --> 0:15:03,000
you as a spiritual leader I'm sorry go

326
0:15:03.68,000 --> 0:15:07,000
ahead

327
0:15:04.03,000 --> 0:15:09,000
no I was just going to say my my one of

328
0:15:08.24,000 --> 0:15:14,000
our grandchildren our eight year old

329
0:15:09.86,000 --> 0:15:15,000
granddaughter decided on her own the

330
0:15:14.36,000 --> 0:15:18,000
knock on the doors of all the houses in

331
0:15:15.95,000 --> 0:15:2,000
her Street keeping her social distance

332
0:15:18.62,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and when the door is open saying we live

333
0:15:21.38,000 --> 0:15:25,000
at number 12 if you need anything come

334
0:15:23.63,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and knock at our door and I thought you

335
0:15:26.24,000 --> 0:15:3,000
know that's what an eight-year-old does

336
0:15:28.1,000 --> 0:15:33,000
spontaneously I'm feeling quite proud at

337
0:15:31.04,000 --> 0:15:33,000
the moment

338
0:15:34.75,000 --> 0:15:39,000
but I think that the there's a universal

339
0:15:37.97,000 --> 0:15:4,000
fear that everyone is experiencing even

340
0:15:40.25,000 --> 0:15:45,000
if they're not experiencing in the same

341
0:15:41.87,000 --> 0:15:47,000
way and and fear can be paralyzing do

342
0:15:45.44,000 --> 0:15:49,000
you in your experience what what advice

343
0:15:48.86,000 --> 0:15:51,000
do you have for people who are trying to

344
0:15:50.36,000 --> 0:15:53,000
overcome that fear who are trying to

345
0:15:52.1,000 --> 0:16:,000
kind of live in the communal space and

346
0:15:54.17,000 --> 0:16:03,000
not just retreat to themselves well look

347
0:16:00.68,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I mean the thing to do is to reach out

348
0:16:03.17,000 --> 0:16:11,000
in any way that you can because we know

349
0:16:07.54,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that reaching out and helping someone

350
0:16:11.259,000 --> 0:16:16,000
makes you feel better makes you feel

351
0:16:13.94,000 --> 0:16:18,000
more confident boosts your immune system

352
0:16:16.97,000 --> 0:16:21,000
speeds your recovery from any illness

353
0:16:19.66,000 --> 0:16:25,000
huge amount of research has been done on

354
0:16:22.49,000 --> 0:16:28,000
the health benefits of altruism and and

355
0:16:25.839,000 --> 0:16:31,000
sometimes it's nothing but a smile at a

356
0:16:29.36,000 --> 0:16:33,000
passerby at six or eight feet distance

357
0:16:32.75,000 --> 0:16:36,000
sometimes it's nothing

358
0:16:34.279,000 --> 0:16:4,000
sometimes it's sharing a funny story on

359
0:16:37.699,000 --> 0:16:43,000
whatsapp you know we had some friends we

360
0:16:40.76,000 --> 0:16:45,000
went on a holiday with got twenty two

361
0:16:44.18,000 --> 0:16:47,000
twenty three friends we went on a

362
0:16:45.8,000 --> 0:16:5,000
holiday in New Zealand a few months ago

363
0:16:47.93,000 --> 0:16:52,000
they live all over the world and they've

364
0:16:50.839,000 --> 0:16:55,000
been bombarding one another with little

365
0:16:53.029,000 --> 0:16:59,000
photographs and videos and stuff and so

366
0:16:56.209,000 --> 0:17:02,000
on that everyone has found a way of

367
0:16:59.18,000 --> 0:17:06,000
getting out of their confinement

368
0:17:02.209,000 --> 0:17:09,000
you know I there's a line in Psalms you

369
0:17:06.829,000 --> 0:17:12,000
know I animates a karateka I called you

370
0:17:09.89,000 --> 0:17:14,000
God from my confinement and you answered

371
0:17:13.25,000 --> 0:17:18,000
me with expenses sometimes those

372
0:17:15.77,000 --> 0:17:19,000
expenses just psychological but knowing

373
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that you've communicated with somebody

374
0:17:20.39,000 --> 0:17:28,000
made someone smile that's all you have

375
0:17:23.15,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to do how do you so you've written a lot

376
0:17:28.429,000 --> 0:17:31,000
we talked about it in your talk and

377
0:17:30.53,000 --> 0:17:34,000
you've written about it in your latest

378
0:17:31.73,000 --> 0:17:36,000
book about the need to move from I to we

379
0:17:34.97,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and I have a couple of questions around

380
0:17:37.01,000 --> 0:17:4,000
this but first of all I wonder if you

381
0:17:38.36,000 --> 0:17:43,000
can describe exactly what you mean by

382
0:17:40.19,000 --> 0:17:47,000
that shift I mean that any social animal

383
0:17:43.909,000 --> 0:17:48,000
needs to be able to do two things

384
0:17:47.25,000 --> 0:17:54,000
needs to engage in competition and

385
0:17:49.68,000 --> 0:17:56,000
cooperation without competition die

386
0:17:54.84,000 --> 0:17:58,000
without cooperation you can't have a

387
0:17:57.06,000 --> 0:18:03,000
group you can't have a society and we

388
0:17:59.58,000 --> 0:18:06,000
cannot survive on top we have today two

389
0:18:03.9,000 --> 0:18:09,000
very powerful arenas of competition the

390
0:18:07.5,000 --> 0:18:12,000
market and the state politics and

391
0:18:10.08,000 --> 0:18:15,000
economically the market competition for

392
0:18:13.02,000 --> 0:18:19,000
wealth the state competition for power

393
0:18:15.35,000 --> 0:18:21,000
but what we've been losing is our arenas

394
0:18:19.41,000 --> 0:18:23,000
of cooperation families communities

395
0:18:21.84,000 --> 0:18:26,000
charities volunteering and all the rest

396
0:18:23.97,000 --> 0:18:27,000
of it those things where you search not

397
0:18:27.03,000 --> 0:18:31,000
for self-interest but for the common

398
0:18:28.74,000 --> 0:18:33,000
good those things have been weakening

399
0:18:31.5,000 --> 0:18:36,000
over the past several decades and the

400
0:18:34.59,000 --> 0:18:43,000
end result is societies become much more

401
0:18:36.78,000 --> 0:18:44,000
abrasive and unequal and so therefore

402
0:18:43.95,000 --> 0:18:47,000
how do we move away from that I mean do

403
0:18:45.75,000 --> 0:18:5,000
we did we need to have such a shift such

404
0:18:48.27,000 --> 0:18:56,000
a seismic shift such as this in order to

405
0:18:51,000 --> 0:19:01,000
shake us out of our kind of complacency

406
0:18:56.51,000 --> 0:19:03,000
well I always make sure we observe the

407
0:19:01.35,000 --> 0:19:06,000
difference by between asking why is this

408
0:19:03.51,000 --> 0:19:09,000
happened and what then should we do

409
0:19:06.8,000 --> 0:19:12,000
right this has not happened in order to

410
0:19:10.41,000 --> 0:19:14,000
make us we conscious it did not happen

411
0:19:12.81,000 --> 0:19:17,000
in order to boost the sales of my leg at

412
0:19:15.36,000 --> 0:19:2,000
his book the virus mutates that's how it

413
0:19:18.21,000 --> 0:19:23,000
things happen so I'm not asking why this

414
0:19:20.85,000 --> 0:19:26,000
happened I'm saying now that this has

415
0:19:23.22,000 --> 0:19:29,000
happened let us really see if it is

416
0:19:27.24,000 --> 0:19:32,000
unleashed let energies as it has because

417
0:19:29.67,000 --> 0:19:33,000
communities have grown up I mean virtual

418
0:19:32.37,000 --> 0:19:35,000
communities have grown up at a speed

419
0:19:34.47,000 --> 0:19:38,000
that nobody ever thought they would

420
0:19:36.18,000 --> 0:19:41,000
happen the National Health Service asked

421
0:19:38.73,000 --> 0:19:44,000
for volunteers to be health auxiliaries

422
0:19:41.66,000 --> 0:19:48,000
they had over half a million volunteers

423
0:19:45.21,000 --> 0:19:5,000
in one day now you know that's quite

424
0:19:48.69,000 --> 0:19:52,000
something we have a we have a

425
0:19:51.2,000 --> 0:19:55,000
conservative prime minister right now

426
0:19:53.4,000 --> 0:19:57,000
you remember Margaret Thatcher famously

427
0:19:55.23,000 --> 0:20:,000
said there is no such thing as society

428
0:19:57.9,000 --> 0:20:02,000
today Boris Johnson said you know what

429
0:20:01.2,000 --> 0:20:06,000
there is such a thing as society after

430
0:20:03.09,000 --> 0:20:07,000
all but that's a big change

431
0:20:08.549,000 --> 0:20:12,000
chipping in with a couple of questions

432
0:20:10.679,000 --> 0:20:16,000
from the room and first of all what a

433
0:20:12.96,000 --> 0:20:18,000
question from our tech department who

434
0:20:16.7,000 --> 0:20:2,000
said we're getting bit of noise from the

435
0:20:19.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
microphone rubbing against your collar

436
0:20:21.09,000 --> 0:20:26,000
if there's a way of smoothing the

437
0:20:23.549,000 --> 0:20:26,000
microphone away from your collar I don't

438
0:20:26.34,000 --> 0:20:32,000
know whether you can even do that it's

439
0:20:27.48,000 --> 0:20:36,000
not a big deal doesn't matter but Chris

440
0:20:33.029,000 --> 0:20:45,000
I I met you halfway I'm not wearing a

441
0:20:37.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
tie anyway I was doing this the first

442
0:20:45.99,000 --> 0:20:5,000
day and they asked me to correct but

443
0:20:48.83,000 --> 0:20:53,000
that's the small thing here's a question

444
0:20:51.48,000 --> 0:20:57,000
though after this is from Jennifer on on

445
0:20:54.47,000 --> 0:20:58,000
after the 1918 flu epidemic the world

446
0:20:57.75,000 --> 0:21:01,000
did change but not sure for the better

447
0:20:59.25,000 --> 0:21:05,000
because the rise of fascist ideologies

448
0:21:02.539,000 --> 0:21:06,000
why should we be optimistic that the

449
0:21:05.519,000 --> 0:21:08,000
present disruption is leading us to a

450
0:21:07.38,000 --> 0:21:11,000
better place

451
0:21:09.11,000 --> 0:21:14,000
Chris I have to make a distinction which

452
0:21:11.519,000 --> 0:21:17,000
is readily important between optimism

453
0:21:14.85,000 --> 0:21:21,000
and hope optimism is the belief that

454
0:21:18.48,000 --> 0:21:23,000
things will get better hope is the

455
0:21:22.019,000 --> 0:21:27,000
belief that if we work hard enough

456
0:21:23.49,000 --> 0:21:29,000
together we can make things better it

457
0:21:27.149,000 --> 0:21:32,000
needs no courage only a certain naivety

458
0:21:29.909,000 --> 0:21:33,000
to be an optimist but it needs sometimes

459
0:21:32.789,000 --> 0:21:35,000
a great deal of courage to have hope

460
0:21:34.169,000 --> 0:21:4,000
I've tried to bring a message of hope

461
0:21:36.389,000 --> 0:21:41,000
not of optimism we know that World War

462
0:21:40.38,000 --> 0:21:44,000
one was supposed to be the war to end

463
0:21:42,000 --> 0:21:48,000
all wars and it didn't end all war we

464
0:21:44.61,000 --> 0:21:5,000
know that the flu epidemic which they

465
0:21:48.84,000 --> 0:21:52,000
have taken between 20 and 50 million

466
0:21:50.639,000 --> 0:21:55,000
lives did not suddenly create a we

467
0:21:53.7,000 --> 0:21:58,000
society we know all the bad things that

468
0:21:56.549,000 --> 0:22:,000
happen the great crash the thirties

469
0:21:58.98,000 --> 0:22:02,000
depression and so on and in the end the

470
0:22:01.38,000 --> 0:22:06,000
explosion of evil that was World War two

471
0:22:03.769,000 --> 0:22:08,000
though I'm not being optimistic here

472
0:22:07.169,000 --> 0:22:13,000
there could be another road that people

473
0:22:09.6,000 --> 0:22:14,000
will go down a nationalist road

474
0:22:13.44,000 --> 0:22:16,000
which sees the rise of far-right parties

475
0:22:15.33,000 --> 0:22:17,000
in Europe and the breakup of the

476
0:22:16.74,000 --> 0:22:19,000
European Union

477
0:22:17.82,000 --> 0:22:21,000
further tensions between the United

478
0:22:20.009,000 --> 0:22:25,000
States and China heaven alone knows what

479
0:22:22.74,000 --> 0:22:27,000
Russia will do in all this mix there are

480
0:22:25.649,000 --> 0:22:3,000
horrendous possibilities here that's why

481
0:22:28.47,000 --> 0:22:34,000
we need to work very hard together to

482
0:22:31.289,000 --> 0:22:38,000
make sure that we take the possible good

483
0:22:34.769,000 --> 0:22:4,000
benefits out of this number one the

484
0:22:38.73,000 --> 0:22:42,000
understanding that the whole of humanity

485
0:22:41.519,000 --> 0:22:46,000
has been brought to its knees by one

486
0:22:43.23,000 --> 0:22:49,000
tiny virus we are we feel the we of

487
0:22:47.07,000 --> 0:22:52,000
humanity as a whole number two that in

488
0:22:49.95,000 --> 0:22:54,000
the end the only effective political

489
0:22:52.559,000 --> 0:22:57,000
force that's worked is the nation let's

490
0:22:55.049,000 --> 0:23:,000
have one nation and not a divided nation

491
0:22:58.08,000 --> 0:23:02,000
and number three we've seen the growth

492
0:23:00.33,000 --> 0:23:04,000
locally of community spirit like we've

493
0:23:03.029,000 --> 0:23:06,000
never had before that's the weave

494
0:23:04.35,000 --> 0:23:08,000
community I don't think any of these

495
0:23:06.72,000 --> 0:23:11,000
things are automatic I think they will

496
0:23:09,000 --> 0:23:16,000
require determination wisdom and great

497
0:23:11.789,000 --> 0:23:16,000
courage they will require leadership and

498
0:23:16.019,000 --> 0:23:19,000
by the way that question wasn't from

499
0:23:17.759,000 --> 0:23:2,000
Jennifer on Facebook Jennifer this is a

500
0:23:19.71,000 --> 0:23:22,000
member of our tech team before I did the

501
0:23:21.149,000 --> 0:23:25,000
question to me though but here's another

502
0:23:23.639,000 --> 0:23:28,000
question from from Facebook which is

503
0:23:25.889,000 --> 0:23:32,000
what coping strategies can religion

504
0:23:29.279,000 --> 0:23:37,000
offer in the current circumstances well

505
0:23:33.539,000 --> 0:23:4,000
prayer helps it actually helps if you

506
0:23:37.889,000 --> 0:23:43,000
want specifically to know what to say

507
0:23:41.029,000 --> 0:23:47,000
read The Book of Psalms book of Psalms

508
0:23:44.19,000 --> 0:23:48,000
is the greatest source of comfort it

509
0:23:47.159,000 --> 0:23:51,000
certainly was to me when I've been ill

510
0:23:49.08,000 --> 0:23:53,000
was to my late father when he went

511
0:23:51.21,000 --> 0:23:56,000
through the many operations at the end

512
0:23:53.25,000 --> 0:23:58,000
of his life I think faith that God is

513
0:23:56.879,000 --> 0:24:,000
with you giving you the strength to come

514
0:23:58.889,000 --> 0:24:02,000
through this faith that you place your

515
0:24:01.139,000 --> 0:24:06,000
life in his hands these are powerful

516
0:24:03.48,000 --> 0:24:11,000
things they helped me go through a

517
0:24:06.69,000 --> 0:24:14,000
number of life challenging illnesses

518
0:24:12.47,000 --> 0:24:16,000
that marrying the right woman of course

519
0:24:15.45,000 --> 0:24:19,000
but I mean

520
0:24:17.03,000 --> 0:24:23,000
I think faith helps the other thing

521
0:24:2,000 --> 0:24:25,000
that's worth listening to is now that so

522
0:24:23.27,000 --> 0:24:27,000
many people are living in isolation

523
0:24:25.36,000 --> 0:24:31,000
somebody had the bright idea of asking

524
0:24:27.95,000 --> 0:24:32,000
that and Sharansky there was in pretty

525
0:24:31.97,000 --> 0:24:36,000
much solitary confinement for nine years

526
0:24:33.8,000 --> 0:24:39,000
by the KGB what did he do to stay sane

527
0:24:37.28,000 --> 0:24:43,000
and he came up with some pretty good

528
0:24:40.37,000 --> 0:24:45,000
principles that I that I think he want

529
0:24:43.34,000 --> 0:24:47,000
to share with you number one focus on

530
0:24:45.89,000 --> 0:24:49,000
what you can control

531
0:24:47.45,000 --> 0:24:53,000
don't worry about the rest number two

532
0:24:50.47,000 --> 0:24:56,000
keep your mind active number three never

533
0:24:54.38,000 --> 0:24:59,000
lose your sense of humor number four

534
0:24:57.1,000 --> 0:25:01,000
think of the group that you're a member

535
0:24:59.66,000 --> 0:25:04,000
of even if you can't physically be in

536
0:25:01.79,000 --> 0:25:07,000
their company and number five think of

537
0:25:04.94,000 --> 0:25:1,000
the bigger picture and for him too that

538
0:25:08.6,000 --> 0:25:11,000
came from the book of Psalms last

539
0:25:11.51,000 --> 0:25:14,000
question

540
0:25:12.17,000 --> 0:25:17,000
and you mentioned prayer someone's

541
0:25:15.29,000 --> 0:25:19,000
asking would you be willing to say no to

542
0:25:17.9,000 --> 0:25:22,000
this would you be willing to lead us in

543
0:25:19.55,000 --> 0:25:26,000
a prayer or invocation offering you help

544
0:25:23.3,000 --> 0:25:32,000
or guide us to get on the right track

545
0:25:26.59,000 --> 0:25:32,000
maybe our or towards the end of this hmm

546
0:25:33.52,000 --> 0:25:4,000
God on high please be with us all in

547
0:25:37.79,000 --> 0:25:43,000
this hour of trial heal those who is

548
0:25:41.42,000 --> 0:25:48,000
sick give strength to those who give

549
0:25:44.39,000 --> 0:25:52,000
them comfort be with those heroes and

550
0:25:48.98,000 --> 0:25:54,000
heroines who manage our medical systems

551
0:25:53.15,000 --> 0:25:59,000
the doctors the nurses the medical

552
0:25:55.4,000 --> 0:26:02,000
auxiliaries if strength to all those who

553
0:25:59.84,000 --> 0:26:03,000
sustain our essential services have

554
0:26:02.42,000 --> 0:26:11,000
stock our supermarkets who dispense the

555
0:26:04.79,000 --> 0:26:16,000
medicines we need extend to us your love

556
0:26:11.92,000 --> 0:26:21,000
remove from us all hate let us be joined

557
0:26:17.54,000 --> 0:26:26,000
in this time of trial in our sense of

558
0:26:22.64,000 --> 0:26:29,000
belonging to one another and help us and

559
0:26:27.16,000 --> 0:26:39,000
this is over the Builder better more

560
0:26:30.43,000 --> 0:26:38,000
just and safer world Thank You rabbi

561
0:26:44.71,000 --> 0:26:49,000
Ellen it's over to you yeah I'm here I'm

562
0:26:48.279,000 --> 0:26:5,000
here thank you so much for doing that

563
0:26:50.14,000 --> 0:26:54,000
that was beautiful

564
0:26:51.149,000 --> 0:26:56,000
though I think it's important when you

565
0:26:54.429,000 --> 0:26:57,000
talk about the you know you mentioned

566
0:26:56.649,000 --> 0:26:59,000
the healthcare workers you mentioned the

567
0:26:58,000 --> 0:27:05,000
people who are stocking shelves who are

568
0:27:00.279,000 --> 0:27:06,000
out there every day despite the the

569
0:27:05.01,000 --> 0:27:08,000
recommendations that we social distance

570
0:27:07.21,000 --> 0:27:12,000
or you know in certain cases we just

571
0:27:08.98,000 --> 0:27:13,000
stay home and don't go out so I guess my

572
0:27:12.94,000 --> 0:27:17,000
concern and worries are with them and

573
0:27:14.89,000 --> 0:27:21,000
how they maintain calm and peace time

574
0:27:18.549,000 --> 0:27:24,000
when they are sustaining all of us how

575
0:27:22,000 --> 0:27:27,000
how can we help them how can we think

576
0:27:25.51,000 --> 0:27:29,000
about doing what is right for those

577
0:27:27.82,000 --> 0:27:3,000
people and they're also of course there

578
0:27:29.649,000 --> 0:27:32,000
are cultures in which social distancing

579
0:27:31.51,000 --> 0:27:34,000
is just simply not possible it's you

580
0:27:33.279,000 --> 0:27:38,000
know society was designed in such a way

581
0:27:35.26,000 --> 0:27:4,000
that you know that social distancing is

582
0:27:38.59,000 --> 0:27:41,000
not possible so I guess I'm thinking

583
0:27:40.539,000 --> 0:27:43,000
about this a lot and I wonder what your

584
0:27:42.49,000 --> 0:27:46,000
thoughts are about how we can help or

585
0:27:44.409,000 --> 0:27:49,000
how we can think about that it's

586
0:27:46.75,000 --> 0:27:52,000
tremendously helpful for employers and

587
0:27:49.6,000 --> 0:27:54,000
if not employers then the government to

588
0:27:52.899,000 --> 0:27:55,000
provide them with or whatever safety

589
0:27:54.85,000 --> 0:27:57,000
equipment they can have whether it's

590
0:27:56.44,000 --> 0:28:,000
gloves whether it's face masks whether

591
0:27:58.57,000 --> 0:28:03,000
face must have been found to work and so

592
0:28:01.21,000 --> 0:28:09,000
and it's appalling that governments were

593
0:28:04.27,000 --> 0:28:12,000
not prepared for this and because South

594
0:28:09.789,000 --> 0:28:15,000
Korea and China and Hong Kong and

595
0:28:12.399,000 --> 0:28:17,000
Singapore had had SARS and other

596
0:28:15.88,000 --> 0:28:18,000
epidemics recently they really were

597
0:28:17.74,000 --> 0:28:22,000
prepared and you can see the difference

598
0:28:19.45,000 --> 0:28:24,000
in state but otherwise you know it's

599
0:28:22.99,000 --> 0:28:27,000
really really important that we help

600
0:28:25.24,000 --> 0:28:3,000
those people by keeping our social

601
0:28:28.36,000 --> 0:28:32,000
distance otherwise we are a health

602
0:28:30.64,000 --> 0:28:37,000
hazard to them and and and that's just

603
0:28:33.24,000 --> 0:28:4,000
incredibly important so that's the best

604
0:28:37.96,000 --> 0:28:41,000
we can do to make sure that they are

605
0:28:40.299,000 --> 0:28:44,000
prioritized with the provision of

606
0:28:42.909,000 --> 0:28:46,000
whatever safety to proceed especially

607
0:28:45.25,000 --> 0:28:5,000
the doctors nurses and hospitals you

608
0:28:47.649,000 --> 0:28:52,000
know in Italy there's been a huge

609
0:28:50.38,000 --> 0:28:55,000
percentage of the casualties have been

610
0:28:52.87,000 --> 0:28:55,000
doctors nurses I mean that's really

611
0:28:55.389,000 --> 0:29:,000
tragic

612
0:28:56.65,000 --> 0:29:02,000
and in Britain people are working very

613
0:29:00.64,000 --> 0:29:06,000
hard very fast make sure it doesn't

614
0:29:03.4,000 --> 0:29:08,000
happen here what do you think is the

615
0:29:06.64,000 --> 0:29:12,000
moral imperative for executives or for

616
0:29:09.19,000 --> 0:29:14,000
leaders in that in that position who you

617
0:29:12.94,000 --> 0:29:16,000
know or maybe running the warehouses or

618
0:29:14.98,000 --> 0:29:2,000
overseeing the places where these people

619
0:29:17.53,000 --> 0:29:23,000
are working well I mean here the whole

620
0:29:21.28,000 --> 0:29:26,000
wartime ethos is absolutely essential

621
0:29:24.51,000 --> 0:29:3,000
chief executives have to be down there

622
0:29:27.25,000 --> 0:29:32,000
on on the ground with the workers you

623
0:29:30.61,000 --> 0:29:34,000
know they can't be running companies

624
0:29:32.56,000 --> 0:29:37,000
from a distance they have to be there

625
0:29:35.5,000 --> 0:29:4,000
sharing the same risks suffering the

626
0:29:37.9,000 --> 0:29:42,000
same fears as their employees otherwise

627
0:29:40.9,000 --> 0:29:49,000
I think you know they're just morally

628
0:29:43.69,000 --> 0:29:53,000
unfit for the job there's certainly

629
0:29:50.29,000 --> 0:29:55,000
there I think related to the the we and

630
0:29:53.71,000 --> 0:29:56,000
the I that you have that you have

631
0:29:55.87,000 --> 0:29:58,000
written about there's a kind of a rise

632
0:29:57.67,000 --> 0:30:02,000
over the last decades of individualism

633
0:29:59.74,000 --> 0:30:04,000
and the kind of a sense that personal

634
0:30:03.16,000 --> 0:30:07,000
freedom matters more than anything else

635
0:30:04.99,000 --> 0:30:08,000
I think that we've all seen unfortunate

636
0:30:07.48,000 --> 0:30:1,000
stories of people who are putting their

637
0:30:09.01,000 --> 0:30:14,000
personal freedom above others what do

638
0:30:11.47,000 --> 0:30:17,000
you say to them how and how can if

639
0:30:14.85,000 --> 0:30:2,000
personally if we see people who are

640
0:30:17.55,000 --> 0:30:23,000
perhaps not making taking all these

641
0:30:20.88,000 --> 0:30:25,000
restrictions seriously should we get

642
0:30:23.74,000 --> 0:30:28,000
involved like how do how do we respond

643
0:30:26.08,000 --> 0:30:3,000
to seeing people out in society who are

644
0:30:29.08,000 --> 0:30:34,000
not perhaps taking this as seriously as

645
0:30:30.88,000 --> 0:30:36,000
we believe everyone should it's a

646
0:30:34.39,000 --> 0:30:41,000
serious problem and interestingly we

647
0:30:37.12,000 --> 0:30:43,000
have we have some really good social

648
0:30:41.47,000 --> 0:30:44,000
science research on this there's

649
0:30:43.54,000 --> 0:30:46,000
something called the social goods game I

650
0:30:45.34,000 --> 0:30:5,000
don't know if you've come across this

651
0:30:46.78,000 --> 0:30:53,000
let me explain there three players are

652
0:30:50.65,000 --> 0:30:56,000
given let's say $30 each and they are

653
0:30:54.22,000 --> 0:31:,000
told that they can contribute as much as

654
0:30:57.4,000 --> 0:31:03,000
they want to a communal chest and the

655
0:31:00.52,000 --> 0:31:08,000
money will then be doubled and returned

656
0:31:03.55,000 --> 0:31:09,000
to them three three people are sitting

657
0:31:09.28,000 --> 0:31:13,000
around the table there

658
0:31:10.24,000 --> 0:31:17,000
been given $30 they each put $30 in the

659
0:31:13.36,000 --> 0:31:18,000
communal chest that is doubled to a

660
0:31:17.35,000 --> 0:31:21,000
hundred and eighty dollars and they all

661
0:31:18.79,000 --> 0:31:24,000
get $60 left the next round somebody

662
0:31:22.24,000 --> 0:31:27,000
decides to be clever and he doesn't put

663
0:31:25.66,000 --> 0:31:3,000
his thirty dollars in but the other two

664
0:31:27.46,000 --> 0:31:35,000
do there now they're $60 double to 120

665
0:31:31.42,000 --> 0:31:37,000
everyone gets 40 so to get 40 with the

666
0:31:35.679,000 --> 0:31:42,000
third who didn't put his money in now

667
0:31:37.78,000 --> 0:31:46,000
has 70 he gains by putting self-interest

668
0:31:42.88,000 --> 0:31:47,000
above the common good what happens the

669
0:31:46.809,000 --> 0:31:5,000
short answer is within a few rounds

670
0:31:48.84,000 --> 0:31:53,000
everyone stops putting money in the

671
0:31:51.28,000 --> 0:31:58,000
collective then though common good

672
0:31:54.16,000 --> 0:32:01,000
disappears number two when asked if they

673
0:31:58.48,000 --> 0:32:04,000
would be willing to pay money to punish

674
0:32:01.45,000 --> 0:32:07,000
the non contributor they all agree

675
0:32:05.14,000 --> 0:32:09,000
they're willing to make a sacrifice to

676
0:32:08.02,000 --> 0:32:12,000
punish the guy who puts his

677
0:32:09.76,000 --> 0:32:14,000
self-interest over the common good so we

678
0:32:12.28,000 --> 0:32:18,000
have huge research on this though what

679
0:32:14.8,000 --> 0:32:2,000
happens of course is that if lots of

680
0:32:18.429,000 --> 0:32:24,000
people panic buy and hoard and stockpile

681
0:32:21.73,000 --> 0:32:25,000
supermarket goods or drugs or what have

682
0:32:24.7,000 --> 0:32:29,000
you or they don't keep their social

683
0:32:26.53,000 --> 0:32:32,000
distance then we all suffer the whole

684
0:32:29.94,000 --> 0:32:34,000
thing suffers that's why everyone is in

685
0:32:32.83,000 --> 0:32:36,000
lockdown in Britain today because people

686
0:32:35.32,000 --> 0:32:39,000
weren't following the rules so the whole

687
0:32:37.69,000 --> 0:32:42,000
common good disappears because a few

688
0:32:40.12,000 --> 0:32:46,000
people pursue their own interests the

689
0:32:42.76,000 --> 0:32:48,000
truth is that in the fullness of time

690
0:32:46.179,000 --> 0:32:5,000
somebody's going to take their own back

691
0:32:48.91,000 --> 0:32:52,000
on those non-compliance individuals

692
0:32:51.04,000 --> 0:32:56,000
because everyone suffers though do get

693
0:32:53.679,000 --> 0:32:59,000
involved and less getting involved means

694
0:32:57.01,000 --> 0:33:02,000
getting less than 6 feet close to them

695
0:32:59.95,000 --> 0:33:08,000
which case look after your own health

696
0:33:02.05,000 --> 0:33:09,000
first get involved but stay back yeah

697
0:33:12.82,000 --> 0:33:18,000
carry on go ahead oh no go ahead go

698
0:33:15.309,000 --> 0:33:21,000
ahead I was just going to say I think

699
0:33:19.36,000 --> 0:33:23,000
it's worth if we will take care of

700
0:33:21.49,000 --> 0:33:26,000
ourselves and our own behaviors the

701
0:33:24.039,000 --> 0:33:29,000
for really applying ourselves to others

702
0:33:26.679,000 --> 0:33:3,000
of course you know that that's kind of

703
0:33:29.289,000 --> 0:33:32,000
how we can at least contribute

704
0:33:31.299,000 --> 0:33:35,000
meaningfully to what's happening in

705
0:33:33.1,000 --> 0:33:38,000
society what they say on the plane first

706
0:33:36.22,000 --> 0:33:42,000
fix your own bars before fixing someone

707
0:33:38.679,000 --> 0:33:45,000
else's that's right I mean the numbers

708
0:33:42.399,000 --> 0:33:47,000
that were seeing rabbi up so I watering

709
0:33:45.85,000 --> 0:33:49,000
Li horrifying we're seeing them coming

710
0:33:48.1,000 --> 0:33:52,000
out of countries such as Italy they're

711
0:33:50.32,000 --> 0:33:54,000
happening in the US right now it's the

712
0:33:52.389,000 --> 0:33:56,000
one thing that seems clear is that death

713
0:33:54.369,000 --> 0:33:58,000
will be full of all going to have a

714
0:33:56.71,000 --> 0:34:01,000
closer connection to death do know than

715
0:33:59.139,000 --> 0:34:03,000
later and generally death I mean of

716
0:34:01.84,000 --> 0:34:04,000
course it comes for us all but generally

717
0:34:03.549,000 --> 0:34:07,000
death is more of a personal experience

718
0:34:05.529,000 --> 0:34:09,000
you know we kind of we we deal with it

719
0:34:07.659,000 --> 0:34:11,000
in our own ways and I don't think in

720
0:34:10.119,000 --> 0:34:14,000
this generation we've had to deal with

721
0:34:11.71,000 --> 0:34:16,000
death at this scale how like what words

722
0:34:15.04,000 --> 0:34:2,000
of advice or wisdom do you have to share

723
0:34:17.53,000 --> 0:34:21,000
to help us as we all collectively have

724
0:34:20.26,000 --> 0:34:24,000
to manage it not with the records and

725
0:34:22.24,000 --> 0:34:28,000
our families but you know the direct

726
0:34:24.73,000 --> 0:34:32,000
deaths of many millions potentially of

727
0:34:28.99,000 --> 0:34:34,000
people around the world it's terribly

728
0:34:33.339,000 --> 0:34:37,000
scary what's happening and the scale of

729
0:34:35.319,000 --> 0:34:41,000
what's happening but in some respects is

730
0:34:38.319,000 --> 0:34:45,000
even worse because I mean I had to do a

731
0:34:41.919,000 --> 0:34:46,000
funeral we could to we go work you know

732
0:34:46.24,000 --> 0:34:48,000
the normally there would have been

733
0:34:47.23,000 --> 0:34:51,000
hundreds of people a well-known

734
0:34:48.79,000 --> 0:34:54,000
well-loved individual everyone would

735
0:34:51.429,000 --> 0:34:57,000
have wanted to come to see them off and

736
0:34:55.26,000 --> 0:35:,000
almost nobody was there because it was

737
0:34:57.97,000 --> 0:35:01,000
much of a health risk we have something

738
0:35:00.79,000 --> 0:35:04,000
called sitting Shiva you sit for seven

739
0:35:02.68,000 --> 0:35:06,000
days and people friends and family come

740
0:35:05.53,000 --> 0:35:08,000
and comfort you they can't do that

741
0:35:07.359,000 --> 0:35:11,000
anymore they can only do that through

742
0:35:08.829,000 --> 0:35:13,000
social media so even the traditional

743
0:35:11.97,000 --> 0:35:16,000
comforts that we had in the face of

744
0:35:14.38,000 --> 0:35:2,000
death are being removed from us the end

745
0:35:17.349,000 --> 0:35:23,000
result is that we will be left with a

746
0:35:21.22,000 --> 0:35:26,000
trauma that will probably stay with us

747
0:35:23.74,000 --> 0:35:29,000
to the end of our days people will never

748
0:35:27.069,000 --> 0:35:32,000
forget world war two those who lived

749
0:35:29.859,000 --> 0:35:33,000
through it people will certainly live

750
0:35:32.2,000 --> 0:35:35,000
never forget the Holocaust those who

751
0:35:34.45,000 --> 0:35:38,000
lived through it we

752
0:35:35.94,000 --> 0:35:44,000
we'll never forget this we will live

753
0:35:39.319,000 --> 0:35:49,000
despite this we will just say as Moses

754
0:35:45.42,000 --> 0:35:51,000
said you know choose life you know

755
0:35:49.56,000 --> 0:35:53,000
nothing can make with that loss we are

756
0:35:52.14,000 --> 0:35:55,000
going to lose people who are very

757
0:35:53.79,000 --> 0:35:58,000
precious to us we're going to lose

758
0:35:56.04,000 --> 0:36:03,000
people who are very close to us and and

759
0:35:59.609,000 --> 0:36:05,000
and we are not going to we're not going

760
0:36:03.66,000 --> 0:36:09,000
to try and diminish that pain that pain

761
0:36:06.359,000 --> 0:36:16,000
is real and we have to feel it and then

762
0:36:10.23,000 --> 0:36:18,000
we have to get up the next day I think

763
0:36:16.38,000 --> 0:36:2,000
it's also going to be strange to to kind

764
0:36:18.54,000 --> 0:36:22,000
of re adapt should we be lucky enough to

765
0:36:20.94,000 --> 0:36:24,000
be able to readapt at the end of this

766
0:36:22.859,000 --> 0:36:26,000
like already you kind of you know you go

767
0:36:25.079,000 --> 0:36:3,000
outside it's so quiet like how are we

768
0:36:27.06,000 --> 0:36:32,000
going to do it that's when this is over

769
0:36:30.81,000 --> 0:36:33,000
or are we even going to what are we

770
0:36:32.43,000 --> 0:36:36,000
going to readjust to it's you know it's

771
0:36:34.77,000 --> 0:36:38,000
difficult to know in this time but

772
0:36:36.75,000 --> 0:36:41,000
christe's you're back with questions

773
0:36:39.2,000 --> 0:36:45,000
well there's a there's a provocative

774
0:36:42.15,000 --> 0:36:48,000
question yeah which I'm introduced to

775
0:36:45.329,000 --> 0:36:5,000
how you respond to it from Facebook

776
0:36:48.66,000 --> 0:36:52,000
rabbi it may not be coincidental that

777
0:36:50.67,000 --> 0:36:55,000
the pandemic happened before Passover

778
0:36:53.52,000 --> 0:36:58,000
Easter what do you think the meaning of

779
0:36:56.609,000 --> 0:37:,000
this plague is in the context of what

780
0:36:58.829,000 --> 0:37:03,000
happened millennia ago in Egypt is the

781
0:37:01.44,000 --> 0:37:06,000
whole humanity getting out of the

782
0:37:03.96,000 --> 0:37:12,000
tyranny of materialism of symbolic Egypt

783
0:37:07.109,000 --> 0:37:15,000
they go no sorry I I'm not going to have

784
0:37:13.56,000 --> 0:37:22,000
the whole world eating unleavened bread

785
0:37:15.3,000 --> 0:37:25,000
after this if you want a real answer if

786
0:37:22.829,000 --> 0:37:31,000
you can handle this close bit of

787
0:37:25.76,000 --> 0:37:33,000
biblical exegesis I would say this if

788
0:37:32.339,000 --> 0:37:39,000
you read the exodus account there are

789
0:37:34.349,000 --> 0:37:39,000
ten plagues the first two the water

790
0:37:39.839,000 --> 0:37:4,000
turned

791
0:37:40.339,000 --> 0:37:45,000
two blood and the country is full of

792
0:37:41.749,000 --> 0:37:48,000
frogs the Egyptian magicians can

793
0:37:45.349,000 --> 0:37:51,000
replicate though they say that's nothing

794
0:37:48.799,000 --> 0:37:54,000
that's that's just magic the third

795
0:37:51.499,000 --> 0:38:01,000
plague is a plague of lice of

796
0:37:54.91,000 --> 0:38:02,000
microscopic little organisms now on this

797
0:38:01.789,000 --> 0:38:05,000
one the Egyptian magicians can't

798
0:38:03.71,000 --> 0:38:08,000
replicate it and they say to Pharaoh at

799
0:38:06.41,000 --> 0:38:13,000
Spa Elohim hook it's the finger of God

800
0:38:09.369,000 --> 0:38:15,000
now this is the Bible making fun of

801
0:38:13.719,000 --> 0:38:18,000
Egyptian civilization Egyptian

802
0:38:16.099,000 --> 0:38:21,000
civilization said what's divine is

803
0:38:18.89,000 --> 0:38:23,000
massive look at the temples look at the

804
0:38:21.739,000 --> 0:38:26,000
Great Pyramid of Giza for four thousand

805
0:38:24.319,000 --> 0:38:3,000
years the highest man-made structure on

806
0:38:27.17,000 --> 0:38:33,000
earth and along comes plank 3 this tiny

807
0:38:31.309,000 --> 0:38:34,000
microscopic little organism and brings

808
0:38:33.92,000 --> 0:38:38,000
Egypt to its knees

809
0:38:35.239,000 --> 0:38:42,000
it's what TS Eliot meant when he said I

810
0:38:39.44,000 --> 0:38:44,000
will show you fear in a handful of dust

811
0:38:42.249,000 --> 0:38:48,000
though if I were to take any biblical

812
0:38:44.9,000 --> 0:38:51,000
significance it would not be in the

813
0:38:48.859,000 --> 0:38:53,000
context of the book of Exodus but it

814
0:38:52.19,000 --> 0:38:57,000
would be in the sense of teaching all of

815
0:38:54.499,000 --> 0:39:,000
this humility this tiny little

816
0:38:58.099,000 --> 0:39:04,000
microscopic virus has brought humanity

817
0:39:01.369,000 --> 0:39:06,000
to its knees despite all our wealth all

818
0:39:04.099,000 --> 0:39:1,000
our scientific expertise and all our

819
0:39:07.279,000 --> 0:39:15,000
technological prowess let us have a

820
0:39:10.099,000 --> 0:39:16,000
little humility from Iran but what would

821
0:39:15.319,000 --> 0:39:18,000
you say to someone whose takes almost

822
0:39:16.759,000 --> 0:39:21,000
the opposite stance and say that

823
0:39:18.979,000 --> 0:39:23,000
actually to try to understand this

824
0:39:22.099,000 --> 0:39:26,000
remotely in terms of ancient myths and

825
0:39:24.499,000 --> 0:39:29,000
stories and know that that whole

826
0:39:26.509,000 --> 0:39:3,000
worldview has as kind of failed in the

827
0:39:29.599,000 --> 0:39:33,000
current context the only story we should

828
0:39:31.369,000 --> 0:39:35,000
be paying attention to is the story of

829
0:39:34.16,000 --> 0:39:38,000
science the story of knowledge the story

830
0:39:36.079,000 --> 0:39:41,000
of learning that random horrifying

831
0:39:38.869,000 --> 0:39:42,000
things can happen on the planet can

832
0:39:41.299,000 --> 0:39:49,000
spread out of control and that and that

833
0:39:43.609,000 --> 0:39:51,000
yes we may maybe we can get a sense of

834
0:39:49.7,000 --> 0:39:52,000
community and connection from religion

835
0:39:51.619,000 --> 0:39:56,000
but in terms of an explanation of

836
0:39:53.609,000 --> 0:39:58,000
happen to get it we must pay more

837
0:39:56.88,000 --> 0:40:01,000
attention to science I do percent

838
0:39:59.43,000 --> 0:40:03,000
totally and absolutely fair I wrote a

839
0:40:02.7,000 --> 0:40:05,000
book on this called the great

840
0:40:04.289,000 --> 0:40:07,000
partnerships they don't think of

841
0:40:05.91,000 --> 0:40:08,000
religion and science there's two

842
0:40:07.499,000 --> 0:40:11,000
opposite things the greatest rabbi of

843
0:40:09.48,000 --> 0:40:13,000
the Middle Ages Moses Maimonides was one

844
0:40:11.849,000 --> 0:40:15,000
of the greatest doctors of the Middle

845
0:40:13.92,000 --> 0:40:18,000
Ages author of eight medical textbooks I

846
0:40:16.23,000 --> 0:40:21,000
think it's a religious imperative to

847
0:40:19.23,000 --> 0:40:24,000
study medicine to develop new cures to

848
0:40:22.019,000 --> 0:40:26,000
save life thereby and the idea that

849
0:40:24.509,000 --> 0:40:29,000
religion is a substitute for science is

850
0:40:26.849,000 --> 0:40:32,000
outrageous I'm sorry I have no patience

851
0:40:29.519,000 --> 0:40:34,000
for that view whatsoever okay and

852
0:40:32.999,000 --> 0:40:36,000
finally another question about your

853
0:40:34.89,000 --> 0:40:39,000
Confederate devices society I mean it is

854
0:40:37.559,000 --> 0:40:42,000
divisive it's us versus them the how do

855
0:40:40.049,000 --> 0:40:45,000
you dialogue with people on the other

856
0:40:42.599,000 --> 0:40:49,000
side who are only used to talking with

857
0:40:45.059,000 --> 0:40:52,000
people who agree with them it's called

858
0:40:49.68,000 --> 0:40:54,000
role reversal I think to myself you know

859
0:40:52.41,000 --> 0:40:56,000
I mean somebody asked me what do you say

860
0:40:55.41,000 --> 0:40:59,000
to a guy who's just coming out of the

861
0:40:57.119,000 --> 0:41:02,000
supermarket with I don't know hundred

862
0:40:59.759,000 --> 0:41:04,000
rolls of toilet paper you know and

863
0:41:02.489,000 --> 0:41:07,000
leaving this old lady behind with

864
0:41:05.099,000 --> 0:41:09,000
nothing in her basket I said what I

865
0:41:07.589,000 --> 0:41:12,000
would say to him is just think what she

866
0:41:10.079,000 --> 0:41:15,000
is thinking right now put yourself in

867
0:41:12.9,000 --> 0:41:18,000
her position that's the simplest way of

868
0:41:15.749,000 --> 0:41:22,000
learning how to be moral I know now what

869
0:41:19.14,000 --> 0:41:25,000
I saw in the United States just defy

870
0:41:23.249,000 --> 0:41:29,000
belief you had what one month ago

871
0:41:25.41,000 --> 0:41:32,000
a poll that said that 45% of Americans

872
0:41:29.599,000 --> 0:41:34,000
no longer talked politics through a

873
0:41:32.64,000 --> 0:41:36,000
close friend or a member of the family

874
0:41:34.799,000 --> 0:41:38,000
because they are worried that that would

875
0:41:37.349,000 --> 0:41:41,000
break up the relationship and I'm

876
0:41:39.269,000 --> 0:41:45,000
thinking to myself oh we suddenly become

877
0:41:41.759,000 --> 0:41:46,000
soldiers though such super heroes that

878
0:41:45.869,000 --> 0:41:5,000
we can dispense with the need for

879
0:41:47.64,000 --> 0:41:53,000
empathy - the need to understand how the

880
0:41:51.21,000 --> 0:41:54,000
world looks like from somebody who's

881
0:41:53.759,000 --> 0:41:56,000
looking at it from another perspective

882
0:41:54.93,000 --> 0:42:,000
from us but for heaven's sake it's

883
0:41:57.72,000 --> 0:42:03,000
ridiculous civilization depends and

884
0:42:01.049,000 --> 0:42:06,000
morality depends on our being able to

885
0:42:03.869,000 --> 0:42:08,000
see through other people's eyes

886
0:42:06.52,000 --> 0:42:1,000
and that and you know I'm gonna quote

887
0:42:09.22,000 --> 0:42:15,000
the Bible at you Chris

888
0:42:10.6,000 --> 0:42:17,000
do not arm a stranger because you know

889
0:42:15.7,000 --> 0:42:2,000
what it feels like to be a stranger

890
0:42:18.43,000 --> 0:42:22,000
you will want strangers in the land of

891
0:42:20.98,000 --> 0:42:25,000
Egypt you know what it feels like to be

892
0:42:23.29,000 --> 0:42:3,000
on the other side we need that in

893
0:42:26.11,000 --> 0:42:32,000
politics right now Thank You rabbi and a

894
0:42:30.58,000 --> 0:42:38,000
percent agree on that point for sure

895
0:42:32.74,000 --> 0:42:41,000
I'll be back home at the end okay the

896
0:42:38.8,000 --> 0:42:43,000
rabbi you turn to religious texts

897
0:42:42.13,000 --> 0:42:47,000
obviously for comfort and sucker what

898
0:42:44.5,000 --> 0:42:51,000
advice do you have for those who don't

899
0:42:47.53,000 --> 0:42:56,000
have spiritual beliefs I don't have

900
0:42:52.36,000 --> 0:42:58,000
spiritual beliefs poetry and music those

901
0:42:56.98,000 --> 0:43:,000
are the finest expressions of the human

902
0:42:59.14,000 --> 0:43:04,000
spirit you know just just read

903
0:43:01.72,000 --> 0:43:08,000
Shakespeare's sonnets read Wordsworth

904
0:43:04.38,000 --> 0:43:09,000
read gates read whoever you know and

905
0:43:09.72,000 --> 0:43:15,000
look musing is such a personal taste and

906
0:43:14.29,000 --> 0:43:18,000
when I try and get all away from M&M

907
0:43:16.42,000 --> 0:43:2,000
does lead raw dared and so on you know

908
0:43:18.85,000 --> 0:43:23,000
but I never know what what speaks to

909
0:43:21.07,000 --> 0:43:26,000
people but their words the language of

910
0:43:24.58,000 --> 0:43:28,000
the mind and music is language of the

911
0:43:26.83,000 --> 0:43:3,000
soul and don't tell me that there are

912
0:43:29.38,000 --> 0:43:35,000
too many human beings who can't be moved

913
0:43:31.03,000 --> 0:43:4,000
by music there are some a very few so

914
0:43:36.03,000 --> 0:43:42,000
basically that's it poetry and music I'm

915
0:43:40.33,000 --> 0:43:44,000
just I'm not gonna lie rabbi I have

916
0:43:42.64,000 --> 0:43:46,000
great delight in seeing you rocking out

917
0:43:44.59,000 --> 0:43:49,000
- mmm that gives me great pleasure thank

918
0:43:47.38,000 --> 0:43:53,000
you for that yeah lose yourself let's

919
0:43:50.05,000 --> 0:43:57,000
think that once a day you know though

920
0:43:53.95,000 --> 0:43:59,000
you mentioned Shiva earlier and I know

921
0:43:57.31,000 --> 0:44:03,000
also that you have or you have had up

922
0:44:00.04,000 --> 0:44:06,000
until now a family Sabbath meal every

923
0:44:03.49,000 --> 0:44:09,000
Friday what part of what role can ritual

924
0:44:06.94,000 --> 0:44:12,000
play at this moment and how how are you

925
0:44:09.49,000 --> 0:44:16,000
redefining ritual in a virtual world

926
0:44:13.32,000 --> 0:44:18,000
well number one we get together with the

927
0:44:16.54,000 --> 0:44:21,000
family on a

928
0:44:18.789,000 --> 0:44:22,000
program that it was named I forget is it

929
0:44:21.579,000 --> 0:44:25,000
guestroom or something something like

930
0:44:23.199,000 --> 0:44:27,000
that some subsidiary of zoom I don't

931
0:44:26.259,000 --> 0:44:31,000
know they're all on the screen together

932
0:44:27.999,000 --> 0:44:32,000
and we have family times when we just

933
0:44:31.419,000 --> 0:44:36,000
come together as a family so everyone's

934
0:44:33.489,000 --> 0:44:37,000
there and of course our grandchildren

935
0:44:36.549,000 --> 0:44:4,000
love this stuff they grow up with this

936
0:44:38.319,000 --> 0:44:43,000
stuff they add all sorts of special

937
0:44:40.869,000 --> 0:44:45,000
effects while we're talking and that's

938
0:44:43.689,000 --> 0:44:48,000
number one number two obviously

939
0:44:46.349,000 --> 0:44:52,000
physically we can't be with them on what

940
0:44:49.39,000 --> 0:44:54,000
we can't be with them . but especially

941
0:44:52.749,000 --> 0:44:57,000
on friday night which is family time so

942
0:44:55.059,000 --> 0:44:59,000
we have one of those electronic picture

943
0:44:58.209,000 --> 0:45:01,000
frames you know where you can store lots

944
0:44:59.89,000 --> 0:45:04,000
of pictures they change every few

945
0:45:02.079,000 --> 0:45:08,000
seconds so as we are bringing in the

946
0:45:04.929,000 --> 0:45:1,000
sabbath I'm and I stand by that picture

947
0:45:08.319,000 --> 0:45:14,000
frame I would just stand there looking

948
0:45:11.14,000 --> 0:45:17,000
at our grandchildren you know and it's

949
0:45:14.89,000 --> 0:45:17,000
very very moving I have to tell you

950
0:45:17.439,000 --> 0:45:25,000
though you know

951
0:45:18.669,000 --> 0:45:34,000
we managed where do you see hope or

952
0:45:26.229,000 --> 0:45:4,000
light in this moment hello because I was

953
0:45:35.279,000 --> 0:45:44,000
chief rabbi for a long time I got to

954
0:45:40.63,000 --> 0:45:45,000
know Holocaust survivors I wanted to

955
0:45:44.439,000 --> 0:45:47,000
know how did they carry on living you

956
0:45:46.179,000 --> 0:45:5,000
know and some of them didn't you know

957
0:45:48.219,000 --> 0:45:53,000
some of them committed suicide even even

958
0:45:50.919,000 --> 0:45:59,000
even Premal lovely committed suicide in

959
0:45:53.89,000 --> 0:46:03,000
his 80 and I just thought after they

960
0:45:59.919,000 --> 0:46:06,000
survived and then I thought of is Israel

961
0:46:03.909,000 --> 0:46:1,000
Christo who died a couple of years of

962
0:46:07.9,000 --> 0:46:14,000
about three years ago one month short of

963
0:46:11.799,000 --> 0:46:18,000
his hundred and 14th birthday the

964
0:46:15.13,000 --> 0:46:23,000
world's oldest living man a Holocaust

965
0:46:19.509,000 --> 0:46:27,000
survivor who had his Bar Mitzvah on his

966
0:46:24.099,000 --> 0:46:32,000
hundred and 13th birthday lived in

967
0:46:28.14,000 --> 0:46:35,000
lived in - he made chocolate he liked

968
0:46:32.45,000 --> 0:46:38,000
making people have made the cured

969
0:46:35.49,000 --> 0:46:41,000
chocolate EDA Seger you know wrote the

970
0:46:39.36,000 --> 0:46:45,000
book the choice survivor of Auschwitz

971
0:46:42.42,000 --> 0:46:48,000
survivor of the death march which was

972
0:46:45.75,000 --> 0:46:51,000
worse than Auschwitz who writes her

973
0:46:48.99,000 --> 0:46:52,000
first book at the age of 90 called the

974
0:46:52.02,000 --> 0:46:58,000
choice and it's an international

975
0:46:53.54,000 --> 0:47:01,000
bestseller and she emerges as a female

976
0:46:58.41,000 --> 0:47:05,000
Viktor Frankl who used her pain at

977
0:47:02.43,000 --> 0:47:11,000
Auschwitz to speak to and heal the pain

978
0:47:06.21,000 --> 0:47:14,000
of others I look at the photograph last

979
0:47:12.12,000 --> 0:47:16,000
summer of a lady in Israel called

980
0:47:15.06,000 --> 0:47:21,000
Shoshana Ovitz

981
0:47:17.09,000 --> 0:47:24,000
another outreach survivor celebrating

982
0:47:21.18,000 --> 0:47:25,000
her hundred and fourth birthday and she

983
0:47:24.42,000 --> 0:47:27,000
invited her family our children

984
0:47:26.13,000 --> 0:47:3,000
grandchildren great-grandchildren to

985
0:47:28.17,000 --> 0:47:32,000
come together to celebrate with her they

986
0:47:30.72,000 --> 0:47:37,000
took a photograph of them against the

987
0:47:32.43,000 --> 0:47:4,000
western wall there were almost 400 I

988
0:47:38.06,000 --> 0:47:43,000
thought what courage does it take to

989
0:47:40.5,000 --> 0:47:46,000
bring 400 lives into a world that you

990
0:47:43.14,000 --> 0:47:49,000
know contains out and I've just studied

991
0:47:47.04,000 --> 0:47:53,000
these I haven't read philosophical

992
0:47:49.53,000 --> 0:47:56,000
theories I just studied these these

993
0:47:53.13,000 --> 0:47:59,000
people lived from day to day their firm

994
0:47:57.21,000 --> 0:48:03,000
life they celebrate life they look

995
0:47:59.49,000 --> 0:48:05,000
forward they wrestle with their memories

996
0:48:03.45,000 --> 0:48:11,000
and they try not to late load them on

997
0:48:05.82,000 --> 0:48:17,000
others and they are joyous people but a

998
0:48:12.24,000 --> 0:48:21,000
very hard one joy a lot of jagged edges

999
0:48:17.9,000 --> 0:48:23,000
and I always think if they could get

1000
0:48:21.3,000 --> 0:48:3,000
through what they had to go through so

1001
0:48:24.54,000 --> 0:48:33,000
can I beautiful and I think that will

1002
0:48:31.14,000 --> 0:48:36,000
speak to to the many parents I'm sure

1003
0:48:33.57,000 --> 0:48:38,000
who were watching and listening and

1004
0:48:36.87,000 --> 0:48:4,000
worrying about the fact that children

1005
0:48:39.09,000 --> 0:48:43,000
are home or

1006
0:48:41.349,000 --> 0:48:45,000
children are not having an education

1007
0:48:43.22,000 --> 0:48:49,000
right now any other thoughts that you

1008
0:48:46.13,000 --> 0:48:51,000
have about how to how to involve and

1009
0:48:49.279,000 --> 0:48:53,000
include children in this moment without

1010
0:48:51.76,000 --> 0:48:57,000
filling them with the fear that I think

1011
0:48:54.049,000 --> 0:49:01,000
so many of us are feeling well I've seen

1012
0:48:57.92,000 --> 0:49:03,000
some very innovative approaches in

1013
0:49:01.609,000 --> 0:49:07,000
education classroom virtual classrooms

1014
0:49:04.52,000 --> 0:49:1,000
and the teachers seem to be working

1015
0:49:08.569,000 --> 0:49:13,000
through the idea that you have to keep

1016
0:49:11,000 --> 0:49:16,000
kids physically active quite a lot cuz

1017
0:49:14.329,000 --> 0:49:18,000
it's quite difficult to sit still in

1018
0:49:16.7,000 --> 0:49:21,000
your own house in your own front room

1019
0:49:18.74,000 --> 0:49:24,000
and it gets quite boring so they seem to

1020
0:49:22.64,000 --> 0:49:27,000
have worked out more interactive and

1021
0:49:25.309,000 --> 0:49:31,000
more active lessons learning through

1022
0:49:28.22,000 --> 0:49:36,000
game playing in some cases and and that

1023
0:49:31.49,000 --> 0:49:38,000
seems to work I would also think you

1024
0:49:37.01,000 --> 0:49:42,000
know around Easter around Passover to

1025
0:49:39.319,000 --> 0:49:45,000
get children to you know do a little

1026
0:49:42.64,000 --> 0:49:48,000
Passover or the word you know a little

1027
0:49:46.279,000 --> 0:49:52,000
poem a little play a little something on

1028
0:49:49.549,000 --> 0:49:54,000
you know filmed on your smartphone and

1029
0:49:52.46,000 --> 0:49:57,000
send it to their grandparents

1030
0:49:54.619,000 --> 0:50:02,000
make them feel that they're the teachers

1031
0:49:58.299,000 --> 0:50:09,000
are just the pupils and how much do you

1032
0:50:03.529,000 --> 0:50:11,000
advise honesty with children as it

1033
0:50:09.65,000 --> 0:50:13,000
sounds but how much do we involve

1034
0:50:11.869,000 --> 0:50:15,000
children in in what is happening here

1035
0:50:14.539,000 --> 0:50:18,000
there's so much uncertainty around and

1036
0:50:16.72,000 --> 0:50:2,000
children don't necessarily thrive on

1037
0:50:19.25,000 --> 0:50:23,000
uncertainty but at the same time you

1038
0:50:21.65,000 --> 0:50:25,000
don't necessarily want to disguise the

1039
0:50:23.66,000 --> 0:50:27,000
fact that this is you know do put odd

1040
0:50:26.059,000 --> 0:50:29,000
for everybody how do you how do you

1041
0:50:28.22,000 --> 0:50:34,000
think about talking to children about

1042
0:50:29.96,000 --> 0:50:36,000
what's happening it's found out anyway

1043
0:50:35.2,000 --> 0:50:4,000
they're extremely well informed these

1044
0:50:37.849,000 --> 0:50:42,000
days there are such times you have to be

1045
0:50:40.67,000 --> 0:50:45,000
very open and honest you have to answer

1046
0:50:42.859,000 --> 0:50:48,000
questions you have to never ever induce

1047
0:50:46.279,000 --> 0:50:49,000
fear or uncertainty you have to say it's

1048
0:50:49.25,000 --> 0:50:52,000
gonna be okay

1049
0:50:50.15,000 --> 0:50:54,000
we're all in this together okay we're

1050
0:50:52.339,000 --> 0:50:57,000
going to come through this

1051
0:50:54.65,000 --> 0:50:59,000
you've got you've got to explain to them

1052
0:50:57.6,000 --> 0:51:02,000
why they have to keep certain distances

1053
0:51:00.51,000 --> 0:51:06,000
that they can't go to certain places or

1054
0:51:03.05,000 --> 0:51:1,000
children respond to discipline when it

1055
0:51:06.6,000 --> 0:51:11,000
is accompanied with explanation but I've

1056
0:51:10.44,000 --> 0:51:16,000
never known that keeping things from

1057
0:51:12.51,000 --> 0:51:19,000
from children is terribly helpful and

1058
0:51:17.25,000 --> 0:51:22,000
and they're getting so much more mature

1059
0:51:19.65,000 --> 0:51:24,000
so much earlier these days and so much

1060
0:51:22.44,000 --> 0:51:27,000
better informed that it's better for

1061
0:51:25.02,000 --> 0:51:3,000
them to confront their fears for you to

1062
0:51:28.17,000 --> 0:51:32,000
confront their fears and to reassure

1063
0:51:30.63,000 --> 0:51:36,000
them and that reassurance must be

1064
0:51:33.09,000 --> 0:51:41,000
rock-solid not the slightest room for

1065
0:51:37.53,000 --> 0:51:46,000
doubt there what happens if you don't

1066
0:51:41.43,000 --> 0:51:5,000
feel rock-solid have to for their sake

1067
0:51:46.77,000 --> 0:51:53,000
something about that and once you've

1068
0:51:50.97,000 --> 0:51:57,000
done it you will feel rock-solid it's

1069
0:51:53.85,000 --> 0:52:,000
the way you combat fear you know when

1070
0:51:58.56,000 --> 0:52:04,000
you have to be fearless the sake of your

1071
0:52:00.99,000 --> 0:52:06,000
children you become fearless it's a very

1072
0:52:05.03,000 --> 0:52:11,000
strengthening and reinforcing phenomena

1073
0:52:07.62,000 --> 0:52:14,000
and you know at such moments families

1074
0:52:11.43,000 --> 0:52:21,000
huddle together in very beautiful ways

1075
0:52:15.51,000 --> 0:52:24,000
and you know I remember that but it

1076
0:52:22.2,000 --> 0:52:28,000
wasn't the same in any way but when our

1077
0:52:24.78,000 --> 0:52:29,000
kids were young we were in Israel for

1078
0:52:28.38,000 --> 0:52:32,000
the whole of the first Gulf War

1079
0:52:30.23,000 --> 0:52:34,000
thirty-nine Scud missiles any one of

1080
0:52:32.91,000 --> 0:52:35,000
which could have contained

1081
0:52:34.26,000 --> 0:52:39,000
chemical or bacterial weapons we had

1082
0:52:36.75,000 --> 0:52:42,000
these very big gas masks it was very

1083
0:52:39.93,000 --> 0:52:5,000
scary for all of them but you know he

1084
0:52:43.14,000 --> 0:52:53,000
were very together as a family then just

1085
0:52:51.27,000 --> 0:52:54,000
as you know the it looks like the online

1086
0:52:53.19,000 --> 0:52:57,000
audience has been super appreciative and

1087
0:52:55.08,000 --> 0:52:59,000
somewhat you know they've learned so

1088
0:52:57.54,000 --> 0:53:,000
much from you and there's an interesting

1089
0:52:59.16,000 --> 0:53:03,000
question here this week get towards the

1090
0:53:01.29,000 --> 0:53:06,000
end of this hour together a broken

1091
0:53:04.05,000 --> 0:53:07,000
Beauty play in helping us manage our

1092
0:53:06.6,000 --> 0:53:09,000
lives at this time

1093
0:53:07.74,000 --> 0:53:11,000
in connecting with Beauty help us or is

1094
0:53:10.17,000 --> 0:53:19,000
that a luxury when people are suffering

1095
0:53:12.359,000 --> 0:53:22,000
and dying very I'm thinking I'm not a

1096
0:53:19.77,000 --> 0:53:24,000
great beauty guy you know sort of fairly

1097
0:53:22.68,000 --> 0:53:27,000
ugly sort of guy but I'm trying to

1098
0:53:25.23,000 --> 0:53:31,000
wrestle with him Swan Chris I'm thinking

1099
0:53:28.05,000 --> 0:53:33,000
you know of Rhino Maria Rilke z-- line

1100
0:53:31.349,000 --> 0:53:36,000
in the first of the Duino elegies beauty

1101
0:53:34.02,000 --> 0:53:42,000
is the beginning of terror that we are

1102
0:53:36.93,000 --> 0:53:44,000
just able to bear so so Rilke seem to

1103
0:53:42.24,000 --> 0:53:46,000
say that that that beauty is this side

1104
0:53:45.599,000 --> 0:53:5,000
of fear

1105
0:53:46.68,000 --> 0:53:53,000
Maimonides says that beauty is a

1106
0:53:51.32,000 --> 0:53:54,000
wonderful antidote to anxiety and

1107
0:53:54.21,000 --> 0:53:57,000
depression

1108
0:53:55.07,000 --> 0:54:02,000
I just love bleeding for the sake of

1109
0:53:58.109,000 --> 0:54:04,000
loving beauty but some I also believe

1110
0:54:02.43,000 --> 0:54:07,000
and I don't know whether this resonates

1111
0:54:04.14,000 --> 0:54:1,000
with anyone but I don't know if you've

1112
0:54:08.25,000 --> 0:54:13,000
listened for instance the late quartets

1113
0:54:10.71,000 --> 0:54:17,000
of Beethoven and in particular the late

1114
0:54:13.43,000 --> 0:54:21,000
music of Schubert the last three

1115
0:54:18.119,000 --> 0:54:25,000
quartets and me and the quintet and to

1116
0:54:21.48,000 --> 0:54:28,000
me Schubert is taking pain and turning

1117
0:54:25.47,000 --> 0:54:31,000
it into beauty and therefore whenever

1118
0:54:28.65,000 --> 0:54:33,000
I'd felt pain or fear I tend to listen

1119
0:54:31.77,000 --> 0:54:36,000
to those late Schubert quartets or the

1120
0:54:33.72,000 --> 0:54:4,000
quintet and you takes you on this

1121
0:54:37.53,000 --> 0:54:42,000
journey from from pain to beauty and and

1122
0:54:40.92,000 --> 0:54:44,000
you feel transformed by the experience

1123
0:54:43.44,000 --> 0:54:47,000
so I'm not sure if musical beauty was

1124
0:54:45.75,000 --> 0:54:49,000
what your question I was asking about

1125
0:54:47.66,000 --> 0:54:53,000
but Beauty is much to be recommended at

1126
0:54:50.46,000 --> 0:54:55,000
such a time I mean is it is it fair to

1127
0:54:53.67,000 --> 0:54:58,000
say that beauty is connected quite

1128
0:54:55.83,000 --> 0:55:01,000
closely to two other words yearning

1129
0:54:59.099,000 --> 0:55:03,000
which is in the case of music I think

1130
0:55:01.83,000 --> 0:55:05,000
you outline there very eloquently that

1131
0:55:04.02,000 --> 0:55:08,000
that feeling of this is beautiful but

1132
0:55:05.9,000 --> 0:55:1,000
it's it's painful it's like is

1133
0:55:08.76,000 --> 0:55:13,000
expressing a pain in me you know that

1134
0:55:11.52,000 --> 0:55:15,000
that is there's a sort of almost a

1135
0:55:13.77,000 --> 0:55:18,000
contradiction there that is powerful but

1136
0:55:15.99,000 --> 0:55:2,000
then another word as well of gratitude

1137
0:55:19.07,000 --> 0:55:23,000
thanks for me

1138
0:55:21.329,000 --> 0:55:27,000
when you just take a moment I don't know

1139
0:55:23.219,000 --> 0:55:29,000
to get outside if you can and be a piece

1140
0:55:27.359,000 --> 0:55:3,000
of nature or see something that moment

1141
0:55:29.309,000 --> 0:55:32,000
is saying oh my goodness that's

1142
0:55:30.779,000 --> 0:55:33,000
beautiful oh my goodness

1143
0:55:32.339,000 --> 0:55:36,000
now that I think about it I do have

1144
0:55:34.589,000 --> 0:55:38,000
other things to be grateful for that

1145
0:55:36.779,000 --> 0:55:42,000
there's some there's some sort of mental

1146
0:55:38.7,000 --> 0:55:44,000
health nourishment in that can I tell

1147
0:55:43.019,000 --> 0:55:48,000
you a story do we have a moment do we

1148
0:55:44.729,000 --> 0:55:51,000
have time tell us tell us your story hmm

1149
0:55:48.63,000 --> 0:55:54,000
this our honeymoon 50 years ago and we

1150
0:55:52.44,000 --> 0:55:57,000
were a little Italian town called

1151
0:55:54.93,000 --> 0:56:,000
paestum has some Roman ruins but it also

1152
0:55:57.959,000 --> 0:56:04,000
has a beach lovely beach and this

1153
0:56:01.769,000 --> 0:56:07,000
glorious day and I long to go into the

1154
0:56:05.549,000 --> 0:56:11,000
water except for the fact that I can't

1155
0:56:07.799,000 --> 0:56:13,000
swim my and I was looking at the people

1156
0:56:11.94,000 --> 0:56:14,000
and there were about 200 yards out but

1157
0:56:14.4,000 --> 0:56:17,000
they were only up to their knees so I

1158
0:56:15.9,000 --> 0:56:19,000
said to Elaine I'm gonna paddle out up

1159
0:56:17.999,000 --> 0:56:21,000
to my knees and that'll be that so I

1160
0:56:20.249,000 --> 0:56:25,000
paddled out up to my knees then I turned

1161
0:56:22.829,000 --> 0:56:27,000
around and started coming back and

1162
0:56:25.799,000 --> 0:56:32,000
suddenly I found myself out of my depth

1163
0:56:28.309,000 --> 0:56:36,000
there was no one near and as I went

1164
0:56:33.479,000 --> 0:56:4,000
under for the fifth time I remember

1165
0:56:36.779,000 --> 0:56:43,000
thinking to thoughts number one what a

1166
0:56:41.249,000 --> 0:56:48,000
way to start a honeymoon and number two

1167
0:56:44.279,000 --> 0:56:48,000
um what's the Italian for help

1168
0:56:49.459,000 --> 0:56:53,000
damn how are others somebody must have

1169
0:56:51.809,000 --> 0:56:56,000
seen me because somebody rescued me to

1170
0:56:54.239,000 --> 0:56:58,000
this day I know who deposited me pretty

1171
0:56:56.819,000 --> 0:57:,000
much unconscious at Elaine's feet and

1172
0:56:58.769,000 --> 0:57:04,000
that was a honey but ever since then I

1173
0:57:01.709,000 --> 0:57:07,000
have said with special concentration the

1174
0:57:05.009,000 --> 0:57:09,000
first prayer that you say in the morning

1175
0:57:07.739,000 --> 0:57:11,000
before they do anything else

1176
0:57:09.119,000 --> 0:57:14,000
modere Anila for Nava thank you God for

1177
0:57:12.119,000 --> 0:57:17,000
giving me back my life that's what I

1178
0:57:15.029,000 --> 0:57:2,000
feel every day the point I'm making

1179
0:57:17.369,000 --> 0:57:21,000
though is the first word we say I'm

1180
0:57:20.369,000 --> 0:57:26,000
waking up in the morning is more death

1181
0:57:22.349,000 --> 0:57:29,000
thank in Judaism we thanked before we

1182
0:57:26.729,000 --> 0:57:31,000
think and I commend this to everyone

1183
0:57:29.819,000 --> 0:57:33,000
right now think of the wonderful things

1184
0:57:32.369,000 --> 0:57:38,000
to say thank you for

1185
0:57:34.48,000 --> 0:57:4,000
and they will lift your spirit and I'll

1186
0:57:38.38,000 --> 0:57:44,000
ask one last question from a line you

1187
0:57:40.66,000 --> 0:57:46,000
know you spoke of a just world could you

1188
0:57:44.68,000 --> 0:57:49,000
elaborate on that what what does that

1189
0:57:47.14,000 --> 0:57:54,000
just world look like and what steps

1190
0:57:50.25,000 --> 0:57:57,000
maybe just one key step do get there

1191
0:57:54.42,000 --> 0:58:03,000
well you know I my main thoughts are

1192
0:57:58.15,000 --> 0:58:07,000
about individual Nations I think we

1193
0:58:03.609,000 --> 0:58:1,000
really have reached the outer limits of

1194
0:58:07.23,000 --> 0:58:13,000
inequality I don't know did you see that

1195
0:58:11.05,000 --> 0:58:17,000
that South Korean film that won the

1196
0:58:13.48,000 --> 0:58:19,000
Oscar what was it called parasite I

1197
0:58:17.109,000 --> 0:58:21,000
don't know if you squawk the American

1198
0:58:19.84,000 --> 0:58:22,000
film that had most nominations called

1199
0:58:21.97,000 --> 0:58:26,000
the Joker

1200
0:58:23.25,000 --> 0:58:31,000
lately different films but both of them

1201
0:58:27.15,000 --> 0:58:36,000
cries of anger from the people who are

1202
0:58:31.81,000 --> 0:58:37,000
left out towards the people who are at

1203
0:58:36.16,000 --> 0:58:41,000
the top of society and they are violent

1204
0:58:38.74,000 --> 0:58:43,000
films both of them really violent films

1205
0:58:41.17,000 --> 0:58:47,000
and I can't imagine either of them being

1206
0:58:44.17,000 --> 0:58:48,000
made in the past in quite that way there

1207
0:58:47.38,000 --> 0:58:5,000
could have been a lot of anger in the

1208
0:58:49.119,000 --> 0:58:54,000
30s and 40s but it would have been

1209
0:58:51.04,000 --> 0:58:58,000
working class solidarity type anger not

1210
0:58:54.25,000 --> 0:59:01,000
individual revenge type anger so I think

1211
0:58:58.69,000 --> 0:59:04,000
we need economic justice we cannot have

1212
0:59:01.83,000 --> 0:59:08,000
X million of people in the States and

1213
0:59:05.41,000 --> 0:59:12,000
then elsewhere outside adequate health

1214
0:59:09.55,000 --> 0:59:16,000
service we can't have gross inequalities

1215
0:59:13.3,000 --> 0:59:19,000
touch that whether whether you're Robert

1216
0:59:17.2,000 --> 0:59:21,000
Putnam on the sort of middling left or

1217
0:59:19.54,000 --> 0:59:23,000
Charles Mauri on the far right they are

1218
0:59:22.15,000 --> 0:59:26,000
saying the American dream no longer

1219
0:59:24.04,000 --> 0:59:28,000
plays anymore the social mobility has

1220
0:59:26.44,000 --> 0:59:29,000
declined those things

1221
0:59:28.18,000 --> 0:59:33,000
I mean Ray Dalio you remember Ray Dalio

1222
0:59:30.4,000 --> 0:59:34,000
was we were part of the same TED

1223
0:59:33.369,000 --> 0:59:38,000
Conference together

1224
0:59:35.01,000 --> 0:59:4,000
Ray Dalio last year called income

1225
0:59:38.38,000 --> 0:59:43,000
inequality in the States a national

1226
0:59:40.93,000 --> 0:59:45,000
emergency and an existential threat to

1227
0:59:44.05,000 --> 0:59:48,000
the future of America though it is that

1228
0:59:46.59,000 --> 0:59:5,000
individual justice

1229
0:59:48.4,000 --> 0:59:53,000
that I can make sense of the more global

1230
0:59:50.73,000 --> 0:59:57,000
justice is a really difficult one

1231
0:59:53.5,000 --> 0:59:59,000
because how do you reform failed and

1232
0:59:58.24,000 --> 1:00:03,000
failing States how do you deal with

1233
1:00:00.09,000 --> 1:00:07,000
corrupt rulers and and and essentially

1234
1:00:04.03,000 --> 1:00:1,000
corrupt economies so you know for these

1235
1:00:07.78,000 --> 1:00:09,000
I wish I had an answer I'd I really

1236
1:00:10.18,000 --> 1:00:12,000
don't

1237
1:00:10.69,000 --> 1:00:13,000
I've discussed them with people who

1238
1:00:12.4,000 --> 1:00:16,000
should have an answer and they can you

1239
1:00:14.62,000 --> 1:00:18,000
know with people from the World Bank and

1240
1:00:16.63,000 --> 1:00:21,000
what have you and they find it very

1241
1:00:19.51,000 --> 1:00:23,000
difficult to give me an answer so I'll

1242
1:00:21.76,000 --> 1:00:26,000
settle for local national justice and

1243
1:00:24.34,000 --> 1:00:31,000
for the rest needs a bigger brain than I

1244
1:00:27.43,000 --> 1:00:33,000
have means you hold any hope about the

1245
1:00:31.51,000 --> 1:00:37,000
fact that the reset we're all facing

1246
1:00:34.15,000 --> 1:00:39,000
right now is so dramatic that it will

1247
1:00:38.23,000 --> 1:00:41,000
force this kind of thinking the kind of

1248
1:00:39.73,000 --> 1:00:43,000
radical rethinking that we need to do

1249
1:00:41.56,000 --> 1:00:46,000
about you know and we have the time to

1250
1:00:43.96,000 --> 1:00:5,000
do it and the the almost sort of the the

1251
1:00:47.34,000 --> 1:00:54,000
absolute essential need to do it to

1252
1:00:51.22,000 --> 1:00:56,000
rethink these things that the people

1253
1:00:54.88,000 --> 1:00:59,000
will do it in in a million conversations

1254
1:00:57.13,000 --> 1:01:04,000
around the world that we basically we

1255
1:01:00.31,000 --> 1:01:05,000
reassess what really matters and the

1256
1:01:04.18,000 --> 1:01:08,000
words you've just used are a powerful

1257
1:01:06.12,000 --> 1:01:12,000
motive for up for us to do that can can

1258
1:01:09.04,000 --> 1:01:16,000
this actually happen I think Chris you

1259
1:01:12.22,000 --> 1:01:18,000
you yourself have a very very important

1260
1:01:16.39,000 --> 1:01:21,000
platform to play as I don't think this

1261
1:01:18.94,000 --> 1:01:24,000
is coming together will necessarily

1262
1:01:22.18,000 --> 1:01:27,000
happen through conventional political

1263
1:01:25.06,000 --> 1:01:3,000
avenues but it can come together through

1264
1:01:28.15,000 --> 1:01:33,000
platforms like Ted it can come together

1265
1:01:30.88,000 --> 1:01:35,000
through you know were World Health

1266
1:01:33.48,000 --> 1:01:38,000
Organization's and scientific

1267
1:01:35.98,000 --> 1:01:41,000
cooperation and so on the kind that that

1268
1:01:39.16,000 --> 1:01:45,000
we are still waiting for on on climate

1269
1:01:42.49,000 --> 1:01:47,000
change I think we have reached the point

1270
1:01:45.85,000 --> 1:01:49,000
at which though our politics are all

1271
1:01:47.95,000 --> 1:01:52,000
national our problems are almost all

1272
1:01:50.8,000 --> 1:01:56,000
global and there is a big mismatch and

1273
1:01:53.91,000 --> 1:01:58,000
hence I think Ted has a very very

1274
1:01:57.22,000 --> 1:02:02,000
important role to play in this

1275
1:01:59.67,000 --> 1:02:04,000
well we usually appreciate you coming

1276
1:02:02.61,000 --> 1:02:09,000
and showing these words that was

1277
1:02:04.68,000 --> 1:02:12,000
something thank you thank you great to

1278
1:02:10.41,000 --> 1:02:14,000
be with you I always said remember Chris

1279
1:02:12.78,000 --> 1:02:21,000
you get the best speakers cuz you're the

1280
1:02:14.67,000 --> 1:02:23,000
best listeners watching this thank you

1281
1:02:22.14,000 --> 1:02:27,000
for being great listeners and for I mean

1282
1:02:24.42,000 --> 1:02:3,000
with this son this journey of you know

1283

Greg Gage: It's an age-old pursuit of all parents,

3
0:00:14.806,000 --> 0:00:16,000
getting their kids to eat their vegetables.

4
0:00:16.832,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But getting them to eat cookies or ice cream

5
0:00:18.905,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is relatively easy,

6
0:00:20.08,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and that's because our brains prefer sweetness.

7
0:00:22.345,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now, there's a new technology called optogenetics

8
0:00:24.784,000 --> 0:00:26,000
which may be able to trick our taste buds,

9
0:00:26.83,000 --> 0:00:28,000
for instance preferring vegetables over sweets.

10
0:00:29.467,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We're going to try this today using fruit flies.

[DIY Neuroscience]

12
0:00:35.086,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The reason why we experiment with fruit flies

13
0:00:37.22,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is they have a small enough nervous system

14
0:00:39.255,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that gives us a fighting chance to really understand what's going on.

15
0:00:42.521,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And believe it or not, their taste buds are very similar to ours.

16
0:00:45.624,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But before we try to manipulate their taste preferences,

17
0:00:48.307,000 --> 0:00:5,000
we need to establish: What is the baseline of the fruit fly?

18
0:00:51.185,000 --> 0:00:52,000
What does it prefer?

19
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We call this a control experiment.

20
0:00:54.272,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Spencer's been hard at work doing this.

21
0:00:56.499,000 --> 0:00:58,000
OK, Spencer, let's do our first experiment.

22
0:00:58.587,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We want to test to see if fruit flies prefer bananas or broccoli.

23
0:01:01.905,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So what do we need?

24
0:01:03.476,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Spencer Brown: So we need the fly pad, which is basically an iPad for flies.

25
0:01:07.097,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It measures the touch.

26
0:01:08.304,000 --> 0:01:09,000
GG: You put a fly in each chamber?

27
0:01:10.288,000 --> 0:01:12,000
SB: Yeah. Inside, we'll offer them banana and broccoli

28
0:01:13.211,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to see which one they prefer.

29
0:01:14.621,000 --> 0:01:15,000
GG: In order to count how many times

30
0:01:16.424,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the fruit fly eats a banana versus the broccoli,

31
0:01:18.926,000 --> 0:01:2,000
these chambers have been outfitted with a small electrode

32
0:01:21.662,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that sends data to a computer.

33
0:01:23.276,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And so what were your findings on banana versus broccoli?

34
0:01:26.442,000 --> 0:01:28,000
SB: I found that the flies visited banana the most.

35
0:01:29.003,000 --> 0:01:3,000
GG: Both were there, but like most kids,

36
0:01:30.951,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they choose not to eat the broccoli, and they go switch to something sweeter.

37
0:01:35.258,000 --> 0:01:37,000
GG: Now a quick background on how taste works.

38
0:01:37.464,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Taste buds are made up of specialized neurons

39
0:01:39.669,000 --> 0:01:4,000
called taste receptors.

40
0:01:40.861,000 --> 0:01:42,000
When we eat something that triggers a particular taste,

41
0:01:43.535,000 --> 0:01:45,000
those taste neurons will fire a signal to the brain.

42
0:01:46.058,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This allows our brain to know what's sweet and what's bitter.

43
0:01:49.002,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So when a fruit fly eats a banana, its sweet taste neurons will fire.

44
0:01:52.362,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But when it eats broccoli, those same neurons stay pretty quiet.

45
0:01:55.867,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But what if we could force those sweet-tasting neurons to fire

46
0:01:58.865,000 --> 0:01:59,000
every time the fruit fly eats broccoli?

47
0:02:00.755,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We may be able to get the fruit fly

48
0:02:02.497,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to like broccoli as much as banana.

49
0:02:04.268,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Enter optogenetics.

50
0:02:05.529,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This is the revolutionary new tool that's taking neuroscience by storm,

51
0:02:08.925,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and in this case, "opto" means light

52
0:02:11.267,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and "genetic" refers to the fact that these fruit flies have been modified

53
0:02:14.822,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to contain a special gene that makes only certain neurons respond to light.

54
0:02:18.671,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In our case, we've added the special gene to the sweet taste receptors.

55
0:02:22.734,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now here's the fun part.

56
0:02:23.94,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Optogenetics means that we can control these special neurons

57
0:02:27.018,000 --> 0:02:29,000
whenever they're exposed to a bright-colored light,

58
0:02:29.651,000 --> 0:02:31,000
causing them to send messages to the brain.

59
0:02:31.864,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In this experiment, we're going to have these modified fruit flies

60
0:02:35.027,000 --> 0:02:37,000
choose between banana and broccoli again,

61
0:02:37.066,000 --> 0:02:39,000
only this time, every time the fruit fly eats the broccoli,

62
0:02:39.931,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we're going to trigger a big bright red light.

63
0:02:42.146,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And when the channels see that red light, they're going to open up,

64
0:02:45.32,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and they're going to cause that neuron to fire,

65
0:02:47.484,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the sweet taste message will be sent to the brain.

66
0:02:50.032,000 --> 0:02:51,000
How do you get them out?

67
0:02:51.3,000 --> 0:02:53,000
SB: So we're going to be using a mouth aspirator,

68
0:02:53.698,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so it's just two straws put together.

69
0:02:55.563,000 --> 0:02:56,000
GG: So it's a fancy name for a straw.

70
0:02:57.396,000 --> 0:02:58,000
SB: Basically.

71
0:02:58.571,000 --> 0:02:59,000
GG: So you're going to suck those out.

72
0:03:01.822,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Have you ever sucked up a fly before?

73
0:03:03.678,000 --> 0:03:04,000
SB: Once or twice.

74
0:03:10.432,000 --> 0:03:11,000
GG: There we go. You got all four.

75
0:03:12.106,000 --> 0:03:13,000
OK, perfect.

76
0:03:13.281,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So you're going to turn on your OptoStimmers here.

77
0:03:15.725,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You're going to park the light right on top of the chambers.

78
0:03:18.883,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So now we sit here and we wait for them to eat broccoli,

79
0:03:21.732,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and then when the light fires,

80
0:03:23.716,000 --> 0:03:25,000
they're going to think it's tasting something sweet.

81
0:03:26.255,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Come on. Oh, he's getting closer.

82
0:03:28.241,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Come on. It tastes good now.

83
0:03:30.193,000 --> 0:03:31,000
SB: It's about to.

84
0:03:31.736,000 --> 0:03:32,000
GG: Oh, he's back. All right!

85
0:03:33.268,000 --> 0:03:36,000
All right, so now we see that some of these flies

86
0:03:36.586,000 --> 0:03:38,000
are switching over from the banana to the broccoli.

87
0:03:39.435,000 --> 0:03:4,000
SB: Exactly, yeah.

88
0:03:40.625,000 --> 0:03:41,000
GG: Every time this light goes off,

89
0:03:42.332,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that means that they think they're tasting something sweet.

90
0:03:45.143,000 --> 0:03:47,000
SB: Yeah. So this guy's really going after it.

91
0:03:47.338,000 --> 0:03:49,000
GG: So we saw that we were able to rescue broccoli

92
0:03:49.536,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and make it just as appealing as banana to our fruit flies.

93
0:03:52.433,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And we're able to replicate these same results

94
0:03:54.711,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in all of our experiments.

95
0:03:56.068,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So the question is: Can we do the same thing in humans?

96
0:03:58.692,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Well, that depends on a number of items.

97
0:04:00.621,000 --> 0:04:03,000
First, do optogenetic tools even work in humans?

98
0:04:04.107,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And that looks like the answer is yes,

99
0:04:06.134,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and in fact, clinical trials are already being planned

100
0:04:08.74,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that will treat chronic pain and blindness using optogenetics.

101
0:04:12.294,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the next question is, can we easily trigger a light source

102
0:04:15.309,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so that every time we eat vegetables, it will go off?

103
0:04:17.857,000 --> 0:04:2,000
For that, I'm afraid at least at this time, the answer is still no.

104
0:04:21.319,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But today, we got to witness just a taste of optogenetics

105
0:04:24.672,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and its amazing potential.

106
0:04:26.11,000 --> 0:04:32,000

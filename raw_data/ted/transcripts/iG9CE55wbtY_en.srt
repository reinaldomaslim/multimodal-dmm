1
0:00:27.103,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Good morning. How are you?

2
0:00:29.702,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Audience) Good.

3
0:00:31.129,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's been great, hasn't it?

4
0:00:33.408,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

5
0:00:35.753,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In fact, I'm leaving.

6
0:00:37.269,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:43.096,000 --> 0:00:46,000
There have been three themes running through the conference,

8
0:00:46.687,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which are relevant to what I want to talk about.

9
0:00:48.997,000 --> 0:00:52,000
One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity

10
0:00:53.491,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in all of the presentations that we've had

11
0:00:55.928,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and in all of the people here;

12
0:00:57.904,000 --> 0:00:59,000
just the variety of it and the range of it.

13
0:01:01.158,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The second is that it's put us in a place

14
0:01:03.325,000 --> 0:01:05,000
where we have no idea what's going to happen

15
0:01:05.846,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in terms of the future.

16
0:01:07.261,000 --> 0:01:09,000
No idea how this may play out.

17
0:01:10.27,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I have an interest in education.

18
0:01:11.916,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education.

19
0:01:16.352,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Don't you?

20
0:01:17.693,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I find this very interesting.

21
0:01:19.119,000 --> 0:01:22,000
If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education --

22
0:01:23.101,000 --> 0:01:25,000
actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.

23
0:01:25.87,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:29.69,000 --> 0:01:31,000
If you work in education, you're not asked.

25
0:01:32.142,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:35.345,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me.

27
0:01:39.328,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But if you are, and you say to somebody,

28
0:01:41.568,000 --> 0:01:42,000
you know, they say, "What do you do?"

29
0:01:43.37,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and you say you work in education,

30
0:01:45.082,000 --> 0:01:47,000
you can see the blood run from their face.

31
0:01:47.155,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They're like, "Oh my God. Why me?"

32
0:01:48.864,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:51.164,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"My one night out all week."

34
0:01:52.712,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:55.346,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall,

36
0:01:58.611,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right?

37
0:02:02.042,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Like religion and money and other things.

38
0:02:05.559,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.

39
0:02:10.025,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We have a huge vested interest in it,

40
0:02:11.851,000 --> 0:02:14,000
partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future

41
0:02:15.195,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that we can't grasp.

42
0:02:16.873,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If you think of it,

43
0:02:18.063,000 --> 0:02:24,000
children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065.

44
0:02:25.272,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Nobody has a clue,

45
0:02:26.867,000 --> 0:02:29,000
despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days,

46
0:02:30.45,000 --> 0:02:32,000
what the world will look like in five years' time.

47
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it.

48
0:02:35.318,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.

49
0:02:37.892,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,

50
0:02:41.344,000 --> 0:02:46,000
on the really extraordinary capacities that children have --

51
0:02:46.673,000 --> 0:02:48,000
their capacities for innovation.

52
0:02:49.032,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she?

53
0:02:51.845,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Just seeing what she could do.

54
0:02:53.539,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak,

55
0:02:59.112,000 --> 0:03:01,000
exceptional in the whole of childhood.

56
0:03:02.041,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication

57
0:03:04.896,000 --> 0:03:05,000
who found a talent.

58
0:03:06.091,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents,

59
0:03:08.701,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.

60
0:03:11.119,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So I want to talk about education,

61
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and I want to talk about creativity.

62
0:03:14.896,000 --> 0:03:2,000
My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy,

63
0:03:21.016,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and we should treat it with the same status.

64
0:03:23.827,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Applause)

65
0:03:24.963,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Thank you.

66
0:03:26.176,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Applause)

67
0:03:30.485,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That was it, by the way. Thank you very much.

68
0:03:32.795,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:34.934,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So, 15 minutes left.

70
0:03:36.635,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:39.816,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"Well, I was born ... "

72
0:03:41.511,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:45.006,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it --

74
0:03:47.68,000 --> 0:03:49,000
of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.

75
0:03:50.075,000 --> 0:03:52,000
She was six, and she was at the back, drawing,

76
0:03:52.274,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention,

77
0:03:55.058,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and in this drawing lesson, she did.

78
0:03:56.868,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The teacher was fascinated.

79
0:03:58.232,000 --> 0:04:,000
She went over to her, and she said, "What are you drawing?"

80
0:04:01.045,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And the girl said, "I'm drawing a picture of God."

81
0:04:04.642,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And the teacher said, "But nobody knows what God looks like."

82
0:04:07.984,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And the girl said, "They will in a minute."

83
0:04:10.096,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:21.662,000 --> 0:04:23,000
When my son was four in England --

85
0:04:24.413,000 --> 0:04:26,000
actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.

86
0:04:26.628,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:28.404,000 --> 0:04:31,000
If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.

88
0:04:31.815,000 --> 0:04:33,000
He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?

89
0:04:34.477,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:35.72,000 --> 0:04:36,000
No, it was big, it was a big story.

91
0:04:37.571,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.

92
0:04:39.9,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:41.185,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"Nativity II."

94
0:04:42.77,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about.

95
0:04:46.678,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We considered this to be one of the lead parts.

96
0:04:49.608,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts:

97
0:04:52.119,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"James Robinson IS Joseph!"

98
0:04:53.557,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:54.614,000 --> 0:04:57,000
He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in?

100
0:04:58.266,000 --> 0:05:,000
They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh.

101
0:05:00.975,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This really happened.

102
0:05:02.157,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence,

103
0:05:05.297,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because we talked to the little boy afterward and said,

104
0:05:07.9,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"You OK with that?" They said, "Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"

105
0:05:10.72,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They just switched.

106
0:05:11.9,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads.

107
0:05:15.234,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, "I bring you gold."

108
0:05:18.58,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And the second boy said, "I bring you myrrh."

109
0:05:20.878,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."

110
0:05:22.984,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:35.711,000 --> 0:05:38,000
What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.

112
0:05:38.825,000 --> 0:05:41,000
If they don't know, they'll have a go.

113
0:05:42.331,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong.

114
0:05:45.924,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.

115
0:05:49.886,000 --> 0:05:52,000
What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong,

116
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
you'll never come up with anything original --

117
0:05:55.391,000 --> 0:05:57,000
if you're not prepared to be wrong.

118
0:05:57.995,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.

119
0:06:02.462,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They have become frightened of being wrong.

120
0:06:04.95,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And we run our companies like this.

121
0:06:06.664,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We stigmatize mistakes.

122
0:06:08.34,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And we're now running national education systems

123
0:06:10.666,000 --> 0:06:12,000
where mistakes are the worst thing you can make.

124
0:06:13.8,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And the result is that we are educating people

125
0:06:16.932,000 --> 0:06:18,000
out of their creative capacities.

126
0:06:19.298,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.

127
0:06:23.749,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.

128
0:06:26.995,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity,

129
0:06:30.251,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we grow out of it.

130
0:06:31.98,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Or rather, we get educated out of it.

131
0:06:34.607,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So why is this?

132
0:06:37.124,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.

133
0:06:39.931,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.

134
0:06:42.912,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was.

135
0:06:45.56,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield,

137
0:06:49.4,000 --> 0:06:5,000
just outside Stratford,

138
0:06:50.675,000 --> 0:06:52,000
which is where Shakespeare's father was born.

139
0:06:53.334,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Are you struck by a new thought? I was.

140
0:06:55.481,000 --> 0:06:57,000
You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?

141
0:06:58.1,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Do you?

142
0:06:59.497,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?

143
0:07:02.412,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Shakespeare being seven?

144
0:07:03.7,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I never thought of it.

145
0:07:04.9,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I mean, he was seven at some point.

146
0:07:06.616,000 --> 0:07:08,000
He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?

147
0:07:08.906,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:15.717,000 --> 0:07:16,000
How annoying would that be?

149
0:07:17.07,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:24.939,000 --> 0:07:25,000
"Must try harder."

151
0:07:26.303,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:30.559,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!"

153
0:07:33.564,000 --> 0:07:34,000
To William Shakespeare.

154
0:07:34.746,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"And put the pencil down!"

155
0:07:36.041,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:37.14,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"And stop speaking like that."

157
0:07:38.641,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:42.244,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"It's confusing everybody."

159
0:07:43.592,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:48.886,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles,

161
0:07:54.096,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and I just want to say a word about the transition.

162
0:07:56.596,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Actually, my son didn't want to come.

163
0:07:58.422,000 --> 0:08:,000
I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.

164
0:08:00.841,000 --> 0:08:02,000
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.

165
0:08:03.068,000 --> 0:08:06,000
He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England.

166
0:08:06.88,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This was the love of his life, Sarah.

167
0:08:09.761,000 --> 0:08:1,000
He'd known her for a month.

168
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:12.534,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary,

170
0:08:15.837,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because it's a long time when you're 16.

171
0:08:17.797,000 --> 0:08:18,000
He was really upset on the plane.

172
0:08:19.462,000 --> 0:08:21,000
He said, "I'll never find another girl like Sarah."

173
0:08:21.893,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And we were rather pleased about that, frankly --

174
0:08:24.231,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:32.434,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.

176
0:08:35.404,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:41.141,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But something strikes you when you move to America

178
0:08:43.527,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and travel around the world:

179
0:08:44.918,000 --> 0:08:47,000
every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.

180
0:08:48.589,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.

181
0:08:50.516,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't.

182
0:08:52.81,000 --> 0:08:54,000
At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities.

183
0:08:55.815,000 --> 0:08:57,000
At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth.

184
0:08:58.13,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts.

185
0:09:02.519,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools

186
0:09:05.4,000 --> 0:09:06,000
than drama and dance.

187
0:09:06.852,000 --> 0:09:08,000
There isn't an education system on the planet

188
0:09:08.983,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that teaches dance every day to children

189
0:09:10.926,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the way we teach them mathematics.

190
0:09:12.6,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Why?

191
0:09:13.782,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Why not?

192
0:09:14.973,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I think this is rather important.

193
0:09:16.591,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I think math is very important, but so is dance.

194
0:09:18.879,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do.

195
0:09:21.783,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?

196
0:09:24.257,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

197
0:09:27.645,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up,

198
0:09:29.99,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we start to educate them progressively from the waist up.

199
0:09:32.728,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And then we focus on their heads.

200
0:09:34.378,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And slightly to one side.

201
0:09:37.044,000 --> 0:09:39,000
If you were to visit education as an alien

202
0:09:39.139,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and say "What's it for, public education?"

203
0:09:42.144,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output,

204
0:09:44.895,000 --> 0:09:45,000
who really succeeds by this,

205
0:09:46.276,000 --> 0:09:47,000
who does everything they should,

206
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners --

207
0:09:50.755,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education

208
0:09:54.017,000 --> 0:09:55,000
throughout the world

209
0:09:55.239,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is to produce university professors.

210
0:09:57.718,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Isn't it?

211
0:09:58.91,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They're the people who come out the top.

212
0:10:00.918,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I used to be one, so there.

213
0:10:02.761,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:06.482,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And I like university professors,

215
0:10:08.106,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up

216
0:10:10.045,000 --> 0:10:12,000
as the high-water mark of all human achievement.

217
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They're just a form of life.

218
0:10:15.137,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Another form of life.

219
0:10:16.584,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But they're rather curious.

220
0:10:18.005,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And I say this out of affection for them:

221
0:10:19.993,000 --> 0:10:21,000
there's something curious about professors.

222
0:10:22.092,000 --> 0:10:25,000
In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads.

223
0:10:25.862,000 --> 0:10:27,000
They live up there and slightly to one side.

224
0:10:28.495,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.

225
0:10:31.955,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.

226
0:10:35.129,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

227
0:10:41.2,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Don't they?

228
0:10:42.601,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's a way of getting their head to meetings.

229
0:10:44.77,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Laughter)

230
0:10:50.022,000 --> 0:10:53,000
If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way,

231
0:10:53.968,000 --> 0:10:56,000
get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics

232
0:10:57.467,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and pop into the discotheque on the final night.

233
0:10:59.842,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Laughter)

234
0:11:02.478,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And there, you will see it.

235
0:11:03.858,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.

236
0:11:08.375,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:10.891,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it.

238
0:11:14.24,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

239
0:11:16.245,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability.

240
0:11:20.13,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And there's a reason.

241
0:11:21.325,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Around the world, there were no public systems of education,

242
0:11:24.978,000 --> 0:11:26,000
really, before the 19th century.

243
0:11:27.109,000 --> 0:11:3,000
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism.

244
0:11:30.38,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.

245
0:11:32.456,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top.

246
0:11:37.042,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school

247
0:11:40.099,000 --> 0:11:41,000
when you were a kid,

248
0:11:41.275,000 --> 0:11:42,000
things you liked,

249
0:11:42.452,000 --> 0:11:44,000
on the grounds you would never get a job doing that.

250
0:11:44.918,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Is that right?

251
0:11:46.093,000 --> 0:11:48,000
"Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician;

252
0:11:48.529,000 --> 0:11:49,000
don't do art, you won't be an artist."

253
0:11:50.404,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.

254
0:11:53.174,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.

255
0:11:55.343,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And the second is academic ability,

256
0:11:57.464,000 --> 0:11:59,000
which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence,

257
0:12:00.307,000 --> 0:12:02,000
because the universities design the system in their image.

258
0:12:03.07,000 --> 0:12:04,000
If you think of it,

259
0:12:04.245,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process

260
0:12:07.933,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of university entrance.

261
0:12:09.108,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And the consequence is that many highly talented,

262
0:12:11.425,000 --> 0:12:13,000
brilliant, creative people think they're not,

263
0:12:13.967,000 --> 0:12:15,000
because the thing they were good at at school

264
0:12:16.124,000 --> 0:12:18,000
wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized.

265
0:12:18.45,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And I think we can't afford to go on that way.

266
0:12:20.703,000 --> 0:12:22,000
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,

267
0:12:23.014,000 --> 0:12:26,000
more people worldwide will be graduating through education

268
0:12:26.444,000 --> 0:12:28,000
than since the beginning of history.

269
0:12:28.663,000 --> 0:12:29,000
More people.

270
0:12:29.844,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about:

271
0:12:32.789,000 --> 0:12:34,000
technology and its transformational effect on work,

272
0:12:35.206,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and demography and the huge explosion in population.

273
0:12:37.708,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

274
0:12:40.169,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Isn't that true?

275
0:12:41.87,000 --> 0:12:43,000
When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.

276
0:12:44.875,000 --> 0:12:46,000
If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one.

277
0:12:47.697,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And I didn't want one, frankly.

278
0:12:50.055,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Laughter)

279
0:12:51.67,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But now kids with degrees are often heading home

280
0:12:55.499,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to carry on playing video games,

281
0:12:57.317,000 --> 0:13:,000
because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA,

282
0:13:00.389,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and now you need a PhD for the other.

283
0:13:02.2,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It's a process of academic inflation.

284
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet.

285
0:13:07.78,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.

286
0:13:10.346,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We know three things about intelligence.

287
0:13:12.294,000 --> 0:13:13,000
One, it's diverse.

288
0:13:13.469,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it.

289
0:13:16.474,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically.

290
0:13:19.475,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We think in abstract terms, we think in movement.

291
0:13:21.82,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.

292
0:13:24.673,000 --> 0:13:26,000
If you look at the interactions of a human brain,

293
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations,

294
0:13:30.047,000 --> 0:13:32,000
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

295
0:13:32.229,000 --> 0:13:34,000
The brain isn't divided into compartments.

296
0:13:34.872,000 --> 0:13:35,000
In fact, creativity --

297
0:13:36.47,000 --> 0:13:4,000
which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value --

298
0:13:40.514,000 --> 0:13:41,000
more often than not comes about

299
0:13:42.468,000 --> 0:13:45,000
through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.

300
0:13:47.472,000 --> 0:13:5,000
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain,

301
0:13:51.127,000 --> 0:13:52,000
called the corpus callosum.

302
0:13:52.449,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It's thicker in women.

303
0:13:54.471,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Following off from Helen yesterday,

304
0:13:56.218,000 --> 0:13:59,000
this is probably why women are better at multitasking.

305
0:13:59.253,000 --> 0:14:,000
Because you are, aren't you?

306
0:14:01.102,000 --> 0:14:04,000
There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life.

307
0:14:04.865,000 --> 0:14:06,000
If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ...

308
0:14:09.224,000 --> 0:14:1,000
thankfully.

309
0:14:10.414,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Laughter)

310
0:14:13.128,000 --> 0:14:14,000
No, she's good at some things.

311
0:14:14.604,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone,

312
0:14:17.523,000 --> 0:14:19,000
she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling --

313
0:14:20.194,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Laughter)

314
0:14:21.233,000 --> 0:14:23,000
she's doing open-heart surgery over here.

315
0:14:23.282,000 --> 0:14:25,000
If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out,

316
0:14:26.304,000 --> 0:14:27,000
the phone's on the hook,

317
0:14:27.567,000 --> 0:14:28,000
if she comes in, I get annoyed.

318
0:14:29.281,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I say, "Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here."

319
0:14:32.095,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Laughter)

320
0:14:39.254,000 --> 0:14:4,000
"Give me a break."

321
0:14:40.478,000 --> 0:14:41,000
(Laughter)

322
0:14:42.222,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing,

323
0:14:44.745,000 --> 0:14:47,000
"If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?"

324
0:14:48.252,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Remember that old chestnut?

325
0:14:49.605,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said,

326
0:14:52.539,000 --> 0:14:55,000
"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him,

327
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:57,000
is he still wrong?"

328
0:14:57.42,000 --> 0:15:02,000
(Laughter)

329
0:15:05.089,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And the third thing about intelligence is,

330
0:15:07.152,000 --> 0:15:08,000
it's distinct.

331
0:15:09.114,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I'm doing a new book at the moment called "Epiphany,"

332
0:15:11.642,000 --> 0:15:13,000
which is based on a series of interviews with people

333
0:15:14.107,000 --> 0:15:15,000
about how they discovered their talent.

334
0:15:15.995,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I'm fascinated by how people got to be there.

335
0:15:18.14,000 --> 0:15:21,000
It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman

336
0:15:21.355,000 --> 0:15:23,000
who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.

337
0:15:24.056,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Have you heard of her? Some have.

338
0:15:25.676,000 --> 0:15:27,000
She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work.

339
0:15:28.152,000 --> 0:15:3,000
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."

340
0:15:30.192,000 --> 0:15:31,000
She's wonderful.

341
0:15:31.367,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see.

342
0:15:34.338,000 --> 0:15:35,000
(Laughter)

343
0:15:36.291,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Gillian and I had lunch one day. I said, "How did you get to be a dancer?"

344
0:15:39.84,000 --> 0:15:4,000
It was interesting.

345
0:15:41.015,000 --> 0:15:43,000
When she was at school, she was really hopeless.

346
0:15:43.286,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said,

347
0:15:46.099,000 --> 0:15:48,000
"We think Gillian has a learning disorder."

348
0:15:48.158,000 --> 0:15:5,000
She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting.

349
0:15:50.28,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I think now they'd say she had ADHD.

350
0:15:52.181,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Wouldn't you?

351
0:15:53.504,000 --> 0:15:57,000
But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point.

352
0:15:57.705,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It wasn't an available condition.

353
0:15:59.769,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Laughter)

354
0:16:03.008,000 --> 0:16:05,000
People weren't aware they could have that.

355
0:16:05.074,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Laughter)

356
0:16:07.523,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Anyway, she went to see this specialist.

357
0:16:11.723,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother,

358
0:16:15.454,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and she was led and sat on this chair at the end,

359
0:16:17.805,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes,

360
0:16:19.774,000 --> 0:16:2,000
while this man talked to her mother

361
0:16:21.479,000 --> 0:16:23,000
about all the problems Gillian was having at school,

362
0:16:23.967,000 --> 0:16:26,000
because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on.

363
0:16:27.54,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Little kid of eight.

364
0:16:28.715,000 --> 0:16:3,000
In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said,

365
0:16:31.65,000 --> 0:16:33,000
"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me.

366
0:16:34.387,000 --> 0:16:35,000
I need to speak to her privately.

367
0:16:36.005,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Wait here. We'll be back. We won't be very long,"

368
0:16:38.345,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and they went and left her.

369
0:16:41.019,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But as they went out of the room,

370
0:16:42.683,000 --> 0:16:44,000
he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk.

371
0:16:45.563,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And when they got out of the room,

372
0:16:47.225,000 --> 0:16:49,000
he said to her mother, "Just stand and watch her."

373
0:16:49.627,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And the minute they left the room,

374
0:16:52.163,000 --> 0:16:54,000
she was on her feet, moving to the music.

375
0:16:54.782,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said,

376
0:16:58.309,000 --> 0:16:59,000
"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick.

377
0:17:00.312,000 --> 0:17:01,000
She's a dancer.

378
0:17:03.338,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Take her to a dance school."

379
0:17:04.748,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I said, "What happened?"

380
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:08,000
She said, "She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was.

381
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:11,000
We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me --

382
0:17:11.853,000 --> 0:17:13,000
people who couldn't sit still,

383
0:17:14.099,000 --> 0:17:16,000
people who had to move to think."

384
0:17:17.03,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Who had to move to think.

385
0:17:18.886,000 --> 0:17:21,000
They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary.

386
0:17:22.52,000 --> 0:17:24,000
She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School.

387
0:17:25.29,000 --> 0:17:28,000
She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.

388
0:17:28.567,000 --> 0:17:3,000
She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School,

389
0:17:31.146,000 --> 0:17:32,000
founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,

390
0:17:33.098,000 --> 0:17:34,000
met Andrew Lloyd Webber.

391
0:17:34.359,000 --> 0:17:35,000
She's been responsible for

392
0:17:35.679,000 --> 0:17:38,000
some of the most successful musical theater productions in history,

393
0:17:38.851,000 --> 0:17:39,000
she's given pleasure to millions,

394
0:17:40.471,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and she's a multimillionaire.

395
0:17:41.902,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.

396
0:17:45.636,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Applause)

397
0:17:53.603,000 --> 0:17:54,000
What I think it comes to is this:

398
0:17:55.2,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Al Gore spoke the other night

399
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:01,000
about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson.

400
0:18:02.257,000 --> 0:18:04,000
I believe our only hope for the future

401
0:18:04.393,000 --> 0:18:07,000
is to adopt a new conception of human ecology,

402
0:18:08.292,000 --> 0:18:1,000
one in which we start to reconstitute our conception

403
0:18:10.843,000 --> 0:18:12,000
of the richness of human capacity.

404
0:18:13.128,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Our education system has mined our minds

405
0:18:16.523,000 --> 0:18:19,000
in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity.

406
0:18:20.377,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And for the future, it won't serve us.

407
0:18:22.823,000 --> 0:18:24,000
We have to rethink the fundamental principles

408
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:27,000
on which we're educating our children.

409
0:18:27.087,000 --> 0:18:29,000
There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said,

410
0:18:29.785,000 --> 0:18:34,000
"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth,

411
0:18:34.906,000 --> 0:18:36,000
within 50 years, all life on Earth would end.

412
0:18:38.77,000 --> 0:18:41,000
If all human beings disappeared from the Earth,

413
0:18:41.831,000 --> 0:18:43,000
within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish."

414
0:18:45.378,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And he's right.

415
0:18:47.39,000 --> 0:18:5,000
What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination.

416
0:18:51.533,000 --> 0:18:55,000
We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely,

417
0:18:55.791,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about.

418
0:18:59.044,000 --> 0:19:02,000
And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities

419
0:19:02.823,000 --> 0:19:03,000
for the richness they are

420
0:19:04.634,000 --> 0:19:07,000
and seeing our children for the hope that they are.

421
0:19:07.84,000 --> 0:19:09,000
And our task is to educate their whole being,

422
0:19:10.262,000 --> 0:19:11,000
so they can face this future.

423
0:19:11.699,000 --> 0:19:13,000
By the way -- we may not see this future,

424
0:19:14.228,000 --> 0:19:15,000
but they will.

425
0:19:15.815,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And our job is to help them make something of it.

426
0:19:18.557,000 --> 0:19:19,000
Thank you very much.

427
0:19:19.766,000 --> 0:19:24,000
(Applause)

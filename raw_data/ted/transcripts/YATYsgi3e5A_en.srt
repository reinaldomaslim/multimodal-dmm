1
0:00:13.928,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So ... we're in a real live war at the moment,

2
0:00:18.017,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and it's a war that we're truly losing.

3
0:00:20.97,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's a war on superbugs.

4
0:00:25.692,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So you might wonder,

5
0:00:27.547,000 --> 0:00:29,000
if I'm going to talk about superbugs,

6
0:00:29.629,000 --> 0:00:33,000
why I'm showing you a photograph of some soccer fans --

7
0:00:33.885,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Liverpool soccer fans celebrating a famous victory

8
0:00:37.13,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in Istanbul, a decade ago.

9
0:00:40.233,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In the back, in the red shirt,

10
0:00:42.417,000 --> 0:00:43,000
well, that's me,

11
0:00:44.028,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and next to me in the red hat, that's my friend Paul Rice.

12
0:00:49.168,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So a couple of years after this picture was taken,

13
0:00:52.614,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Paul went into hospital for some minor surgery,

14
0:00:56.475,000 --> 0:01:,000
and he developed a superbug-related infection,

15
0:01:00.772,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and he died.

16
0:01:02.425,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I was truly shocked.

17
0:01:05.198,000 --> 0:01:07,000
He was a healthy guy in the prime of life.

18
0:01:08.535,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So there and then,

19
0:01:09.928,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and actually with a lot of encouragement from a couple of TEDsters,

20
0:01:13.508,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I declared my own personal war on superbugs.

21
0:01:18.365,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So let's talk about superbugs for a moment.

22
0:01:20.735,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The story actually starts in the 1940s

23
0:01:24.143,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with the widespread introduction of antibiotics.

24
0:01:27.925,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And since then,

25
0:01:29.348,000 --> 0:01:33,000
drug-resistant bacteria have continued to emerge,

26
0:01:33.908,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and so we've been forced to develop newer and newer drugs

27
0:01:37.353,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to fight these new bacteria.

28
0:01:40.061,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And this vicious cycle actually is the origin of superbugs,

29
0:01:45.98,000 --> 0:01:49,000
which is simply bacteria for which we don't have effective drugs.

30
0:01:51.474,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I'm sure you'll recognize at least some of these superbugs.

31
0:01:55.052,000 --> 0:01:57,000
These are the more common ones around today.

32
0:01:58.158,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Last year, around 700,000 people died

33
0:02:02.629,000 --> 0:02:04,000
from superbug-related diseases.

34
0:02:05.983,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Looking to the future,

35
0:02:09.316,000 --> 0:02:12,000
if we carry on on the path we're going,

36
0:02:12.476,000 --> 0:02:15,000
which is basically a drugs-based approach to the problem,

37
0:02:16.126,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the best estimate by the middle of this century

38
0:02:18.746,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is that the worldwide death toll from superbugs will be 10 million.

39
0:02:24.126,000 --> 0:02:25,000
10 million.

40
0:02:25.947,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Just to put that in context, that's actually more

41
0:02:28.782,000 --> 0:02:31,000
than the number of people that died of cancer worldwide last year.

42
0:02:32.954,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So it seems pretty clear that we're not on a good road,

43
0:02:37.034,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and the drugs-based approach to this problem is not working.

44
0:02:42.247,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'm a physicist,

45
0:02:44.732,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and so I wondered, could we take a physics-based approach --

46
0:02:48.693,000 --> 0:02:49,000
a different approach to this problem.

47
0:02:51.59,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And in that context,

48
0:02:53.146,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the first thing we know for sure,

49
0:02:55.821,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is that we actually know how to kill every kind of microbe,

50
0:02:59.178,000 --> 0:03:,000
every kind of virus,

51
0:03:00.791,000 --> 0:03:01,000
every kind of bacteria.

52
0:03:02.809,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And that's with ultraviolet light.

53
0:03:05.505,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We've actually known this for more than 100 years.

54
0:03:08.933,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I think you all know what ultraviolet light is.

55
0:03:11.593,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's part of a spectrum that includes infrared,

56
0:03:14.656,000 --> 0:03:15,000
it includes visible light,

57
0:03:16.126,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and the short-wavelength part of this group is ultraviolet light.

58
0:03:21.607,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The key thing from our perspective here

59
0:03:24.72,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is that ultraviolet light kills bacteria by a completely different mechanism

60
0:03:29.932,000 --> 0:03:3,000
from the way drugs kill bacteria.

61
0:03:32.605,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So ultraviolet light is just as capable of killing a drug-resistant bacteria

62
0:03:38.417,000 --> 0:03:4,000
as any other bacteria,

63
0:03:40.665,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and because ultraviolet light is so good at killing all bugs,

64
0:03:45.167,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it's actually used a lot these days to sterilize rooms,

65
0:03:48.326,000 --> 0:03:51,000
sterilize working surfaces.

66
0:03:51.398,000 --> 0:03:53,000
What you see here is a surgical theater

67
0:03:54.25,000 --> 0:03:58,000
being sterilized with germicidal ultraviolet light.

68
0:03:59.578,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But what you don't see in this picture, actually,

69
0:04:02.079,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is any people,

70
0:04:03.768,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and there's a very good reason for that.

71
0:04:06.028,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Ultraviolet light is actually a health hazard,

72
0:04:09.639,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so it can damage cells in our skin,

73
0:04:11.988,000 --> 0:04:12,000
cause skin cancer,

74
0:04:13.443,000 --> 0:04:14,000
it can damage cells in our eye,

75
0:04:14.978,000 --> 0:04:17,000
cause eye diseases like cataract.

76
0:04:18.49,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So you can't use conventional, germicidal, ultraviolet light

77
0:04:21.969,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when there are people are around.

78
0:04:23.722,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And of course,

79
0:04:24.961,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we want to sterilize mostly when there are people around.

80
0:04:28.929,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So the ideal ultraviolet light

81
0:04:31.62,000 --> 0:04:34,000
would actually be able to kill all bacteria,

82
0:04:35.327,000 --> 0:04:36,000
including superbugs,

83
0:04:36.887,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but would be safe for human exposure.

84
0:04:40.312,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And actually that's where my physics background kicked into this story.

85
0:04:45.296,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Together with my physics colleagues,

86
0:04:47.512,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we realized there actually is a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light

87
0:04:53.611,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that should kill all bacteria,

88
0:04:56.128,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but should be safe for human exposure.

89
0:04:58.928,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That wavelength is called far-UVC light,

90
0:05:02.27,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and it's just the short-wavelength part of the ultraviolet spectrum.

91
0:05:07.375,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So let's see how that would work.

92
0:05:10.426,000 --> 0:05:13,000
What you're seeing here is the surface of our skin,

93
0:05:14.259,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I'm going to superimpose on that some bacteria in the air above the skin.

94
0:05:19.536,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now we're going to see what happens

95
0:05:21.227,000 --> 0:05:26,000
when conventional, germicidal, ultraviolet light impinges on this.

96
0:05:27.631,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So what you see is,

97
0:05:28.805,000 --> 0:05:33,000
as we know, germicidal light is really good at killing bacteria,

98
0:05:34.115,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but what you also see

99
0:05:35.449,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is that it penetrates into the upper layers of our skin,

100
0:05:38.816,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and it can damage those key cells in our skin

101
0:05:41.392,000 --> 0:05:44,000
which ultimately, when damaged, can lead to skin cancer.

102
0:05:46.108,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So let's compare now with far-UVC light --

103
0:05:48.98,000 --> 0:05:49,000
same situation,

104
0:05:50.164,000 --> 0:05:52,000
skin and some bacteria in the air above them.

105
0:05:54.342,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So what you're seeing now

106
0:05:55.618,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is that again, far-UVC light's perfectly fine at killing bacteria,

107
0:06:00.438,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but what far-UVC light can't do is penetrate into our skin.

108
0:06:05.318,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And there's a good, solid physics reason for that:

109
0:06:08.057,000 --> 0:06:13,000
far-UVC light is incredibly, strongly absorbed by all biological materials,

110
0:06:13.445,000 --> 0:06:14,000
so it simply can't go very far.

111
0:06:16.68,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now, viruses and bacteria are really, really, really small,

112
0:06:20.661,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so the far-UVC light can certainly penetrate them and kill them,

113
0:06:25.551,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but what it can't do is penetrate into skin,

114
0:06:28.959,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it can't even penetrate the dead-cell area

115
0:06:31.385,000 --> 0:06:32,000
right at the very surface of our skin.

116
0:06:33.815,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So far-UVC light should be able to kill bacteria,

117
0:06:40.161,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but kill them safely.

118
0:06:43.397,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So that's the theory.

119
0:06:44.587,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It should work, should be safe.

120
0:06:47.921,000 --> 0:06:48,000
What about in practice?

121
0:06:49.54,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Does it really work?

122
0:06:50.715,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Is it really safe?

123
0:06:52.599,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So that's actually what our lab has been working on

124
0:06:55.029,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the past five or six years,

125
0:06:57.27,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and I'm delighted to say the answer to both these questions

126
0:07:00.143,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is an emphatic yes.

127
0:07:01.348,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Yes, it does work,

128
0:07:02.652,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but yes, it is safe.

129
0:07:04.46,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So I'm delighted to say that,

130
0:07:06.257,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but actually I'm not very surprised to say that,

131
0:07:08.52,000 --> 0:07:1,000
because it's purely the laws of physics at work.

132
0:07:13.911,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So let's look to the future.

133
0:07:16.07,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I'm thrilled that we now have a completely new weapon,

134
0:07:21.852,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and I should say an inexpensive weapon,

135
0:07:25.34,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in our fight against superbugs.

136
0:07:28.447,000 --> 0:07:29,000
For example,

137
0:07:29.719,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I see far-UVC lights in surgical theaters.

138
0:07:33.629,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I see far-UVC lights in food preparation areas.

139
0:07:38.046,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And in terms of preventing the spread of viruses,

140
0:07:40.93,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I see far-UVC lights in schools,

141
0:07:44.126,000 --> 0:07:46,000
preventing the spread of influenza,

142
0:07:46.673,000 --> 0:07:47,000
preventing the spread of measles,

143
0:07:48.662,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and I see far-UVC lights in airports or airplanes,

144
0:07:52.666,000 --> 0:07:56,000
preventing the global spread of viruses like H1N1 virus.

145
0:07:58.015,000 --> 0:08:,000
So back to my friend Paul Rice.

146
0:08:00.206,000 --> 0:08:03,000
He was actually a well-known and well-loved local politician

147
0:08:04.125,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in his and my hometown of Liverpool,

148
0:08:06.821,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and they put up a statue in his memory in the center of Liverpool,

149
0:08:11.049,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and there it is.

150
0:08:12.368,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But me,

151
0:08:14.582,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I want Paul's legacy to be a major advance in this war against superbugs.

152
0:08:20.002,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Armed with the power of light,

153
0:08:22.091,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that's actually within our grasp.

154
0:08:25.297,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Thank you.

155
0:08:26.472,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Applause)

156
0:08:31.392,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Chris Anderson: Stay up here, David, I've got a question for you.

157
0:08:34.535,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Applause)

158
0:08:37.343,000 --> 0:08:41,000
David, tell us where you're up to in developing this,

159
0:08:41.952,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and what are the remaining obstacles to trying to roll out

160
0:08:44.923,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and realize this dream?

161
0:08:46.678,000 --> 0:08:49,000
David Brenner: Well, I think we now know that it kills all bacteria,

162
0:08:49.893,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but we sort of knew that before we started,

163
0:08:51.972,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but we certainly tested that.

164
0:08:54.174,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So we have to do lots and lots of tests about safety,

165
0:08:56.912,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and so it's more about safety than it is about efficacy.

166
0:09:00.84,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And we need to do short-term tests,

167
0:09:03.268,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and we need to do long-term tests

168
0:09:05.295,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to make sure you can't develop melanoma many years on.

169
0:09:09.494,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So those studies are pretty well done at this point.

170
0:09:13.85,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The FDA of course is something we have to deal with,

171
0:09:19.256,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and rightly so,

172
0:09:20.655,000 --> 0:09:23,000
because we certainly can't use this in the real world without FDA approval.

173
0:09:24.766,000 --> 0:09:27,000
CA: Are you trying to launch first in the US,

174
0:09:27.988,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or somewhere else?

175
0:09:29.772,000 --> 0:09:31,000
DB: Actually, in a couple of countries.

176
0:09:31.948,000 --> 0:09:34,000
In Japan and in the US, both.

177
0:09:35.873,000 --> 0:09:39,000
CA: Have you been able to persuade biologists, doctors,

178
0:09:40.502,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that this is a safe approach?

179
0:09:42.612,000 --> 0:09:45,000
DB: Well, as you can imagine, there is a certain skepticism

180
0:09:45.731,000 --> 0:09:48,000
because everybody knows that UV light is not safe.

181
0:09:49.691,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So when somebody comes along and says,

182
0:09:51.7,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"Well, this particular UV light is safe,"

183
0:09:55.06,000 --> 0:09:56,000
there is a barrier to be crossed,

184
0:09:56.726,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but the data are there,

185
0:09:58.94,000 --> 0:10:,000
and I think that's what we're going to be standing on.

186
0:10:02.487,000 --> 0:10:03,000
CA: Well, we wish you well.

187
0:10:04.201,000 --> 0:10:05,000
This is potentially such important work.

188
0:10:06.13,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Thank you so much for sharing this with us.

189
0:10:08.187,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Thank you, David.

190
0:10:09.362,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Applause)

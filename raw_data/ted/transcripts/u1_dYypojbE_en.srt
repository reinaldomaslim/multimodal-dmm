1
0:00:12.921,000 --> 0:00:14,000
After cutting her arm with a broken glass,

2
0:00:15.349,000 --> 0:00:2,000
she fell into a fitful, exhausted sleep on the railway station platform.

3
0:00:21.649,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Early in the morning, when the station toilets were opened,

4
0:00:24.467,000 --> 0:00:27,000
she got painfully to her feet, and made her way over to them.

5
0:00:28.458,000 --> 0:00:3,000
When she saw her reflection in the mirror,

6
0:00:30.561,000 --> 0:00:31,000
she started to cry.

7
0:00:32.792,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Her face was dirty and tearstained;

8
0:00:34.998,000 --> 0:00:36,000
her shirt was ripped and covered in blood.

9
0:00:38.038,000 --> 0:00:42,000
She looked as if she'd been on the streets for three months, not three days.

10
0:00:42.998,000 --> 0:00:44,000
She washed herself as best she could.

11
0:00:45.473,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Her arms and stomach were hurting badly.

12
0:00:49.149,000 --> 0:00:5,000
She tried to clean the wounds,

13
0:00:50.752,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but any pressure she applied just started the bleeding again.

14
0:00:55.244,000 --> 0:00:58,000
She needed stitches, but there was no way she would go to a hospital.

15
0:00:59.718,000 --> 0:01:,000
They'd have sent her back home again.

16
0:01:01.591,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Back to him.

17
0:01:03.964,000 --> 0:01:04,000
She tightened her jacket --

18
0:01:05.917,000 --> 0:01:07,000
well, fastened her jacket tightly to cover the blood.

19
0:01:09.109,000 --> 0:01:11,000
She looked back at herself in the mirror.

20
0:01:11.466,000 --> 0:01:14,000
She looked a little better than before but was past caring.

21
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
There was only one thing she could think of doing.

22
0:01:19.093,000 --> 0:01:22,000
She came out of the station and into a phone box nearby.

23
0:01:23.456,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Telephone rings)

24
0:01:28.863,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Telephone rings)

25
0:01:32.339,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Woman: Samaritans, can I help you?

26
0:01:37.133,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Hello, Samaritans. Can I help you?

27
0:01:40.076,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Girl: (Crying) I -- I don't know.

28
0:01:42.895,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Woman: What's happened? You sound very upset.

29
0:01:46.077,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Girl cries)

30
0:01:50.799,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Woman: Why not start with your name?

31
0:01:52.744,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I'm Pam. What can I call you?

32
0:01:57.894,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Where are you speaking from?

33
0:02:00.046,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Are you safe?

34
0:02:02.244,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Girl: It's a phone box in London.

35
0:02:05.609,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Pam: You sound very young. How old are you?

36
0:02:08.612,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Girl: Fourteen.

37
0:02:10.374,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Pam: And what's happened to make you so upset?

38
0:02:13.128,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Girl: I just want to die. Every day I wake up and wish I was dead.

39
0:02:17.046,000 --> 0:02:2,000
If he doesn't kill me, then, I think, I want to do it myself.

40
0:02:21.949,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Pam: I'm glad you called.

41
0:02:24.165,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Let's start at the beginning.

42
0:02:28.854,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Sophie Andrews: Pam continued to gently ask the girl about herself.

43
0:02:32.038,000 --> 0:02:34,000
She didn't say much; there were lots of silences.

44
0:02:35.222,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But she knew she was there,

45
0:02:36.6,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and having Pam on the end of the phone felt so comforting.

46
0:02:42.365,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The 14-year-old that made that call was me.

47
0:02:46.189,000 --> 0:02:47,000
That was me in the phone box.

48
0:02:48.451,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I was running away from home, sleeping rough on the streets in London.

49
0:02:53.426,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I was being sexually abused by my father and his friends.

50
0:02:57.681,000 --> 0:03:,000
I was self-harming every day. I was suicidal.

51
0:03:03.847,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The first time I called Samaritans, I was 12 and absolutely desperate.

52
0:03:08.371,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It was a few months after my mother had deserted me,

53
0:03:11.051,000 --> 0:03:13,000
walked out and left me in the family home.

54
0:03:14.077,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And the abuse I was suffering at the hands of my father and his friends

55
0:03:17.506,000 --> 0:03:18,000
had left me a total wreck.

56
0:03:20.232,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I was running away, I was missing school,

57
0:03:22.863,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I was arriving drunk.

58
0:03:24.957,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was without hope and wanted to die.

59
0:03:28.934,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And that's where Samaritans came in.

60
0:03:33.046,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Samaritans has been around since 1953.

61
0:03:36.878,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's a 24/7 confidential helpline in the UK

62
0:03:40.521,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for anyone who might be feeling desperate or suicidal.

63
0:03:44.036,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Which I certainly was.

64
0:03:46.411,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Volunteers answer the phone around the clock every day of the year,

65
0:03:49.616,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and calls are confidential.

66
0:03:53.204,000 --> 0:03:55,000
During my teenage years, when I was most desperate,

67
0:03:55.768,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Samaritans became my lifeline.

68
0:03:58.776,000 --> 0:04:,000
They promised me total confidentiality.

69
0:04:01.45,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And that allowed me to trust them.

70
0:04:04.315,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Disturbing as they no doubt found my story, they never showed it.

71
0:04:08.457,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They were always there for me and listened without judgment.

72
0:04:12.244,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Mostly, they gently encouraged me to get help;

73
0:04:14.45,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I never felt out of control with them --

74
0:04:17.014,000 --> 0:04:18,000
an interesting parallel,

75
0:04:18.212,000 --> 0:04:21,000
as I felt so out of control in every other aspect of my life.

76
0:04:22.632,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It felt my self-harm was probably the only area

77
0:04:24.865,000 --> 0:04:25,000
where I felt I had any control.

78
0:04:29.442,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A few years later, I managed to get some control in my life.

79
0:04:33.641,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And I had appropriate support around me

80
0:04:35.927,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to allow me to live with what had happened.

81
0:04:38.387,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I had become a survivor of abuse rather than a victim.

82
0:04:42.204,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And at 21, I contacted Samaritans again.

83
0:04:45.299,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This time because I wanted to become a volunteer.

84
0:04:48.426,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Wanted to pay something back

85
0:04:49.903,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to the organization that had really saved my life.

86
0:04:54.674,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I knew that the simple act of listening in an empathetic way

87
0:04:58.348,000 --> 0:04:59,000
could have a profound effect.

88
0:05:00.991,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I knew that somebody listening to me without judgment

89
0:05:04.047,000 --> 0:05:05,000
would make the biggest difference.

90
0:05:07.673,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So I caught up with my education,

91
0:05:10.672,000 --> 0:05:13,000
found someone I could persuade to give me a job,

92
0:05:14.641,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and I enjoyed my volunteering at Samaritans.

93
0:05:17.744,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And when I say "enjoyed," it's an odd word to use,

94
0:05:20.261,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because no one would want to think of anyone

95
0:05:22.348,000 --> 0:05:24,000
being in absolute distress or pain.

96
0:05:25.053,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But I knew that that profound impact of that listening ear

97
0:05:27.8,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and someone being alongside me at that desperate time

98
0:05:31.061,000 --> 0:05:32,000
had the biggest impact,

99
0:05:32.3,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I felt a great sense of fulfillment

100
0:05:34.919,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that I was able to help people as a Samaritan.

101
0:05:38.45,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In my years volunteering at Samaritans, I was asked to perform many roles.

102
0:05:42.371,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But I guess the peak came in 2008,

103
0:05:45.561,000 --> 0:05:47,000
when I was asked to chair the organization for three years.

104
0:05:48.395,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So I had actually gone from that vulnerable caller

105
0:05:50.768,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in the phone box, desperate for help,

106
0:05:52.792,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to being the national lead for the organization

107
0:05:55.053,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and responsible for 22,000 volunteers.

108
0:05:59.018,000 --> 0:06:,000
I actually used to joke at the time

109
0:06:00.772,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and say if you really screwed up as a caller,

110
0:06:02.922,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you might end up running the place.

111
0:06:04.613,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:05.788,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Which I did.

113
0:06:06.982,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But I guess in a world which is dominated by professionalizing everything we do,

114
0:06:12.093,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I really understood that that simple act of listening

115
0:06:14.609,000 --> 0:06:16,000
could have such a life-changing effect.

116
0:06:17.578,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I guess it's a simple concept

117
0:06:19.031,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that can be applied across all areas of life.

118
0:06:22.768,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So in the 1980s, when I called Samaritans,

119
0:06:24.824,000 --> 0:06:26,000
child abuse was a subject no one wanted to talk about.

120
0:06:28.022,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Victims were often blamed, victims were often judged.

121
0:06:33.236,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And it was a topic of shame, and no one really wanted to talk about it.

122
0:06:38.284,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Today, judgment and shame surround a different issue.

123
0:06:41.871,000 --> 0:06:43,000
There's a different stigma that's out there.

124
0:06:44.633,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And the stigma that's there today is to talk about loneliness.

125
0:06:50.18,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Loneliness and isolation have profound health impacts.

126
0:06:53.546,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Being lonely can have a significant impact on your own well-being.

127
0:06:58.022,000 --> 0:07:,000
Recent systematic review of research

128
0:07:00.204,000 --> 0:07:02,000
actually said that it increased the mortality rates,

129
0:07:02.824,000 --> 0:07:03,000
or premature death rates,

130
0:07:04.173,000 --> 0:07:05,000
by up to 30 percent.

131
0:07:06.556,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It can lead to higher blood pressure, higher levels of depression,

132
0:07:10.597,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and actually aligned to mortality rates

133
0:07:12.803,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that might be more associated with alcohol abuse or smoking cigarettes.

134
0:07:17.913,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Loneliness is actually more harmful that smoking 15 cigarettes.

135
0:07:21.667,000 --> 0:07:22,000
A day.

136
0:07:23.215,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Not in your life, in your day.

137
0:07:25.324,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's also associated with higher levels of dementia.

138
0:07:28.268,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So a recent study also found

139
0:07:30.18,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that lonely people are twice at risk of Alzheimer's disease.

140
0:07:35.728,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Of course, there's many people that live alone who are not lonely.

141
0:07:40.696,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But being a caregiver for a partner that maybe has dementia

142
0:07:44.347,000 --> 0:07:45,000
can be a very lonely place.

143
0:07:47.163,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And a recent landmark study gave us a very good, clear definition

144
0:07:50.315,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of what loneliness is.

145
0:07:51.854,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And it said it's a subjective, unwelcome feeling

146
0:07:55.28,000 --> 0:07:57,000
of a lack or loss of companionship.

147
0:07:58.185,000 --> 0:08:,000
And it happens when there's a mismatch

148
0:08:00.273,000 --> 0:08:03,000
between the quality and the quantity of relationships that we have

149
0:08:03.963,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and those that we want.

150
0:08:07.007,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now in my life, the best help I've ever received

151
0:08:09.77,000 --> 0:08:11,000
has been from those personal connections

152
0:08:11.944,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and being listened to in an empathetic way.

153
0:08:15.561,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Professionals, and I'm conscious I'm speaking to a room of professionals,

154
0:08:19.03,000 --> 0:08:2,000
have a very important place.

155
0:08:20.451,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But for me, a volunteer giving up their time

156
0:08:23.49,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and listening to me without judgment in a confidential way,

157
0:08:27.244,000 --> 0:08:29,000
had such a huge, life-changing effect for me.

158
0:08:30.546,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And that was something that really stayed with me.

159
0:08:33.561,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So as you will have gathered, in my teenage years,

160
0:08:35.959,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I was off the rails, I was going every day wondering if I'd even live the next day.

161
0:08:39.898,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But that profound impact of the volunteer listening to me stayed with me.

162
0:08:44.673,000 --> 0:08:46,000
When I finally got to a point in my life

163
0:08:46.823,000 --> 0:08:48,000
where I felt I could live with what had happened,

164
0:08:49.395,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I wanted to pay something back.

165
0:08:51.99,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And in my experience,

166
0:08:53.164,000 --> 0:08:55,000
people who have been helped in a transforming way

167
0:08:56.078,000 --> 0:08:57,000
always want to pay something back.

168
0:08:59.45,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So I started paying back by my 25 years volunteering with Samaritans.

169
0:09:05.125,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And then, in 2013,

170
0:09:07.182,000 --> 0:09:1,000
picking up on that whole issue and the new stigma of loneliness,

171
0:09:10.855,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I launched a new national helpline in the UK for older people,

172
0:09:14.49,000 --> 0:09:15,000
called The Silver Line,

173
0:09:15.72,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which is there to support lonely and isolated older people.

174
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
In our short history, we've taken 1.5 million calls.

175
0:09:24.276,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And I know we're having a big impact, based on the feedback we get every day.

176
0:09:29.411,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Some people might be calling up for a friendly chat,

177
0:09:32.03,000 --> 0:09:34,000
maybe some information about local services.

178
0:09:34.538,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Some might be calling because they're suicidal.

179
0:09:37.204,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Some might be calling up because they're reporting abuse.

180
0:09:40.693,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And some quite simply, as I was, may have simply just given up on life.

181
0:09:46.931,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I guess it's a really simple idea, setting up a helpline.

182
0:09:49.709,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And I look back to those early days

183
0:09:51.442,000 --> 0:09:54,000
when I had the lofty title, I still have, of chief exec, but in the early days,

184
0:09:55.181,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I was chief exec of myself.

185
0:09:56.982,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Which, I have to say, I had the best meetings ever in my career --

186
0:10:00.163,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

187
0:10:01.338,000 --> 0:10:02,000
as chief exec of myself.

188
0:10:02.648,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But things have moved on, and now in 2017,

189
0:10:06.455,000 --> 0:10:09,000
we have over 200 staff listening to older people

190
0:10:10.207,000 --> 0:10:11,000
every day of the year, 24/7.

191
0:10:12.673,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We also have over 3,000 volunteers making weekly friendship calls

192
0:10:16.467,000 --> 0:10:17,000
from their own home.

193
0:10:18.767,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We also, for people that like the written word,

194
0:10:20.998,000 --> 0:10:22,000
offer Silver Letters, and we write pen-pal letters

195
0:10:23.919,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to older people who still enjoy receiving a letter.

196
0:10:27.497,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And we also have introduced something called Silver Circles --

197
0:10:30.442,000 --> 0:10:32,000
you notice I'm owning the word "silver" here --

198
0:10:32.73,000 --> 0:10:34,000
put "silver" in front of it and it's ours.

199
0:10:34.757,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Silver Circles are group conference calls

200
0:10:36.728,000 --> 0:10:38,000
where people actually talk about shared interests.

201
0:10:39.086,000 --> 0:10:4,000
My favorite group is the music group,

202
0:10:40.959,000 --> 0:10:42,000
where people, every week, play musical instruments

203
0:10:43.336,000 --> 0:10:44,000
down the phone to each other.

204
0:10:45.156,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Not always the same tune at the same time.

205
0:10:47.411,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:48.974,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But they do have fun.

207
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And "fun" is an interesting word,

208
0:10:52.9,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because I've talked very much about desperation, loneliness and isolation.

209
0:10:56.8,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But if you came to our helpline in the UK, you would also hear laughter.

210
0:11:00.419,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Because at the Silver Line,

211
0:11:01.888,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we do want to cherish the wonderful lives of older people

212
0:11:05.296,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and all the experiences that they bring.

213
0:11:07.522,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So here's an example, just a snippet of one of our calls.

214
0:11:11.974,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Audio) Good morning, you're through to the Silver Line.

215
0:11:14.665,000 --> 0:11:15,000
My name's Alan, how can I help?

216
0:11:16.221,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Woman: Hello, Alan. Good morning.

217
0:11:17.824,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Alan: Hello.

218
0:11:18.999,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Woman: (Chipper) Hello!

219
0:11:20.18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Alan: Oh, how are you this morning?

220
0:11:21.934,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Woman: I'm alright, thank you.

221
0:11:23.387,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Alan: I'm pleased to hear it.

222
0:11:24.807,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Woman: What a wonderful thing the telephone is, you know?

223
0:11:28.101,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Alan: It's a remarkable invention, isn't it?

224
0:11:30.228,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Woman: I remember when I was a little girl,

225
0:11:32.331,000 --> 0:11:33,000
donkey's years ago,

226
0:11:33.887,000 --> 0:11:35,000
if you wanted to make a phone call to somebody,

227
0:11:36.807,000 --> 0:11:38,000
you had to go to a shop

228
0:11:39.022,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and use the telephone of the shop

229
0:11:41.498,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and pay the shop for using the telephone and have your phone call.

230
0:11:45.475,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So you didn't make phone calls just whenever you fancied.

231
0:11:48.188,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Alan: Oh, no.

232
0:11:49.363,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Woman: (Coughs) Oh, sorry.

233
0:11:51.157,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Coughs)

234
0:11:52.45,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Excuse me about that.

235
0:11:53.8,000 --> 0:11:54,000
You had to, you know,

236
0:11:55.523,000 --> 0:11:58,000
confine your phone calls to the absolute essentials.

237
0:11:59.141,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And now, here I am, sitting in my own home in my dressing gown still,

238
0:12:04.812,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and using the telephone, isn't it wonderful?

239
0:12:07.807,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Alan: It is. (Laughter)

240
0:12:10.886,000 --> 0:12:13,000
SA: And that's not untypical of a call we might receive at our helpline.

241
0:12:14.307,000 --> 0:12:16,000
That's someone who really sees us as part of the family.

242
0:12:17.727,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So Silver Line, I guess, are now helping older people

243
0:12:20.236,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in the same way that Samaritans has helped me.

244
0:12:22.466,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They're there 24/7, they're listening confidentially

245
0:12:25.148,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and quite often not giving any advice.

246
0:12:27.695,000 --> 0:12:3,000
How often do we really ever listen without giving advice?

247
0:12:31.331,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It's actually quite hard.

248
0:12:32.688,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Quite often on the phone calls, an older person would say,

249
0:12:35.721,000 --> 0:12:36,000
"Could you give me some advice, please?"

250
0:12:37.687,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And 20 minutes later, they say, "Thank you for your advice,"

251
0:12:40.57,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and we realize we haven't given any.

252
0:12:42.334,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Laughter)

253
0:12:43.359,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We've listened and listened, and we haven't interrupted.

254
0:12:45.996,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But to that person, maybe we have given advice.

255
0:12:48.511,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We recently conducted a survey at The Silver Line

256
0:12:50.901,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to 3,000 older people, to ask them what they thought of the service.

257
0:12:54.582,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And one person quite simply came back and said,

258
0:12:56.94,000 --> 0:12:58,000
for the first time in her life,

259
0:12:59.521,000 --> 0:13:02,000
she had what we would call in the sport cricket a wicketkeeper,

260
0:13:03.331,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and what you would call in baseball, a catcher.

261
0:13:06.911,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I've been here 48 hours, and I'm talking American.

262
0:13:09.332,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They will not recognize me when I get home.

263
0:13:11.371,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Laughter)

264
0:13:12.919,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But for the first time in her life, she had that catcher,

265
0:13:15.68,000 --> 0:13:16,000
which is really, really important.

266
0:13:17.379,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And now it's come full circle, because actually,

267
0:13:20.052,000 --> 0:13:22,000
people that are calling Silver Line and needing a catcher

268
0:13:22.759,000 --> 0:13:24,000
are now becoming catchers themselves by putting something back

269
0:13:25.729,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and becoming volunteers and becoming part of our family.

270
0:13:29.641,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So I end my talk, really, where I started, talking about my own personal experience.

271
0:13:34.323,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Because when I talk about my life, I often say that I've been lucky.

272
0:13:37.728,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And people generally ask me why.

273
0:13:40.212,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And it's because, at every stage of my life,

274
0:13:42.673,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I have been lucky enough to have someone alongside me at the right time

275
0:13:47.134,000 --> 0:13:48,000
who maybe has believed in me,

276
0:13:48.921,000 --> 0:13:49,000
which in turn has helped me

277
0:13:50.302,000 --> 0:13:53,000
just to believe a little bit more in myself, which has been so important.

278
0:13:55.094,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And everyone needs a catcher at some point in their lives.

279
0:13:58.895,000 --> 0:13:59,000
This is my catcher.

280
0:14:00.705,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So that's Pam.

281
0:14:02.038,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And she answered the call to me

282
0:14:03.646,000 --> 0:14:06,000
when I was that 14-year-old in the phone box, over 30 years ago.

283
0:14:08.973,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So never, ever underestimate the power of a simple human connection.

284
0:14:14.418,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Because it can be and so often is the power to save a life.

285
0:14:18.045,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Thank you.

286
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Applause)

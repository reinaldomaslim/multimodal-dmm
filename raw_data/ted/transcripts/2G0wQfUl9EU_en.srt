1
0:00:12.537,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My work focuses on the connection of

2
0:00:15.054,000 --> 0:00:18,000
both thinking about our community life

3
0:00:18.561,000 --> 0:00:19,000
being part of the environment

4
0:00:20.221,000 --> 0:00:22,000
where architecture grows from the natural

5
0:00:22.509,000 --> 0:00:25,000
local conditions and traditions.

6
0:00:25.981,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Today I brought two recent projects

7
0:00:28.13,000 --> 0:00:3,000
as an example of this.

8
0:00:30.403,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Both projects are in emerging countries,

9
0:00:32.479,000 --> 0:00:35,000
one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.

10
0:00:35.518,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And also they have in common

11
0:00:37.277,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that the different analyses from different perspectives

12
0:00:40.309,000 --> 0:00:44,000
becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.

13
0:00:44.892,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The first example started with an invitation

14
0:00:47.634,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to design a multistory shopping mall

15
0:00:49.657,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.

16
0:00:51.962,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And this is the type of building

17
0:00:54.257,000 --> 0:00:56,000
we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,

18
0:00:57.082,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of what we had to design.

19
0:00:59.246,000 --> 0:01:01,000
At first, the first thing I thought was,

20
0:01:01.321,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I want to run away.

21
0:01:03.271,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:05.332,000 --> 0:01:07,000
After seeing a few of these buildings --

23
0:01:07.64,000 --> 0:01:08,000
there are many in the city --

24
0:01:09.44,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we realized that they have three very big points.

25
0:01:12.882,000 --> 0:01:14,000
First, these buildings, they are almost empty

26
0:01:14.978,000 --> 0:01:15,000
because they have very large shops

27
0:01:16.759,000 --> 0:01:18,000
where people cannot afford to buy things.

28
0:01:19.73,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Second, they need tons of energy to perform

29
0:01:22.57,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because of the skin treatment with glass

30
0:01:24.738,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that creates heat in the inside,

31
0:01:26.706,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and then you need a lot of cooling.

32
0:01:28.346,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In a city where this shouldn't happen

33
0:01:30.307,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because they have really mild weather

34
0:01:32.202,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.

35
0:01:35.951,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And third is that their image has nothing to do

36
0:01:39.141,000 --> 0:01:41,000
with Africa and with Ethiopia.

37
0:01:41.296,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.

38
0:01:46.898,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,

39
0:01:49.718,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I was really captivated by the old merkato

40
0:01:51.846,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that is this open-air structure

41
0:01:54.027,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where thousands of people, they go and buy things

42
0:01:55.919,000 --> 0:01:57,000
every day from small vendors.

43
0:01:58.286,000 --> 0:02:,000
And also it has this idea of the public space

44
0:02:00.574,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that uses the outdoors to create activity.

45
0:02:03.816,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I thought, this is what I really want to design,

46
0:02:07.182,000 --> 0:02:08,000
not a shopping mall.

47
0:02:08.971,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But the question was how we could do a multistory,

48
0:02:12.251,000 --> 0:02:14,000
contemporary building with these principles.

49
0:02:15.14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The next challenge was when we looked at the site,

50
0:02:17.596,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that is, in a really growing area of the city,

51
0:02:20.144,000 --> 0:02:22,000
where most of these buildings that you see in the image,

52
0:02:22.628,000 --> 0:02:23,000
they were not there.

53
0:02:24.23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And it's also between two parallel streets

54
0:02:26.902,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.

55
0:02:29.269,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So the first thing we did was to create a connection

56
0:02:32.663,000 --> 0:02:33,000
between these two streets,

57
0:02:34.399,000 --> 0:02:36,000
putting all the entrances of the building.

58
0:02:36.598,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And this extends with an inclined atrium

59
0:02:39.383,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that creates an open-air space in the building

60
0:02:41.711,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that self-protects itself with its own shape

61
0:02:44.44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
from the sun and the rain.

62
0:02:46.242,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And around this void

63
0:02:47.898,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we placed this idea of the market with small shops,

64
0:02:51.201,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.

65
0:02:54.971,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I also thought, how to close the building?

66
0:02:57.242,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I really wanted to find a solution

67
0:02:59.152,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that would respond to the local climate conditions.

68
0:03:02.615,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I started thinking about the textile

69
0:03:04.723,000 --> 0:03:05,000
like a shell made of concrete

70
0:03:06.604,000 --> 0:03:09,000
with perforations that would let the air in,

71
0:03:10.175,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and also the light, but in a filtered way.

72
0:03:12.799,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.

73
0:03:18.603,000 --> 0:03:2,000
That they have fractal geometry properties

74
0:03:20.778,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and this helped me to shape the whole facade.

75
0:03:22.909,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And we are building that

76
0:03:24.514,000 --> 0:03:26,000
with these small prefabricated pieces

77
0:03:26.655,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that are the windows that let the air and the light

78
0:03:30.093,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in a controlled way inside the building.

79
0:03:32.075,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses

80
0:03:34.457,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that use the light from the inside of the building

81
0:03:37.06,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to light up the building at night.

82
0:03:39.946,000 --> 0:03:43,000
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers

83
0:03:44.068,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because they were like,

84
0:03:45.224,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."

85
0:03:47.912,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But then we all realized that this idea of the market

86
0:03:53.721,000 --> 0:03:55,000
happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall

87
0:03:56.495,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because basically they had more shops to sell.

88
0:03:59.215,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,

89
0:04:03.289,000 --> 0:04:05,000
not only because of the material compared with the glass,

90
0:04:05.517,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.

91
0:04:08.205,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So we created some budget savings

92
0:04:10.362,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that we used to implement the project.

93
0:04:12.259,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the first implementation was to think

94
0:04:14.191,000 --> 0:04:17,000
about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy

95
0:04:17.431,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.

96
0:04:20.765,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.

97
0:04:24.982,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And then under those panels

98
0:04:27.063,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars

99
0:04:30.799,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that would create this urban oasis.

100
0:04:33.613,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And these porches on the roof,

101
0:04:35.403,000 --> 0:04:39,000
all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.

102
0:04:40.139,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.

103
0:04:45.301,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The second example is a master plan

104
0:04:48.356,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.

105
0:04:51.635,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,

106
0:04:55.569,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,

107
0:04:57.834,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.

108
0:05:01.956,000 --> 0:05:04,000
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina

109
0:05:05.064,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,

110
0:05:09.041,000 --> 0:05:13,000
opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.

111
0:05:13.49,000 --> 0:05:17,000
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did

112
0:05:17.859,000 --> 0:05:21,000
was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks

113
0:05:21.879,000 --> 0:05:24,000
similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona

114
0:05:25.063,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.

115
0:05:28.054,000 --> 0:05:3,000
On top of that, we selected some strategic points

116
0:05:30.839,000 --> 0:05:33,000
reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,

117
0:05:34.04,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and this modified this initial pattern.

118
0:05:36.81,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And the last operation was to think about the cell,

119
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the small cell of the project, like the apartment,

120
0:05:41.95,000 --> 0:05:42,000
as an essential part of the master plan.

121
0:05:43.728,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation

122
0:05:46.901,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?

123
0:05:49.2,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house

124
0:05:53.963,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and then a natural ventilation.

125
0:05:56.826,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments

126
0:06:00.412,000 --> 0:06:02,000
are perfectly oriented in that direction.

127
0:06:02.552,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And this is the result

128
0:06:04.012,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.

129
0:06:07.777,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It has these blocks with courtyards,

130
0:06:09.375,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and then on the ground floor

131
0:06:10.498,000 --> 0:06:12,000
you have all these connections for the pedestrians.

132
0:06:12.634,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish

133
0:06:15.741,000 --> 0:06:18,000
a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.

134
0:06:19.404,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.

135
0:06:22.95,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The volume has this connecting shape

136
0:06:24.842,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that shades itself with three different types of apartments

137
0:06:28.144,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood

138
0:06:31.787,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,

139
0:06:34.687,000 --> 0:06:35,000
such as a gym and a kindergarten

140
0:06:36.417,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.

141
0:06:40.487,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project

142
0:06:43.287,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.

143
0:06:46.997,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,

144
0:06:49.281,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,

145
0:06:52.818,000 --> 0:06:55,000
jumping from one building to another.

146
0:06:56.202,000 --> 0:06:58,000
These two examples,

147
0:06:58.561,000 --> 0:07:01,000
they have a common approach in the design process.

148
0:07:01.945,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see

149
0:07:04.524,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the cities literally growing.

150
0:07:06.67,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow

151
0:07:11.411,000 --> 0:07:16,000
changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.

152
0:07:16.552,000 --> 0:07:18,000
For this reason, I see even more importance

153
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions

154
0:07:24.19,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment

155
0:07:28.251,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and that aim to connect nature and people.

156
0:07:32.169,000 --> 0:07:33,000

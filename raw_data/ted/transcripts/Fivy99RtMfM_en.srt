0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Mosquito buzzing)

3
0:00:22.04,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Swat)

4
0:00:25.48,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Gotcha.

5
0:00:27.96,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Mosquitoes.

6
0:00:29.88,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I hate them.

7
0:00:32.12,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Don't you?

8
0:00:33.96,000 --> 0:00:35,000
That awful buzzing sound at night around your ears

9
0:00:36.6,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that drives you absolutely crazy?

10
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin

11
0:00:41.8,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and suck out your blood?

12
0:00:43.52,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That's awful, right?

13
0:00:45.28,000 --> 0:00:49,000
In fact, there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes.

14
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:52,000
When they fly into our bedroom at night,

15
0:00:53.8,000 --> 0:00:54,000
they prefer to bite my wife.

16
0:00:55.601,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:56.84,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But that's fascinating, right?

18
0:00:58.32,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Why does she receive more bites than I do?

19
0:01:02.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And the answer is smell,

20
0:01:05.04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the smell of her body.

21
0:01:07.12,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin

22
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that either attract or repel mosquitoes,

23
0:01:13.96,000 --> 0:01:15,000
some of us are just more attractive than others.

24
0:01:17.36,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So my wife smells nicer than I do, or I just stink more than she does.

25
0:01:23.56,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Either way, mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us out. They smell us.

26
0:01:29.8,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And during my PhD, I wanted to know exactly

27
0:01:33.12,000 --> 0:01:37,000
what chemicals from our skin African malaria mosquitoes use

28
0:01:37.224,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to track us down at night.

29
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And there's a whole range of compounds that they do use.

30
0:01:42.76,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And this was not going to be an easy task.

31
0:01:45.6,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And therefore we set up various experiments.

32
0:01:49.64,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Why did we set up these experiments?

33
0:01:51.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Because half the world's population

34
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria

35
0:01:58.48,000 --> 0:01:59,000
through a simple mosquito bite.

36
0:02:00.84,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Every 30 seconds, somewhere on this planet,

37
0:02:03.28,000 --> 0:02:05,000
a child dies of malaria,

38
0:02:05.76,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and Paul Levy this morning, he was talking about the metaphor

39
0:02:08.68,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of the 727 crashing into the United States.

40
0:02:11.2,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Well, in Africa, we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s

41
0:02:16.88,000 --> 0:02:17,000
crashing every day.

42
0:02:19.32,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps,

43
0:02:22.639,000 --> 0:02:23,000
bait it with our smell,

44
0:02:24.24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we may be able to stop transmission of disease.

45
0:02:28.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now, solving this puzzle was not an easy thing,

46
0:02:30.6,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin,

47
0:02:33.6,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but we undertook some remarkable experiments

48
0:02:36.28,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed.

49
0:02:39.6,000 --> 0:02:42,000
First, we observed that not all mosquito species

50
0:02:42.96,000 --> 0:02:43,000
bite on the same part of the body.

51
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Strange.

52
0:02:46.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So we set up an experiment

53
0:02:48.44,000 --> 0:02:51,000
where we put a naked volunteer in a large cage,

54
0:02:51.821,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:52.86,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and in that cage, we released mosquitoes

56
0:02:55.32,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to see where they were biting on the body of that person.

57
0:02:58.6,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And we found some remarkable differences.

58
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
On the left here you see the bites

59
0:03:04.04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
by the Dutch malaria mosquito on this person.

60
0:03:06.32,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They had a very strong preference for biting on the face.

61
0:03:09.84,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In contrast, the African malaria mosquito

62
0:03:12.36,000 --> 0:03:17,000
had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person.

63
0:03:17.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And that, of course, we should have known all along,

64
0:03:20.04,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because they're called mosqui-toes, you see?

65
0:03:23.2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:24.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
That's right.

67
0:03:25.8,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:28.08,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And so we started focusing on the smell of feet ...

69
0:03:33.24,000 --> 0:03:34,000
on the smell of human feet,

70
0:03:35.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature

71
0:03:38.84,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that said that cheese smells after feet

72
0:03:42.64,000 --> 0:03:43,000
rather than the reverse.

73
0:03:44.84,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Think of it.

74
0:03:46.32,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment.

75
0:03:48.773,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We tried, with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese,

76
0:03:53.84,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which smells badly after feet,

77
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to attract African malaria mosquitoes.

78
0:03:58.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And you know what? It worked.

79
0:04:01.44,000 --> 0:04:03,000
In fact, it worked so well

80
0:04:04.44,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese

81
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that we're using in Tanzania

82
0:04:10.8,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and has been shown there

83
0:04:12.04,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitoes than humans.

84
0:04:16.76,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Limburg, be proud of your cheese,

85
0:04:20.28,000 --> 0:04:23,000
as it is now used in the fight against malaria.

86
0:04:23.44,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Applause)

87
0:04:30.279,000 --> 0:04:32,000
That's the cheese, just to show you.

88
0:04:33.399,000 --> 0:04:35,000
My second story is remarkable as well.

89
0:04:36.72,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's about man's best friend. It's about dogs.

90
0:04:39.96,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria.

91
0:04:44.88,000 --> 0:04:46,000
One of the best ways of killing mosquitoes

92
0:04:47.76,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is not to wait until they fly around like adults

93
0:04:51.08,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and bite people and transmit disease.

94
0:04:53.8,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae.

95
0:04:57.92,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Why?

96
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Because they are just like the CIA.

97
0:05:02.48,000 --> 0:05:05,000
In that pool of water, these larvae are concentrated.

98
0:05:06.48,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They're all together there. They are immobile.

99
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They can't escape from that water.

100
0:05:10.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They can't fly.

101
0:05:12.44,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And they're accessible.

102
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there, right?

103
0:05:20.12,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So the problem that we face with this

104
0:05:23.76,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is that, throughout the landscape, all these pools of water with the larvae,

105
0:05:27.68,000 --> 0:05:28,000
they are scattered all over the place,

106
0:05:29.68,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which makes it very hard for an inspector like this

107
0:05:32.92,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides.

108
0:05:37.04,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem?

109
0:05:41.96,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Until we realized that just like us -- we have a unique smell --

110
0:05:46.44,000 --> 0:05:49,000
mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell.

111
0:05:50.48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And so we set up another crazy experiment,

112
0:05:52.68,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because we collected the smell of these larvae,

113
0:05:55.04,000 --> 0:05:58,000
put it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable.

114
0:05:58.96,000 --> 0:06:,000
Here we have a bar with four holes

115
0:06:01.4,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole.

116
0:06:04.2,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Oh, that was very quick.

117
0:06:05.44,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.

118
0:06:08.6,000 --> 0:06:1,000
He's examining these holes and now he's got it already.

119
0:06:11.24,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He's going back to check the control holes again,

120
0:06:13.6,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but he's coming back to the first one,

121
0:06:15.48,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and now he's locking into that smell,

122
0:06:17.32,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which means that now, we can use dogs with these inspectors

123
0:06:20.96,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitoes in the field,

124
0:06:24.2,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria.

125
0:06:27.32,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This lady is Ellen van der Zweep.

126
0:06:28.96,000 --> 0:06:3,000
She's one of the best dog trainers in the world,

127
0:06:31.223,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and she believes that we can do a lot more.

128
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites

129
0:06:37.64,000 --> 0:06:39,000
smell different compared to people that are uninfected,

130
0:06:40.52,000 --> 0:06:44,000
she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite.

131
0:06:46.8,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way

132
0:06:50.24,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and there's few people remaining with parasites,

133
0:06:52.68,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that the dogs can find these people,

134
0:06:54.44,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we can treat them with antimalarial drugs and give the final blow to malaria.

135
0:06:58.36,000 --> 0:07:,000
Man's best friend in the fight against malaria.

136
0:07:02.08,000 --> 0:07:04,000
My third story is perhaps even more remarkable ...

137
0:07:05.28,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and, I should say, has never been shown to the public until today.

138
0:07:08.78,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Audience cheers)

139
0:07:09.805,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Yeah.

140
0:07:11.76,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It's a crazy story, but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge

141
0:07:16.76,000 --> 0:07:17,000
against mosquitoes ever.

142
0:07:18.44,000 --> 0:07:19,000
In fact, people have told me

143
0:07:19.96,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes.

144
0:07:24.52,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And the question of course is,

145
0:07:26.08,000 --> 0:07:29,000
what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes?

146
0:07:29.8,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the answer I have right here ...

147
0:07:33.08,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in my pocket --

148
0:07:34.546,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:35.571,000 --> 0:07:36,000
if I get it.

150
0:07:37.96,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's a tablet.

151
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:41,000
A simple tablet,

152
0:07:41.24,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and when I take it with water ...

153
0:07:44.48,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it does miracles.

154
0:07:48.96,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Thank you.

155
0:07:56.36,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now, let me show you how this works.

156
0:07:59.96,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Here in this box, I have a cage

157
0:08:04.014,000 --> 0:08:1,000
with several hundred hungry female mosquitoes ...

158
0:08:11.016,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:12.32,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that I'm just about to release.

160
0:08:14.8,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:16.6,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Just kidding, just kidding.

162
0:08:17.965,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:19.36,000 --> 0:08:22,000
What I'm going to show you is, I'm gonna stick my arm into it

164
0:08:22.44,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and I will show you how quickly they will bite.

165
0:08:25.48,000 --> 0:08:26,000
There we go.

166
0:08:27.48,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Don't worry, I do this all the time in the lab.

167
0:08:30.32,000 --> 0:08:31,000
There we go.

168
0:08:32.56,000 --> 0:08:33,000
OK.

169
0:08:34.24,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now, on the video --

170
0:08:37.32,000 --> 0:08:38,000
on the video here,

171
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I'm going to show you exactly the same thing,

172
0:08:41.32,000 --> 0:08:43,000
except that what I'm showing you on the video

173
0:08:43.48,000 --> 0:08:45,000
happened one hour after I took the tablet.

174
0:08:46.799,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Have a look.

175
0:08:48.72,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That doesn't work.

176
0:08:49.96,000 --> 0:08:5,000
OK. Sorry about that.

177
0:08:51.6,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I'm sticking in my arm, I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal,

178
0:08:54.6,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I'm shaking them off, and we follow them through time

179
0:08:57.12,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to see these mosquitoes get very, very sick indeed,

180
0:08:59.64,000 --> 0:09:,000
here shown in fast motion.

181
0:09:01.92,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And three hours later, what we see at the bottom of the cage

182
0:09:05.88,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is dead mosquitoes ...

183
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:09,000
very dead mosquitoes.

184
0:09:10.8,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And I'm going to say, ladies and gentlemen,

185
0:09:12.84,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes.

186
0:09:14.864,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They don't kill us. We kill them.

187
0:09:18.44,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Applause)

188
0:09:27.64,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now --

189
0:09:29.96,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Maastricht, be prepared.

191
0:09:35.4,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now, think of what we can do with this.

192
0:09:37.32,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We can actually use this to contain outbreaks

193
0:09:39.48,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of mosquito-born diseases, of epidemics, right?

194
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And better still, imagine what would happen

195
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:49,000
if, in a very large area, everyone would take these drugs, for just three weeks.

196
0:09:49.92,000 --> 0:09:5,000
That would give us an opportunity

197
0:09:51.56,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to actually eliminate malaria as a disease.

198
0:09:54.36,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So cheese, dogs and a pill to kill mosquitoes.

199
0:09:58.32,000 --> 0:10:,000
That's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing ...

200
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
for the betterment of mankind,

201
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but especially for her,

202
0:10:05.8,000 --> 0:10:08,000
so that she can grow up in a world without malaria.

203
0:10:09.72,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Thank you.

204
0:10:10.96,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Applause)

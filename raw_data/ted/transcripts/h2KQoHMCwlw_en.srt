1
0:00:12.926,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We're at a tipping point in human history,

2
0:00:15.416,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home.

3
0:00:21.332,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Even in just the past few years, we've greatly expanded

4
0:00:24.062,000 --> 0:00:28,000
our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe.

5
0:00:28.392,000 --> 0:00:3,000
NASA's Kepler mission has discovered

6
0:00:31.13,000 --> 0:00:33,000
thousands of potential planets around other stars,

7
0:00:34.079,000 --> 0:00:38,000
indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy.

8
0:00:38.273,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Kepler is a space telescope

9
0:00:40.143,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them,

10
0:00:44.434,000 --> 0:00:46,000
blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us.

11
0:00:47.732,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes

12
0:00:50.332,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as well as their distance from their parent star.

13
0:00:53.118,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky,

14
0:00:57.158,000 --> 0:00:59,000
like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System,

15
0:00:59.713,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and also how much light they receive from their parent sun.

16
0:01:03.079,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover

17
0:01:06.957,000 --> 0:01:08,000
might be habitable or not.

18
0:01:09.418,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove

19
0:01:13.481,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of potentially habitable worlds,

20
0:01:15.594,000 --> 0:01:18,000
our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.

21
0:01:19.054,000 --> 0:01:23,000
2014 was the hottest year on record.

22
0:01:23.466,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia

23
0:01:26.809,000 --> 0:01:29,000
are now disappearing in a matter of decades.

24
0:01:29.944,000 --> 0:01:34,000
These planetary-scale environmental changes that we have set in motion

25
0:01:35.055,000 --> 0:01:38,000
are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course.

26
0:01:39.347,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronomer.

27
0:01:43.062,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars

28
0:01:46.432,000 --> 0:01:48,000
with the hopes of finding the places in the universe

29
0:01:48.89,000 --> 0:01:5,000
where we might discover life beyond our own planet.

30
0:01:51.862,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You could say that I look for choice alien real estate.

31
0:01:55.902,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe,

32
0:02:00.244,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth,

33
0:02:03.611,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the more you appreciate our own planet itself.

34
0:02:07.257,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison

35
0:02:09.95,000 --> 0:02:12,000
between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best:

36
0:02:13.572,000 --> 0:02:15,000
those of our own Solar System.

37
0:02:15.662,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Consider our neighbor, Mars.

38
0:02:17.624,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Mars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun,

39
0:02:21.409,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it might be considered a potentially habitable world

40
0:02:23.934,000 --> 0:02:25,000
if found by a mission like Kepler.

41
0:02:25.936,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Indeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past,

42
0:02:29.303,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and in part, this is why we study Mars so much.

43
0:02:32.74,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Our rovers, like Curiosity, crawl across its surface,

44
0:02:36.13,000 --> 0:02:39,000
scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it.

45
0:02:39.38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere,

46
0:02:42.886,000 --> 0:02:45,000
trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability.

47
0:02:46.578,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space

48
0:02:51.143,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars.

49
0:02:54.844,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But though these Martian vistas

50
0:02:56.794,000 --> 0:02:58,000
resemble the deserts of our own home world,

51
0:02:59.349,000 --> 0:03:04,000
places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,

52
0:03:04.921,000 --> 0:03:05,000
compared to Earth

53
0:03:06.593,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.

54
0:03:09.89,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Consider the extent to which we have not colonized

55
0:03:13.164,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the deserts of our own planet,

56
0:03:15.068,000 --> 0:03:17,000
places that are lush by comparison with Mars.

57
0:03:17.901,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Even in the driest, highest places on Earth,

58
0:03:20.687,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the air is sweet and thick with oxygen

59
0:03:23.287,000 --> 0:03:27,000
exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests.

60
0:03:27.374,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I worry -- I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets

61
0:03:33.318,000 --> 0:03:36,000
carries with it a long, dark shadow:

62
0:03:36.429,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the implication and belief by some

63
0:03:38.449,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction

64
0:03:42.002,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth.

65
0:03:46.135,000 --> 0:03:48,000
As much as I love interplanetary exploration,

66
0:03:48.573,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I deeply disagree with this idea.

67
0:03:50.918,000 --> 0:03:52,000
There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars,

68
0:03:53.611,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity

69
0:03:57.025,000 --> 0:04:,000
is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party

70
0:04:00.133,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is happening later on the lifeboats.

71
0:04:02.504,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:05.453,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Applause)

73
0:04:08.355,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Thank you.

74
0:04:11.142,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation

75
0:04:14.928,000 --> 0:04:16,000
are not opposed to one another.

76
0:04:17.109,000 --> 0:04:19,000
No, they're in fact two sides of the same goal:

77
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to understand, preserve and improve life into the future.

78
0:04:23.982,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas.

79
0:04:28.045,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They're just closer to home.

80
0:04:29.926,000 --> 0:04:33,000
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces

81
0:04:34.105,000 --> 0:04:37,000
out of hostile, inhospitable spaces here on Earth,

82
0:04:37.495,000 --> 0:04:4,000
perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment

83
0:04:40.932,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and moving beyond it.

84
0:04:43.161,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I leave you with a final thought experiment:

85
0:04:45.471,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Fermi's paradox.

86
0:04:47.166,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact

87
0:04:52.028,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that our universe has been around for a very long time

88
0:04:54.875,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and we expect that there are many planets within it,

89
0:04:57.545,000 --> 0:05:,000
we should have found evidence for alien life by now.

90
0:05:00.633,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So where are they?

91
0:05:02.676,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Well, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox

92
0:05:06.043,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough

93
0:05:09.526,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to consider living amongst the stars,

94
0:05:11.848,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they lose sight of how important it is

95
0:05:14.332,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with.

96
0:05:18.86,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone

97
0:05:23.248,000 --> 0:05:24,000
will save us from ourselves,

98
0:05:25.129,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration

99
0:05:28.658,000 --> 0:05:29,000
can work together.

100
0:05:30.552,000 --> 0:05:32,000
If we truly believe in our ability

101
0:05:32.675,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation,

102
0:05:36.181,000 --> 0:05:39,000
then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving

103
0:05:39.767,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the habitability of the Earth.

104
0:05:41.94,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Thank you.

105
0:05:42.996,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Applause)

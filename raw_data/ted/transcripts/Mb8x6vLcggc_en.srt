1
0:00:13.063,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There's an old joke about a cop

2
0:00:14.602,000 --> 0:00:16,000
who's walking his beat in the middle of the night,

3
0:00:16.983,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and he comes across a guy under a street lamp

4
0:00:19.11,000 --> 0:00:21,000
who's looking at the ground and moving from side to side,

5
0:00:21.825,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and the cop asks him what he's doing.

6
0:00:23.626,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The guys says he's looking for his keys.

7
0:00:25.584,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So the cop takes his time

8
0:00:27.047,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and looks over and kind of makes a little matrix

9
0:00:29.341,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and looks for about two, three minutes.

10
0:00:31.57,000 --> 0:00:32,000
No keys.

11
0:00:32.745,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The cop says, "Are you sure?

12
0:00:35.141,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Hey buddy, are you sure you lost your keys here?"

13
0:00:37.474,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And the guy says, "No, actually I lost them

14
0:00:39.53,000 --> 0:00:4,000
down at the other end of the street,

15
0:00:41.28,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but the light is better here."

16
0:00:42.749,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:46.167,000 --> 0:00:49,000
There's a concept that people talk about nowadays called "big data."

18
0:00:49.434,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And what they're talking about is all of the information

19
0:00:52.101,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that we're generating through our interaction

20
0:00:54.276,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with and over the Internet,

21
0:00:55.603,000 --> 0:00:56,000
everything from Facebook and Twitter

22
0:00:57.387,000 --> 0:01:,000
to music downloads, movies, streaming, all this kind of stuff,

23
0:01:01.044,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the live streaming of TED.

24
0:01:02.919,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And the folks who work with big data, for them,

25
0:01:05.627,000 --> 0:01:07,000
they talk about that their biggest problem

26
0:01:07.655,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is we have so much information.

27
0:01:09.426,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The biggest problem is: how do we organize all that information?

28
0:01:13.272,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I can tell you that, working in global health,

29
0:01:15.456,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that is not our biggest problem.

30
0:01:18.232,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Because for us, even though the light is better on the Internet,

31
0:01:22.989,000 --> 0:01:25,000
the data that would help us solve the problems we're trying to solve

32
0:01:26.379,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is not actually present on the Internet.

33
0:01:28.552,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So we don't know, for example,

34
0:01:30.021,000 --> 0:01:33,000
how many people right now are being affected by disasters

35
0:01:33.336,000 --> 0:01:34,000
or by conflict situations.

36
0:01:35.329,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We don't know for, really, basically, any of the clinics

37
0:01:39.072,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the developing world,

38
0:01:40.246,000 --> 0:01:42,000
which ones have medicines and which ones don't.

39
0:01:42.725,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics.

40
0:01:46.123,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We don't know -- and this is really amazing to me -- we don't know

41
0:01:49.845,000 --> 0:01:52,000
how many children were born -- or how many children there are --

42
0:01:53.639,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan.

43
0:01:58.047,000 --> 0:02:,000
We don't know how many kids died last week

44
0:02:00.112,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in any of those countries.

45
0:02:01.382,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We don't know the needs of the elderly, the mentally ill.

46
0:02:04.453,000 --> 0:02:07,000
For all of these different critically important problems

47
0:02:07.692,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or critically important areas that we want to solve problems in,

48
0:02:11.016,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we basically know nothing at all.

49
0:02:15.834,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And part of the reason why we don't know anything at all

50
0:02:18.51,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is that the information technology systems that we use in global health

51
0:02:22.713,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here.

52
0:02:27.15,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is about a 5,000-year-old technology.

53
0:02:29.408,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Some of you may have used it before.

54
0:02:31.164,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's kind of on its way out now,

55
0:02:32.727,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but we still use it for 99 percent of our stuff.

56
0:02:35.19,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is a paper form.

57
0:02:38.01,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And what you're looking at is a paper form

58
0:02:40.067,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia,

59
0:02:43.27,000 --> 0:02:45,000
who is tramping out across the countryside

60
0:02:45.534,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in Indonesia on, I'm sure, a very hot and humid day,

61
0:02:49.209,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors

62
0:02:51.915,000 --> 0:02:53,000
over a period of weeks or months,

63
0:02:54.018,000 --> 0:02:55,000
knocking on the doors and saying,

64
0:02:55.639,000 --> 0:02:57,000
"Excuse me, we'd like to ask you some questions.

65
0:02:58.541,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Do you have any children? Were your children vaccinated?"

66
0:03:02.223,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Because the only way we can actually find out

67
0:03:04.382,000 --> 0:03:06,000
how many children were vaccinated in the country of Indonesia,

68
0:03:07.341,000 --> 0:03:08,000
what percentage were vaccinated,

69
0:03:08.922,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is actually not on the Internet, but by going out and knocking on doors,

70
0:03:13.074,000 --> 0:03:15,000
sometimes tens of thousands of doors.

71
0:03:15.312,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this.

72
0:03:19.334,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You know, a census of Indonesia

73
0:03:21.475,000 --> 0:03:23,000
would probably take two years to accomplish.

74
0:03:23.593,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And the problem, of course, with all of this

75
0:03:25.689,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is that, with all those paper forms --

76
0:03:27.61,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and I'm telling you, we have paper forms for every possible thing:

77
0:03:30.753,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We have paper forms for vaccination surveys.

78
0:03:32.841,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We have paper forms to track people who come into clinics.

79
0:03:36.026,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We have paper forms to track drug supplies, blood supplies --

80
0:03:40.092,000 --> 0:03:43,000
all these different paper forms for many different topics,

81
0:03:43.35,000 --> 0:03:45,000
they all have a single, common endpoint,

82
0:03:45.69,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and the common endpoint looks something like this.

83
0:03:48.333,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And what we're looking at here is a truckful of data.

84
0:03:53.261,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey

85
0:03:57.15,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in a single district in the country of Zambia

86
0:03:59.365,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from a few years ago, that I participated in.

87
0:04:01.679,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The only thing anyone was trying to find out

88
0:04:04.05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is what percentage of Zambian children are vaccinated,

89
0:04:07.327,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and this is the data, collected on paper over weeks,

90
0:04:10.605,000 --> 0:04:11,000
from a single district,

91
0:04:11.812,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which is something like a county in the United States.

92
0:04:14.511,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You can imagine that, for the entire country of Zambia,

93
0:04:17.21,000 --> 0:04:19,000
answering just that single question ...

94
0:04:20.615,000 --> 0:04:21,000
looks something like this.

95
0:04:23.072,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Truck after truck after truck,

96
0:04:25.136,000 --> 0:04:27,000
filled with stack after stack after stack of data.

97
0:04:28.43,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And what makes it even worse is that's just the beginning.

98
0:04:31.666,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Because once you've collected all that data,

99
0:04:33.784,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of course, someone -- some unfortunate person --

100
0:04:36.348,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is going to have to type that into a computer.

101
0:04:38.587,000 --> 0:04:39,000
When I was a graduate student,

102
0:04:40.063,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I actually was that unfortunate person sometimes.

103
0:04:42.546,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I can tell you, I often wasn't really paying attention.

104
0:04:45.585,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I probably made a lot of mistakes when I did it

105
0:04:47.876,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that no one ever discovered, so data quality goes down.

106
0:04:50.52,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But eventually that data, hopefully, gets typed into a computer,

107
0:04:53.564,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and someone can begin to analyze it,

108
0:04:55.319,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and once they have an analysis and a report,

109
0:04:58.215,000 --> 0:05:01,000
hopefully, then you can take the results of that data collection

110
0:05:01.263,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and use it to vaccinate children better.

111
0:05:03.254,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Because if there's anything worse in the field of global public health --

112
0:05:08.819,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I don't know what's worse than allowing children on this planet

113
0:05:11.825,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to die of vaccine-preventable diseases --

114
0:05:14.679,000 --> 0:05:16,000
diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar.

115
0:05:17.835,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And millions of children die of these diseases every year.

116
0:05:21.211,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And the fact is, millions is a gross estimate,

117
0:05:24.209,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because we don't really know how many kids die each year of this.

118
0:05:27.73,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What makes it even more frustrating is that the data-entry part,

119
0:05:31.253,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the part that I used to do as a grad student,

120
0:05:33.467,000 --> 0:05:34,000
can take sometimes six months.

121
0:05:34.949,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer,

122
0:05:38.425,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And sometimes, actually not infrequently,

123
0:05:40.559,000 --> 0:05:41,000
it actually never happens.

124
0:05:42.411,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now try and wrap your head around that for a second.

125
0:05:44.911,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You just had teams of hundreds of people.

126
0:05:47.11,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They went out into the field to answer a particular question.

127
0:05:50.037,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars

128
0:05:52.457,000 --> 0:05:55,000
on fuel and photocopying and per diem.

129
0:05:56.072,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And then for some reason, momentum is lost

130
0:05:58.14,000 --> 0:05:59,000
or there's no money left,

131
0:05:59.557,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and all of that comes to nothing,

132
0:06:01.918,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because no one actually types it into the computer at all.

133
0:06:04.665,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The process just stops.

134
0:06:05.865,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Happens all the time.

135
0:06:07.813,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is what we base our decisions on in global health:

136
0:06:10.952,000 --> 0:06:13,000
little data, old data, no data.

137
0:06:15.924,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So back in 1995,

138
0:06:17.401,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I began to think about ways in which we could improve this process.

139
0:06:20.665,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now 1995 -- obviously, that was quite a long time ago.

140
0:06:23.357,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was.

141
0:06:26.359,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The top movie of the year was "Die Hard with a Vengeance."

142
0:06:29.121,000 --> 0:06:31,000
As you can see, Bruce Willis had a lot more hair back then.

143
0:06:31.962,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I was working in the Centers for Disease Control

144
0:06:34.651,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and I had a lot more hair back then as well.

145
0:06:37.505,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But to me, the most significant thing that I saw in 1995

146
0:06:40.473,000 --> 0:06:41,000
was this.

147
0:06:42.151,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Hard for us to imagine, but in 1995,

148
0:06:44.568,000 --> 0:06:47,000
this was the ultimate elite mobile device.

149
0:06:48.286,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It wasn't an iPhone. It wasn't a Galaxy phone.

150
0:06:50.866,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It was a PalmPilot.

151
0:06:52.254,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And when I saw the PalmPilot for the first time, I thought,

152
0:06:55.806,000 --> 0:06:57,000
"Why can't we put the forms on these PalmPilots?

153
0:06:58.758,000 --> 0:07:,000
And go out into the field just carrying one PalmPilot,

154
0:07:01.402,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms?

155
0:07:05.191,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Why don't we try to do that?

156
0:07:06.642,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Because if we can do that,

157
0:07:07.929,000 --> 0:07:1,000
if we can actually just collect the data electronically, digitally,

158
0:07:11.762,000 --> 0:07:12,000
from the very beginning,

159
0:07:13.443,000 --> 0:07:16,000
we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process

160
0:07:16.743,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of typing, of having somebody type that stuff into the computer.

161
0:07:21.759,000 --> 0:07:22,000
We can skip straight to the analysis

162
0:07:23.623,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives."

163
0:07:26.786,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So that's what I began to do.

164
0:07:29.397,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Working at CDC, I began to travel to different programs around the world

165
0:07:33.77,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and to train them in using PalmPilots to do data collection,

166
0:07:37.936,000 --> 0:07:38,000
instead of using paper.

167
0:07:39.338,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And it actually worked great.

168
0:07:41.25,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted.

169
0:07:44.326,000 --> 0:07:45,000
What do you know?

170
0:07:45.507,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Digital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper.

171
0:07:49.143,000 --> 0:07:51,000
While I was doing it, my business partner,

172
0:07:51.199,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Rose, who's here with her husband, Matthew, here in the audience,

173
0:07:54.302,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Rose was out doing similar stuff for the American Red Cross.

174
0:07:57.199,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The problem was, after a few years of doing that,

175
0:07:59.609,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I realized -- I had been to maybe six or seven programs --

176
0:08:03.53,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and I thought, you know, if I keep this up at this pace,

177
0:08:06.815,000 --> 0:08:07,000
over my whole career,

178
0:08:07.99,000 --> 0:08:09,000
maybe I'm going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs.

179
0:08:10.693,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But the problem is, 20 or 30 programs,

180
0:08:13.86,000 --> 0:08:15,000
like, training 20 or 30 programs to use this technology,

181
0:08:16.834,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that is a tiny drop in the bucket.

182
0:08:19.024,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The demand for this, the need for data to run better programs

183
0:08:22.988,000 --> 0:08:24,000
just within health -- not to mention all of the other fields

184
0:08:25.87,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in developing countries -- is enormous.

185
0:08:27.89,000 --> 0:08:3,000
There are millions and millions and millions of programs,

186
0:08:31.9,000 --> 0:08:33,000
millions of clinics that need to track drugs,

187
0:08:34.492,000 --> 0:08:35,000
millions of vaccine programs.

188
0:08:35.92,000 --> 0:08:37,000
There are schools that need to track attendance.

189
0:08:38.205,000 --> 0:08:41,000
There are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do.

190
0:08:42.135,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And I realized if I kept up the way that I was doing,

191
0:08:46.778,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I was basically hardly going to make any impact

192
0:08:50.022,000 --> 0:08:51,000
by the end of my career.

193
0:08:51.756,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And so I began to rack my brain,

194
0:08:53.648,000 --> 0:08:55,000
trying to think about, what was the process that I was doing?

195
0:08:56.616,000 --> 0:08:57,000
How was I training folks,

196
0:08:57.922,000 --> 0:09:,000
and what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles

197
0:09:01.12,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently?

198
0:09:03.839,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And, unfortunately, after thinking about this for some time,

199
0:09:06.699,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I identified the main obstacle.

200
0:09:10.475,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And the main obstacle, it turned out --

201
0:09:12.42,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and this is a sad realization --

202
0:09:14.032,000 --> 0:09:15,000
the main obstacle was me.

203
0:09:16.229,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So what do I mean by that?

204
0:09:18.538,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I had developed a process

205
0:09:20.278,000 --> 0:09:24,000
whereby I was the center of the universe of this technology.

206
0:09:26.304,000 --> 0:09:29,000
If you wanted to use this technology, you had to get in touch with me.

207
0:09:29.651,000 --> 0:09:3,000
That means you had to know I existed.

208
0:09:31.499,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Then you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country

209
0:09:34.936,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate.

210
0:09:38.555,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So you could be talking about 10- or 20- or 30,000 dollars,

211
0:09:41.578,000 --> 0:09:43,000
if I actually had the time or it fit my schedule

212
0:09:43.896,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and I wasn't on vacation.

213
0:09:45.594,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The point is that anything,

214
0:09:47.579,000 --> 0:09:49,000
any system that depends on a single human being

215
0:09:49.966,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or two or three or five human beings --

216
0:09:51.893,000 --> 0:09:52,000
it just doesn't scale.

217
0:09:53.57,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology,

218
0:09:56.793,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and we need to scale it now.

219
0:09:58.387,000 --> 0:10:,000
And so I began to think of ways in which I could basically

220
0:10:01.165,000 --> 0:10:03,000
take myself out of the picture.

221
0:10:06.071,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And, you know, I was thinking,

222
0:10:07.739,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"How could I take myself out of the picture?"

223
0:10:09.867,000 --> 0:10:1,000
for quite some time.

224
0:10:11.51,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I'd been trained that the way you distribute technology

225
0:10:15.01,000 --> 0:10:16,000
within international development

226
0:10:16.59,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is always consultant-based.

227
0:10:18.176,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's always guys that look pretty much like me,

228
0:10:21.201,000 --> 0:10:23,000
flying from countries that look pretty much like this

229
0:10:23.773,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to other countries with people with darker skin.

230
0:10:26.769,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And you go out there, and you spend money on airfare

231
0:10:29.255,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and you spend time and you spend per diem

232
0:10:32.515,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and you spend for a hotel and all that stuff.

233
0:10:34.888,000 --> 0:10:37,000
As far as I knew, that was the only way you could distribute technology,

234
0:10:38.324,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and I couldn't figure out a way around it.

235
0:10:40.383,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But the miracle that happened --

236
0:10:42.851,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I'm going to call it Hotmail for short.

237
0:10:45.168,000 --> 0:10:47,000
You may not think of Hotmail as being miraculous,

238
0:10:47.615,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but for me it was miraculous,

239
0:10:49.076,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because I noticed, just as I was wrestling with this problem --

240
0:10:52.712,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I was working in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly, at the time --

241
0:10:56.242,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I noticed that every sub-Saharan African health worker

242
0:10:58.831,000 --> 0:11:,000
that I was working with had a Hotmail account.

243
0:11:03.389,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And it struck me, "Wait a minute --

244
0:11:06.341,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I know the Hotmail people surely didn't fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya

245
0:11:10.603,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to train people in how to use Hotmail.

246
0:11:13.382,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So these guys are distributing technology, getting software capacity out there,

247
0:11:17.654,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but they're not actually flying around the world.

248
0:11:20.006,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I need to think about this more."

249
0:11:21.602,000 --> 0:11:22,000
While I was thinking about it,

250
0:11:23.076,000 --> 0:11:26,000
people started using even more things like this, just as we were.

251
0:11:26.259,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They started using LinkedIn and Flickr and Gmail and Google Maps --

252
0:11:29.514,000 --> 0:11:3,000
all these things.

253
0:11:30.695,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Of course, all of these things are cloud based

254
0:11:33.41,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and don't require any training.

255
0:11:35.583,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They don't require any programmers.

256
0:11:37.283,000 --> 0:11:38,000
They don't require consultants.

257
0:11:38.81,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Because the business model for all these businesses

258
0:11:41.319,000 --> 0:11:43,000
requires that something be so simple we can use it ourselves,

259
0:11:44.28,000 --> 0:11:45,000
with little or no training.

260
0:11:45.598,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You just have to hear about it and go to the website.

261
0:11:48.217,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And so I thought, what would happen if we built software

262
0:11:52.437,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to do what I'd been consulting in?

263
0:11:54.525,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Instead of training people how to put forms onto mobile devices,

264
0:11:58.621,000 --> 0:12:01,000
let's create software that lets them do it themselves with no training

265
0:12:01.946,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and without me being involved.

266
0:12:03.406,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And that's exactly what we did.

267
0:12:04.914,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So we created software called Magpi, which has an online form creator.

268
0:12:10.159,000 --> 0:12:11,000
No one has to speak to me,

269
0:12:11.435,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you just have to hear about it and go to the website.

270
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You can create forms, and once you've created the forms,

271
0:12:16.942,000 --> 0:12:18,000
you push them to a variety of common mobile phones.

272
0:12:19.427,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Obviously, nowadays, we've moved past PalmPilots to mobile phones.

273
0:12:22.968,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And it doesn't have to be a smartphone, it can be a basic phone,

274
0:12:26.221,000 --> 0:12:28,000
like the phone on the right, the basic Symbian phone

275
0:12:28.735,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that's very common in developing countries.

276
0:12:30.821,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And the great part about this is it's just like Hotmail.

277
0:12:34.534,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It's cloud based,

278
0:12:35.709,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and it doesn't require any training, programming, consultants.

279
0:12:38.986,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But there are some additional benefits as well.

280
0:12:41.213,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Now we knew when we built this system,

281
0:12:43.11,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the whole point of it, just like with the PalmPilots,

282
0:12:45.689,000 --> 0:12:47,000
was that you'd be able to collect the data

283
0:12:48.512,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and immediately upload the data and get your data set.

284
0:12:51.134,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But what we found, of course, since it's already on a computer,

285
0:12:54.143,000 --> 0:12:56,000
we can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing.

286
0:12:56.778,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We can take a process that took two years

287
0:12:58.873,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and compress that down to the space of five minutes.

288
0:13:02.222,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency.

289
0:13:04.74,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Cloud based, no training, no consultants, no me.

290
0:13:09.52,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And I told you that in the first few years

291
0:13:11.815,000 --> 0:13:13,000
of trying to do this the old-fashioned way,

292
0:13:13.908,000 --> 0:13:14,000
going out to each country,

293
0:13:15.211,000 --> 0:13:19,000
we probably trained about 1,000 people.

294
0:13:19.871,000 --> 0:13:2,000
What happened after we did this?

295
0:13:21.577,000 --> 0:13:22,000
In the second three years,

296
0:13:23.062,000 --> 0:13:25,000
we had 14,000 people find the website,

297
0:13:25.236,000 --> 0:13:27,000
sign up and start using it to collect data:

298
0:13:27.373,000 --> 0:13:28,000
data for disaster response,

299
0:13:29.307,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Canadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds,

300
0:13:33.765,000 --> 0:13:34,000
people tracking drug supplies.

301
0:13:36.241,000 --> 0:13:39,000
One of my favorite examples, the IRC, International Rescue Committee,

302
0:13:39.609,000 --> 0:13:42,000
they have a program where semi-literate midwives,

303
0:13:42.846,000 --> 0:13:44,000
using $10 mobile phones,

304
0:13:45.273,000 --> 0:13:48,000
send a text message using our software, once a week,

305
0:13:48.598,000 --> 0:13:5,000
with the number of births and the number of deaths,

306
0:13:51.098,000 --> 0:13:54,000
which gives IRC something that no one in global health has ever had:

307
0:13:54.694,000 --> 0:13:57,000
a near-real-time system of counting babies,

308
0:13:58.24,000 --> 0:13:59,000
of knowing how many kids are born,

309
0:13:59.898,000 --> 0:14:01,000
of knowing how many children there are in Sierra Leone,

310
0:14:02.564,000 --> 0:14:04,000
which is the country where this is happening,

311
0:14:04.811,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and knowing how many children die.

312
0:14:07.394,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Physicians for Human Rights --

313
0:14:08.991,000 --> 0:14:1,000
this is moving a little bit outside the health field --

314
0:14:11.607,000 --> 0:14:15,000
they're basically training people to do rape exams in Congo,

315
0:14:16.414,000 --> 0:14:17,000
where this is an epidemic,

316
0:14:17.887,000 --> 0:14:18,000
a horrible epidemic,

317
0:14:19.704,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and they're using our software to document the evidence they find,

318
0:14:22.904,000 --> 0:14:23,000
including photographically,

319
0:14:24.902,000 --> 0:14:26,000
so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice.

320
0:14:28.956,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Camfed, another charity based out of the UK --

321
0:14:32.573,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Camfed pays girls' families to keep them in school.

322
0:14:36.165,000 --> 0:14:39,000
They understand this is the most significant intervention they can make.

323
0:14:39.664,000 --> 0:14:42,000
They used to track the disbursements, the attendance, the grades, on paper.

324
0:14:43.528,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance

325
0:14:46.899,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and getting that into a report was about two to three years.

326
0:14:49.758,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Now it's real time.

327
0:14:50.933,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And because this is such a low-cost system and based in the cloud,

328
0:14:54.14,000 --> 0:14:57,000
it costs, for the entire five countries that Camfed runs this in,

329
0:14:58.153,000 --> 0:14:59,000
with tens of thousands of girls,

330
0:15:00.042,000 --> 0:15:02,000
the whole cost combined is 10,000 dollars a year.

331
0:15:03.154,000 --> 0:15:04,000
That's less than I used to get

332
0:15:05.139,000 --> 0:15:07,000
just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation.

333
0:15:10.139,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So I told you before that when we were doing it the old-fashioned way,

334
0:15:13.632,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket --

335
0:15:17.451,000 --> 0:15:18,000
10, 20, 30 different programs.

336
0:15:20.036,000 --> 0:15:21,000
We've made a lot of progress,

337
0:15:21.473,000 --> 0:15:22,000
but I recognize that right now,

338
0:15:23.053,000 --> 0:15:26,000
even the work that we've done with 14,000 people using this

339
0:15:26.441,000 --> 0:15:27,000
is still a drop in the bucket.

340
0:15:27.928,000 --> 0:15:29,000
But something's changed, and I think it should be obvious.

341
0:15:30.682,000 --> 0:15:32,000
What's changed now is,

342
0:15:32.861,000 --> 0:15:35,000
instead of having a program in which we're scaling at such a slow rate

343
0:15:36.187,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that we can never reach all the people who need us,

344
0:15:39.522,000 --> 0:15:42,000
we've made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us.

345
0:15:43.128,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We've created a tool that lets programs keep kids in school,

346
0:15:48.155,000 --> 0:15:51,000
track the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that die,

347
0:15:52.118,000 --> 0:15:55,000
catch criminals and successfully prosecute them --

348
0:15:55.919,000 --> 0:15:59,000
to do all these different things to learn more about what's going on,

349
0:16:00.365,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to understand more,

350
0:16:01.69,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to see more ...

351
0:16:03.911,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and to save lives and improve lives.

352
0:16:07.92,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Thank you.

353
0:16:09.096,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Applause)

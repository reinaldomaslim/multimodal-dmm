2
0:00:13.373,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So I've been thinking about how to explain this concept to you,

3
0:00:16.836,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I've decided I'm just going to start with something we all understand.

4
0:00:20.778,000 --> 0:00:22,000
To achieve great heights or change the world,

5
0:00:23.316,000 --> 0:00:25,000
no matter how smart we are, we all need people.

6
0:00:26.939,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And for conventional people,

7
0:00:29.214,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the universe seems to conspire to make them successful.

8
0:00:33.313,000 --> 0:00:34,000
For the unconventional,

9
0:00:34.668,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I think we need something that I like to call "co-conspirators."

10
0:00:39.587,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Co-conspirators are different not because they're different themselves,

11
0:00:44.17,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but because of the people who need them.

12
0:00:46.799,000 --> 0:00:48,000
They tend to be people who are willing to bend the rules --

13
0:00:49.735,000 --> 0:00:51,000
actually even break them sometimes --

14
0:00:52.211,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and challenge the status quo

15
0:00:54.138,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to stand beside someone who is going against societal norms.

16
0:00:58.494,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'm actually going to describe an experience that I had

17
0:01:01.276,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that first crystallized the idea of co-conspirators in my mind.

18
0:01:05.311,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In 2014,

19
0:01:07.193,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I was a corporate executive with an American multinational in India,

20
0:01:11.455,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and we were actually faced with an interesting problem:

21
0:01:15.266,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we didn't have enough women in the workforce.

22
0:01:18.397,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And just to give you some context,

23
0:01:20.415,000 --> 0:01:23,000
27 percent of women work in India.

24
0:01:23.816,000 --> 0:01:24,000
If you look at most of Asia,

25
0:01:25.296,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that number is around 48 percent.

26
0:01:27.803,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So we knew the numbers were deplorable,

27
0:01:30.214,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and it was manifesting itself in our own organization.

28
0:01:33.655,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So we decided -- actually, I'll just give you a quick example

29
0:01:36.843,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of a young engineer, a 25-year-old woman,

30
0:01:39.663,000 --> 0:01:41,000
who told us a great story about her daily life,

31
0:01:41.985,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to just exemplify it for us.

32
0:01:45.087,000 --> 0:01:47,000
She said, "As I walk out of the house in the morning,

33
0:01:47.639,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I am running around doing a bunch of chores,

34
0:01:50.37,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and my mother-in-law -- I live with my in-laws --

35
0:01:52.784,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is starting to get a little bit irritated,

36
0:01:56.099,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because she's going to be left with all the housework to do.

37
0:01:59.438,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And then, as I get back home in the evening,

38
0:02:01.566,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I've overshot the time I'm going to be home by an hour or two at least,

39
0:02:04.951,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and by then, two of my biggest champions,

40
0:02:07.229,000 --> 0:02:08,000
my father-in-law and my husband,

41
0:02:09.148,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are also starting to get a little bit irritated.

42
0:02:11.445,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And my mother-in-law is furious, because she's taken care of everything

43
0:02:14.818,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that needs to be done.

44
0:02:16.016,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And through the middle of the day,

45
0:02:17.689,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I'm actually surrounded by men my age,

46
0:02:19.926,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and there's only one expectation from them by society.

47
0:02:23.294,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's to achieve in their careers

48
0:02:25.579,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and provide for their families financially.

49
0:02:28.87,000 --> 0:02:31,000
How do you expect me to bring this same level of enthusiasm,

50
0:02:32.251,000 --> 0:02:34,000
excitement and passion to the workplace?"

51
0:02:35.444,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And she was right.

52
0:02:37.526,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And I thought the women's network volunteers

53
0:02:41.303,000 --> 0:02:42,000
came up with a great idea.

54
0:02:43.709,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They instituted a "bring your mother-in-law to work" day.

55
0:02:48.802,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So we heralded a group of mothers-in-law

56
0:02:51.524,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and a few mothers into the office,

57
0:02:54.071,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and we took them to our R and D labs.

58
0:02:56.43,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We took them to the medical equipment

59
0:02:58.448,000 --> 0:03:,000
that their daughters-in-law were creating and building.

60
0:03:01.402,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And as we did, we described to them what their daughters-in-law actually did:

61
0:03:05.887,000 --> 0:03:08,000
they impacted maternal mortality rates and infant mortality rates.

62
0:03:09.594,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They brought them down.

63
0:03:11.019,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They identified complex diseases

64
0:03:13.472,000 --> 0:03:16,000
early enough to be able to prevent and cure them.

65
0:03:17.474,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And then we took them to lunch.

66
0:03:19.061,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We gave them a lavish lunch and thanked them for the role they played

67
0:03:22.929,000 --> 0:03:25,000
for freeing up a young woman to work shoulder to shoulder with us

68
0:03:26.667,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to literally change the world.

69
0:03:29.418,000 --> 0:03:31,000
There wasn't a dry eye in the room.

70
0:03:32.542,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Every one of these women were grateful and proud.

71
0:03:35.733,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They were proud of who their daughters-in-law were,

72
0:03:38.353,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but they were grateful to be included as part of the conversation.

73
0:03:42.028,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And I wondered at the time

74
0:03:43.413,000 --> 0:03:47,000
whether what we'd done was just a great touchy-feely moment

75
0:03:47.515,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and was cute

76
0:03:48.733,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but really wasn't going to have long-term impact.

77
0:03:51.185,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And a couple of days later, one of my mentees swung by my office,

78
0:03:54.388,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and she was super excited.

79
0:03:56.231,000 --> 0:03:58,000
She said, "I went home from work yesterday,

80
0:03:58.692,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and I was bracing myself, because I was really late,

81
0:04:01.797,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and I was bracing myself for a lecture,

82
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and my mother-in-law turned to my husband and said,

83
0:04:06.962,000 --> 0:04:08,000
'Can you please get up and make her a cup of tea?

84
0:04:09.326,000 --> 0:04:1,000
She's exhausted.

85
0:04:10.612,000 --> 0:04:12,000
She's saving lives. You work at a bank.'"

86
0:04:12.954,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:14.687,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And there you had it.

88
0:04:16.267,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You had the perfect co-conspirator,

89
0:04:18.829,000 --> 0:04:2,000
someone that we don't always recognize or value,

90
0:04:21.737,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but was changing the way somebody else could challenge the status quo,

91
0:04:26.056,000 --> 0:04:27,000
by standing beside her

92
0:04:27.943,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and questioning the societal norms

93
0:04:30.351,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and making a difference.

94
0:04:32.141,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The next example I'm going to use will be closer to almost everyone in this room.

95
0:04:37.25,000 --> 0:04:41,000
When I graduated from business school and started working in a company,

96
0:04:41.618,000 --> 0:04:44,000
a group of us, my peers and I, were asked to work on a strategy

97
0:04:45.496,000 --> 0:04:48,000
for a business that hadn't been doing too well over the last decade

98
0:04:48.749,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and was being neglected.

99
0:04:50.724,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We put our hearts and souls into it,

100
0:04:52.56,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and we did a lot of analysis on our nights and weekends

101
0:04:55.269,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and put together what we thought was a good strategy.

102
0:04:57.818,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And after presenting it to a number of people

103
0:05:00.024,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that we were getting buy-in with,

104
0:05:01.667,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we were actually asked to present to the global CEO

105
0:05:04.41,000 --> 0:05:07,000
at his annual strategy meet that happened over a week.

106
0:05:08.947,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And we were both excited and apprehensive as we flew into headquarters.

107
0:05:12.403,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We were excited because this was an opportunity

108
0:05:14.648,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to show how much we had learned.

109
0:05:16.801,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But we were also nervous because, though a brilliant, dynamic man,

110
0:05:20.395,000 --> 0:05:24,000
he had a fiery temper and wasn't really the easiest person to present to.

111
0:05:25.282,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Five or six hours before our presentation, a senior colleague pulled us aside

112
0:05:29.587,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and sat down and gave us a front-seat view of what had happened all week.

113
0:05:33.657,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We knew about people who had bombed their presentations.

114
0:05:36.437,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We knew about people who had almost been instantaneously promoted in the room.

115
0:05:40.373,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We knew what was keeping the CEO up at night

116
0:05:42.913,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and what he thought were tailwinds to the business.

117
0:05:46.717,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And when we walked into that presentation later in the day,

118
0:05:49.846,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we actually got buy-in with both the CEO

119
0:05:54.177,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and his senior staff.

120
0:05:55.981,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And it wasn't just because of our analysis or our strategy.

121
0:05:58.984,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It was because we were prepped

122
0:06:00.88,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to be able to communicate in a way that the team could absorb.

123
0:06:05.3,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now, this senior colleague of ours didn't pull us aside,

124
0:06:07.95,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because he wanted to gossip.

125
0:06:09.857,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He pulled us aside because he believed we were unconventional in the boardroom.

126
0:06:14.38,000 --> 0:06:17,000
That unconventionality was exactly why he wanted us to think about

127
0:06:18.141,000 --> 0:06:19,000
this new, fresh perspective

128
0:06:20.128,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and provide a view on where this business should go.

129
0:06:22.823,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But he also knew it was a distinct disadvantage for us,

130
0:06:25.552,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because we didn't know how to present in that room,

131
0:06:27.979,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and we hadn't done it before,

132
0:06:29.584,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and they weren't used to receiving us.

133
0:06:32.331,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And that again is an example, in my mind,

134
0:06:35.019,000 --> 0:06:37,000
of somebody bending the rules.

135
0:06:37.207,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Because he decided to co-conspire with us,

136
0:06:40.075,000 --> 0:06:42,000
he not only changed the career trajectories

137
0:06:42.885,000 --> 0:06:47,000
of six young people in the organization who suddenly got all this visibility,

138
0:06:48.54,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but he actually changed the trajectory of a business

139
0:06:51.943,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that people were neglecting and didn't have any fresh ideas for.

140
0:06:56.615,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The last example I want to share with you

141
0:06:58.62,000 --> 0:07:,000
is actually very far removed from the corporate world

142
0:07:01.201,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and somewhat personal.

143
0:07:02.717,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This is the story of my mother.

144
0:07:04.8,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In her early 20s, she lost her father.

145
0:07:07.483,000 --> 0:07:1,000
He had passed away in his late 40s,

146
0:07:10.963,000 --> 0:07:12,000
leaving behind six children,

147
0:07:13.869,000 --> 0:07:15,000
four younger siblings and one older sibling than her,

148
0:07:16.811,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and a widowed mother who had never worked.

149
0:07:20.496,000 --> 0:07:22,000
My mom and her older sister realized

150
0:07:22.596,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that they actually needed to start earning an income --

151
0:07:25.29,000 --> 0:07:26,000
they were both in grad school --

152
0:07:26.944,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to ensure the rest of the siblings could get through their schooling

153
0:07:30.302,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and start to work.

154
0:07:32.195,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So she shifted her law school classes to evening classes,

155
0:07:35.79,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and she started to work during the day as a schoolteacher

156
0:07:38.482,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to bring home an income.

157
0:07:40.473,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And every day, she would actually get off a bus

158
0:07:43.158,000 --> 0:07:46,000
at the end of her evening law school classes

159
0:07:46.31,000 --> 0:07:47,000
on the streets of Calcutta.

160
0:07:47.695,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Now, mind you,

161
0:07:48.873,000 --> 0:07:51,000
this is a woman who wasn't used to taking public transportation at all,

162
0:07:52.3,000 --> 0:07:53,000
let alone at night.

163
0:07:53.643,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And as she would get off the bus,

164
0:07:55.296,000 --> 0:07:58,000
she would take about a seven- to eight-minute walk to her home

165
0:07:58.63,000 --> 0:07:59,000
from the bus stop

166
0:07:59.98,000 --> 0:08:01,000
on a street that was largely deserted,

167
0:08:02.629,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because it was a residential street

168
0:08:04.828,000 --> 0:08:08,000
with some shops that closed around 8pm or a little bit before that.

169
0:08:09.799,000 --> 0:08:12,000
One day, a store owner was closing his store a little bit later than usual,

170
0:08:13.72,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because there was a customer who had actually left a little bit later.

171
0:08:17.112,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And he saw my mother get off the bus.

172
0:08:19.583,000 --> 0:08:2,000
He waited for her.

173
0:08:20.777,000 --> 0:08:21,000
He actually knew the family.

174
0:08:22.178,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The store had been in the neighborhood for more than 20 years,

175
0:08:25.416,000 --> 0:08:27,000
so he knew her since she was a baby.

176
0:08:27.957,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He watched her walk to the street that her house was on,

177
0:08:32.455,000 --> 0:08:35,000
turned off the lights, shut the store and went home.

178
0:08:36.392,000 --> 0:08:39,000
From the next day, he found that he waited for her every single day

179
0:08:39.866,000 --> 0:08:41,000
until he she made her way to her own house.

180
0:08:44.631,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Other store owners on that same street suddenly noticed this one store

181
0:08:49.29,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that was open longer,

182
0:08:50.465,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and suddenly started to see a bunch of end-of-day customers walk in

183
0:08:54.896,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to buy odds and ends that,

184
0:08:56.929,000 --> 0:08:59,000
from after their long day from work and their commute home,

185
0:09:00.705,000 --> 0:09:02,000
realized they hadn't picked up for the next morning.

186
0:09:03.663,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Some people who came in the mornings also started to come the night before.

187
0:09:08.438,000 --> 0:09:11,000
A few of the storekeepers decided that actually what was happening

188
0:09:11.74,000 --> 0:09:13,000
was he was monopolizing a bunch of customers,

189
0:09:13.906,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and they started to keep their store lights on

190
0:09:16.254,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and keep their shop open till 9 o'clock.

191
0:09:19.354,000 --> 0:09:21,000
From that time on, my mother had a lit street

192
0:09:22.304,000 --> 0:09:24,000
with plenty of activity on the street.

193
0:09:25.51,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I believe that that store owner was my mother's co-conspirator.

194
0:09:30.526,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Because of him,

195
0:09:31.918,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a small change to what was conventional on that street at the time

196
0:09:36.893,000 --> 0:09:38,000
allowed for her and her family

197
0:09:38.962,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to do something that was completely unconventional.

198
0:09:41.391,000 --> 0:09:44,000
A woman her age from an upper-middle-class family

199
0:09:44.53,000 --> 0:09:45,000
actually got married at that age

200
0:09:46.471,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or studied in grad school with the protection of their family.

201
0:09:49.887,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Because of that store owner,

202
0:09:52.147,000 --> 0:09:55,000
all of my mother's siblings went on to become engineers,

203
0:09:55.677,000 --> 0:09:57,000
lawyers, accountants and teachers,

204
0:09:58.158,000 --> 0:10:,000
and my mother went on to become a lawyer.

205
0:10:01.911,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The world needs co-conspirators.

206
0:10:06.801,000 --> 0:10:1,000
As we get into a complex environment where more and more complex problems exist

207
0:10:10.951,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and we need to find more solutions,

208
0:10:12.935,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we need unconventional people in our boardrooms and at the table.

209
0:10:17.323,000 --> 0:10:18,000
For that to happen,

210
0:10:18.631,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we need co-conspirators.

211
0:10:20.789,000 --> 0:10:21,000
In my own life,

212
0:10:22.019,000 --> 0:10:23,000
whether it's because of my gender,

213
0:10:23.673,000 --> 0:10:25,000
my ethnicity or sometimes,

214
0:10:25.731,000 --> 0:10:28,000
as I've been living in this part of the world for over a decade, my accent,

215
0:10:29.532,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I'm often perceived to be unconventional.

216
0:10:32.275,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It's my co-conspirators that have shown me the path forward,

217
0:10:35.491,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and actually, it's my co-conspirators that keep me seeking out

218
0:10:39.417,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the unconventional paths to go down.

219
0:10:42.322,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So what I'd like to ask of all of you today

220
0:10:44.616,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is that you look around and find the people

221
0:10:46.707,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that inspire you to co-conspire.

222
0:10:49.025,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I promise you that your empathy

223
0:10:51.557,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and your courage

224
0:10:53.303,000 --> 0:10:54,000
will change someone's life

225
0:10:55.046,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and may even change the world.

226
0:10:57.496,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Thank you.

227
0:10:58.715,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Images like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp,

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:34,000
have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and have given us a new understanding of who we are,

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
where we've come from and the times we live in.

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:46,000
During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities

6
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides,

7
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old,

8
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur

9
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and the daily horrors of Iraq.

10
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This has led to a common understanding of our situation,

11
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps

12
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril.

13
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Here is an example

14
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe

15
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life

16
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems,

17
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown,

18
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes

19
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate

20
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.

21
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We teach it to our children. We hear it on television

22
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session

23
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
was, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidence

24
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong,

25
0:01:56,000 --> 0:02:,000
that, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are,

26
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time,

27
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.

28
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,

29
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory

30
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you

31
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence

32
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia,

33
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
over centuries, over decades and over years,

34
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset

35
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it

36
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
all over the world, although not homogeneously.

37
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's especially evident in the West, beginning with England

38
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment.

39
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 --

40
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
from the millennium scale to the year scale --

41
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans

42
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements

43
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought

44
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist

45
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Lawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates

46
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
among contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source

47
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion.

48
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Here is a graph that he put together

49
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare

50
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies.

51
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die

52
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
at the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away

53
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies

54
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.

55
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die

56
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
at the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi,

57
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
only a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lower

58
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States

59
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deaths

60
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed

61
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:2,000
during the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million.

62
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Also at the millennium scale, we can look

63
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:28,000
at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described

64
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values,

65
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare,

66
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
such as the following from Numbers 31: "And they warred

67
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,

68
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them,

69
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every male

70
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man

71
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:57,000
by lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man

72
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'" In other words,

73
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:05,000
kill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins,

74
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them.

75
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk.

76
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Also in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty

77
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:2,000
was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality,

78
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents --

79
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.

80
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Well, let's click the zoom lens

81
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:34,000
down one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.

82
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout

83
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the Middle Ages to modern times,

84
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we know just from conventional history -- the evidence

85
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction

86
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in socially sanctioned forms of violence.

87
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:54,000
For example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture

88
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
were routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction

89
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
today that would give you a fine, in those days would result in

90
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
your tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded,

91
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
a hand being chopped off and so on.

92
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:11,000
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:

93
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel,

94
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
being pulled apart by horses and so on.

95
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes:

96
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:26,000
criticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery, of course,

97
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
was the preferred labor-saving device, and cruelty was

98
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
a popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example

99
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
was the practice of cat burning, in which a cat was hoisted

100
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,

101
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat, howling in pain,

102
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
was burned to death.

103
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
What about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics,

104
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because many municipalities recorded the cause of death.

105
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The criminologist Manuel Eisner

106
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
scoured all of the historical records across Europe

107
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
for homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county

108
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that he could find, and he supplemented them

109
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
with national data, when nations started keeping statistics.

110
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:22,000
He plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths

111
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:28,000
per 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate

112
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:33,000
of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down

113
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year

114
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptick

115
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead

116
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.

117
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude

118
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present,

119
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century.

120
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Let's click down now to the decade scale.

121
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
According to non-governmental organizations

122
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,

123
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:14,000
there has been a steep decline in interstate wars,

124
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups,

125
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
even in South America. Worldwide, there's been a steep decline

126
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number

127
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.

128
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths

129
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:42,000
per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths

130
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:46,000
per conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is.

131
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Even in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.

132
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Since the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars,

133
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:59,000
fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs --

134
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.

135
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:09,000
This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see

136
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,

137
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
then it soared upward for several decades, and began

138
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:21,000
a precipitous decline, starting in the 1990s, so that it went back

139
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.

140
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
President Clinton, if you're here, thank you.

141
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

142
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So the question is, why are so many people so wrong

143
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
about something so important? I think there are a number of reasons.

144
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:39,000
One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press

145
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth

146
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:47,000
than sixteenth-century monks were.

147
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:52,000
There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is

148
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to recall specific instances of something,

149
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the higher the probability that you assign to it.

150
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage

151
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying

152
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion

153
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocates

154
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and donors by saying

155
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
things just seem to be getting better and better.

156
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

157
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples

158
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge

159
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
there could be anything good about Western culture.

160
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And of course, our change in standards can outpace the change

161
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
in behavior. One of the reasons violence went down

162
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time.

163
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That's a process that seems to be continuing,

164
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day,

165
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
things always look more barbaric than they would have been

166
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:56,000
by historic standards. So today, we get exercised -- and rightly so --

167
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:02,000
if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection

168
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:06,000
in Texas after a 15-year appeal process. We don't consider

169
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that a couple of hundred years ago, they may have been burned

170
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial

171
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeated

172
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
over and over again. Today, we look at capital punishment

173
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
as evidence of how low our behavior can sink,

174
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
rather than how high our standards have risen.

175
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Well, why has violence declined? No one really knows,

176
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think,

177
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
have some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe

178
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said

179
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish

180
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and short." Not because, he argued,

181
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
humans have some primordial thirst for blood

182
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative,

183
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy,

184
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:05,000
there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively,

185
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
before they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schelling

186
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling

187
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol

188
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.

189
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand.

190
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Now, each one of them is thinking,

191
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:25,000
"I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.

192
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Maybe I had better shoot him, before he shoots me,

193
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
especially since, even if he doesn't want to kill me,

194
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:34,000
he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him

195
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
before he kills me." And so on.

196
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought,

197
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.

198
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.

199
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:55,000
You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy

200
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.

201
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
The only thing is that it's

202
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
liable to having its bluff called, and therefore can only work

203
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:09,000
if it's credible. To make it credible, you must avenge all insults

204
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and settle all scores, which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta.

205
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution,

206
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:23,000
the "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate use

207
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:28,000
of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan --

208
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack,

209
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:35,000
because any kind of aggression will be punished,

210
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:4,000
leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation

211
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.

212
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation

213
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would lead

214
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to a state of peace. Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates

215
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that you failed to see in the earlier slide --

216
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe

217
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:08,000
coincided with the rise of centralized states.

218
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.

219
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence

220
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:19,000
in zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires,

221
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:23,000
frontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on.

222
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:28,000
The second explanation is that in many times and places,

223
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.

224
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:36,000
In earlier times, when suffering and early death were common

225
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:4,000
in one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them

226
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:44,000
on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life

227
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:48,000
longer and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.

228
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.

229
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:56,000
A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game,

230
0:14:56,000 --> 0:15:,000
and was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist

231
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances,

232
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties

233
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:13,000
in an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade

234
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:17,000
their surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties

235
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend

236
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that results in them not having to fight the whole time.

237
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Wright argues that technology has increased the number

238
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in,

239
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
by allowing the trade of goods, services and ideas

240
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:37,000
over longer distances and among larger groups of people.

241
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,

242
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it,

243
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
"Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb

244
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
the Japanese is that they built my mini-van."

245
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Laughter)

246
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:58,000
The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book

247
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:01,000
called "The Expanding Circle," by the philosopher Peter Singer,

248
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense

249
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:1,000
of empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests

250
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:14,000
as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by default

251
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:18,000
we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family.

252
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:21,000
People outside that circle are treated as sub-human,

253
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and can be exploited with impunity. But, over history,

254
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:29,000
the circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record,

255
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
it expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe,

256
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
to the nation, to other races, to both sexes,

257
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend

258
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:43,000
to other sentient species. The question is,

259
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
if this has happened, what has powered that expansion?

260
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles

261
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:53,000
of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.

262
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:58,000
The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact

263
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:02,000
with other people, the more you realize that it is untenable

264
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:06,000
to privilege your interests over theirs,

265
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:09,000
at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say

266
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
that my interests are special compared to yours,

267
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
anymore than you can say that the particular spot

268
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:17,000
that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe

269
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:2,000
because I happen to be standing on it that very minute.

270
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:25,000
It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories,

271
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel,

272
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives

273
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human,

274
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station

275
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:44,000
in life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I."

276
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Whatever its causes, the decline of violence, I think,

277
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:53,000
has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just, why

278
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:57,000
is there war? But also, why is there peace? Not just,

279
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:01,000
what are we doing wrong? But also, what have we been doing right?

280
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Because we have been doing something right,

281
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and it sure would be good to find out what it is.

282
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Thank you very much.

283
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:18,000
(Applause).

284
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say

285
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:25,000
that that expansion of -- that you were talking about,

286
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:28,000
that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology,

287
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:32,000
by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world

288
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:35,000
is therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth?

289
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Steven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory,

290
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:43,000
that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation

291
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
over larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps us

292
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:52,000
imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read

293
0:18:52,000 --> 0:18:55,000
these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think,

294
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:57,000
how could they possibly have done it,

295
0:18:57,000 --> 0:18:59,000
how could they have not have empathized with the person

296
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:02,000
that they're disemboweling? But clearly,

297
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:06,000
as far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being

298
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:09,000
that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think,

299
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:11,000
that makes it easier to imagine trading places

300
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:15,000
with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration

301
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:16,000
to that other person.

302
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
CA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talk

303
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:22,000
at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.

304
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:23,000
SP: My pleasure.

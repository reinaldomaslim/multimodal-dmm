Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears,

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
these are the dancing bears.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
In 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to try and find out what was going on.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because of this.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
who live across India,

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and have been in India since the 13th century.

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We went about getting evidence of what was going on.

11
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button.

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And we went in, pretending to be buyers.

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka.

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and being sold and traded.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each,

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and they are used for bear paw soup,

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and also being trained, later on,

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to become dancing bears like the one you just saw.

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Sadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear.

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The couple are barely 18 years old.

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They already have four children beside them. You can see them.

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals.

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.

25
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now, when we started working deeper and digging deeper,

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we found that it's an illegal act.

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
These guys could go to jail for up to seven years

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
if they were caught by authorities.

29
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling.

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It was unacceptable.

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The mother bears are usually killed.

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The cubs, which are taken, are separated.

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.

34
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that

36
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
for a livelihood, to getting something else.

37
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
So, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment.

38
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And we were so unsure that this would work.

39
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him.

40
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.

41
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Let's see if you can get something else." And we got the bear surrendered

42
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to -- we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India.

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.

44
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
He has a telephone booth.

45
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And then it started, there was no turning back after that.

46
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.

47
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store

48
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
near Agra.

49
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Then there was no looking back at all for us.

50
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We gave cycle rickshaws.

51
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We set up carpet-weaving units,

52
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
vocational training for the women.

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community

54
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that.

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Education. The kids never went to school.

56
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They only had Islamic education, very little of it.

57
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And they were never allowed to go to school

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education.

59
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So, we sponsor 600 children education programs today.

60
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.

61
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Of course we also had to get the bears in.

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is what happens to the bears when they come in.

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And this is what we turn them into.

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So, basically in 2002 there were

66
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
1,200 dancing bears.

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We rescued over 550 dancing bears.

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The big news that I want to announce today

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is that next month we will be bringing in

71
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the very last bear of India,

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
into our rescue center.

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Applause)

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice

75
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which has been here for centuries.

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And the people can hold their heads up high.

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that they've lived all their lives.

79
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.

80
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And there will be no more removing of these bears.

81
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And the children, both humans and bear cubs

82
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
can live peacefully. Thank you.

83
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.706,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood

2
0:00:15.417,000 --> 0:00:18,000
are of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar,

3
0:00:18.968,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in our four-family home in Brooklyn, New York.

4
0:00:22.768,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Her apartment was an oasis.

5
0:00:25.843,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee,

6
0:00:27.888,000 --> 0:00:3,000
which was really warm milk with just a touch of caffeine.

7
0:00:31.769,000 --> 0:00:33,000
She loved life.

8
0:00:34.303,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And although she worked in a factory,

9
0:00:36.798,000 --> 0:00:39,000
she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.

10
0:00:39.97,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I remember poring over those pictures with her

11
0:00:43.299,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and then dancing with her to her favorite music.

12
0:00:47.411,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And then, when I was eight and she was 60,

13
0:00:52.033,000 --> 0:00:54,000
something changed.

14
0:00:54.086,000 --> 0:00:56,000
She no longer worked or traveled.

15
0:00:56.44,000 --> 0:00:57,000
She no longer danced.

16
0:00:58.131,000 --> 0:01:,000
There were no more coffee times.

17
0:01:00.884,000 --> 0:01:02,000
My mother missed work and took her to doctors

18
0:01:03.068,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who couldn't make a diagnosis.

19
0:01:05.454,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And my father, who worked at night, would spend every afternoon with her,

20
0:01:10.791,000 --> 0:01:13,000
just to make sure she ate.

21
0:01:13.876,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Her care became all-consuming for our family.

22
0:01:18.576,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And by the time a diagnosis was made,

23
0:01:20.223,000 --> 0:01:22,000
she was in a deep spiral.

24
0:01:22.928,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Now many of you will recognize her symptoms.

25
0:01:26.489,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My grandmother had depression.

26
0:01:29.152,000 --> 0:01:32,000
A deep, life-altering depression,

27
0:01:32.472,000 --> 0:01:35,000
from which she never recovered.

28
0:01:35.562,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And back then, so little was known about depression.

29
0:01:39.253,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But even today, 50 years later,

30
0:01:42.658,000 --> 0:01:45,000
there's still so much more to learn.

31
0:01:45.932,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Today, we know that women are 70 percent more likely

32
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to experience depression over their lifetimes

33
0:01:53.831,000 --> 0:01:55,000
compared with men.

34
0:01:56.112,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And even with this high prevalence,

35
0:01:58.952,000 --> 0:02:04,000
women are misdiagnosed between 30 and 50 percent of the time.

36
0:02:05.239,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now we know that women are more likely

37
0:02:08.172,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to experience the symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance,

38
0:02:13.56,000 --> 0:02:15,000
pain and anxiety compared with men.

39
0:02:16.105,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And these symptoms are often overlooked

40
0:02:18.804,000 --> 0:02:2,000
as symptoms of depression.

41
0:02:21.767,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And it isn't only depression in which these sex differences occur,

42
0:02:25.55,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but they occur across so many diseases.

43
0:02:30.069,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So it's my grandmother's struggles

44
0:02:32.064,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that have really led me on a lifelong quest.

45
0:02:35.797,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And today, I lead a center in which the mission

46
0:02:39.025,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is to discover why these sex differences occur

47
0:02:42.804,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and to use that knowledge

48
0:02:44.906,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to improve the health of women.

49
0:02:47.865,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Today, we know that every cell has a sex.

50
0:02:51.998,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, that's a term coined by the Institute of Medicine.

51
0:02:55.951,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And what it means is that men and women are different

52
0:02:59.712,000 --> 0:03:03,000
down to the cellular and molecular levels.

53
0:03:04.154,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It means that we're different across all of our organs.

54
0:03:09.094,000 --> 0:03:14,000
From our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.

55
0:03:14.589,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, it was only 20 years ago

56
0:03:18.473,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that we hardly had any data on women's health

57
0:03:22.3,000 --> 0:03:24,000
beyond our reproductive functions.

58
0:03:25.183,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But then in 1993,

59
0:03:28.084,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.

60
0:03:32.696,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And what this law did was it mandated

61
0:03:35.299,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that women and minorities be included in clinical trials

62
0:03:39.772,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that were funded by the National Institutes of Health.

63
0:03:43.823,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And in many ways, the law has worked.

64
0:03:46.75,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Women are now routinely included in clinical studies,

65
0:03:50.42,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and we've learned that there are major differences

66
0:03:52.671,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in the ways that women and men

67
0:03:54.764,000 --> 0:03:56,000
experience disease.

68
0:03:57.3,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But remarkably,

69
0:03:59.465,000 --> 0:04:04,000
what we have learned about these differences is often overlooked.

70
0:04:04.559,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So, we have to ask ourselves the question:

71
0:04:08.384,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Why leave women's health to chance?

72
0:04:12.897,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And we're leaving it to chance in two ways.

73
0:04:15.54,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The first is that there is so much more to learn

74
0:04:19.237,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and we're not making the investment

75
0:04:21.646,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences.

76
0:04:25.814,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And the second is that we aren't taking what we have learned,

77
0:04:30.536,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and routinely applying it in clinical care.

78
0:04:34.24,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We are just not doing enough.

79
0:04:38.229,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So, I'm going to share with you three examples

80
0:04:40.488,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of where sex differences have impacted the health of women,

81
0:04:44.194,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and where we need to do more.

82
0:04:46.864,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Let's start with heart disease.

83
0:04:48.876,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's the number one killer of women in the United States today.

84
0:04:54.078,000 --> 0:04:56,000
This is the face of heart disease.

85
0:04:56.974,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Linda is a middle-aged woman,

86
0:04:59.255,000 --> 0:05:01,000
who had a stent placed in one of the arteries

87
0:05:01.84,000 --> 0:05:03,000
going to her heart.

88
0:05:03.94,000 --> 0:05:06,000
When she had recurring symptoms she went back to her doctor.

89
0:05:07.191,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Her doctor did the gold standard test:

90
0:05:09.829,000 --> 0:05:11,000
a cardiac catheterization.

91
0:05:12.116,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It showed no blockages.

92
0:05:14.533,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Linda's symptoms continued.

93
0:05:16.605,000 --> 0:05:18,000
She had to stop working.

94
0:05:19.078,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And that's when she found us.

95
0:05:21.83,000 --> 0:05:25,000
When Linda came to us, we did another cardiac catheterization

96
0:05:25.978,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and this time, we found clues.

97
0:05:29.395,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But we needed another test

98
0:05:31.869,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to make the diagnosis.

99
0:05:34.463,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound,

100
0:05:39.043,000 --> 0:05:41,000
where you use soundwaves to look at the artery

101
0:05:41.348,000 --> 0:05:43,000
from the inside out.

102
0:05:44.079,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And what we found

103
0:05:46.017,000 --> 0:05:48,000
was that Linda's disease didn't look like

104
0:05:48.468,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the typical male disease.

105
0:05:51.538,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The typical male disease looks like this.

106
0:05:54.734,000 --> 0:05:57,000
There's a discrete blockage or stenosis.

107
0:05:58.046,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Linda's disease, like the disease of so many women,

108
0:06:02.347,000 --> 0:06:03,000
looks like this.

109
0:06:04.189,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely

110
0:06:07.726,000 --> 0:06:1,000
along the artery, and it's harder to see.

111
0:06:11.698,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So for Linda, and for so many women,

112
0:06:15.104,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the gold standard test wasn't gold.

113
0:06:18.796,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, Linda received the right treatment.

114
0:06:21.783,000 --> 0:06:23,000
She went back to her life and, fortunately, today

115
0:06:23.961,000 --> 0:06:24,000
she is doing well.

116
0:06:25.713,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But Linda was lucky.

117
0:06:27.319,000 --> 0:06:29,000
She found us, we found her disease.

118
0:06:29.945,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But for too many women, that's not the case.

119
0:06:32.856,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We have the tools.

120
0:06:35.171,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We have the technology to make the diagnosis.

121
0:06:38.852,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But it's all too often that these sex diffferences

122
0:06:42.249,000 --> 0:06:44,000
are overlooked.

123
0:06:44.553,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So what about treatment?

124
0:06:46.726,000 --> 0:06:48,000
A landmark study that was published two years ago

125
0:06:49.436,000 --> 0:06:51,000
asked the very important question:

126
0:06:51.858,000 --> 0:06:56,000
What are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women?

127
0:06:56.913,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The authors looked at papers written over a 10-year period,

128
0:07:00.572,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and hundreds had to be thrown out.

129
0:07:03.05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And what they found out was that of those that were tossed out,

130
0:07:07.823,000 --> 0:07:1,000
65 percent were excluded

131
0:07:11.477,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because even though women were included in the studies,

132
0:07:15.841,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the analysis didn't differentiate between women and men.

133
0:07:22.197,000 --> 0:07:25,000
What a lost opportunity.

134
0:07:25.418,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The money had been spent

135
0:07:27.449,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and we didn't learn how women fared.

136
0:07:29.596,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And these studies could not contribute one iota

137
0:07:32.397,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to the very, very important question,

138
0:07:34.814,000 --> 0:07:36,000
what are the most effective treatments

139
0:07:37.205,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for heart disease in women?

140
0:07:40.1,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I want to introduce you to Hortense, my godmother,

141
0:07:45.592,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Hung Wei, a relative of a colleague,

142
0:07:49.035,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and somebody you may recognize --

143
0:07:51.226,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Dana, Christopher Reeve's wife.

144
0:07:54.873,000 --> 0:07:58,000
All three women have something very important in common.

145
0:07:59.233,000 --> 0:08:02,000
All three were diagnosed with lung cancer,

146
0:08:02.808,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the number one cancer killer of women

147
0:08:05.737,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in the United States today.

148
0:08:08.438,000 --> 0:08:11,000
All three were nonsmokers.

149
0:08:12.314,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Sadly, Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease.

150
0:08:17.48,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Today, what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely

151
0:08:23.62,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men

152
0:08:26.357,000 --> 0:08:27,000
who are nonsmokers.

153
0:08:28.343,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now interestingly, when women are diagnosed with lung cancer,

154
0:08:32.033,000 --> 0:08:35,000
their survival tends to be better than that of men.

155
0:08:35.212,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now, here are some clues.

156
0:08:37.087,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Our investigators have found that there are

157
0:08:39.486,000 --> 0:08:43,000
certain genes in the lung tumor cells of both women and men.

158
0:08:44.158,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And these genes are activated

159
0:08:46.35,000 --> 0:08:48,000
mainly by estrogen.

160
0:08:48.44,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And when these genes are over-expressed,

161
0:08:51.258,000 --> 0:08:53,000
it's associated with improved survival

162
0:08:53.989,000 --> 0:08:55,000
only in young women.

163
0:08:56.656,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Now this is a very early finding

164
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and we don't yet know whether it has relevance

165
0:09:01.973,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to clinical care.

166
0:09:04.414,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But it's findings like this that may provide hope

167
0:09:08.273,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and may provide an opportunity to save lives

168
0:09:11.04,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of both women and men.

169
0:09:13.587,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now, let me share with you an example

170
0:09:14.968,000 --> 0:09:17,000
of when we do consider sex differences, it can drive the science.

171
0:09:18.946,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Several years ago a new lung cancer drug

172
0:09:21.274,000 --> 0:09:22,000
was being evaluated,

173
0:09:22.92,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and when the authors looked at whose tumors shrank,

174
0:09:27.292,000 --> 0:09:3,000
they found that 82 percent were women.

175
0:09:30.725,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This led them to ask the question: Well, why?

176
0:09:33.688,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And what they found

177
0:09:35.243,000 --> 0:09:38,000
was that the genetic mutations that the drug targeted

178
0:09:38.723,000 --> 0:09:4,000
were far more common in women.

179
0:09:41.45,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And what this has led to

180
0:09:43.149,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is a more personalized approach

181
0:09:45.331,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to the treatment of lung cancer that also includes sex.

182
0:09:49.485,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This is what we can accomplish

183
0:09:51.58,000 --> 0:09:54,000
when we don't leave women's health to chance.

184
0:09:55.406,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We know that when you invest in research,

185
0:09:58.614,000 --> 0:09:59,000
you get results.

186
0:10:00.14,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Take a look at the death rate from breast cancer over time.

187
0:10:04.648,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And now take a look at the death rates

188
0:10:06.573,000 --> 0:10:09,000
from lung cancer in women over time.

189
0:10:09.905,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now let's look at the dollars invested in breast cancer --

190
0:10:13.515,000 --> 0:10:15,000
these are the dollars invested per death --

191
0:10:16.484,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and the dollars invested in lung cancer.

192
0:10:20.712,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now, it's clear that our investment in breast cancer

193
0:10:25.633,000 --> 0:10:26,000
has produced results.

194
0:10:27.422,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They may not be fast enough,

195
0:10:29.755,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but it has produced results.

196
0:10:31.981,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We can do the same

197
0:10:33.785,000 --> 0:10:37,000
for lung cancer and for every other disease.

198
0:10:38.776,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So let's go back to depression.

199
0:10:42.102,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Depression is the number one cause

200
0:10:44.412,000 --> 0:10:48,000
of disability in women in the world today.

201
0:10:49.004,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Our investigators have found

202
0:10:51.139,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that there are differences in the brains

203
0:10:52.955,000 --> 0:10:53,000
of women and men

204
0:10:54.432,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in the areas that are connected with mood.

205
0:10:57.551,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And when you put men and women

206
0:10:59.624,000 --> 0:11:,000
in a functional MRI scanner --

207
0:11:01.499,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated --

208
0:11:06.046,000 --> 0:11:1,000
so you put them in the scanner and you expose them to stress.

209
0:11:10.089,000 --> 0:11:13,000
You can actually see the difference.

210
0:11:13.976,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And it's findings like this

211
0:11:16.505,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that we believe hold some of the clues

212
0:11:19.486,000 --> 0:11:22,000
for why we see these very significant sex differences

213
0:11:23.239,000 --> 0:11:25,000
in depression.

214
0:11:25.493,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But even though we know

215
0:11:27.051,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that these differences occur,

216
0:11:29.918,000 --> 0:11:31,000
66 percent

217
0:11:32.571,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of the brain research that begins in animals

218
0:11:36.567,000 --> 0:11:38,000
is done in either male animals

219
0:11:38.893,000 --> 0:11:42,000
or animals in whom the sex is not identified.

220
0:11:43.24,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So, I think we have to ask again the question:

221
0:11:46.859,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Why leave women's health to chance?

222
0:11:51.661,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And this is a question that haunts those of us

223
0:11:54.489,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in science and medicine

224
0:11:56.3,000 --> 0:12:02,000
who believe that we are on the verge of being able to dramatically improve

225
0:12:02.659,000 --> 0:12:03,000
the health of women.

226
0:12:04.335,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We know that every cell has a sex.

227
0:12:06.821,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We know that these differences are often overlooked.

228
0:12:09.763,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And therefore we know that women are not getting the full benefit

229
0:12:14.051,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of modern science and medicine today.

230
0:12:17.95,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We have the tools

231
0:12:19.601,000 --> 0:12:22,000
but we lack the collective will and momentum.

232
0:12:23.483,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Women's health is an equal rights issue

233
0:12:26.227,000 --> 0:12:29,000
as important as equal pay.

234
0:12:29.781,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And it's an issue of the quality

235
0:12:31.965,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and the integrity of science and medicine.

236
0:12:35.12,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Applause)

237
0:12:42.583,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So imagine the momentum we could achieve

238
0:12:47.128,000 --> 0:12:49,000
in advancing the health of women

239
0:12:49.239,000 --> 0:12:51,000
if we considered whether these sex differences were present

240
0:12:52.098,000 --> 0:12:55,000
at the very beginning of designing research.

241
0:12:55.687,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Or if we analyzed our data by sex.

242
0:12:59.566,000 --> 0:13:,000
So, people often ask me:

243
0:13:01.514,000 --> 0:13:02,000
What can I do?

244
0:13:03.285,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And here's what I suggest:

245
0:13:05.619,000 --> 0:13:09,000
First, I suggest that you think about women's health

246
0:13:09.792,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in the same way

247
0:13:11.535,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that you think and care about other causes that are important to you.

248
0:13:17.58,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And second, and equally as important,

249
0:13:20.762,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that as a woman,

250
0:13:22.974,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you have to ask your doctor

251
0:13:25.615,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and the doctors who are caring for those who you love:

252
0:13:30.027,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Is this disease or treatment different in women?

253
0:13:34.903,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Now, this is a profound question because the answer is likely yes,

254
0:13:38.491,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but your doctor may not know the answer, at least not yet.

255
0:13:42.188,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But if you ask the question, your doctor will very likely

256
0:13:46.564,000 --> 0:13:48,000
go looking for the answer.

257
0:13:48.846,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And this is so important,

258
0:13:51.183,000 --> 0:13:53,000
not only for ourselves,

259
0:13:53.345,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but for all of those whom we love.

260
0:13:55.998,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Whether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister,

261
0:14:00.482,000 --> 0:14:03,000
a friend or a grandmother.

262
0:14:04.179,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It was my grandmother's suffering

263
0:14:06.322,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that inspired my work

264
0:14:08.255,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to improve the health of women.

265
0:14:11.24,000 --> 0:14:13,000
That's her legacy.

266
0:14:13.59,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Our legacy can be to improve the health of women

267
0:14:18.259,000 --> 0:14:2,000
for this generation

268
0:14:20.398,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and for generations to come.

269
0:14:23.42,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Thank you.

270
0:14:25.569,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

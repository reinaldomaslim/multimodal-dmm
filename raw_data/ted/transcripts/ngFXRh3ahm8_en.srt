1
0:00:00.067,000 --> 0:00:02,000
I can't think of anyone who just has one interest in life,

2
0:00:02.877,000 --> 0:00:04,000
and that's all they want to do for the rest of their life.

3
0:00:05.021,000 --> 0:00:07,000
[The Way We Work]

4
0:00:09.329,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Around 15 percent of American workers don't have traditional full-time jobs.

5
0:00:13.909,000 --> 0:00:16,000
They're half-time, part-time, contract workers or temps.

6
0:00:17.116,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The term "side hustle" just seems to fit with this ethos

7
0:00:20.965,000 --> 0:00:23,000
where people are putting together a few different things to make a living.

8
0:00:24.525,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The word "side hustle" has its roots in popular African American newspapers.

9
0:00:28.872,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In the 1920s, these papers used the word "hustle"

10
0:00:32.525,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to refer to some kind of scam.

11
0:00:34.121,000 --> 0:00:36,000
By the 1950s, they were using "side hustle"

12
0:00:37.049,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to refer to legitimate work, too.

13
0:00:39.326,000 --> 0:00:41,000
A side hustle is a little different than a second job.

14
0:00:42.05,000 --> 0:00:43,000
A second job is about necessity.

15
0:00:43.779,000 --> 0:00:45,000
While a side hustle can certainly bring in extra income,

16
0:00:46.793,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it's a little more aspirational.

17
0:00:48.533,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Side hustle captures a certain kind of scrappy, entrepreneurial spirit.

18
0:00:52.398,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I've interviewed more than 100 women of color

19
0:00:54.961,000 --> 0:00:55,000
on Side Hustle Pro

20
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
who started successful side hustles.

21
0:00:58.065,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Nailah Ellis-Brown started Ellis Island Tea out of her trunk.

22
0:01:01.272,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Arsha Jones started her famous Capital City Co Mambo Sauce

23
0:01:04.8,000 --> 0:01:05,000
with one product and a PayPal link.

24
0:01:06.803,000 --> 0:01:08,000
All these women are running side hustles.

25
0:01:08.835,000 --> 0:01:1,000
What exactly does this tell us?

26
0:01:10.986,000 --> 0:01:13,000
First, that people are seeing opportunity within their communities.

27
0:01:14.946,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The goal here isn't necessarily to be the next Coca-Cola or Google.

28
0:01:19.043,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Scale is great, but there's also beauty in a successful business

29
0:01:22.613,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that's built for a specific audience.

30
0:01:25.427,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Second, people are increasingly interested in being their own boss.

31
0:01:29.113,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Being your own boss takes discipline.

32
0:01:31.295,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Self-made millionaires tend to have one big trait in common:

33
0:01:34.795,000 --> 0:01:36,000
they make decisions, hold themselves accountable

34
0:01:37.414,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and push through in the face of challenges.

35
0:01:39.911,000 --> 0:01:42,000
A side hustle is a great way to try out being your own boss

36
0:01:43.849,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and see if you have those skills before fully stepping out on your own.

37
0:01:47.565,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Third, people are multipassionate.

38
0:01:49.988,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I want to stress that not every side hustle is started

39
0:01:53.445,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because someone hates their job.

40
0:01:55.084,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Many are started simply because people are interested

41
0:01:58.068,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in lots of different things.

42
0:01:59.582,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Lisa Price, who started a hair and beauty company, Carol's Daughter,

43
0:02:02.892,000 --> 0:02:05,000
was working in television production when she started side-hustling.

44
0:02:06.138,000 --> 0:02:07,000
She says she actually loved her job.

45
0:02:08.01,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It was the fact that she came home every day feeling good

46
0:02:11.264,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that led her to start experimenting

47
0:02:13.034,000 --> 0:02:15,000
with making fragrances and hair oils in her kitchen.

48
0:02:15.701,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We're always being taught

49
0:02:16.943,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that we're supposed to know what we want to do when we grow up.

50
0:02:19.963,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But when you're multipassionate,

51
0:02:21.543,000 --> 0:02:23,000
you want to dip and dabble in those different things.

52
0:02:24.066,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It doesn't mean that you're not committed to your job,

53
0:02:26.816,000 --> 0:02:29,000
it just means that you have other outlets that bring you joy.

54
0:02:29.931,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And that brings me to the final thing the side hustle revolution shows us:

55
0:02:34.24,000 --> 0:02:36,000
people want to make a bet on themselves.

56
0:02:36.677,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Side hustles are appealing because it's easier to take that chance

57
0:02:40.249,000 --> 0:02:42,000
when you have some kind of income coming in.

58
0:02:42.416,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Even if a side hustle doesn't take off,

59
0:02:44.647,000 --> 0:02:45,000
it's still an investment in yourself.

60
0:02:46.583,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Forty-one percent of millennials who have a side hustle

61
0:02:49.725,000 --> 0:02:51,000
say they've shared this information with their employers.

62
0:02:52.431,000 --> 0:02:54,000
They're not worried about their managers reacting negatively.

63
0:02:55.417,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They recognize all the learning and growth that comes with running a side hustle.

64
0:02:59.924,000 --> 0:03:,000
Everyone is looking to feel fulfilled.

65
0:03:01.877,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Thirty-eight percent of baby boomers feel some kind of regret about their career.

66
0:03:05.774,000 --> 0:03:06,000
No one wants that.

67
0:03:06.966,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The truth is that there are many different ways to find happiness

68
0:03:10.153,000 --> 0:03:11,000
through what we do.

69
0:03:11.331,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Side hustles are about embracing that hope

70
0:03:13.479,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that we can be the ones making the decisions

71
0:03:16.082,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in how we spend our work lives.

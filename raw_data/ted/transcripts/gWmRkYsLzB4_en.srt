1
0:00:12.968,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So this is my niece.

2
0:00:14.644,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Her name is Yahli.

3
0:00:16.203,000 --> 0:00:17,000
She is nine months old.

4
0:00:18.201,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Her mum is a doctor, and her dad is a lawyer.

5
0:00:21.269,000 --> 0:00:23,000
By the time Yahli goes to college,

6
0:00:23.299,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different.

7
0:00:27.347,000 --> 0:00:32,000
In 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on the future of work.

8
0:00:32.766,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk

9
0:00:36.929,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of being automated by machines.

10
0:00:40.388,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Machine learning is the technology

11
0:00:42.317,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that's responsible for most of this disruption.

12
0:00:44.619,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence.

13
0:00:47.433,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It allows machines to learn from data

14
0:00:49.339,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and mimic some of the things that humans can do.

15
0:00:51.955,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My company, Kaggle, operates on the cutting edge of machine learning.

16
0:00:55.394,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We bring together hundreds of thousands of experts

17
0:00:57.804,000 --> 0:01:,000
to solve important problems for industry and academia.

18
0:01:01.279,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This gives us a unique perspective on what machines can do,

19
0:01:04.525,000 --> 0:01:05,000
what they can't do

20
0:01:05.784,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and what jobs they might automate or threaten.

21
0:01:09.316,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Machine learning started making its way into industry in the early '90s.

22
0:01:12.89,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It started with relatively simple tasks.

23
0:01:15.406,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It started with things like assessing credit risk from loan applications,

24
0:01:19.545,000 --> 0:01:23,000
sorting the mail by reading handwritten characters from zip codes.

25
0:01:24.036,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Over the past few years, we have made dramatic breakthroughs.

26
0:01:27.586,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Machine learning is now capable of far, far more complex tasks.

27
0:01:31.86,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community

28
0:01:35.115,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to build an algorithm that could grade high-school essays.

29
0:01:38.328,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The winning algorithms were able to match the grades

30
0:01:40.956,000 --> 0:01:41,000
given by human teachers.

31
0:01:43.092,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Last year, we issued an even more difficult challenge.

32
0:01:46.1,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Can you take images of the eye and diagnose an eye disease

33
0:01:49.077,000 --> 0:01:5,000
called diabetic retinopathy?

34
0:01:51.164,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Again, the winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses

35
0:01:55.228,000 --> 0:01:56,000
given by human ophthalmologists.

36
0:01:57.561,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, given the right data, machines are going to outperform humans

37
0:02:00.797,000 --> 0:02:01,000
at tasks like this.

38
0:02:01.986,000 --> 0:02:04,000
A teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career.

39
0:02:06.407,000 --> 0:02:08,000
An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.

40
0:02:08.791,000 --> 0:02:11,000
A machine can read millions of essays or see millions of eyes

41
0:02:12.728,000 --> 0:02:13,000
within minutes.

42
0:02:14.456,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We have no chance of competing against machines

43
0:02:17.338,000 --> 0:02:19,000
on frequent, high-volume tasks.

44
0:02:20.665,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But there are things we can do that machines can't do.

45
0:02:24.791,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Where machines have made very little progress

46
0:02:27.015,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is in tackling novel situations.

47
0:02:28.893,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They can't handle things they haven't seen many times before.

48
0:02:33.321,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The fundamental limitations of machine learning

49
0:02:35.929,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is that it needs to learn from large volumes of past data.

50
0:02:39.347,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now, humans don't.

51
0:02:41.125,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We have the ability to connect seemingly disparate threads

52
0:02:44.179,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to solve problems we've never seen before.

53
0:02:46.808,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Percy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during World War II,

54
0:02:51.243,000 --> 0:02:54,000
when he noticed the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar.

55
0:02:54.97,000 --> 0:02:57,000
He was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation

56
0:02:58.289,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with his knowledge of cooking

57
0:02:59.797,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in order to invent -- any guesses? -- the microwave oven.

58
0:03:03.444,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, this is a particularly remarkable example of creativity.

59
0:03:06.541,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But this sort of cross-pollination happens for each of us in small ways

60
0:03:10.229,000 --> 0:03:11,000
thousands of times per day.

61
0:03:12.501,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Machines cannot compete with us

62
0:03:14.186,000 --> 0:03:16,000
when it comes to tackling novel situations,

63
0:03:16.461,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks

64
0:03:19.602,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that machines will automate.

65
0:03:22.041,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So what does this mean for the future of work?

66
0:03:24.804,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question:

67
0:03:29.36,000 --> 0:03:33,000
To what extent is that job reducible to frequent, high-volume tasks,

68
0:03:34.365,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations?

69
0:03:37.975,000 --> 0:03:41,000
On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter.

70
0:03:42.034,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Today they grade essays. They diagnose certain diseases.

71
0:03:44.772,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Over coming years, they're going to conduct our audits,

72
0:03:47.953,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and they're going to read boilerplate from legal contracts.

73
0:03:50.944,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Accountants and lawyers are still needed.

74
0:03:52.965,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They're going to be needed for complex tax structuring,

75
0:03:55.671,000 --> 0:03:56,000
for pathbreaking litigation.

76
0:03:57.052,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But machines will shrink their ranks

77
0:03:58.793,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and make these jobs harder to come by.

78
0:04:00.689,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now, as mentioned,

79
0:04:01.864,000 --> 0:04:03,000
machines are not making progress on novel situations.

80
0:04:04.837,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers' attention.

81
0:04:08.318,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It has to stand out from the crowd.

82
0:04:10.057,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Business strategy means finding gaps in the market,

83
0:04:12.525,000 --> 0:04:13,000
things that nobody else is doing.

84
0:04:14.305,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing campaigns,

85
0:04:18.447,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy.

86
0:04:21.988,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So Yahli, whatever you decide to do,

87
0:04:24.829,000 --> 0:04:26,000
let every day bring you a new challenge.

88
0:04:27.587,000 --> 0:04:29,000
If it does, then you will stay ahead of the machines.

89
0:04:31.126,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Thank you.

90
0:04:32.326,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Applause)

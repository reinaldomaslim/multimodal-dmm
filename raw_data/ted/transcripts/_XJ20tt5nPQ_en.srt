1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Now, I'm an ethnobotanist.

2
0:00:13.876,000 --> 0:00:15,000
That's a scientist who works in the rainforest

3
0:00:16.121,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to document how people use local plants.

4
0:00:19.552,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I've been doing this for a long time,

5
0:00:22.608,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I want to tell you,

6
0:00:24.377,000 --> 0:00:26,000
these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures

7
0:00:27.344,000 --> 0:00:3,000
better than we do and better than we ever will.

8
0:00:30.493,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But also, these cultures,

9
0:00:32.801,000 --> 0:00:33,000
these indigenous cultures,

10
0:00:34.345,000 --> 0:00:38,000
are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves.

11
0:00:39.024,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And the greatest and most endangered species

12
0:00:41.974,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in the Amazon Rainforest

13
0:00:43.778,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is not the jaguar,

14
0:00:45.618,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it's not the harpy eagle,

15
0:00:47.343,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes.

16
0:00:51.164,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now four years ago, I injured my foot in a climbing accident

17
0:00:54.613,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I went to the doctor.

18
0:00:56.147,000 --> 0:00:57,000
She gave me heat,

19
0:00:57.741,000 --> 0:00:59,000
she gave me cold, aspirin,

20
0:01:00.445,000 --> 0:01:03,000
narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories,

21
0:01:03.675,000 --> 0:01:04,000
cortisone shots.

22
0:01:05.542,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It didn't work.

23
0:01:07.559,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Several months later,

24
0:01:09.396,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I was in the northeast Amazon,

25
0:01:11.613,000 --> 0:01:12,000
walked into a village,

26
0:01:13.606,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the shaman said, "You're limping."

27
0:01:16.073,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I'll never forget this as long as I live.

28
0:01:18.632,000 --> 0:01:19,000
He looked me in the face and he said,

29
0:01:20.466,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Take off your shoe and give me your machete."

30
0:01:24.382,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:26.587,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He walked over to a palm tree

32
0:01:28.571,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and carved off a fern,

33
0:01:30.117,000 --> 0:01:31,000
threw it in the fire,

34
0:01:31.429,000 --> 0:01:32,000
applied it to my foot,

35
0:01:33.121,000 --> 0:01:34,000
threw it in a pot of water,

36
0:01:34.95,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and had me drink the tea.

37
0:01:37.076,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The pain disappeared for seven months.

38
0:01:40.518,000 --> 0:01:41,000
When it came back, I went to see the shaman again.

39
0:01:42.444,000 --> 0:01:43,000
He gave me the same treatment,

40
0:01:44.249,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I've been cured for three years now.

41
0:01:47.999,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Who would you rather be treated by?

42
0:01:50.671,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Applause)

43
0:01:53.557,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now, make no mistake — Western medicine

44
0:01:55.785,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is the most successful system of healing ever devised,

45
0:01:58.895,000 --> 0:02:,000
but there's plenty of holes in it.

46
0:02:01.47,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Where's the cure for breast cancer?

47
0:02:03.508,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Where's the cure for schizophrenia?

48
0:02:05.378,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Where's the cure for acid reflux?

49
0:02:07.772,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Where's the cure for insomnia?

50
0:02:09.969,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The fact is that these people

51
0:02:11.888,000 --> 0:02:13,000
can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

52
0:02:13.924,000 --> 0:02:14,000
cure things we cannot.

53
0:02:15.57,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Here you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon

54
0:02:17.952,000 --> 0:02:18,000
treating leishmaniasis,

55
0:02:19.532,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a really nasty protozoal disease

56
0:02:21.863,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that afflicts 12 million people around the world.

57
0:02:24.824,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Western treatment are injections of antimony.

58
0:02:27.527,000 --> 0:02:29,000
They're painful, they're expensive,

59
0:02:30.028,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and they're probably not good for your heart;

60
0:02:32.139,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it's a heavy metal.

61
0:02:33.779,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This man cures it with three plants from the Amazon Rainforest.

62
0:02:37.397,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is the magic frog.

63
0:02:39.712,000 --> 0:02:41,000
My colleague, the late great Loren McIntyre,

64
0:02:42.448,000 --> 0:02:44,000
discoverer of the source lake of the Amazon,

65
0:02:44.612,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes,

66
0:02:47.056,000 --> 0:02:5,000
was lost on the Peru-Brazil border about 30 years ago.

67
0:02:50.161,000 --> 0:02:54,000
He was rescued by a group of isolated Indians called the Matsés.

68
0:02:54.756,000 --> 0:02:57,000
They beckoned for him to follow them into the forest, which he did.

69
0:02:58.535,000 --> 0:03:,000
There, they took out palm leaf baskets.

70
0:03:00.959,000 --> 0:03:02,000
There, they took out these green monkey frogs —

71
0:03:03.441,000 --> 0:03:04,000
these are big suckers, they're like this —

72
0:03:05.439,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and they began licking them.

73
0:03:07.962,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It turns out, they're highly hallucinogenic.

74
0:03:10.93,000 --> 0:03:14,000
McIntyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of High Times magazine.

75
0:03:15.832,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You see that ethnobotanists have friends in all sorts of strange cultures.

76
0:03:20.183,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This guy decided he would go down to the Amazon and give it a whirl,

77
0:03:23.616,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or give it a lick, and he did, and he wrote,

78
0:03:27.35,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"My blood pressure went through the roof,

79
0:03:29.835,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I lost full control of my bodily functions,

80
0:03:32.025,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I passed out in a heap,

81
0:03:33.855,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I woke up in a hammock six hours later,

82
0:03:36.381,000 --> 0:03:38,000
felt like God for two days."

83
0:03:38.555,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:39.864,000 --> 0:03:4,000
An Italian chemist read this and said,

85
0:03:41.747,000 --> 0:03:44,000
"I'm not really interested in the theological aspects of the green monkey frog.

86
0:03:45.583,000 --> 0:03:47,000
What's this about the change in blood pressure?"

87
0:03:48.168,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now, this is an Italian chemist

88
0:03:50.572,000 --> 0:03:52,000
who's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure

89
0:03:53.187,000 --> 0:03:55,000
based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog,

90
0:03:56.037,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and other scientists are looking

91
0:03:58.319,000 --> 0:04:01,000
at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus.

92
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
How ironic if these isolated Indians and their magic frog

93
0:04:05.749,000 --> 0:04:07,000
prove to be one of the cures.

94
0:04:07.858,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Here's an ayahuasca shaman

95
0:04:10.047,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in the northwest Amazon, in the middle of a yage ceremony.

96
0:04:12.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I took him to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer

97
0:04:15.974,000 --> 0:04:18,000
looking for support for monies to protect their culture.

98
0:04:19.462,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This fellow looked at the medicine man, and he said,

99
0:04:22.06,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"You didn't go to medical school, did you?"

100
0:04:25.207,000 --> 0:04:26,000
The shaman said, "No, I did not."

101
0:04:27.037,000 --> 0:04:29,000
He said, "Well, then what can you know about healing?"

102
0:04:29.668,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The shaman looked at him and he said,

103
0:04:31.432,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"You know what? If you have an infection, go to a doctor.

104
0:04:35.248,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But many human afflictions are diseases of the heart, the mind and the spirit.

105
0:04:41.809,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Western medicine can't touch those. I cure them."

106
0:04:46.361,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Applause)

107
0:04:50.55,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines.

108
0:04:54.058,000 --> 0:04:56,000
This is a viper from Brazil,

109
0:04:56.345,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the venom of which was studied at the Universidade de São Paulo here.

110
0:04:59.603,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It was later developed into ACE inhibitors.

111
0:05:03.054,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This is a frontline treatment for hypertension.

112
0:05:05.45,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Hypertension causes over 10 percent

113
0:05:08.084,000 --> 0:05:1,000
of all deaths on the planet every day.

114
0:05:10.458,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is a $4 billion industry

115
0:05:12.542,000 --> 0:05:14,000
based on venom from a Brazilian snake,

116
0:05:14.734,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and the Brazilians did not get a nickel.

117
0:05:18.068,000 --> 0:05:22,000
This is not an acceptable way of doing business.

118
0:05:23.056,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The rainforest has been called the greatest expression of life on Earth.

119
0:05:26.67,000 --> 0:05:28,000
There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love:

120
0:05:29.336,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask."

121
0:05:34.945,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing.

122
0:05:37.822,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Here in Brazil, in the Amazon,

123
0:05:39.938,000 --> 0:05:4,000
around the world.

124
0:05:41.335,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I took this picture from a small plane

125
0:05:43.505,000 --> 0:05:45,000
flying over the eastern border of the Xingu indigenous reserve

126
0:05:46.453,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in the state of Mato Grosso to the northwest of here.

127
0:05:49.502,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The top half of the picture,

128
0:05:51.155,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you see where the Indians live.

129
0:05:52.857,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The line through the middle

130
0:05:54.414,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is the eastern border of the reserve.

131
0:05:56.761,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.

132
0:06:00.239,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Top half wonder drugs,

133
0:06:02.411,000 --> 0:06:05,000
bottom half just a bunch of skinny-ass cows.

134
0:06:05.996,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs,

135
0:06:09.469,000 --> 0:06:11,000
bottom half carbon in the atmosphere

136
0:06:12.143,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where it's driving climate change.

137
0:06:14.546,000 --> 0:06:16,000
In fact, the number two cause

138
0:06:17.034,000 --> 0:06:19,000
of carbon being released into the atmosphere

139
0:06:19.573,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is forest destruction.

140
0:06:22.411,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But in talking about destruction,

141
0:06:24.227,000 --> 0:06:25,000
it's important to keep in mind

142
0:06:26.171,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that the Amazon is the mightiest landscape of all.

143
0:06:30.174,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's a place of beauty and wonder.

144
0:06:32.626,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The biggest anteater in the world

145
0:06:35.117,000 --> 0:06:36,000
lives in the rain forest,

146
0:06:37.065,000 --> 0:06:39,000
tips the scale at 90 pounds.

147
0:06:39.468,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The goliath bird-eating spider

148
0:06:41.519,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is the world's largest spider.

149
0:06:43.467,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's found in the Amazon as well.

150
0:06:45.768,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet.

151
0:06:49.656,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And the black cayman —

152
0:06:52.453,000 --> 0:06:55,000
these monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton.

153
0:06:55.509,000 --> 0:06:58,000
They're known to be man-eaters.

154
0:06:58.858,000 --> 0:07:,000
The anaconda, the largest snake,

155
0:07:01.648,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the capybara, the largest rodent.

156
0:07:04.375,000 --> 0:07:05,000
A specimen from here in Brazil

157
0:07:06.037,000 --> 0:07:09,000
tipped the scale at 201 pounds.

158
0:07:09.733,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Let's visit where these creatures live,

159
0:07:12.028,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the northeast Amazon,

160
0:07:13.864,000 --> 0:07:14,000
home to the Akuriyo tribe.

161
0:07:15.563,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Uncontacted peoples hold a mystical and iconic role

162
0:07:21.076,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in our imagination.

163
0:07:23.211,000 --> 0:07:25,000
These are the people who know nature best.

164
0:07:25.548,000 --> 0:07:26,000
These are the people who truly live

165
0:07:27.399,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in total harmony with nature.

166
0:07:30.457,000 --> 0:07:32,000
By our standards, some would dismiss these people as primitive.

167
0:07:33.421,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"They don't know how to make fire,

168
0:07:35.062,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or they didn't when they were first contacted."

169
0:07:37.314,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But they know the forest far better than we do.

170
0:07:40.458,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The Akuriyos have 35 words for honey,

171
0:07:43.452,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and other Indians look up to them

172
0:07:45.502,000 --> 0:07:49,000
as being the true masters of the emerald realm.

173
0:07:49.757,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay.

174
0:07:52.072,000 --> 0:07:53,000
When I was a teenager rocking out

175
0:07:53.815,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to the Rolling Stones in my hometown of New Orleans,

176
0:07:56.259,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Pohnay was a forest nomad

177
0:07:58.794,000 --> 0:08:,000
roaming the jungles of the northeast Amazon

178
0:08:01.291,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in a small band, looking for game,

179
0:08:04.531,000 --> 0:08:06,000
looking for medicinal plants,

180
0:08:06.626,000 --> 0:08:07,000
looking for a wife,

181
0:08:08.023,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in other small nomadic bands.

182
0:08:10.301,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But it's people like these

183
0:08:12.779,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that know things that we don't,

184
0:08:14.712,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and they have lots of lessons to teach us.

185
0:08:18.832,000 --> 0:08:21,000
However, if you go into most of the forests of the Amazon,

186
0:08:22.23,000 --> 0:08:23,000
there are no indigenous peoples.

187
0:08:24.037,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This is what you find:

188
0:08:25.971,000 --> 0:08:28,000
rock carvings which indigenous peoples,

189
0:08:29.12,000 --> 0:08:33,000
uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe.

190
0:08:33.55,000 --> 0:08:35,000
These cultures that once danced,

191
0:08:35.622,000 --> 0:08:37,000
made love, sang to the gods,

192
0:08:38.203,000 --> 0:08:39,000
worshipped the forest,

193
0:08:39.786,000 --> 0:08:42,000
all that's left is an imprint in stone, as you see here.

194
0:08:43.434,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Let's move to the western Amazon,

195
0:08:46.004,000 --> 0:08:49,000
which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples.

196
0:08:49.091,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Each of these dots represents

197
0:08:51.129,000 --> 0:08:53,000
a small, uncontacted tribe,

198
0:08:53.422,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and the big reveal today is we believe there are 14 or 15 isolated groups

199
0:08:58.381,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in the Colombian Amazon alone.

200
0:09:01.762,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Why are these people isolated?

201
0:09:04.004,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They know we exist, they know there's an outside world.

202
0:09:06.711,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This is a form of resistance.

203
0:09:08.731,000 --> 0:09:1,000
They have chosen to remain isolated,

204
0:09:10.866,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and I think it is their human right to remain so.

205
0:09:14.439,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Why are these the tribes that hide from man?

206
0:09:16.862,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Here's why.

207
0:09:17.967,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Obviously, some of this was set off in 1492.

208
0:09:21.225,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But at the turn of the last century

209
0:09:23.247,000 --> 0:09:24,000
was the rubber trade.

210
0:09:25.072,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The demand for natural rubber,

211
0:09:26.722,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which came from the Amazon,

212
0:09:28.628,000 --> 0:09:31,000
set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush.

213
0:09:31.802,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Rubber for bicycle tires,

214
0:09:33.678,000 --> 0:09:34,000
rubber for automobile tires,

215
0:09:35.296,000 --> 0:09:36,000
rubber for zeppelins.

216
0:09:37.047,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It was a mad race to get that rubber,

217
0:09:40.054,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and the man on the left, Julio Arana,

218
0:09:42.732,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is one of the true thugs of the story.

219
0:09:45.799,000 --> 0:09:46,000
His people, his company,

220
0:09:47.492,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and other companies like them

221
0:09:49.594,000 --> 0:09:52,000
killed, massacred, tortured, butchered Indians

222
0:09:52.749,000 --> 0:09:56,000
like the Witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide.

223
0:09:57.656,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Even today, when people come out of the forest,

224
0:10:00.081,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the story seldom has a happy ending.

225
0:10:02.786,000 --> 0:10:05,000
These are Nukaks. They were contacted in the '80s.

226
0:10:05.906,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Within a year, everybody over 40 was dead.

227
0:10:09.863,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And remember, these are preliterate societies.

228
0:10:12.095,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The elders are the libraries.

229
0:10:13.875,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Every time a shaman dies,

230
0:10:15.653,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it's as if a library has burned down.

231
0:10:19.042,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They have been forced off their lands.

232
0:10:21.538,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The drug traffickers have taken over the Nukak lands,

233
0:10:25.761,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and the Nukaks live as beggars

234
0:10:27.739,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in public parks in eastern Colombia.

235
0:10:30.981,000 --> 0:10:32,000
From the Nukak lands, I want to take you to the southwest,

236
0:10:33.881,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to the most spectacular landscape in the world:

237
0:10:36.528,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Chiribiquete National Park.

238
0:10:38.601,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It was surrounded by three isolated tribes

239
0:10:40.74,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues,

240
0:10:43.771,000 --> 0:10:44,000
it has now expanded.

241
0:10:45.717,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's bigger than the state of Maryland.

242
0:10:47.694,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It is a treasure trove of botanical diversity.

243
0:10:51.135,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It was first explored botanically in 1943

244
0:10:54.09,000 --> 0:10:55,000
by my mentor, Richard Schultes,

245
0:10:55.88,000 --> 0:10:57,000
seen here atop the Bell Mountain,

246
0:10:58.75,000 --> 0:11:,000
the sacred mountains of the Karijonas.

247
0:11:01.185,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And let me show you what it looks like today.

248
0:11:03.476,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Flying over Chiribiquete,

249
0:11:05.405,000 --> 0:11:07,000
realize that these lost world mountains are still lost.

250
0:11:07.983,000 --> 0:11:08,000
No scientist has been atop them.

251
0:11:09.788,000 --> 0:11:11,000
In fact, nobody has been atop the Bell Mountain

252
0:11:11.981,000 --> 0:11:12,000
since Schultes in '43.

253
0:11:13.94,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain

254
0:11:16.812,000 --> 0:11:18,000
just to the east of the picture.

255
0:11:19.07,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Let me show you what it looks like today.

256
0:11:21.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity,

257
0:11:24.937,000 --> 0:11:26,000
not only is it home to three isolated tribes,

258
0:11:27.715,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but it's the greatest treasure trove

259
0:11:29.503,000 --> 0:11:32,000
of pre-Colombian art in the world:

260
0:11:32.828,000 --> 0:11:34,000
over 200,000 paintings.

261
0:11:35.367,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen

262
0:11:38.011,000 --> 0:11:43,000
described this as the Sistine Chapel of the Amazon Rainforest.

263
0:11:43.697,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But move from Chiribiquete down to the southeast,

264
0:11:46.271,000 --> 0:11:47,000
again in the Colombian Amazon.

265
0:11:48.082,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Remember, the Colombian Amazon is bigger than New England.

266
0:11:50.964,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The Amazon's a big forest,

267
0:11:52.581,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and Brazil's got a big part of it,

268
0:11:54.212,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but not all of it.

269
0:11:55.698,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Moving down to these two national parks,

270
0:11:57.286,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Cahuinari and Puré

271
0:11:59.435,000 --> 0:12:,000
in the Colombian Amazon —

272
0:12:00.781,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that's the Brazilian border to the right —

273
0:12:03.469,000 --> 0:12:05,000
it's home to several groups

274
0:12:05.843,000 --> 0:12:06,000
of isolated and uncontacted peoples.

275
0:12:07.587,000 --> 0:12:09,000
To the trained eye, you can look at the roofs

276
0:12:09.716,000 --> 0:12:11,000
of these malocas, these longhouses,

277
0:12:11.807,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and see that there's cultural diversity.

278
0:12:13.728,000 --> 0:12:15,000
These are, in fact, different tribes.

279
0:12:15.776,000 --> 0:12:17,000
As isolated as these areas are,

280
0:12:18.34,000 --> 0:12:22,000
let me show you how the outside world is crowding in.

281
0:12:22.595,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Here we see trade and transport increased in Putumayo.

282
0:12:25.316,000 --> 0:12:27,000
With the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia,

283
0:12:27.756,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the outside world is showing up.

284
0:12:30.368,000 --> 0:12:32,000
To the north, we have illegal gold mining,

285
0:12:33.12,000 --> 0:12:34,000
also from the east, from Brazil.

286
0:12:34.812,000 --> 0:12:37,000
There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes.

287
0:12:38.452,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We see illegal logging coming from the south,

288
0:12:41.509,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and drug runners are trying to move through the park

289
0:12:44.164,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and get into Brazil.

290
0:12:46.37,000 --> 0:12:48,000
This, in the past, is why you didn't mess

291
0:12:49.128,000 --> 0:12:5,000
with isolated Indians.

292
0:12:50.749,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And if it looks like this picture is out of focus

293
0:12:52.613,000 --> 0:12:55,000
because it was taken in a hurry, here's why.

294
0:12:55.899,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

295
0:12:58.416,000 --> 0:13:03,000
This looks like — (Applause)

296
0:13:04.303,000 --> 0:13:06,000
This looks like a hangar from the Brazilian Amazon.

297
0:13:06.823,000 --> 0:13:08,000
This is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba.

298
0:13:09.566,000 --> 0:13:1,000
A group called Los Carpinteros.

299
0:13:11.223,000 --> 0:13:15,000
This is their perception of why you shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians.

300
0:13:15.574,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But the world is changing.

301
0:13:17.551,000 --> 0:13:19,000
These are Mashco-Piros on the Brazil-Peru border

302
0:13:20.319,000 --> 0:13:22,000
who stumbled out of the jungle

303
0:13:22.46,000 --> 0:13:23,000
because they were essentially chased out

304
0:13:24.414,000 --> 0:13:26,000
by drug runners and timber people.

305
0:13:26.792,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And in Peru, there's a very nasty business.

306
0:13:29.425,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It's called human safaris.

307
0:13:31.245,000 --> 0:13:34,000
They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture.

308
0:13:34.277,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Of course, when you give them clothes, when you give them tools,

309
0:13:37.323,000 --> 0:13:38,000
you also give them diseases.

310
0:13:39.221,000 --> 0:13:41,000
We call these "inhuman safaris."

311
0:13:42.068,000 --> 0:13:44,000
These are Indians again on the Peru border,

312
0:13:44.166,000 --> 0:13:47,000
who were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries.

313
0:13:47.384,000 --> 0:13:49,000
They want to get in there and turn them into Christians.

314
0:13:50.315,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We know how that turns out.

315
0:13:52.51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
What's to be done?

316
0:13:54.284,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Introduce technology to the contacted tribes,

317
0:13:56.71,000 --> 0:13:57,000
not the uncontacted tribes,

318
0:13:58.612,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in a culturally sensitive way.

319
0:14:01.745,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom

320
0:14:05.891,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and 21st century technology.

321
0:14:08.717,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We've done this now with over 30 tribes,

322
0:14:11.728,000 --> 0:14:13,000
mapped, managed and increased protection

323
0:14:14.652,000 --> 0:14:17,000
of over 70 million acres of ancestral rainforest.

324
0:14:18.555,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Applause)

325
0:14:23.828,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So this allows the Indians to take control

326
0:14:27.05,000 --> 0:14:3,000
of their environmental and cultural destiny.

327
0:14:30.577,000 --> 0:14:31,000
They also then set up guard houses

328
0:14:32.566,000 --> 0:14:34,000
to keep outsiders out.

329
0:14:34.572,000 --> 0:14:36,000
These are Indians, trained as indigenous park rangers,

330
0:14:37.211,000 --> 0:14:38,000
patrolling the borders

331
0:14:38.867,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and keeping the outside world at bay.

332
0:14:41.948,000 --> 0:14:43,000
This is a picture of actual contact.

333
0:14:44.707,000 --> 0:14:45,000
These are Chitonahua Indians

334
0:14:46.614,000 --> 0:14:48,000
on the Brazil-Peru border.

335
0:14:48.617,000 --> 0:14:49,000
They've come out of the jungle

336
0:14:50.321,000 --> 0:14:51,000
asking for help.

337
0:14:52.062,000 --> 0:14:53,000
They were shot at,

338
0:14:53.468,000 --> 0:14:55,000
their malocas, their longhouses, were burned.

339
0:14:56.205,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Some of them were massacred.

340
0:14:58.708,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Using automatic weapons to slaughter uncontacted peoples

341
0:15:04.494,000 --> 0:15:08,000
is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse

342
0:15:08.726,000 --> 0:15:1,000
on our planet today, and it has to stop.

343
0:15:11.671,000 --> 0:15:17,000
(Applause)

344
0:15:18.205,000 --> 0:15:2,000
But let me conclude by saying,

345
0:15:20.928,000 --> 0:15:22,000
this work can be spiritually rewarding,

346
0:15:23.792,000 --> 0:15:25,000
but it's difficult and it can be dangerous.

347
0:15:26.636,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Two colleagues of mine passed away recently

348
0:15:29.538,000 --> 0:15:31,000
in the crash of a small plane.

349
0:15:31.903,000 --> 0:15:32,000
They were serving the forest

350
0:15:33.681,000 --> 0:15:35,000
to protect those uncontacted tribes.

351
0:15:36.429,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So the question is, in conclusion,

352
0:15:38.366,000 --> 0:15:39,000
is what the future holds.

353
0:15:40.191,000 --> 0:15:42,000
These are the Uray people in Brazil.

354
0:15:42.288,000 --> 0:15:43,000
What does the future hold for them,

355
0:15:43.969,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and what does the future hold for us?

356
0:15:46.64,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Let's think differently.

357
0:15:49.121,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Let's make a better world.

358
0:15:50.918,000 --> 0:15:51,000
If the climate's going to change,

359
0:15:52.836,000 --> 0:15:56,000
let's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse.

360
0:15:56.919,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Let's live on a planet

361
0:16:00.084,000 --> 0:16:02,000
full of luxuriant vegetation,

362
0:16:02.904,000 --> 0:16:04,000
in which isolated peoples

363
0:16:05.01,000 --> 0:16:06,000
can remain in isolation,

364
0:16:06.869,000 --> 0:16:07,000
can maintain that mystery

365
0:16:08.842,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and that knowledge

366
0:16:10.368,000 --> 0:16:11,000
if they so choose.

367
0:16:12.013,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Let's live in a world

368
0:16:14.128,000 --> 0:16:16,000
where the shamans live in these forests

369
0:16:16.497,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and heal themselves and us

370
0:16:19.441,000 --> 0:16:21,000
with their mystical plants

371
0:16:22.178,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and their sacred frogs.

372
0:16:24.235,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Thanks again.

373
0:16:26.082,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Applause)

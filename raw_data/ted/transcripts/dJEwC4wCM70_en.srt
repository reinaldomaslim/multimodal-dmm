1
0:00:12.715,000 --> 0:00:13,000
For over a decade as a doctor,

2
0:00:14.464,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've cared for homeless veterans,

3
0:00:17.13,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for working-class families.

4
0:00:19.185,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've cared for people who live and work in conditions

5
0:00:23.406,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that can be hard, if not harsh,

6
0:00:25.855,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that work has led me to believe

7
0:00:27.608,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that we need a fundamentally different way

8
0:00:29.553,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of looking at healthcare.

9
0:00:31.787,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We simply need a healthcare system

10
0:00:33.193,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms

11
0:00:35.294,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that bring people into clinics,

12
0:00:36.973,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but instead actually is able to look

13
0:00:39.85,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and improve health where it begins.

14
0:00:42.445,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And where health begins

15
0:00:43.932,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is not in the four walls of a doctor's office,

16
0:00:46.692,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but where we live

17
0:00:48.102,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and where we work,

18
0:00:50.321,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where we eat, sleep, learn and play,

19
0:00:53.473,000 --> 0:00:56,000
where we spend the majority of our lives.

20
0:00:56.9,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So what does this different approach to healthcare look like,

21
0:00:59.568,000 --> 0:01:02,000
an approach that can improve health where it begins?

22
0:01:02.794,000 --> 0:01:05,000
To illustrate this, I'll tell you about Veronica.

23
0:01:06.601,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Veronica was the 17th patient

24
0:01:08.32,000 --> 0:01:09,000
out of my 26-patient day

25
0:01:10.227,000 --> 0:01:12,000
at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.

26
0:01:13.174,000 --> 0:01:15,000
She came into our clinic with a chronic headache.

27
0:01:15.693,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This headache had been going on

28
0:01:16.856,000 --> 0:01:17,000
for a number of years, and this particular episode

29
0:01:18.809,000 --> 0:01:2,000
was very, very troubling.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In fact, three weeks before she came to visit us

31
0:01:23.974,000 --> 0:01:26,000
for the first time, she went to an emergency room in Los Angeles.

32
0:01:27.13,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The emergency room doctors said,

33
0:01:29.597,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"We've run some tests, Veronica.

34
0:01:31.555,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The results are normal, so here's some pain medication,

35
0:01:34.267,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and follow up with a primary care doctor,

36
0:01:36.786,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but if the pain persists or if it worsens,

37
0:01:38.529,000 --> 0:01:39,000
then come on back."

38
0:01:40.258,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Veronica followed those standard instructions

39
0:01:43.35,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and she went back.

40
0:01:45.1,000 --> 0:01:48,000
She went back not just once, but twice more.

41
0:01:48.333,000 --> 0:01:5,000
In the three weeks before Veronica met us,

42
0:01:50.791,000 --> 0:01:52,000
she went to the emergency room three times.

43
0:01:52.94,000 --> 0:01:53,000
She went back and forth,

44
0:01:54.807,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in and out of hospitals and clinics,

45
0:01:56.506,000 --> 0:01:57,000
just like she had done in years past,

46
0:01:58.272,000 --> 0:02:01,000
trying to seek relief but still coming up short.

47
0:02:01.712,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Veronica came to our clinic,

48
0:02:03.84,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and despite all these encounters with healthcare professionals,

49
0:02:06.472,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Veronica was still sick.

50
0:02:09.304,000 --> 0:02:12,000
When she came to our clinic, though, we tried a different approach.

51
0:02:12.925,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Our approach started with our medical assistant,

52
0:02:15.562,000 --> 0:02:17,000
someone who had a GED-level training

53
0:02:17.609,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but knew the community.

54
0:02:18.959,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Our medical assistant asked some routine questions.

55
0:02:21.08,000 --> 0:02:23,000
She asked, "What's your chief complaint?"

56
0:02:23.532,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"Headache."

57
0:02:25.821,000 --> 0:02:26,000
"Let's get your vital signs" —

58
0:02:27.115,000 --> 0:02:29,000
measure your blood pressure and your heart rate,

59
0:02:29.624,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but let's also ask something equally as vital

60
0:02:31.637,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to Veronica and a lot of patients like her

61
0:02:33.707,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in South Los Angeles.

62
0:02:35.514,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"Veronica, can you tell me about where you live?

63
0:02:38.155,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Specifically, about your housing conditions?

64
0:02:39.908,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks?

65
0:02:42.361,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Do you have roaches in your home?"

66
0:02:44.518,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Turns out, Veronica said yes to three of those things:

67
0:02:46.925,000 --> 0:02:48,000
roaches, water leaks, mold.

68
0:02:49.232,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I received that chart in hand, reviewed it,

69
0:02:52.347,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and I turned the handle on the door

70
0:02:53.674,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and I entered the room.

71
0:02:55.666,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You should understand that Veronica,

72
0:02:57.116,000 --> 0:02:59,000
like a lot of patients that I have the privilege of caring for,

73
0:02:59.569,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is a dignified person, a formidable presence,

74
0:03:02.292,000 --> 0:03:03,000
a personality that's larger than life,

75
0:03:04.125,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but here she was

76
0:03:05.925,000 --> 0:03:07,000
doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table.

77
0:03:08.76,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Her head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands.

78
0:03:12.944,000 --> 0:03:13,000
She lifted her head up,

79
0:03:14.293,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I saw her face, said hello,

80
0:03:17.4,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and then I immediately noticed something

81
0:03:18.659,000 --> 0:03:19,000
across the bridge of her nose,

82
0:03:20.331,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a crease in her skin.

83
0:03:22.416,000 --> 0:03:25,000
In medicine, we call that crease the allergic salute.

84
0:03:25.735,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies.

85
0:03:28.547,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It comes from chronically rubbing one's nose up and down,

86
0:03:31.303,000 --> 0:03:33,000
trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms,

87
0:03:33.609,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and yet, here was Veronica, a grown woman,

88
0:03:35.646,000 --> 0:03:37,000
with the same telltale sign of allergies.

89
0:03:38.435,000 --> 0:03:4,000
A few minutes later, in asking Veronica some questions,

90
0:03:41.38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and examining her and listening to her,

91
0:03:43.329,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I said, "Veronica, I think I know what you have.

92
0:03:46.134,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I think you have chronic allergies,

93
0:03:48.188,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and I think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion,

94
0:03:50.451,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I think all of those are related to where you live."

95
0:03:53.989,000 --> 0:03:54,000
She looked a little bit relieved,

96
0:03:55.733,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because for the first time, she had a diagnosis,

97
0:03:57.708,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but I said, "Veronica, now let's talk about your treatment.

98
0:03:59.945,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We're going to order some medications for your symptoms,

99
0:04:03.387,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but I also want to refer you to a specialist, if that's okay."

100
0:04:06.92,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, specialists are a little hard to find

101
0:04:09.226,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in South Central Los Angeles,

102
0:04:11.028,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so she gave me this look, like, "Really?"

103
0:04:13.714,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I said, "Veronica, actually, the specialist I'm talking about

104
0:04:16.391,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is someone I call a community health worker,

105
0:04:18.677,000 --> 0:04:19,000
someone who, if it's okay with you,

106
0:04:20.318,000 --> 0:04:2,000
can come to your home

107
0:04:21.1,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and try to understand what's going on

108
0:04:22.83,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with those water leaks and that mold,

109
0:04:24.188,000 --> 0:04:28,000
trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms,

110
0:04:28.226,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and if required, that specialist might refer you

111
0:04:30.318,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer,

112
0:04:32.81,000 --> 0:04:33,000
because it might be that your landlord

113
0:04:34.503,000 --> 0:04:37,000
isn't making the fixes he's required to make."

114
0:04:37.776,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Veronica came back in a few months later.

115
0:04:39.903,000 --> 0:04:41,000
She agreed to all of those treatment plans.

116
0:04:42.715,000 --> 0:04:45,000
She told us that her symptoms had improved by 90 percent.

117
0:04:45.761,000 --> 0:04:46,000
She was spending more time at work

118
0:04:47.627,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and with her family and less time

119
0:04:49.513,000 --> 0:04:53,000
shuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of Los Angeles.

120
0:04:54.123,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Veronica had improved remarkably.

121
0:04:56.335,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Her sons, one of whom had asthma,

122
0:04:58.329,000 --> 0:04:59,000
were no longer as sick as they used to be.

123
0:05:00.104,000 --> 0:05:02,000
She had gotten better, and not coincidentally,

124
0:05:02.491,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Veronica's home was better too.

125
0:05:06.166,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What was it about this different approach we tried

126
0:05:08.01,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that led to better care,

127
0:05:11.604,000 --> 0:05:14,000
fewer visits to the E.R., better health?

128
0:05:15.163,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Well, quite simply, it started with that question:

129
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"Veronica, where do you live?"

130
0:05:20.251,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But more importantly, it was that we put in place

131
0:05:22.627,000 --> 0:05:24,000
a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions

132
0:05:25.197,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to Veronica and hundreds more like her

133
0:05:27.498,000 --> 0:05:28,000
about the conditions that mattered

134
0:05:29.357,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in her community, about where health,

135
0:05:31.195,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and unfortunately sometimes illness, do begin

136
0:05:34.147,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in places like South L.A.

137
0:05:35.9,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In that community, substandard housing

138
0:05:38.129,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and food insecurity are the major conditions

139
0:05:39.67,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that we as a clinic had to be aware of,

140
0:05:41.492,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but in other communities it could be

141
0:05:43.22,000 --> 0:05:45,000
transportation barriers, obesity,

142
0:05:45.3,000 --> 0:05:48,000
access to parks, gun violence.

143
0:05:48.685,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The important thing is, we put in place a system

144
0:05:50.919,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that worked,

145
0:05:52.283,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach.

146
0:05:54.554,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's a term many of you are familiar with.

147
0:05:56.227,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It comes from a parable that's very common

148
0:05:58.344,000 --> 0:06:,000
in the public health community.

149
0:06:00.663,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This is a parable of three friends.

150
0:06:03.273,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Imagine that you're one of these three friends

151
0:06:05.44,000 --> 0:06:06,000
who come to a river.

152
0:06:07.02,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It's a beautiful scene, but it's shattered by the cries of a child,

153
0:06:10.38,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and actually several children, in need of rescue in the water.

154
0:06:13.357,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So you do hopefully what everybody would do.

155
0:06:15.25,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You jump right in along with your friends.

156
0:06:17.041,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The first friend says, I'm going to rescue those

157
0:06:18.83,000 --> 0:06:19,000
who are about to drown,

158
0:06:20.163,000 --> 0:06:22,000
those at most risk of falling over the waterfall.

159
0:06:22.199,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The second friends says, I'm going to build a raft.

160
0:06:24.134,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I'm going to make sure that fewer people

161
0:06:25.934,000 --> 0:06:26,000
need to end up at the waterfall's edge.

162
0:06:27.419,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Let's usher more people to safety

163
0:06:28.721,000 --> 0:06:29,000
by building this raft,

164
0:06:29.883,000 --> 0:06:3,000
coordinating those branches together.

165
0:06:31.739,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Over time, they're successful, but not really,

166
0:06:34.11,000 --> 0:06:34,000
as much as they want to be.

167
0:06:35.012,000 --> 0:06:37,000
More people slip through, and they finally look up

168
0:06:37.273,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and they see that their third friend

169
0:06:38.543,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is nowhere to be seen.

170
0:06:39.96,000 --> 0:06:4,000
They finally spot her.

171
0:06:41.391,000 --> 0:06:43,000
She's in the water. She's swimming away from them

172
0:06:43.427,000 --> 0:06:45,000
upstream, rescuing children as she goes,

173
0:06:45.8,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and they shout to her, "Where are you going?

174
0:06:47.105,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There are children here to save."

175
0:06:48.646,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And she says back,

176
0:06:50.143,000 --> 0:06:51,000
"I'm going to find out

177
0:06:51.372,000 --> 0:06:55,000
who or what is throwing these children in the water."

178
0:06:55.43,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In healthcare, we have that first friend —

179
0:06:58.329,000 --> 0:06:59,000
we have the specialist,

180
0:06:59.404,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we have the trauma surgeon, the ICU nurse,

181
0:07:01.95,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the E.R. doctors.

182
0:07:02.974,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We have those people that are vital rescuers,

183
0:07:05.515,000 --> 0:07:08,000
people you want to be there when you're in dire straits.

184
0:07:08.92,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We also know that we have the second friend —

185
0:07:11.179,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we have that raft-builder.

186
0:07:12.874,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That's the primary care clinician,

187
0:07:14.585,000 --> 0:07:16,000
people on the care team who are there

188
0:07:16.743,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to manage your chronic conditions,

189
0:07:18.333,000 --> 0:07:19,000
your diabetes, your hypertension,

190
0:07:19.874,000 --> 0:07:2,000
there to give you your annual checkups,

191
0:07:21.28,000 --> 0:07:23,000
there to make sure your vaccines are up to date,

192
0:07:23.485,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but also there to make sure that you have

193
0:07:25.15,000 --> 0:07:28,000
a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety.

194
0:07:28.626,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But while that's also vital and very necessary,

195
0:07:30.393,000 --> 0:07:31,000
what we're missing is that third friend.

196
0:07:32.237,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We don't have enough of that upstreamist.

197
0:07:34.352,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The upstreamists are the health care professionals

198
0:07:36.013,000 --> 0:07:38,000
who know that health does begin

199
0:07:38.3,000 --> 0:07:39,000
where we live and work and play,

200
0:07:40.291,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but beyond that awareness, is able to mobilize

201
0:07:42.823,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the resources to create the system

202
0:07:45.11,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in their clinics and in their hospitals

203
0:07:46.918,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that really does start to approach that,

204
0:07:50.304,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to connect people to the resources they need

205
0:07:52.306,000 --> 0:07:54,000
outside the four walls of the clinic.

206
0:07:54.98,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now you might ask, and it's a very obvious question

207
0:07:56.648,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask:

208
0:07:59.303,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"Doctors and nurses thinking about transportation and housing?

209
0:08:02.449,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures

210
0:08:04.759,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and just make sure we focus on the task at hand?"

211
0:08:06.491,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Certainly, rescuing people at the water's edge

212
0:08:09.337,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is important enough work.

213
0:08:12.454,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Who has the time?

214
0:08:13.725,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I would argue, though, that if we were to use science as our guide,

215
0:08:16.616,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that we would find an upstream approach is absolutely necessary.

216
0:08:19.349,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Scientists now know that

217
0:08:21.104,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the living and working conditions that we all

218
0:08:23.354,000 --> 0:08:24,000
are part of

219
0:08:24.99,000 --> 0:08:26,000
have more than twice the impact on our health

220
0:08:27.38,000 --> 0:08:29,000
than does our genetic code,

221
0:08:29.507,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and living and working conditions,

222
0:08:30.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the structures of our environments,

223
0:08:32.226,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the ways in which our social fabric is woven together,

224
0:08:35.695,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and the impact those have on our behaviors,

225
0:08:37.877,000 --> 0:08:39,000
all together, those have more than five times

226
0:08:40.19,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the impact on our health

227
0:08:41.155,000 --> 0:08:43,000
than do all the pills and procedures

228
0:08:43.164,000 --> 0:08:45,000
administered by doctors and hospitals combined.

229
0:08:45.213,000 --> 0:08:48,000
All together, living and working conditions

230
0:08:48.384,000 --> 0:08:52,000
account for 60 percent of preventable death.

231
0:08:52.48,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Let me give you an example of what this feels like.

232
0:08:54.06,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Let's say there was a company, a tech startup

233
0:08:56.663,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that came to you and said, "We have a great product.

234
0:08:58.564,000 --> 0:09:,000
It's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease."

235
0:09:01.388,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Now, you might be likely to invest

236
0:09:03.289,000 --> 0:09:06,000
if that product was a drug or a device,

237
0:09:06.473,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but what if that product was a park?

238
0:09:09.211,000 --> 0:09:1,000
A study in the U.K.,

239
0:09:10.767,000 --> 0:09:12,000
a landmark study that reviewed the records

240
0:09:12.851,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of over 40 million residents in the U.K.,

241
0:09:16.192,000 --> 0:09:17,000
looked at several variables,

242
0:09:18.02,000 --> 0:09:2,000
controlled for a lot of factors, and found that

243
0:09:20.587,000 --> 0:09:24,000
when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease,

244
0:09:24.67,000 --> 0:09:27,000
one's exposure to green space was a powerful influence.

245
0:09:27.701,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The closer you were to green space,

246
0:09:29.58,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to parks and trees,

247
0:09:30.922,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the lower your chance of heart disease,

248
0:09:32.417,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and that stayed true for rich and for poor.

249
0:09:35.224,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That study illustrates what my friends in public health

250
0:09:37.544,000 --> 0:09:38,000
often say these days:

251
0:09:39.042,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that one's zip code matters more

252
0:09:41.11,000 --> 0:09:42,000
than your genetic code.

253
0:09:42.786,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We're also learning that zip code

254
0:09:44.235,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is actually shaping our genetic code.

255
0:09:46.67,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The science of epigenetics looks at those molecular mechanisms,

256
0:09:49.887,000 --> 0:09:52,000
those intricate ways in which our DNA is literally shaped,

257
0:09:52.92,000 --> 0:09:53,000
genes turned on and off

258
0:09:54.488,000 --> 0:09:56,000
based on the exposures to the environment,

259
0:09:56.682,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to where we live and to where we work.

260
0:09:59.426,000 --> 0:10:,000
So it's clear that these factors,

261
0:10:01.283,000 --> 0:10:03,000
these upstream issues, do matter.

262
0:10:03.366,000 --> 0:10:04,000
They matter to our health,

263
0:10:05.069,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and therefore our healthcare professionals should do something about it.

264
0:10:07.562,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And yet, Veronica asked me

265
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
perhaps the most compelling question

266
0:10:10.289,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I've been asked in a long time.

267
0:10:11.697,000 --> 0:10:13,000
In that follow-up visit, she said,

268
0:10:13.835,000 --> 0:10:15,000
"Why did none of my doctors

269
0:10:15.987,000 --> 0:10:17,000
ask about my home before?

270
0:10:18.865,000 --> 0:10:2,000
In those visits to the emergency room,

271
0:10:21.069,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I had two CAT scans,

272
0:10:22.87,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I had a needle placed in the lower part of my back

273
0:10:24.827,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to collect spinal fluid,

274
0:10:26.357,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I had nearly a dozen blood tests.

275
0:10:27.831,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I went back and forth, I saw all sorts of people in healthcare,

276
0:10:30.485,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and no one asked about my home."

277
0:10:34.77,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The honest answer is that in healthcare,

278
0:10:36.508,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we often treat symptoms without addressing

279
0:10:38.203,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the conditions that make you sick in the first place.

280
0:10:41.323,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And there are many reasons for that, but the big three

281
0:10:43.167,000 --> 0:10:47,000
are first, we don't pay for that.

282
0:10:47.767,000 --> 0:10:5,000
In healthcare, we often pay for volume and not value.

283
0:10:51.152,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We pay doctors and hospitals usually

284
0:10:52.94,000 --> 0:10:53,000
for the number of services they provide,

285
0:10:54.92,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but not necessarily on how healthy they make you.

286
0:10:58.219,000 --> 0:11:,000
That leads to a second phenomenon that I call

287
0:11:00.53,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the "don't ask, don't tell" approach

288
0:11:01.91,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to upstream issues in healthcare.

289
0:11:04.484,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We don't ask about where you live and where you work,

290
0:11:06.228,000 --> 0:11:07,000
because if there's a problem there,

291
0:11:07.453,000 --> 0:11:09,000
we don't know what to tell you.

292
0:11:10.349,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's not that doctors don't know these are important issues.

293
0:11:13.169,000 --> 0:11:14,000
In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians,

294
0:11:15.04,000 --> 0:11:16,000
over 1,000 physicians,

295
0:11:16.931,000 --> 0:11:17,000
80 percent of them actually said that

296
0:11:18.743,000 --> 0:11:19,000
they know that their patients' upstream problems

297
0:11:20.441,000 --> 0:11:21,000
are as important as their health issues,

298
0:11:22.328,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as their medical problems,

299
0:11:24.02,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and yet despite that widespread awareness

300
0:11:26.381,000 --> 0:11:27,000
of the importance of upstream issues,

301
0:11:28.315,000 --> 0:11:3,000
only one in five doctors said they had

302
0:11:30.588,000 --> 0:11:32,000
any sense of confidence to address those issues,

303
0:11:33.453,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to improve health where it begins.

304
0:11:35.301,000 --> 0:11:36,000
There's this gap between knowing

305
0:11:36.843,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that patients' lives, the context of where they live and work,

306
0:11:39.272,000 --> 0:11:41,000
matters, and the ability to do something about it

307
0:11:42.08,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in the systems in which we work.

308
0:11:43.857,000 --> 0:11:45,000
This is a huge problem right now,

309
0:11:46.191,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because it leads them to this next question, which is,

310
0:11:48.339,000 --> 0:11:49,000
whose responsibility is it?

311
0:11:49.926,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And that brings me to that third point,

312
0:11:51.635,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that third answer to Veronica's compelling question.

313
0:11:54.909,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Part of the reason that we have this conundrum

314
0:11:56.495,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists

315
0:12:00.25,000 --> 0:12:02,000
in the healthcare system.

316
0:12:02.295,000 --> 0:12:03,000
There are not nearly enough of that third friend,

317
0:12:04.195,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that person who is going to find out

318
0:12:05.959,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who or what is throwing those kids in the water.

319
0:12:08.816,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Now, there are many upstreamists,

320
0:12:10.521,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them,

321
0:12:12.962,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in Los Angeles and in other parts of the country

322
0:12:15.589,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and around the world,

323
0:12:17.357,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and it's important to note that upstreamists

324
0:12:19.785,000 --> 0:12:21,000
sometimes are doctors, but they need not be.

325
0:12:22.322,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They can be nurses, other clinicians,

326
0:12:24.515,000 --> 0:12:26,000
care managers, social workers.

327
0:12:26.523,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's not so important what specific degree

328
0:12:28.475,000 --> 0:12:29,000
upstreamists have at the end of their name.

329
0:12:30.274,000 --> 0:12:31,000
What's more important is that they all seem

330
0:12:32.03,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to share the same ability to implement a process

331
0:12:36.455,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that transforms their assistance,

332
0:12:38.244,000 --> 0:12:4,000
transforms the way they practice medicine.

333
0:12:40.59,000 --> 0:12:41,000
That process is a quite simple process.

334
0:12:42.176,000 --> 0:12:44,000
It's one, two and three.

335
0:12:44.549,000 --> 0:12:45,000
First, they sit down and they say,

336
0:12:46.2,000 --> 0:12:48,000
let's identify the clinical problem

337
0:12:48.224,000 --> 0:12:49,000
among a certain set of patients.

338
0:12:49.567,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Let's say, for instance,

339
0:12:51.31,000 --> 0:12:52,000
let's try to help children

340
0:12:53.244,000 --> 0:12:54,000
who are bouncing in and out of the hospital

341
0:12:55.048,000 --> 0:12:57,000
with asthma.

342
0:12:57.13,000 --> 0:12:59,000
After identifying the problem, they then move on to that second step,

343
0:12:59.641,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and they say, let's identify the root cause.

344
0:13:02.38,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Now, a root cause analysis, in healthcare,

345
0:13:06.171,000 --> 0:13:07,000
usually says, well, let's look at your genes,

346
0:13:07.886,000 --> 0:13:09,000
let's look at how you're behaving.

347
0:13:10.344,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Maybe you're not eating healthy enough.

348
0:13:12.424,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Eat healthier.

349
0:13:13.44,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It's a pretty simplistic

350
0:13:14.835,000 --> 0:13:15,000
approach to root cause analyses.

351
0:13:16.241,000 --> 0:13:17,000
It turns out, it doesn't really work

352
0:13:17.906,000 --> 0:13:19,000
when we just limit ourselves that worldview.

353
0:13:20.37,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings

354
0:13:22.471,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to the table is to say, let's look at the living

355
0:13:24.408,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and the working conditions in your life.

356
0:13:27.76,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Perhaps, for children with asthma,

357
0:13:29.842,000 --> 0:13:3,000
it's what's happening in their home,

358
0:13:31.45,000 --> 0:13:33,000
or perhaps they live close to a freeway with major air pollution

359
0:13:34.386,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that triggers their asthma.

360
0:13:36.21,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And perhaps that's what we should mobilize our resources to address,

361
0:13:38.83,000 --> 0:13:4,000
because that third element, that third part of the process,

362
0:13:41.203,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is that next critical part of what upstreamists do.

363
0:13:43.734,000 --> 0:13:45,000
They mobilize the resources to create a solution,

364
0:13:45.973,000 --> 0:13:46,000
both within the clinical system,

365
0:13:47.694,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and then by bringing in people from public health,

366
0:13:50.03,000 --> 0:13:51,000
from other sectors, lawyers,

367
0:13:51.372,000 --> 0:13:52,000
whoever is willing to play ball,

368
0:13:53.319,000 --> 0:13:55,000
let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense,

369
0:13:55.402,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to take those patients who actually have clinical problems

370
0:13:58.212,000 --> 0:14:,000
and address their root causes together

371
0:14:00.395,000 --> 0:14:02,000
by linking them to the resources you need.

372
0:14:02.937,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It's clear to me that there are so many stories

373
0:14:04.714,000 --> 0:14:06,000
of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things.

374
0:14:07.2,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The problem is that there's just not nearly enough of them out there.

375
0:14:09.86,000 --> 0:14:11,000
By some estimates, we need one upstreamist

376
0:14:12.443,000 --> 0:14:14,000
for every 20 to 30 clinicians in the healthcare system.

377
0:14:15.389,000 --> 0:14:16,000
In the U.S., for instance, that would mean

378
0:14:16.644,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that we need 25,000 upstreamists

379
0:14:18.74,000 --> 0:14:21,000
by the year 2020.

380
0:14:22.207,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now, by all accounts,

381
0:14:26.317,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and that's why, a few years ago, my colleagues and I

382
0:14:28.87,000 --> 0:14:29,000
said, you know what, we need to train

383
0:14:30.787,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and make more upstreamists.

384
0:14:32.76,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So we decided to start an organization

385
0:14:34.466,000 --> 0:14:36,000
called Health Begins,

386
0:14:36.684,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and Health Begins simply does that:

387
0:14:38.43,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We train upstreamists.

388
0:14:39.39,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And there are a lot of measures that we use for our success,

389
0:14:41.328,000 --> 0:14:42,000
but the main thing that we're interested in

390
0:14:42.689,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is making sure that we're changing

391
0:14:44.601,000 --> 0:14:45,000
the sense of confidence,

392
0:14:46.14,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that "don't ask, don't tell" metric among clinicians.

393
0:14:48.045,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We're trying to make sure that clinicians,

394
0:14:50.344,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and therefore their systems that they work in

395
0:14:52.284,000 --> 0:14:54,000
have the ability, the confidence

396
0:14:54.579,000 --> 0:14:56,000
to address the problems in the living

397
0:14:57.254,000 --> 0:15:,000
and working conditions in our lives.

398
0:15:00.261,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We're seeing nearly a tripling

399
0:15:02.24,000 --> 0:15:03,000
of that confidence in our work.

400
0:15:03.821,000 --> 0:15:04,000
It's remarkable,

401
0:15:05.124,000 --> 0:15:06,000
but I'll tell you the most compelling part

402
0:15:07.038,000 --> 0:15:08,000
of what it means to be working

403
0:15:08.607,000 --> 0:15:12,000
with upstreamists to gather them together.

404
0:15:13.09,000 --> 0:15:15,000
What is most compelling is that every day,

405
0:15:15.413,000 --> 0:15:18,000
every week, I hear stories just like Veronica's.

406
0:15:19.184,000 --> 0:15:21,000
There are stories out there of Veronica

407
0:15:21.662,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and many more like her,

408
0:15:23.581,000 --> 0:15:24,000
people who are coming to the healthcare system

409
0:15:25.462,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and getting a glimpse of what it feels like

410
0:15:26.84,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to be part of something that works,

411
0:15:29.4,000 --> 0:15:31,000
a health care system that stops bouncing you back and forth

412
0:15:31.873,000 --> 0:15:32,000
but actually improves your health,

413
0:15:33.694,000 --> 0:15:34,000
listens to you who you are,

414
0:15:34.821,000 --> 0:15:36,000
addresses the context of your life,

415
0:15:37.124,000 --> 0:15:41,000
whether you're rich or poor or middle class.

416
0:15:41.489,000 --> 0:15:42,000
These stories are compelling because

417
0:15:43.144,000 --> 0:15:44,000
not only do they tell us that we're this close

418
0:15:45.124,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to getting the healthcare system that we want,

419
0:15:47.71,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but that there's something that we can all do to get there.

420
0:15:50.459,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Doctors and nurses can get better at asking

421
0:15:52.321,000 --> 0:15:53,000
about the context of patients' lives,

422
0:15:54.165,000 --> 0:15:56,000
not simply because it's better bedside manner,

423
0:15:56.676,000 --> 0:15:59,000
but frankly, because it's a better standard of care.

424
0:15:59.758,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Healthcare systems and payers

425
0:16:02.1,000 --> 0:16:04,000
can start to bring in public health agencies

426
0:16:04.89,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and departments and say,

427
0:16:06.305,000 --> 0:16:07,000
let's look at our data together.

428
0:16:07.843,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Let's see if we can discover some patterns in our data about our patients' lives

429
0:16:11.369,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and see if we can identify an upstream cause,

430
0:16:13.84,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and then, as importantly, can we align the resources

431
0:16:16.401,000 --> 0:16:18,000
to be able to address them?

432
0:16:18.737,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Medical schools, nursing schools,

433
0:16:20.131,000 --> 0:16:22,000
all sorts of health professional education programs

434
0:16:22.427,000 --> 0:16:25,000
can help by training the next generation of upstreamists.

435
0:16:26.183,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We can also make sure that these schools

436
0:16:27.938,000 --> 0:16:3,000
certify a backbone of the upstream approach,

437
0:16:31.166,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and that's the community health worker.

438
0:16:33.361,000 --> 0:16:34,000
We need many more of them in the healthcare system

439
0:16:34.88,000 --> 0:16:36,000
if we're truly going to have it be effective,

440
0:16:37.233,000 --> 0:16:38,000
to move from a sickcare system

441
0:16:38.74,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to a healthcare system.

442
0:16:40.238,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But finally, and perhaps most importantly,

443
0:16:42.286,000 --> 0:16:44,000
what do we do? What do we do as patients?

444
0:16:44.845,000 --> 0:16:46,000
We can start by simply going to our doctors

445
0:16:47.11,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and our nurses, to our clinics,

446
0:16:48.819,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and asking, "Is there something in where I live

447
0:16:51.151,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and where I work that I should be aware of?"

448
0:16:53.494,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of,

449
0:16:56.342,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and more importantly, if there are barriers

450
0:16:58.3,000 --> 0:16:59,000
that I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you

451
0:17:00.281,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and I'm saying I think have a problem with

452
0:17:02.4,000 --> 0:17:04,000
my apartment or at my workplace

453
0:17:04.503,000 --> 0:17:06,000
or I don't have access to transportation,

454
0:17:06.699,000 --> 0:17:07,000
or there's a park that's way too far,

455
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
so sorry doctor, I can't take your advice

456
0:17:10.19,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to go and jog,

457
0:17:12.276,000 --> 0:17:13,000
if those problems exist,

458
0:17:14.157,000 --> 0:17:17,000
then doctor, are you willing to listen?

459
0:17:17.453,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And what can we do together

460
0:17:18.866,000 --> 0:17:2,000
to improve my health where it begins?

461
0:17:21.436,000 --> 0:17:23,000
If we're all able to do this work,

462
0:17:23.88,000 --> 0:17:24,000
doctors and healthcare systems,

463
0:17:25.419,000 --> 0:17:27,000
payers, and all of us together,

464
0:17:27.499,000 --> 0:17:29,000
we'll realize something about health.

465
0:17:29.693,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon.

466
0:17:33.115,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Health is a common good.

467
0:17:36.617,000 --> 0:17:37,000
It comes from our personal investment in knowing

468
0:17:38.535,000 --> 0:17:4,000
that our lives matter,

469
0:17:40.816,000 --> 0:17:42,000
the context of where we live and where we work,

470
0:17:42.944,000 --> 0:17:43,000
eat, and sleep, matter,

471
0:17:44.68,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and that what we do for ourselves,

472
0:17:46.304,000 --> 0:17:48,000
we also should do for those

473
0:17:48.424,000 --> 0:17:5,000
whose living and working conditions

474
0:17:50.44,000 --> 0:17:52,000
again, can be hard, if not harsh.

475
0:17:53.058,000 --> 0:17:55,000
We can all invest in making sure that we improve

476
0:17:55.544,000 --> 0:17:57,000
the allocation of resources upstream,

477
0:17:57.794,000 --> 0:17:59,000
but at the same time work together

478
0:17:59.977,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and show that we can move healthcare

479
0:18:02.71,000 --> 0:18:04,000
upstream.

480
0:18:04.747,000 --> 0:18:07,000
We can improve health where it begins.

481
0:18:07.82,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Thank you.

0:18:09.847,000 --> 0:18:11,000

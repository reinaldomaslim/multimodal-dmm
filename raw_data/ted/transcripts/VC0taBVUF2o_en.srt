1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, a funny thing happened

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
on my way to becoming a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist:

3
0:00:23.339,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I had a baby.

4
0:00:25.265,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And that's not to say

5
0:00:26.544,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I ever went on to become a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist.

6
0:00:30.506,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Sorry, TED.

7
0:00:32.975,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But I did go on to be a reasonably astute,

8
0:00:36.658,000 --> 0:00:37,000
arguably world-class worrier.

9
0:00:39.792,000 --> 0:00:41,000
One of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie,

10
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:44,000
said, "Kim, I figured it out.

11
0:00:45.129,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else;

12
0:00:47.96,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are."

13
0:00:51.481,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So in the spirit of full disclosure,

14
0:00:54.519,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I brought some pictures to share.

15
0:00:57.152,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Awwww.

16
0:00:58.384,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:59.409,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I'll just say: July.

18
0:01:01.96,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Zip!

20
0:01:08.399,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:09.424,000 --> 0:01:1,000
For safety.

22
0:01:10.749,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:12.436,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Water wings --

24
0:01:14.352,000 --> 0:01:16,000
an inch of water.

25
0:01:17.729,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And then, finally, all suited up

26
0:01:19.747,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain.

27
0:01:22.539,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So you can get kind of a feel for this.

28
0:01:26.515,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So my baby, Vander, is eight years old now.

29
0:01:29.983,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And, despite being cursed with my athletic inability,

30
0:01:34.624,000 --> 0:01:35,000
he plays soccer.

31
0:01:36.221,000 --> 0:01:37,000
He's interested in playing football.

32
0:01:38.222,000 --> 0:01:4,000
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.

33
0:01:40.507,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So why would I worry?

34
0:01:42.73,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Because this is what I do. This is what I teach.

35
0:01:45.731,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It's what I study. It's what I treat.

36
0:01:47.827,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And I know that kids get concussed every year.

37
0:01:51.943,000 --> 0:01:54,000
In fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year,

38
0:01:55.365,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and these data are just among kids under 14

39
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
who were seen in emergency rooms.

40
0:02:00.246,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And so when kids sustain a concussion,

41
0:02:02.96,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung,

42
0:02:05.96,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but what is it that we're really talking about?

43
0:02:08.66,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Let's take a look.

44
0:02:11.114,000 --> 0:02:13,000
[Concussive Force]

45
0:02:14.313,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes.

46
0:02:17.882,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So, a car accident.

47
0:02:19.166,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier:

48
0:02:21.468,000 --> 0:02:22,000
35 Gs.

49
0:02:26.628,000 --> 0:02:29,000
A heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face:

50
0:02:29.677,000 --> 0:02:3,000
58 Gs.

51
0:02:32.795,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Music)

52
0:02:37.727,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In case you missed it, we'll look again.

53
0:02:40.147,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So look to the right-hand side of the screen.

54
0:02:44.011,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Music)

55
0:02:48.657,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What would you say?

56
0:02:50.864,000 --> 0:02:51,000
How many Gs?

57
0:02:54.341,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Close.

58
0:02:56.151,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Seventy-two?

59
0:02:57.96,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Would it be crazy to know:

60
0:03:00.186,000 --> 0:03:02,000
103 Gs?

61
0:03:02.888,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The average concussive impact

62
0:03:04.654,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is 95 Gs.

63
0:03:07.96,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, when the kid on the right doesn't get up,

64
0:03:11.327,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we know they've had a concussion.

65
0:03:12.96,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But how about the kid on the left,

66
0:03:14.609,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or the athlete that leaves the field of play?

67
0:03:17.127,000 --> 0:03:2,000
How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion?

68
0:03:21.602,000 --> 0:03:22,000
How do we know

69
0:03:22.955,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that legislation that would require they be pulled from play,

70
0:03:26.539,000 --> 0:03:28,000
cleared for return to play,

71
0:03:28.642,000 --> 0:03:29,000
applies to them?

72
0:03:30.745,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The definition of concussion

73
0:03:32.311,000 --> 0:03:34,000
doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness.

74
0:03:34.968,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It requires only a change in consciousness,

75
0:03:37.745,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and that can be any one or a number of symptoms,

76
0:03:40.381,000 --> 0:03:43,000
including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy,

77
0:03:43.563,000 --> 0:03:44,000
hearing a ringing in your ear,

78
0:03:45.262,000 --> 0:03:47,000
being more impulsive or hostile than usual.

79
0:03:48.769,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am,

80
0:03:52.071,000 --> 0:03:54,000
how do I get any sleep at all?

81
0:03:54.652,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Because I know our brains are resilient.

82
0:03:59.329,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They're designed to recover from an injury.

83
0:04:03.71,000 --> 0:04:05,000
If -- God forbid --

84
0:04:05.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion,

85
0:04:09.18,000 --> 0:04:12,000
most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours

86
0:04:12.68,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to a couple of weeks.

87
0:04:14.15,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury.

88
0:04:16.495,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In fact, high-school athletes are three times more likely

89
0:04:19.804,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to sustain catastrophic injuries

90
0:04:22.176,000 --> 0:04:24,000
relative even to their college-age peers,

91
0:04:24.701,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and it takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline.

92
0:04:30.008,000 --> 0:04:32,000
After that first injury,

93
0:04:32.262,000 --> 0:04:35,000
their risk for second injury is exponentially greater.

94
0:04:36.092,000 --> 0:04:4,000
From there, their risk for a third injury, greater still, and so on.

95
0:04:42.012,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And here's the really alarming part:

96
0:04:45.403,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries.

97
0:04:51.159,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You guys may be familiar with this research

98
0:04:53.307,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that's coming out of the NFL.

99
0:04:55.75,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In a nutshell, this research suggests that,

100
0:04:58.491,000 --> 0:05:03,000
among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions,

101
0:05:03.758,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the incidence of early-onset dementing disease

102
0:05:06.758,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is much greater than it is for the general population.

103
0:05:10.086,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So you've all seen that -- New York Times, you've seen it.

104
0:05:12.96,000 --> 0:05:13,000
What you may not be familiar with

105
0:05:14.586,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said,

106
0:05:19.729,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband

107
0:05:22.73,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is forever losing his keys?"

108
0:05:24.793,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"Isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband

109
0:05:27.588,000 --> 0:05:28,000
is forever losing the car?"

110
0:05:30.095,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"Isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband

111
0:05:32.984,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is forever losing his way home

112
0:05:35.029,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in the car, from the driveway?"

113
0:05:38.298,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child.

114
0:05:44.12,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So it's going to be really important

115
0:05:46.924,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that he be able to drive me around someday.

116
0:05:51.276,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:52.45,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So, how do we guarantee the safety of our kids?

118
0:05:57.809,000 --> 0:06:01,000
How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids?

119
0:06:02.666,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Let me tell you what I've come up with.

120
0:06:06.143,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:10.96,000 --> 0:06:11,000
If only.

122
0:06:12.292,000 --> 0:06:14,000
My little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding.

123
0:06:15.305,000 --> 0:06:16,000
She's totally not kidding."

124
0:06:17.474,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So in all seriousness:

125
0:06:20.066,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Should my kid play football?

126
0:06:21.737,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Should your kid play football?

127
0:06:23.548,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I don't know.

128
0:06:24.738,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But I do know there are three things you can do.

129
0:06:28.269,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The first: study up.

130
0:06:31.135,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today.

131
0:06:34.888,000 --> 0:06:36,000
There are some great resources out there.

132
0:06:37.478,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The CDC has a program, HEADS UP.

133
0:06:39.796,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's at CDC.gov.

134
0:06:41.454,000 --> 0:06:44,000
HEADS UP is specific to concussion in kids.

135
0:06:44.866,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of.

136
0:06:48.14,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months --

137
0:06:50.806,000 --> 0:06:51,000
CO Kids With Brain Injury.

138
0:06:52.499,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This is a great resource for student athletes,

139
0:06:55.175,000 --> 0:06:59,000
teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff.

140
0:06:59.588,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's a great place to start if you have questions.

141
0:07:04.143,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The second thing is: speak up.

142
0:07:07.465,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Just two weeks ago,

143
0:07:08.698,000 --> 0:07:09,000
a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas

144
0:07:10.699,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that would have required athletes, kids under 18,

145
0:07:14.633,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike,

146
0:07:16.971,000 --> 0:07:17,000
died in committee.

147
0:07:19.682,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It died, in large part,

148
0:07:21.463,000 --> 0:07:23,000
because it lacked constituent buy-in;

149
0:07:24.417,000 --> 0:07:26,000
it lacked stakeholder traction.

150
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Now, I'm not here to tell you

151
0:07:28.36,000 --> 0:07:3,000
what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support,

152
0:07:31.285,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you,

153
0:07:34.383,000 --> 0:07:36,000
your legislators need to know that.

154
0:07:37.904,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Speak up also with coaching staff.

155
0:07:39.751,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available.

156
0:07:42.752,000 --> 0:07:44,000
What's the budget for protective equipment?

157
0:07:44.825,000 --> 0:07:45,000
How old it is?

158
0:07:46.399,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear.

159
0:07:50.129,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Which brings us to: suit up.

160
0:07:53.15,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Wear a helmet.

161
0:07:55.682,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The only way to prevent a bad outcome

162
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is to prevent that first injury from happening.

163
0:08:02.96,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Recently, one of my graduate students, Tom, said,

164
0:08:07.543,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class."

165
0:08:11.944,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet

166
0:08:15.864,000 --> 0:08:18,000
can reduce the g-force of impact by half.

167
0:08:19.918,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Now, I thought it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade,

168
0:08:24.903,000 --> 0:08:25,000
this epiphany of Tom's.

169
0:08:27.046,000 --> 0:08:3,000
As it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet

170
0:08:30.737,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education.

171
0:08:34.96,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:37.008,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So ...

173
0:08:40.339,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Should Vander play football?

174
0:08:43.371,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I can't say no,

175
0:08:44.698,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house,

176
0:08:48.96,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that kid's wearing a helmet --

177
0:08:51.682,000 --> 0:08:52,000
like, to the car,

178
0:08:53.683,000 --> 0:08:54,000
or at school.

179
0:08:56.348,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So whether athlete, scholar,

180
0:08:59.053,000 --> 0:09:01,000
overprotected kid, neurotic mom,

181
0:09:01.752,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or otherwise,

182
0:09:03.562,000 --> 0:09:04,000
here's my baby, Vander,

183
0:09:05.474,000 --> 0:09:06,000
reminding you

184
0:09:06.879,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to mind your matter.

185
0:09:09.96,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Thank you.

186
0:09:11.152,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Applause)

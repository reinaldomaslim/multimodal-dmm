0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean,

2
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson --

3
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean

4
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.

5
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,

6
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.

7
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I want to share with you

8
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,

9
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost --

10
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
actually, we've taken, we've eaten --

11
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea;

12
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared;

13
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific

14
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
should concern not only the creatures that are dying,

15
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but it really should concern you.

16
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It does concern you, as well.

17
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child,"

18
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
asking why we didn't do something on our watch

19
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean

20
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
while there still was time.

21
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, now is that time.

22
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I hope for your help

23
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to explore and protect the wild ocean

24
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in ways that will restore the health and,

25
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in so doing, secure hope for humankind.

26
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Health to the ocean means health for us.

27
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales

28
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and other sea creatures

29
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.

30
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I hope, Jill, that someday

31
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.

32
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Did I say that? I guess I did.

34
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
For me, as a scientist,

35
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it all began in 1953

36
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
when I first tried scuba.

37
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's when I first got to know fish swimming

38
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in something other than lemon slices and butter.

39
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I actually love diving at night;

40
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.

41
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970,

42
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time --

43
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.

44
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor

45
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
while using this personal submersible called Jim.

46
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.

47
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It's one of my favorite bathing suits.

48
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines

49
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search

50
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to design and build systems

51
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to access the deep sea.

52
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition,

53
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the Sustainable Seas expeditions,

54
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
using these little subs.

55
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.

56
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And I'm living proof.

57
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Astronauts and aquanauts alike

58
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature --

59
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.

60
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain

61
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system

62
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
and then do everything he could

63
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to take care of his life support system;

64
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."

65
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We need to learn everything we can about it

66
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and do everything we can to take care of it.

67
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love;

68
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
none without water."

69
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.

70
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
No blue, no green.

71
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
If you think the ocean isn't important,

72
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
imagine Earth without it.

73
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Mars comes to mind.

74
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
No ocean, no life support system.

75
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank

76
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I showed this amazing image of Earth

77
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!"

78
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That's where all the assets are!

79
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And we've been trawling them down

80
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
much faster than the natural systems can replenish them.

81
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.

82
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
With every drop of water you drink,

83
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
every breath you take,

84
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you're connected to the sea.

85
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
No matter where on Earth you live.

86
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.

87
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon

88
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
has been absorbed and stored there,

89
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
mostly by microbes.

90
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The ocean drives climate and weather,

91
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.

92
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Water from the sea forms clouds

93
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that return to the land and the seas

94
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
as rain, sleet and snow,

95
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world,

96
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
maybe in the universe.

97
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
No water, no life;

98
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
no blue, no green.

99
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Yet we have this idea, we humans,

100
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies --

101
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
are so vast and so resilient

102
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it doesn't matter what we do to it.

103
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That may have been true 10,000 years ago,

104
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and maybe even 1,000 years ago

105
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
but in the last 100, especially in the last 50,

106
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we've drawn down the assets,

107
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the air, the water, the wildlife

108
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that make our lives possible.

109
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
New technologies are helping us to understand

110
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the nature of nature;

111
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the nature of what's happening,

112
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
showing us our impact on the Earth.

113
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.

114
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And fortunately, in our time,

115
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.

116
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And with knowing comes caring.

117
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And with caring, there's hope

118
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that we can find an enduring place for ourselves

119
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
within the natural systems that support us.

120
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But first we have to know.

121
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Three years ago, I met John Hanke,

122
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
who's the head of Google Earth,

123
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands

124
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and go exploring vicariously.

125
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?

126
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
You did a great job with the land, the dirt.

127
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What about the water?"

128
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers,

129
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with DOER Marine, with National Geographic,

130
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world,

131
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
ones that we could enlist,

132
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to put the ocean in Google Earth.

133
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And as of just this week, last Monday,

134
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Google Earth is now whole.

135
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center,

136
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we can find the nearby aquarium,

137
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
we can look at where we're sitting,

138
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean,

139
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and California's four national marine sanctuaries,

140
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the new network of state marine reserves

141
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets

142
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We can flit over to Hawaii

143
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and see the real Hawaiian Islands:

144
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
not just the little bit that pokes through the surface,

145
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but also what's below.

146
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! --

147
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
right there, ha --

148
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
under the ocean, see what the whales see.

149
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.

150
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth

151
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and visit with humpback whales.

152
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face

153
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
many times underwater.

154
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale.

155
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place:

156
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
seven miles down, the Mariana Trench,

157
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
where only two people have ever been.

158
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Imagine that. It's only seven miles,

159
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but only two people have been there, 49 years ago.

160
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
One-way trips are easy.

161
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We need new deep-diving submarines.

162
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?

163
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains,

164
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
and understand life in the deep sea.

165
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We can now go to the Arctic.

166
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.

167
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.

168
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
That's bad news for the polar bears.

169
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That's bad news for us too.

170
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming,

171
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it's also changing ocean chemistry,

172
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
making the sea more acidic.

173
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.

174
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Also it's bad news for us.

175
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic

176
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and other trash into the sea.

177
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets,

178
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
gear that continues to kill.

179
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system,

180
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife,

181
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
all carbon-based units.

182
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup,

183
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry

184
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle,

185
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the oxygen cycle, the water cycle --

186
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
our life support system.

187
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered

188
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and much more valuable alive than dead.

189
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
All of these parts are part of our life support system.

190
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet

191
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that may stretch for 50 miles or more.

192
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor

193
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
like bulldozers, taking everything in their path.

194
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers --

195
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico --

196
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
shaking the foundation of our life support system,

197
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
leaving plumes of death in their path.

198
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi,

199
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail,

200
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean --

201
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
think of the real cost.

202
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
For every pound that goes to market,

203
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds,

204
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
may be thrown away as bycatch.

205
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This is the consequence of not knowing

206
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.

207
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife

208
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
from 1900 to 2000.

209
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The highest concentrations are in red.

210
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
In my lifetime, imagine,

211
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
90 percent of the big fish have been killed.

212
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales

213
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
are way down in numbers.

214
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But, there is good news.

215
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Ten percent of the big fish still remain.

216
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
There are still some blue whales.

217
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
There are still some krill in Antarctica.

218
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.

219
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape,

220
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.

221
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
There's still time, but not a lot,

222
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to turn things around.

223
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But business as usual means that in 50 years,

224
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
there may be no coral reefs --

225
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.

226
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Imagine the ocean without fish.

227
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Imagine what that means to our life support system.

228
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too,

229
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but the problems are more obvious,

230
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.

231
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park,

232
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the United States began establishing a system of parks

233
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that some say was the best idea America ever had.

234
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected:

235
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink,

236
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.

237
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea,

238
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
National Marine Sanctuaries.

239
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
That's another great idea.

240
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
The good news is

241
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world,

242
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that have some kind of protection.

243
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And you can find them on Google Earth.

244
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
The bad news is

245
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that you have to look hard to find them.

246
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
In the last three years, for example,

247
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.

248
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent

249
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.

250
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Protected areas do rebound,

251
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but it takes a long time to restore

252
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass,

253
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
or 200-year-old orange roughy.

254
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.

255
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Protected areas provide hope

256
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream

257
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life,

258
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
will live not just as a list,

259
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
a photograph, or a paragraph.

260
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean

261
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever --

262
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to search out hope spots,

263
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.

264
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Such as the Arctic --

265
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we have one chance, right now, to get it right.

266
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected,

267
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.

268
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest

269
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is being gathered up to feed cows.

270
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected,

271
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.

272
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It's true too in Argentina

273
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.

274
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel --

275
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth,

276
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
filled with luminous creatures,

277
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
living in dark waters that average two miles deep.

278
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
They flash, and sparkle, and glow

279
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
with their own living light.

280
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.

281
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
The next 10 years may be the most important,

282
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have

283
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.

284
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.

285
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.

286
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.

287
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
But, nothing else will matter

288
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
if we fail to protect the ocean.

289
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Our fate and the ocean's are one.

290
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.

291
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
A global plan of action

292
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
with a world conservation union, the IUCN,

293
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
is underway to protect biodiversity,

294
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change,

295
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
on the high seas and in coastal areas,

296
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
wherever we can identify critical places.

297
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore

298
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.

299
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
The goal is to protect biodiversity,

300
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
to provide stability and resilience.

301
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
We need deep-diving subs,

302
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
new technologies to explore the ocean.

303
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
We need, maybe, an expedition --

304
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
a TED at sea --

305
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
that could help figure out the next steps.

306
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.

307
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
I wish you would use all means at your disposal --

308
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
films, expeditions, the web, new submarines --

309
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
and campaign to ignite public support

310
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
for a global network of marine protected areas --

311
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean,

312
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
the blue heart of the planet.

313
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
How much?

314
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.

315
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?

316
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Whatever it is,

317
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
a fraction of one percent is not enough.

318
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
My wish is a big wish,

319
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world,

320
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and help ensure the survival

321
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species;

322
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that would be us.

323
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
For the children of today,

324
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
for tomorrow's child:

325
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
as never again, now is the time.

326
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Thank you.

327
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000

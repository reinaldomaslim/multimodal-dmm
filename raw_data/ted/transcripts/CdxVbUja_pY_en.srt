1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well after many years working in trade and economics,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
four years ago,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I found myself working on the front lines

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of human vulnerability.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I found myself in the places

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
where people are fighting every day to survive

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and can't even obtain a meal.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This red cup comes from Rwanda

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
from a child named Fabian.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I carry this around

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
as a symbol, really, of the challenge

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and also the hope.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Because one cup of food a day

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
changes Fabian's life completely.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But what I'd like to talk about today

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is the fact that this morning,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
about a billion people on Earth --

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
or one out of every seven --

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
woke up and didn't even know

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
how to fill this cup.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
One out of every seven people.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
First, I'll ask you: Why should you care?

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Why should we care?

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
For most people,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
if they think about hunger,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
they don't have to go far back on their own family history --

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives,

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
or their grandparents' lives --

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to remember an experience of hunger.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I rarely find an audience

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
where people can go back very far without that experience.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Some are driven by compassion,

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
feel it's perhaps

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
one of the fundamental acts of humanity.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
As Gandhi said,

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God."

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Others worry about peace and security,

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
stability in the world.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We saw the food riots in 2008,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The destabilizing effects of hunger

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
are known throughout human history.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
One of the most fundamental acts of civilization

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is to ensure people can get enough food.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Others think about Malthusian nightmares.

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Will we be able to feed a population

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that will be nine billion in just a few decades?

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This is not a negotiable thing, hunger.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
People have to eat.

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
There's going to be a lot of people.

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But I actually came to this issue

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in a different way.

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is a picture of me and my three children.

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In 1987, I was a new mother

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
with my first child

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and was holding her and feeding her

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
when an image very similar to this

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
came on the television.

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia.

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
One two years earlier

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
had killed more than a million people.

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But it never struck me as it did that moment,

65
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because on that image

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
was a woman trying to nurse her baby,

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and she had no milk to nurse.

68
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And the baby's cry really penetrated me,

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
as a mother.

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I thought, there's nothing more haunting

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
than the cry of a child

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that cannot be returned with food --

73
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the most fundamental expectation of every human being.

74
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And it was at that moment

75
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that I just was filled

76
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with the challenge and the outrage

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that actually we know how to fix this problem.

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This isn't one of those rare diseases

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that we don't have the solution for.

80
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We know how to fix hunger.

81
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
A hundred years ago, we didn't.

82
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We actually have the technology and systems.

83
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I was just struck

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that this is out of place.

85
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
At our time in history, these images are out of place.

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Well guess what?

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is last week in northern Kenya.

88
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Yet again,

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the face of starvation

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
at large scale

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with more than nine million people

92
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
wondering if they can make it to the next day.

93
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In fact,

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
what we know now

95
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is that every 10 seconds

96
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we lose a child to hunger.

97
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This is more

98
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
than HIV/AIDS,

99
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
malaria and tuberculosis combined.

100
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And we know that the issue

101
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is not just production of food.

102
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
One of my mentors in life

103
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
was Norman Borlaug, my hero.

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But today I'm going to talk about access to food,

105
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
because actually this year and last year

106
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and during the 2008 food crisis,

107
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
there was enough food on Earth

108
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.

109
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So why is it

110
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that we have a billion people

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
who can't find food?

112
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I also want to talk about

113
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
what I call our new burden of knowledge.

114
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
In 2008,

115
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Lancet compiled all the research

116
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and put forward the compelling evidence

117
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that if a child in its first thousand days --

118
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
from conception to two years old --

119
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
does not have adequate nutrition,

120
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the damage is irreversible.

121
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Their brains and bodies will be stunted.

122
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And here you see a brain scan of two children --

123
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
one who had adequate nutrition,

124
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
another, neglected

125
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and who was deeply malnourished.

126
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And we can see brain volumes

127
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
up to 40 percent less

128
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in these children.

129
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And in this slide

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain

131
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
don't form.

132
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies,

133
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
which I'll talk about later.

134
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But also the earning potential of these children

135
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is cut in half in their lifetime

136
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
due to the stunting

137
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that happens in early years.

138
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So this burden of knowledge drives me.

139
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Because actually we know how to fix it

140
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
very simply.

141
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And yet, in many places,

142
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a third of the children,

143
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
by the time they're three

144
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
already are facing a life of hardship

145
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
due to this.

146
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I'd like to talk about

147
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger,

148
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
some of the things I've learned

149
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in bringing my economic and trade knowledge

150
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and my experience in the private sector.

151
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is.

152
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth,

153
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
breastfeeding.

154
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You may be surprised to know

155
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that a child could be saved every 22 seconds

156
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life.

157
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But in Niger, for example,

158
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
less than seven percent of the children

159
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
are breastfed

160
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
for the first six months of life, exclusively.

161
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In Mauritania, less than three percent.

162
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This is something that can be transformed with knowledge.

163
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This message, this word, can come out

164
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business;

165
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
it's a brilliant way

166
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of saving your child's life.

167
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And so today we focus on not just passing out food,

168
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment,

169
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and teaching them about breastfeeding.

170
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The second thing I'd like to talk about:

171
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
If you were living in a remote village somewhere,

172
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
your child was limp,

173
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and you were in a drought, or you were in floods,

174
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet,

175
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
what would you do?

176
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Do you think you could go to the store

177
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and get a choice of power bars, like we can,

178
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and pick the right one to match?

179
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Well I find parents out on the front lines

180
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
very aware their children are going down for the count.

181
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And I go to those shops, if there are any,

182
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
or out to the fields to see what they can get,

183
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and they cannot obtain the nutrition.

184
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Even if they know what they need to do, it's not available.

185
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And I'm very excited about this,

186
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because one thing we're working on

187
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is transforming the technologies

188
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that are very available

189
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in the food industry

190
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to be available for traditional crops.

191
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And this is made with chickpeas, dried milk

192
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and a host of vitamins,

193
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
matched to exactly what the brain needs.

194
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It costs 17 cents for us to produce this

195
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
as, what I call, food for humanity.

196
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We did this with food technologists

197
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in India and Pakistan --

198
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
really about three of them.

199
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But this is transforming

200
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
99 percent of the kids who get this.

201
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
One package, 17 cents a day --

202
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
their malnutrition is overcome.

203
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So I am convinced

204
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that if we can unlock the technologies

205
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
that are commonplace in the richer world

206
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to be able to transform foods.

207
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And this is climate-proof.

208
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water,

209
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which is often lacking.

210
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And these types of technologies,

211
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I see, have the potential

212
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to transform the face of hunger and nutrition, malnutrition

213
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
out on the front lines.

214
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding.

215
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Eighty percent of the people in the world

216
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
have no food safety net.

217
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
When disaster strikes --

218
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the economy gets blown, people lose a job,

219
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
floods, war, conflict,

220
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
bad governance, all of those things --

221
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
there is nothing to fall back on.

222
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And usually the institutions --

223
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
churches, temples, other things --

224
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
do not have the resources

225
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to provide a safety net.

226
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
What we have found working with the World Bank

227
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is that the poor man's safety net,

228
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the best investment, is school feeding.

229
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And if you fill the cup

230
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
with local agriculture from small farmers,

231
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
you have a transformative effect.

232
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Many kids in the world can't go to school

233
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
because they have to go beg and find a meal.

234
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But when that food is there,

235
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
it's transformative.

236
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life.

237
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls.

238
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
In countries where girls don't go to school

239
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and you offer a meal to girls in school,

240
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we see enrollment rates

241
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
about 50 percent girls and boys.

242
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We see a transformation in attendance by girls.

243
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And there was no argument,

244
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because it's incentive.

245
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Families need the help.

246
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And we find that if we keep girls in school later,

247
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
they'll stay in school until they're 16,

248
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and won't get married if there's food in school.

249
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Or if they get an extra ration of food

250
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
at the end of the week --

251
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
it costs about 50 cents --

252
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
will keep a girl in school,

253
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and they'll give birth to a healthier child,

254
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because the malnutrition is sent

255
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
generation to generation.

256
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger.

257
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We know this.

258
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Right now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before.

259
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So is this a hopeless cause?

260
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Absolutely not.

261
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.

262
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Cameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger

263
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
every year for decades.

264
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Food aid coming in every year

265
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
when people are starving during the lean seasons.

266
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Well two years ago,

267
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger,

268
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks.

269
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And we said, listen,

270
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
during the lean season, take the food out.

271
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
You manage, the village manages these warehouses.

272
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And during harvest, put it back with interest,

273
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
food interest.

274
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So add in five percent, 10 percent more food.

275
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
For the past two years,

276
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
500 of these villages where these are

277
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
have not needed any food aid -- they're self-sufficient.

278
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And the food banks are growing.

279
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And they're starting school feeding programs for their children

280
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
by the people in the village.

281
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But they've never had the ability

282
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to build even the basic infrastructure

283
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
or the resources.

284
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I love this idea that came from the village level:

285
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
three keys to unlock that warehouse.

286
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Food is gold there.

287
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And simple ideas can transform the face,

288
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
not of small areas,

289
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
of big areas of the world.

290
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I'd like to talk about what I call digital food.

291
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Technology is transforming

292
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the face of food vulnerability

293
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in places where you see classic famine.

294
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize

295
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
for saying, "Guess what, famines happen in the presence of food

296
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
because people have no ability to buy it."

297
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We certainly saw that in 2008.

298
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa

299
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas

300
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
over last year.

301
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Food can be there and people can't buy it.

302
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop,

303
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
where instead of bringing in food,

304
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
we provide digital food, a card.

305
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It says "bon appetit" in Arabic.

306
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And the women can go in and swipe

307
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and get nine food items.

308
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They have to be nutritious,

309
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and they have to be locally produced.

310
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And what's happened in the past year alone

311
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is the dairy industry --

312
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
where this card's used for milk and yogurt

313
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and eggs and hummus --

314
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent.

315
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
The shopkeepers are hiring more people.

316
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It is a win-win-win situation

317
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that starts the food economy moving.

318
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We now deliver food in over 30 countries

319
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
over cell phones,

320
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
transforming even the presence of refugees in countries,

321
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and other ways.

322
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Perhaps most exciting to me

323
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
is an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others

324
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
have supported boldly,

325
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
which is to ask the question:

326
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
What if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims --

327
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and most of them are small farmers

328
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
who cannot raise enough food or sell food

329
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to even support their own families --

330
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
what if we view them as the solution,

331
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
as the value chain to fight hunger?

332
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
What if from the women in Africa

333
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
who cannot sell any food --

334
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
there's no roads, there's no warehouses,

335
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with --

336
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
what if we give the enabling environment

337
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
for them to provide the food

338
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to feed the hungry children elsewhere?

339
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries.

340
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And guess what?

341
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
In virtually every case,

342
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market --

343
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
if you say, "We will buy 300 metric tons of this.

344
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly." --

345
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
their yields have gone up two-, three-, fourfold

346
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and they figure it out,

347
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life.

348
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And we're seeing people transform their lives.

349
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Today, food aid, our food aid --

350
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
huge engine --

351
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.

352
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Total transformation

353
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that can actually transform the very lives that need the food.

354
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now you'd ask, can this be done at scale?

355
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
These are great ideas, village-level ideas.

356
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil,

357
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years,

358
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger

359
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
faster than any nation on Earth right now.

360
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And what I've found is,

361
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
rather than investing their money in food subsidies

362
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and other things,

363
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
they invested in a school feeding program.

364
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And they require that a third of that food

365
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.

366
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And they're doing this at huge scale

367
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
after President Lula declared his goal

368
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
of ensuring everyone had three meals a day.

369
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And this zero hunger program

370
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
costs .5 percent of GDP

371
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and has lifted many millions of people

372
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
out of hunger and poverty.

373
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil,

374
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.

375
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers

376
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
who have built their livelihoods

377
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
on the opportunity and platform

378
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
provided by this.

379
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Now if we look at the economic imperative here,

380
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
this isn't just about compassion.

381
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
The fact is studies show

382
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that the cost of malnutrition and hunger --

383
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
the cost to society,

384
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
the burden it has to bear --

385
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
is on average six percent,

386
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and in some countries up to 11 percent,

387
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
of GDP a year.

388
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And if you look at the 36 countries

389
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
with the highest burden of malnutrition,

390
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that's 260 billion lost from a productive economy

391
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
every year.

392
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Well, the World Bank estimates

393
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
it would take about 10 billion dollars --

394
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
10.3 --

395
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
to address malnutrition in those countries.

396
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
You look at the cost-benefit analysis,

397
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and my dream is to take this issue,

398
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
not just from the compassion argument,

399
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
but to the finance ministers of the world,

400
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and say we cannot afford

401
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
to not invest

402
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in the access to adequate, affordable nutrition

403
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
for all of humanity.

404
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
The amazing thing I've found

405
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
is nothing can change on a big scale

406
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
without the determination of a leader.

407
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
When a leader says, "Not under my watch,"

408
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
everything begins to change.

409
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And the world can come in

410
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
with enabling environments and opportunities to do this.

411
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And the fact that France

412
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
has put food at the center of the G20

413
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
is really important.

414
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Because food is one issue

415
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation.

416
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
We have to stand together.

417
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And we're seeing nations in Africa.

418
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations

419
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
because they have transformed

420
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
the face of hunger in their nations.

421
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
What I would like to offer here is a challenge.

422
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
I believe we're living at a time in human history

423
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
where it's just simply unacceptable

424
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
that children wake up

425
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and don't know where to find a cup of food.

426
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Not only that,

427
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
transforming hunger

428
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
is an opportunity,

429
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
but I think we have to change our mindsets.

430
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
I am so honored to be here

431
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.

432
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And I would like you to join with all of humanity

433
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
to draw a line in the sand

434
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and say, "No more.

435
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
No more are we going to accept this."

436
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And we want to tell our grandchildren

437
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
that there was a terrible time in history

438
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
where up to a third of the children

439
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
had brains and bodies that were stunted,

440
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
but that exists no more.

441
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Thank you.

442
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My talk essentially got written

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
by three historic events

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that happened within days of each other

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in the last two months --

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
seemingly unrelated, but as you will see,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
actually all having to do with

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the story I want to tell you today.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The first one was actually a funeral --

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to be more precise, a reburial.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
On May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in Frombork, Poland

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of the 16th-century astronomer

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
who actually changed the world.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
He did that, literally,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
by replacing the Earth with the Sun

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in the center of the Solar System,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and then with this simple-looking act,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
he actually launched a scientific

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and technological revolution,

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
which many call the Copernican Revolution.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now that was,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
ironically, and very befittingly,

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the way we found his grave.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
As it was the custom of the time,

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Copernicus was actually

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
simply buried in an unmarked grave,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
together with 14 others

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in that cathedral.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
DNA analysis,

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
one of the hallmarks

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of the scientific revolution

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
of the last 400 years that he started,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
was the way we found

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which set of bones

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
actually belonged to the person

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
who read all those astronomical books

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which were filled with leftover hair

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that was Copernicus' hair --

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
obviously not many other people

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
bothered to read these books later on.

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That match was unambiguous.

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The DNA matched,

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and we know that this was indeed

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Nicolaus Copernicus.

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, the connection between

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
biology and DNA

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and life

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because, even back then,

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
his followers

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
very quickly made the logical step

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to ask: if the Earth is just a planet,

54
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
then what about planets around other stars?

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds,

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
about life on other planets?

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
very popular books of the time.

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And at the time,

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
people actually answered that question

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
positively: "Yes."

62
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But there was no evidence.

63
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And here begins 400 years

64
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of frustration, of unfulfilled dreams --

65
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the dreams of Galileo, Giordano Bruno,

66
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
many others --

67
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
which never led to the answer

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of those very basic questions

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which humanity has asked all the time.

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"What is life? What is the origin of life?

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Are we alone?"

72
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And that especially happened in the last 10 years,

73
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
at the end of the 20th century,

74
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
when the beautiful developments

75
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
due to molecular biology,

76
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
understanding the code of life, DNA,

77
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
all of that seemed to actually

78
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
put us, not closer,

79
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but further apart from answering

80
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
those basic questions.

81
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, the good news.

82
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
A lot has happened in the last few years,

83
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and let's start with the planets.

84
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Let's start with the old Copernican question:

85
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Are there earths around other stars?

86
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And as we already heard,

87
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
there is a way in which

88
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
we are trying, and now able,

89
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to answer that question.

90
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's a new telescope.

91
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Our team, befittingly I think,

92
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
named it after one of those dreamers

93
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of the Copernican time,

94
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Johannes Kepler,

95
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and that telescope's sole purpose

96
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is to go out,

97
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
find the planets that orbit

98
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
other stars in our galaxy,

99
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth

100
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
happen to be out there.

101
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The telescope is actually

102
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
built similarly to

103
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope,

104
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
except it does have an additional lens --

105
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a wide-field lens,

106
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
as you would call it as a photographer.

107
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And if, in the next couple of months,

108
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
you walk out in the early evening

109
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and look straight up

110
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and place you palm like this,

111
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you will actually be looking at the field of the sky

112
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
where this telescope is searching for planets

113
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
day and night, without any interruption,

114
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for the next four years.

115
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The way we do that, actually,

116
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is with a method, which we call the transit method.

117
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's actually mini-eclipses that occur

118
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
when a planet passes in front of its star.

119
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented

120
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
for us to be able do that,

121
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but if you have a million stars,

122
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you'll find enough planets.

123
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And as you see on this animation,

124
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
what Kepler is going to detect

125
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is just the dimming of the light from the star.

126
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this.

127
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light.

128
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But we learn a lot from that:

129
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size.

130
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
How much of the light is being dimmed

131
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
depends on how big the planet is.

132
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We learn about its orbit,

133
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the period of its orbit and so on.

134
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So, what have we learned?

135
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Well, let me try to walk you through

136
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
what we actually see

137
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and so you understand the news

138
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that I'm here to tell you today.

139
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
What Kepler does

140
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is discover a lot of candidates,

141
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which we then follow up and find as planets,

142
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
confirm as planets.

143
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It basically tells us

144
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
this is the distribution of planets in size.

145
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay.

146
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So we count many, many such planets,

147
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and they have different sizes.

148
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We do that in our solar system.

149
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In fact, even back during the ancients,

150
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the Solar System in that sense

151
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
would look on a diagram like this.

152
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
There will be the smaller planets, and there will be the big planets,

153
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
even back to the time of Epicurus

154
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and then of course Copernicus

155
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and his followers.

156
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Up until recently, that was the Solar System --

157
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
four Earth-like planets with small radius,

158
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
smaller than about two times the size of the Earth --

159
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and that was of course Mercury,

160
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Venus, Mars,

161
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and of course the Earth,

162
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and then the two big, giant planets.

163
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Then the Copernican Revolution

164
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
brought in telescopes,

165
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and of course three more planets were discovered.

166
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now the total planet number

167
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
in our solar system was nine.

168
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The small planets dominated,

169
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and there was a certain harmony to that,

170
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
which actually Copernicus was very happy to note,

171
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and Kepler was one of the big proponents of.

172
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.

173
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But up until, literally, 15 years ago,

174
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that was all we knew about planets.

175
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And that's what the frustration was.

176
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled.

177
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Finally, 15 years ago,

178
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the technology came to the point

179
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
where we could discover a planet around another star,

180
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and we actually did pretty well.

181
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
In the next 15 years,

182
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
almost 500 planets

183
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
were discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods.

184
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Unfortunately, as you can see,

185
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
there was a very different picture.

186
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
There was of course an explanation for it:

187
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We only see the big planets,

188
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so that's why most of those planets

189
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
are really in the category of "like Jupiter."

190
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But you see, we haven't gone very far.

191
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We were still back where Copernicus was.

192
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We didn't have any evidence

193
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
whether planets like the Earth are out there.

194
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And we do care about planets like the Earth

195
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because by now we understood

196
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that life as a chemical system

197
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
really needs a smaller planet

198
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
with water and with rocks

199
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and with a lot of complex chemistry

200
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to originate, to emerge, to survive.

201
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And we didn't have the evidence for that.

202
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse

203
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
of what the new telescope, Kepler,

204
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
has been able to tell us in the last few weeks,

205
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and, lo and behold,

206
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we are back to the harmony

207
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.

208
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You can see here,

209
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the small planets dominate the picture.

210
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The planets which are marked "like Earth,"

211
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
[are] definitely more than

212
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
any other planets that we see.

213
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And now for the first time, we can say that.

214
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
There is a lot more work we need to do with this.

215
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Most of these are candidates.

216
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In the next few years we will confirm them.

217
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But the statistical result

218
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is loud and clear.

219
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And the statistical result is that

220
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
planets like our own Earth

221
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
are out there.

222
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets.

223
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So the question is: what do we do next?

224
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Well, first of all, we can study them

225
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
now that we know where they are.

226
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And we can find those that we would call habitable,

227
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
meaning that they have similar conditions

228
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to the conditions

229
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that we experience here on Earth

230
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen.

231
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So, we can even put a number

232
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to how many of those planets

233
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
now do we expect our own

234
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Milky Way Galaxy harbors.

235
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And the number, as you might expect,

236
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is pretty staggering.

237
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's about 100 million such planets.

238
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That's great news. Why?

239
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Because with our own little telescope,

240
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
just in the next two years,

241
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them.

242
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So that's great because then

243
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we can go and study them --

244
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
remotely, of course --

245
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with all the techniques that we already have

246
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
tested in the past five years.

247
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We can find what they're made of,

248
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
would their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane.

249
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We know and expect that we'll see that.

250
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
That's great, but that is not the whole news.

251
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
That's not why I'm here.

252
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step

253
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
is really the exciting part.

254
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The one that this step

255
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is enabling us to do is coming next.

256
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And here comes biology --

257
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
biology, with its basic question,

258
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
which still stands unanswered,

259
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
which is essentially:

260
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
"If there is life on other planets,

261
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
do we expect it to be like life on Earth?"

262
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And let me immediately tell you here,

263
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita,"

264
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
good life, human life.

265
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I really mean life

266
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
on Earth, past and present,

267
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
from microbes to us humans,

268
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in its rich molecular diversity,

269
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the way we now understand life on Earth

270
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions --

271
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and we call that, collectively, biochemistry,

272
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
life as a chemical process,

273
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
as a chemical phenomenon.

274
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So the question is:

275
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
is that chemical phenomenon universal,

276
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
or is it something

277
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
which depends on the planet?

278
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Is it like gravity,

279
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which is the same everywhere in the universe,

280
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries

281
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
wherever we find them?

282
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We need to know what we are looking for

283
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
when we try to do that.

284
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And that's a very basic question, which we don't know the answer to,

285
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but which we can try --

286
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and we are trying -- to answer in the lab.

287
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We don't need to go to space

288
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to answer that question.

289
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And so, that's what we are trying to do.

290
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And that's what many people now are trying to do.

291
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge

292
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that we are trying to build as well.

293
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So this is one example

294
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that I want to show you here.

295
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
When we think of what is necessary

296
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
for the phenomenon that we call life,

297
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
we think of compartmentalization,

298
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
keeping the molecules which are important for life

299
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in a membrane,

300
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
isolated from the rest of the environment,

301
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but yet, in an environment in which

302
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
they actually could originate together.

303
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And in one of our labs,

304
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Jack Szostak's labs,

305
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
it was a series of experiments

306
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
in the last four years

307
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that showed that the environments --

308
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
which are very common on planets,

309
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
on certain types of planets like the Earth,

310
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
where you have some liquid water and some clays --

311
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
you actually end up with

312
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
naturally available molecules

313
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
which spontaneously form bubbles.

314
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But those bubbles have membranes

315
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
very similar to the membrane of every cell

316
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
of every living thing on Earth looks like,

317
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
like this.

318
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And they really help molecules,

319
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA,

320
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
stay inside, develop,

321
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
change, divide

322
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and do some of the processes that we call life.

323
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Now this is just an example

324
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to tell you the pathway

325
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in which we are trying to answer

326
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon.

327
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And in a sense, you can think of that work

328
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that people are starting to do now around the world

329
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
as building a bridge,

330
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
building a bridge from two sides of the river.

331
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
On one hand, on the left bank of the river,

332
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
are the people like me who study those planets

333
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and try to define the environments.

334
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities,

335
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and there is not too much lab,

336
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and there is not enough human time

337
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to actually to do all the experiments.

338
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So that's what we are building from the left side of the river.

339
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
From the right bank of the river

340
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you,

341
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
where we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth,

342
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and we hope to meet in the middle one day.

343
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So why should you care about that?

344
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Why am I trying to sell you

345
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
a half-built bridge?

346
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Am I that charming?

347
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Well, there are many reasons,

348
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and you heard some of them

349
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in the short talk today.

350
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
This understanding of chemistry

351
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
actually can help us

352
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
with our daily lives.

353
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But there is something more profound here,

354
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
something deeper.

355
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And that deeper, underlying point

356
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
is that science

357
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is in the process of redefining life

358
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
as we know it.

359
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And that is going to change

360
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
our worldview in a profound way --

361
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
not in a dissimilar way

362
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
as 400 years ago,

363
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Copernicus' act did,

364
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
by changing the way

365
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
we view space and time.

366
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Now it's about something else,

367
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
but it's equally profound.

368
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And half the time,

369
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
what's happened

370
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
is it's related this kind of

371
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
sense of insignificance

372
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
to humankind,

373
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to the Earth in a bigger space.

374
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And the more we learn,

375
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the more that was reinforced.

376
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
You've all learned that in school --

377
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
how small the Earth is

378
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
compared to the immense universe.

379
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And the bigger the telescope,

380
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the bigger that universe becomes.

381
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.

382
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
This pixel is the Earth.

383
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It is the Earth as we know it.

384
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It is seen from, in this case,

385
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
from outside the orbit of Saturn.

386
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But it's really tiny.

387
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We know that.

388
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Let's think of life as that entire planet

389
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
because, in a sense, it is.

390
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
The biosphere is the size of the Earth.

391
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Life on Earth

392
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
is the size of the Earth.

393
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And let's compare it to the rest of the world

394
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
in spatial terms.

395
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
What if that

396
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Copernican insignificance

397
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
was actually all wrong?

398
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Would that make us more responsible

399
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
for what is happening today?

400
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Let's actually try that.

401
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So in space, the Earth is very small.

402
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Can you imagine how small it is?

403
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Let me try it.

404
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Okay, let's say

405
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
this is the size

406
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
of the observable universe,

407
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
with all the galaxies,

408
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
with all the stars,

409
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
okay, from here to here.

410
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Do you know what the size of life

411
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
in this necktie will be?

412
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
It will be the size

413
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
of a single, small atom.

414
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
It is unimaginably small.

415
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We can't imagine it.

416
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I mean look, you can see the necktie,

417
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but you can't even imagine seeing

418
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
the size of a little, small atom.

419
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
But that's not the whole story, you see.

420
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
The universe and life

421
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
are both in space and time.

422
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
If that was

423
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the age of the universe,

424
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
then this is the age of life on Earth.

425
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Think about those oldest living things on Earth,

426
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
but in a cosmic proportion.

427
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
This is not insignificant.

428
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
This is very significant.

429
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So life might be insignificant in size,

430
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
but it is not insignificant in time.

431
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Life and the universe

432
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
compare to each other like a child and a parent,

433
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
parent and offspring.

434
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
So what does this tell us?

435
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
This tells us that

436
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that insignificance paradigm

437
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that we somehow got to learn

438
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
from the Copernican principle,

439
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
it's all wrong.

440
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
There is immense, powerful potential

441
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
in life in this universe --

442
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
especially now that we know

443
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
that places like the Earth are common.

444
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
And that potential, that powerful potential,

445
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
is also our potential,

446
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
of you and me.

447
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And if we are to be stewards

448
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
of our planet Earth

449
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and its biosphere,

450
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
we'd better understand

451
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
the cosmic significance

452
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and do something about it.

453
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And the good news is we can

454
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
actually, indeed do it.

455
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
And let's do it.

456
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Let's start this new revolution

457
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
at the tail end of the old one,

458
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
with synthetic biology being

459
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
the way to transform

460
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
both our environment

461
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and our future.

462
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And let's hope that we can build this bridge together

463
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and meet in the middle.

464
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Thank you very much.

465
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:07.66,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to start with a question where

2
0:00:15.49,000 --> 0:00:21,000
does an artwork begin now sometimes that

3
0:00:18.82,000 --> 0:00:24,000
question is absurd it can seem

4
0:00:22.02,000 --> 0:00:26,000
deceptively simple as it was when I

5
0:00:25.57,000 --> 0:00:29,000
asked the question with this piece

6
0:00:26.98,000 --> 0:00:31,000
portable planetarium that I made in 2010

7
0:00:29.739,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I asked the question what would it look

8
0:00:32.739,000 --> 0:00:36,000
like to build a planetarium of one's own

9
0:00:35.11,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I know you all ask that every morning

10
0:00:37.36,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but I asked myself that question and as

11
0:00:40.84,000 --> 0:00:47,000
an artist I was thinking about our

12
0:00:43.69,000 --> 0:00:5,000
effort our desire our continual longing

13
0:00:47.95,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that we've had over the years to make a

14
0:00:51.07,000 --> 0:00:57,000
meaning of the world around us through

15
0:00:53.86,000 --> 0:00:59,000
materials and for me to try and find a

16
0:00:57.52,000 --> 0:01:02,000
kind of wonder but also a kind of

17
0:01:00.01,000 --> 0:01:06,000
futility that lies in that very fragile

18
0:01:03.37,000 --> 0:01:08,000
pursuit is part of my artwork so I bring

19
0:01:06.4,000 --> 0:01:11,000
together the materials I find around me

20
0:01:08.74,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I gather them to try and create

21
0:01:11.56,000 --> 0:01:16,000
experiences immersive experiences that

22
0:01:14.499,000 --> 0:01:19,000
occupy rooms they occupy walls

23
0:01:17.079,000 --> 0:01:23,000
landscapes buildings but ultimately I

24
0:01:20.2,000 --> 0:01:25,000
want them to occupy memory and after

25
0:01:23.409,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I've made a work I find that there's

26
0:01:26.079,000 --> 0:01:3,000
usually one memory of that work that

27
0:01:28.149,000 --> 0:01:32,000
burns in my head and this is the memory

28
0:01:30.939,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for me it was this sudden kind of

29
0:01:33.13,000 --> 0:01:38,000
surprising experience of being immersed

30
0:01:35.139,000 --> 0:01:4,000
inside that work of art and it stayed

31
0:01:38.259,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with me and kind of reoccurred in my

32
0:01:40.359,000 --> 0:01:44,000
work about ten years later but I want to

33
0:01:42.759,000 --> 0:01:46,000
go back to my graduate school studio

34
0:01:44.889,000 --> 0:01:48,000
well um this is like I think it's

35
0:01:47.53,000 --> 0:01:5,000
interesting sometimes when you start a

36
0:01:49.299,000 --> 0:01:53,000
body of work you need to just completely

37
0:01:51.039,000 --> 0:01:55,000
wipe the plate clean take everything

38
0:01:53.409,000 --> 0:01:57,000
away and this may not look like wiping

39
0:01:55.869,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the plate clean but for me it was

40
0:01:57.459,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because I had studied painting for about

41
0:02:00.789,000 --> 0:02:03,000
10 years and when I went to graduate

42
0:02:02.799,000 --> 0:02:05,000
school I realized that I had developed

43
0:02:04.45,000 --> 0:02:07,000
skill but I didn't have a subject it was

44
0:02:06.429,000 --> 0:02:1,000
like an athletic skill because I could

45
0:02:08.17,000 --> 0:02:12,000
paint the figure quickly but I didn't

46
0:02:10.84,000 --> 0:02:14,000
know why I could paint it well but it

47
0:02:12.61,000 --> 0:02:16,000
didn't have content and so I decided to

48
0:02:15.099,000 --> 0:02:18,000
start with to put all the paints aside

49
0:02:17.02,000 --> 0:02:21,000
for a while and to ask this question

50
0:02:19.08,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which was

51
0:02:21.05,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and how do objects acquire value for us

52
0:02:24.44,000 --> 0:02:29,000
how does a shirt that I know everyone

53
0:02:27.2,000 --> 0:02:31,000
thousands of people wear a shirt like

54
0:02:30.02,000 --> 0:02:33,000
this one how does this somehow feel like

55
0:02:31.85,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it's mine so I started with that

56
0:02:33.83,000 --> 0:02:37,000
experience I decided by collecting

57
0:02:35.6,000 --> 0:02:39,000
materials that had a certain quality to

58
0:02:37.97,000 --> 0:02:41,000
them they were mass-produced easily

59
0:02:39.95,000 --> 0:02:44,000
accessible completely designed for the

60
0:02:42.65,000 --> 0:02:46,000
purpose of their use not for their

61
0:02:45.02,000 --> 0:02:51,000
aesthetics so things like toothpicks

62
0:02:47.48,000 --> 0:02:53,000
thumbtacks pieces of toilet paper to see

63
0:02:51.02,000 --> 0:02:56,000
if in the way that I put my energy my

64
0:02:53.69,000 --> 0:02:58,000
hand my time into them that the behavior

65
0:02:56.63,000 --> 0:03:,000
could actually create a kind of value in

66
0:02:59.09,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the work itself and so one of the other

67
0:03:01.31,000 --> 0:03:05,000
ideas is I wanted the work to become

68
0:03:02.93,000 --> 0:03:06,000
live so I wanted to take it off of the

69
0:03:05.39,000 --> 0:03:09,000
pedestal not have a frame around it have

70
0:03:07.67,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the experience not be that you came to

71
0:03:09.44,000 --> 0:03:13,000
something and told you that it was

72
0:03:11.54,000 --> 0:03:15,000
important but that you discovered that

73
0:03:13.55,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it was in your own time so this is like

74
0:03:16.1,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a very very old idea in sculpture which

75
0:03:19.58,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is how do we breathe life into inanimate

76
0:03:22.58,000 --> 0:03:27,000
materials and so I would go to a space

77
0:03:26.06,000 --> 0:03:3,000
like this where there was a wall and

78
0:03:27.86,000 --> 0:03:31,000
used the paint itself pulled the paint

79
0:03:30.65,000 --> 0:03:33,000
out off the wall the wall paint into

80
0:03:32.6,000 --> 0:03:35,000
space to create a sculpture because I

81
0:03:34.58,000 --> 0:03:37,000
was also interested in this idea that

82
0:03:36.17,000 --> 0:03:39,000
these terms sculpture painting

83
0:03:38.44,000 --> 0:03:4,000
installation

84
0:03:39.62,000 --> 0:03:42,000
none of these mattered and though in the

85
0:03:41.3,000 --> 0:03:45,000
way we actually see the world so I

86
0:03:42.92,000 --> 0:03:47,000
wanted to blur those boundaries both

87
0:03:45.53,000 --> 0:03:49,000
between mediums that art artists talked

88
0:03:48.02,000 --> 0:03:52,000
about but also blur the experience of

89
0:03:50.36,000 --> 0:03:54,000
being in life and being in art so that

90
0:03:52.43,000 --> 0:03:55,000
when you were in your everyday or so

91
0:03:54.53,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that when you're in one of my works and

92
0:03:56.18,000 --> 0:04:03,000
you saw you recognized the everyday you

93
0:04:00.23,000 --> 0:04:05,000
could then move that experience into

94
0:04:03.56,000 --> 0:04:08,000
your own life and perhaps see the art in

95
0:04:06.08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
everyday life I was in graduate school

96
0:04:09.23,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in 90s and my studio just became more

97
0:04:11.27,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and more filled with images as did my

98
0:04:13.91,000 --> 0:04:18,000
life and this confusion of images and

99
0:04:16.43,000 --> 0:04:21,000
objects was really part of the way I was

100
0:04:19.519,000 --> 0:04:23,000
trying to make sense of materials and

101
0:04:21.5,000 --> 0:04:25,000
also I was interested in how this might

102
0:04:23.96,000 --> 0:04:27,000
change the way that we actually

103
0:04:25.61,000 --> 0:04:3,000
experience time if we're experiencing

104
0:04:28.13,000 --> 0:04:33,000
time through materials what happens when

105
0:04:31.1,000 --> 0:04:34,000
images and objects become confused in

106
0:04:33.86,000 --> 0:04:35,000
space

107
0:04:34.7,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so I started by doing some of these

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
experiments with images and if you look

109
0:04:40.13,000 --> 0:04:46,000
back to the 1880s that's when the first

110
0:04:43.91,000 --> 0:04:48,000
photograph started turning into film and

111
0:04:46.49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
they were done through experimentations

112
0:04:49.67,000 --> 0:04:53,000
with the studies of the sub animals of

113
0:04:52.13,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the movement of animals so horses in the

114
0:04:53.93,000 --> 0:04:57,000
United States Birds and France there

115
0:04:56.45,000 --> 0:05:,000
were these studies of movement that then

116
0:04:58.01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
slowly like zoetrope became films so I

117
0:05:00.74,000 --> 0:05:04,000
decided I will take an animal and I'm

118
0:05:03.56,000 --> 0:05:07,000
gonna play with that idea of how the

119
0:05:05.69,000 --> 0:05:1,000
image is not stat is not static for us

120
0:05:08.09,000 --> 0:05:13,000
anymore it's moving it's moving in space

121
0:05:10.76,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and so I chose is my character the

122
0:05:14.06,000 --> 0:05:19,000
cheetah because she is the fastest land

123
0:05:17.09,000 --> 0:05:21,000
dwelling creature on earth and she holds

124
0:05:19.73,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that record and I want to use her record

125
0:05:21.86,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to actually make it kind of a measuring

126
0:05:25.19,000 --> 0:05:29,000
stick for time and so this is what she

127
0:05:27.29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
looked like in the sculpture as she

128
0:05:30.08,000 --> 0:05:34,000
moved through space this kind of broken

129
0:05:32.11,000 --> 0:05:37,000
framing of the image in space because I

130
0:05:34.82,000 --> 0:05:39,000
had put a notepad paper and had it

131
0:05:37.73,000 --> 0:05:41,000
actually projected on it then I did this

132
0:05:40.13,000 --> 0:05:44,000
experiment where you have kind of a race

133
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
with these new tools and video that I

134
0:05:44.45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
could play with so the falcon moves out

135
0:05:46.85,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in front the cheetah she comes in second

136
0:05:48.86,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and the Rhino is trying to catch up

137
0:05:50.96,000 --> 0:05:53,000
behind then another one of the

138
0:05:52.82,000 --> 0:05:56,000
experiments I was thinking about how if

139
0:05:54.8,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we try and remember one thing that

140
0:05:57.71,000 --> 0:06:02,000
happened to us when we worth let's say

141
0:06:00.11,000 --> 0:06:05,000
10 years old it's very hard to remember

142
0:06:03.02,000 --> 0:06:07,000
even what happened in that year and for

143
0:06:05.78,000 --> 0:06:1,000
me I can think of maybe one maybe two

144
0:06:07.76,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and that one moment has expanded in my

145
0:06:11.63,000 --> 0:06:16,000
mind to fill that entire year so we're

146
0:06:14.78,000 --> 0:06:19,000
not we don't experience time in minutes

147
0:06:16.82,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and seconds so this it's a still of the

148
0:06:20.09,000 --> 0:06:24,000
video that I took printed out on a piece

149
0:06:22.67,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of paper the paper is torn and then the

150
0:06:24.89,000 --> 0:06:28,000
video is projected on top of it and I

151
0:06:27.56,000 --> 0:06:31,000
wanted to play with this idea of how in

152
0:06:29.78,000 --> 0:06:35,000
this kind of complete immersion of

153
0:06:31.79,000 --> 0:06:4,000
images that's enveloped us how one image

154
0:06:35.93,000 --> 0:06:42,000
can actually grow and can haunt us so I

155
0:06:41.27,000 --> 0:06:45,000
had all of these there's a three out of

156
0:06:42.95,000 --> 0:06:46,000
like a hundred experiments I was trying

157
0:06:45.44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
with images for over about a decade and

158
0:06:47.63,000 --> 0:06:5,000
never

159
0:06:48.169,000 --> 0:06:53,000
showing them and I thought okay how do I

160
0:06:50.779,000 --> 0:06:55,000
bring this into out of the studio into a

161
0:06:53.479,000 --> 0:06:57,000
public space but retain this kind of

162
0:06:55.819,000 --> 0:06:59,000
energy of experimentation that you see

163
0:06:58.4,000 --> 0:07:01,000
when you go into a laboratory you see

164
0:07:00.259,000 --> 0:07:03,000
when you go into a studio and I had this

165
0:07:02.27,000 --> 0:07:05,000
show coming up and I just said all right

166
0:07:03.8,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I'm gonna put my desk right in the

167
0:07:05.689,000 --> 0:07:09,000
middle of the room so I brought my desk

168
0:07:08.18,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and I put it in the room and it actually

169
0:07:10.61,000 --> 0:07:13,000
worked in this kind of very surprising

170
0:07:12.77,000 --> 0:07:15,000
way to me in that it was this kind of

171
0:07:14.479,000 --> 0:07:18,000
flickering because of the video screens

172
0:07:16.599,000 --> 0:07:21,000
from afar and it had all of the

173
0:07:19.4,000 --> 0:07:22,000
projectors on it so the projectors were

174
0:07:21.65,000 --> 0:07:24,000
creating the space around it but you

175
0:07:23.27,000 --> 0:07:27,000
were drawn towards the flickering like a

176
0:07:25.49,000 --> 0:07:29,000
flame and then you were enveloped in the

177
0:07:28.099,000 --> 0:07:31,000
piece at the scale that we're all very

178
0:07:29.87,000 --> 0:07:34,000
familiar with which is the scale of

179
0:07:31.789,000 --> 0:07:36,000
being in front of a desk or a sink you

180
0:07:34.969,000 --> 0:07:38,000
know or a table and you were immersed

181
0:07:37.339,000 --> 0:07:42,000
then back into this scale this

182
0:07:39.71,000 --> 0:07:44,000
one-to-one scale of the body in relation

183
0:07:42.889,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to the image but on this surface

184
0:07:44.779,000 --> 0:07:49,000
you had these projections on paper being

185
0:07:48.349,000 --> 0:07:52,000
blown in the wind so there was this

186
0:07:50.36,000 --> 0:07:54,000
confusion of what was an image and what

187
0:07:52.969,000 --> 0:07:56,000
was an object so this is what the work

188
0:07:55.099,000 --> 0:07:58,000
looked like when it went into a larger

189
0:07:57.02,000 --> 0:08:,000
room and it wasn't until I made this

190
0:07:58.52,000 --> 0:08:02,000
piece that I realized that it

191
0:08:00.58,000 --> 0:08:05,000
effectively made the interior of a

192
0:08:03.199,000 --> 0:08:08,000
planetarium without even realizing that

193
0:08:05.629,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and I remembered that as a child loving

194
0:08:08.96,000 --> 0:08:12,000
going to the planetarium and back then

195
0:08:11.659,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the planetarium there was always not

196
0:08:13.37,000 --> 0:08:17,000
only these amazing images on the ceiling

197
0:08:15.649,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but you could see the projector itself

198
0:08:18.08,000 --> 0:08:23,000
whizzing and burning this amazing camera

199
0:08:21.349,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in the middle of the room and it was

200
0:08:23.449,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that along with seeing the audience

201
0:08:25.759,000 --> 0:08:29,000
around you looking up because it was a

202
0:08:27.8,000 --> 0:08:31,000
audience in the round at that time and

203
0:08:30.08,000 --> 0:08:34,000
seeing them and experiencing being part

204
0:08:32.029,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of an audience so this is an image from

205
0:08:34.419,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the web that I downloaded of people who

206
0:08:38.209,000 --> 0:08:41,000
took images of themselves in the work

207
0:08:40.13,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and I like this image because you see

208
0:08:41.569,000 --> 0:08:46,000
how the figures get mixed with the work

209
0:08:43.94,000 --> 0:08:48,000
so you have the shadow of a visitor

210
0:08:47.47,000 --> 0:08:5,000
against a projection and you also see

211
0:08:49.73,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the projections across a person's shirt

212
0:08:51.35,000 --> 0:08:55,000
so there were these self-portraits made

213
0:08:53.51,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in the work itself and then posters and

214
0:08:56.18,000 --> 0:08:59,000
it felt like a kind of cyclical image

215
0:08:58.699,000 --> 0:09:01,000
making process

216
0:09:00.14,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and kind of an end to that but it

217
0:09:02.209,000 --> 0:09:06,000
reminded me and brought me back to the

218
0:09:04.64,000 --> 0:09:08,000
planetarium and then that interior and I

219
0:09:07.07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
started to go back to painting and

220
0:09:08.75,000 --> 0:09:13,000
thinking about how a painting is

221
0:09:11.269,000 --> 0:09:16,000
actually for me about the interior

222
0:09:14.12,000 --> 0:09:18,000
images that we all have there's so many

223
0:09:16.64,000 --> 0:09:21,000
interior images we've become so focused

224
0:09:18.769,000 --> 0:09:23,000
on what's outside our eyes and how these

225
0:09:22.01,000 --> 0:09:26,000
images how do we store memory in our

226
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
mind how certain images emerge out of

227
0:09:26.839,000 --> 0:09:31,000
nowhere or can fall apart over time and

228
0:09:29.779,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I started to call this series the after

229
0:09:32.12,000 --> 0:09:36,000
image series which was a reference to

230
0:09:34.459,000 --> 0:09:37,000
this idea that if we all close our eyes

231
0:09:36.44,000 --> 0:09:39,000
right now you can see there's this

232
0:09:38.24,000 --> 0:09:41,000
flickering light that lingers and when

233
0:09:40.279,000 --> 0:09:44,000
we open it again it lingers again this

234
0:09:41.99,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is happening all the time and an after

235
0:09:44.329,000 --> 0:09:49,000
image is something that a photograph can

236
0:09:46.88,000 --> 0:09:5,000
never never replace and you never feel

237
0:09:49.91,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that in the photograph so it really

238
0:09:51.86,000 --> 0:09:55,000
reminds you of the limits of the

239
0:09:53.959,000 --> 0:09:57,000
camera's lens so is this idea of taking

240
0:09:56.06,000 --> 0:10:,000
the images that were outside of me this

241
0:09:58.01,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is my studio and then trying to figure

242
0:10:00.56,000 --> 0:10:05,000
out how they were being represented

243
0:10:02.779,000 --> 0:10:07,000
inside me so really quickly I'm just

244
0:10:05.57,000 --> 0:10:1,000
going to whiz through how a process

245
0:10:07.94,000 --> 0:10:13,000
might develop so for the next piece so

246
0:10:10.73,000 --> 0:10:15,000
it might start with a sketch or an image

247
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that's burned in my memory from the 18th

248
0:10:16.37,000 --> 0:10:21,000
century it's pure and AZ's the Colosseum

249
0:10:18.62,000 --> 0:10:23,000
or a model the size of a basketball I

250
0:10:22.22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
built this around a basketball evidence

251
0:10:23.99,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the scales evidence by the red cup

252
0:10:25.64,000 --> 0:10:29,000
behind it and that model can be put into

253
0:10:28.43,000 --> 0:10:32,000
a larger piece as a seed and that seed

254
0:10:30.35,000 --> 0:10:34,000
can grow into a bigger piece and that

255
0:10:32.63,000 --> 0:10:37,000
piece can fill a very very large space

256
0:10:35.23,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but it can funnel down into a video

257
0:10:38.329,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that's just made from my iPhone of the

258
0:10:41.779,000 --> 0:10:48,000
puddle outside of my studio and a rainy

259
0:10:44.39,000 --> 0:10:5,000
night so this is an after image of the

260
0:10:49.04,000 --> 0:10:54,000
painting made in my memory and even that

261
0:10:51.079,000 --> 0:10:57,000
painting can fade as memory does so this

262
0:10:54.74,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is the scale of a very small image from

263
0:10:57.89,000 --> 0:11:01,000
my sketchbook you can see how it can

264
0:10:59.839,000 --> 0:11:04,000
explode to a subway station that spans

265
0:11:02.75,000 --> 0:11:06,000
three blocks and you could see how going

266
0:11:05.149,000 --> 0:11:1,000
into the subway station is like a

267
0:11:07.13,000 --> 0:11:11,000
journey through the pages of a

268
0:11:10.19,000 --> 0:11:13,000
sketchbook and you can see sort of a

269
0:11:11.81,000 --> 0:11:15,000
diary of war

270
0:11:13.41,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Ritt across the public space and you're

271
0:11:16.35,000 --> 0:11:21,000
turning the pages of 20 years of artwork

272
0:11:18.69,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as you move through the subway but even

273
0:11:21.57,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that sketch is actually has a different

274
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
origin has origin in a sculpture that

275
0:11:28.55,000 --> 0:11:33,000
climbs a six story building and is

276
0:11:31.17,000 --> 0:11:35,000
scaled to a cat from the year 2000 to I

277
0:11:34.02,000 --> 0:11:38,000
remember that because I had two black

278
0:11:35.64,000 --> 0:11:4,000
cats at the time and this is an image of

279
0:11:38.64,000 --> 0:11:42,000
a work from Japan that you can see the

280
0:11:41.04,000 --> 0:11:46,000
after made in the subway or work in

281
0:11:43.23,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Venice where you see the image edged in

282
0:11:46.41,000 --> 0:11:52,000
the wall or how sculpture that I did at

283
0:11:49.38,000 --> 0:11:55,000
SF MoMA in 2001 and created this kind of

284
0:11:52.92,000 --> 0:11:57,000
dynamic line how I stole that to create

285
0:11:55.86,000 --> 0:12:,000
a dynamic line as you descend down into

286
0:11:58.41,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the subway itself and this merging of

287
0:12:01.2,000 --> 0:12:04,000
mediums is really interesting to me so

288
0:12:02.79,000 --> 0:12:06,000
how can you take a line that pulls

289
0:12:05.01,000 --> 0:12:09,000
tension like a sculpture and put it into

290
0:12:06.93,000 --> 0:12:1,000
a print or then use line like a drawing

291
0:12:09.69,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in a sculpture to create a dramatic

292
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
perspective or how can a painting mimic

293
0:12:14.1,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the process of printmaking

294
0:12:16.25,000 --> 0:12:23,000
how can an installation use the camera's

295
0:12:19.59,000 --> 0:12:25,000
lens to frame a landscape how can a

296
0:12:23.39,000 --> 0:12:3,000
painting on string become a moment in

297
0:12:26.25,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Denmark in the middle of a track and how

298
0:12:30.51,000 --> 0:12:34,000
on the High Line can you create a piece

299
0:12:32.28,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that camouflages itself into the nature

300
0:12:34.68,000 --> 0:12:4,000
itself and become a habitat for the

301
0:12:38.13,000 --> 0:12:43,000
nature around it and I'll just end with

302
0:12:41.52,000 --> 0:12:45,000
two pieces that I'm making now this is a

303
0:12:44.1,000 --> 0:12:48,000
piece called fallen sky that's going to

304
0:12:46.17,000 --> 0:12:5,000
be a permanent commissioned in Hudson

305
0:12:48.75,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Valley and it's kind of the planetarium

306
0:12:50.79,000 --> 0:12:54,000
finally come down and grounding itself

307
0:12:53.52,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in the earth and this is a work from

308
0:12:55.77,000 --> 0:13:01,000
2013 that's going to be reinstalled have

309
0:12:58.47,000 --> 0:13:04,000
a new life in the reopening of MoMA and

310
0:13:01.83,000 --> 0:13:06,000
it's a piece that the tool itself is the

311
0:13:05.34,000 --> 0:13:11,000
sculpture so the pendulum as it swings

312
0:13:07.5,000 --> 0:13:14,000
is used as a tool to create the piece so

313
0:13:11.67,000 --> 0:13:15,000
each of the piles of objects go right up

314
0:13:14.97,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to one centimetre

315
0:13:16.14,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to that to the tip of that pendulum so

316
0:13:20.04,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you have this combination of the lull of

317
0:13:22.35,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that beautiful swing but also the

318
0:13:24.42,000 --> 0:13:26,000
tension that it constantly could destroy

319
0:13:26.31,000 --> 0:13:29,000
the

320
0:13:26.64,000 --> 0:13:31,000
itself and so it doesn't really matter

321
0:13:29.94,000 --> 0:13:34,000
where any of these pieces end up because

322
0:13:32.13,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the real point for me is that they end

323
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
up in your memory over time and they

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I think the future of this planet depends on humans,

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
not technology, and we already have the knowledge --

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
we’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge.

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But we’re nowhere near the endgame

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
when it comes to our perception.

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We still have one foot in the dark ages.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And when you listen to some of the presentations here --

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings --

9
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and then you contrast it with the fact

10
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we still call this planet, "Earth:" it’s pretty extraordinary --

11
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we have one foot in the dark ages.

12
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Just quickly: Aristotle, his thing was, "It’s not flat, stupid, it’s round."

13
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Galileo -- he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite --

14
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
his was, "It’s not in the middle, you know."

15
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And Hawkes: "it’s not earth, stupid, it’s ocean."

16
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This is an ocean planet.

17
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
T.S. Eliot really said it for me --

18
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and this should give you goose bumps:

19
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"we shall not cease from exploration

20
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the end of our exploring shall be to return

21
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
where we started and know the place for the first time."

22
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And the next lines are, "Through the unknown remembered gate,

23
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
where the last of earth discovered

24
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is that which is the beginning."

25
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So I have one message.

26
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It seems to me that we’re all pointed in the wrong direction.

27
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
For the rocketeers in the audience:

28
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I love what you’re doing, I admire the guts,

29
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I admire the courage -- but your rockets

30
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction.

31
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And it’s all a question of perspective.

33
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Let me try and tell you --

34
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I don’t mean to insult you, but look,

35
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
if I -- and I’m not doing this for real

36
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because it would be an insult,

37
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
so I’m going to pretend, and it softens the blow --

38
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I’m going to tell you what you’re thinking.

39
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth,

40
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and I held up another square that was the root two square --

41
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so it’s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans;

42
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and I said, what is the relative value of these two things?

43
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Well, it’s the relative importance.

44
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You would say -- yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this;

45
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land.

46
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But it’s a question of perception,

47
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and if that’s what you’re thinking,

48
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
if that’s what you think I mean when I say,

49
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'"

50
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
If you think that that’s the relative importance,

51
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
two to one, you’re wrong by a factor of ten.

52
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, you’re not as thick as two short planks,

53
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but you sound like it when you say "Earth,"

54
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because that demonstration, if I turned around this way --

55
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that earth plane would be as thin as paper.

56
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It’s a thin film, two-dimensional existence.

57
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The ocean representation would have a depth to it.

58
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And if you hefted those two things

59
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.

60
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It turns out that something more than

61
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
94 percent of life on earth is aquatic.

62
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority.

63
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The problem we have in believing that

64
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is -- you just have to give up this notion

65
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that this Earth was created for us.

66
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Because it’s a problem we have.

67
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
If this is an ocean planet

68
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and we only have a small minority of this planet,

69
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.

70
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Okay. Let me criticize this thing.

71
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I’m not talking about James Cameron --

72
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
although I could, but I won’t.

73
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You really do have to go and see his latest film,

74
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"Aliens of the Deep." It’s incredible.

75
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It features two of these deep rovers,

76
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine.

77
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
This, I think, represents one of the most beautiful

78
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
classic submersibles built.

79
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you look at that sub, you’ll see a sphere.

80
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
This is an acryclic sphere.

81
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It generates all of the buoyancy,

82
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
all of the payload for the craft,

83
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and the batteries are down here hanging underneath,

84
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
exactly like a balloon.

85
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload.

86
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights.

87
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And this one actually carries two great manipulators.

88
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It actually is a very good working sub --

89
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that’s what it was designed for.

90
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The problem with it is --

91
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the reason I will never build another one like it --

92
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking.

93
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers;

94
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we take all our terrestrial hang-ups,

95
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
all our constraints -- importantly,

96
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
these two-dimensional constraints that we have,

97
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it --

98
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and we take them underwater.

99
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.

100
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
A seat works in a two-dimensional world,

101
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?

102
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And in a two-dimensional world,

103
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we do know about the third dimension

104
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but we don’t use it because to go up

105
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
requires an awful lot of energy against gravity.

106
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And then our mothers tell us,

107
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"Careful you don’t fall down" -- because you’ll fall over.

108
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.

109
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This planet has an inner atmosphere of water;

110
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it’s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres --

111
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one.

112
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere.

113
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence,

114
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
which is alien to us.

115
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Fish do not sit in seats.

116
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They don’t. Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish,

118
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"Careful you don’t fall over."

119
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They don’t fall over. They don’t fall.

120
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They live in a three-dimensional world

121
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
where there is no difference in energy

122
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
between going this way, that way, that way or that way.

123
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It’s truly a three-dimensional space.

124
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And we’re only just beginning to grasp it.

125
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I don’t know of any other submersible,

126
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or even remote, that just takes advantage

127
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that this is a three-dimensional space.

128
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is the way we should be going into the oceans.

129
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This is a three-dimensional machine.

130
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals,

131
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and move in this three-dimensional space.

132
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
OK, this is good stuff.

133
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater.

134
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Right now, I’m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray.

135
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
She has twice the wingspan that I do.

136
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
There I’m coming; she sees me.

137
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And just notice how she rolls under and turns;

138
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
she doesn’t sit there and try and blow air into a tank

139
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and kind of flow up or sink down -- she just rolls.

140
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the craft that I’m in --

141
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
this hasn’t been shown before.

142
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before.

143
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I wanted you to notice

144
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that she actually turned to come back up.

145
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
There I am; I see her coming back,

146
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
coming up underneath me.

147
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down.

148
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I’m trying to do everything very gently.

149
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We spent about three hours together and she’s beginning to trust me.

150
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And this ballet is controlled by this lady here.

151
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
She gets about that close and then she pulls away.

152
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So now I try and go after her, but I’m practicing flying.

153
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype.

154
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This was a fly by wire. It has wings.

155
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
There’re no silly buoyancy tanks --

156
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it’s permanently, positively buoyant.

157
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And then by moving through the water

158
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
it’s able to take that control.

159
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Now, look at that; look, it’s -- she just blew me away.

160
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
She just rolled right away from underneath.

161
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Really that’s the only real dive I’ve ever made in this machine.

162
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It took 10 years to build.

163
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much.

164
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We just learned so much in three hours in the water there.

165
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I just had to go and build another machine.

166
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But look here. Instead of blowing tanks

167
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and coming up slowly without thinking about it,

168
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
it’s a little bit of back pressure,

169
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.

170
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony.

171
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I don’t really look that ugly,

172
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted.

173
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Now, there she goes, right overhead.

174
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This is a wide-angle camera.

175
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head.

176
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about,

177
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
oh, I don’t know, just so close."

178
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I come back up, not for air.

179
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I’m speechless.

180
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
We’ve been just feet apart. I’m going back down now."

181
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please.

182
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Applause)

183
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Trying to fly and keep up with that animal --

184
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
it wasn’t the lack of maneuverability that we had.

185
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It was the fact she was going so slow.

186
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I actually designed that to move faster through the water

187
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because I thought that was the thing

188
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that we needed to do: to move fast and get range.

189
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance.

190
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
She wanted to dance.

191
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area

192
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
so that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.

193
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So the sub that was outside last year -- this is the one.

194
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
You see the larger wing area here.

195
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Also, clearly, it was such a powerful thing,

196
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
we wanted to try and bring other people

197
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but we couldn't figure out how to do it.

198
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So we opened the world’s first flight school.

199
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The rational for the world’s first flight school

200
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
goes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say --

201
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
they used to leave us alone when we were diving

202
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
these goofy little spherical things,

203
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but when we started flying around

204
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous --

205
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
they would come up and say,

206
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
"Do you have a license for that?"

207
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And then I’d put my sunglasses on, the beard

208
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that would all sprout out, and I would say,

209
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"I don’t need no stinking license."

210
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Laughter)

211
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
"I write these stinking license," which I do.

212
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So Bob Gelfond's around here --

213
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but somebody in the audience here has license number 20.

214
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They’re one of the first subsea aviators.

215
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So we’ve run two flight schools.

216
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Where the hell that goes, I don’t know, but it’s a lot of fun.

217
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
What comes next in 30 seconds? I can’t tell you.

218
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But the patent for underwater flight --

219
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Karen and I, we were looking at it,

220
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
some business partners wanted us to patent it --

221
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
we weren’t sure about that.

222
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We’ve decided we’re just going to let that go.

223
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It just seems wrong to try and patent --

224
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Applause)

225
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
-- the freedom for underwater flight.

226
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So anybody who wants to copy us

227
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and come and join us, go for it.

228
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The other thing is that we’ve got much lower costs.

229
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We developed some other technology

230
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
called spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me

231
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to make an announcement here this morning:

232
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we’re going to be building a beautiful, little,

233
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
small version of this -- unmanned, super deep --

234
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff.

235
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Applause)

236
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:12.812,000 --> 0:00:13,000
There's an African proverb that goes,

2
0:00:14.832,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"The lion's story will never be known

3
0:00:17.51,000 --> 0:00:19,000
as long as the hunter is the one to tell it."

4
0:00:21.273,000 --> 0:00:25,000
More than a racial conversation, we need a racial literacy

5
0:00:25.535,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to decode the politics of racial threat in America.

6
0:00:30.335,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Key to this literacy is a forgotten truth,

7
0:00:33.614,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that the more we understand

8
0:00:36.888,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that our cultural differences represent the power

9
0:00:40.459,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to heal the centuries

10
0:00:42.07,000 --> 0:00:43,000
of racial discrimination,

11
0:00:43.922,000 --> 0:00:44,000
dehumanization and illness.

12
0:00:46.495,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Both of my parents were African-American.

13
0:00:49.849,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My father was born in Southern Delaware,

14
0:00:51.945,000 --> 0:00:52,000
my mother, North Philadelphia,

15
0:00:53.432,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and these two places are as different from each other as east is from west,

16
0:00:57.746,000 --> 0:00:59,000
as New York City is from Montgomery, Alabama.

17
0:01:01.262,000 --> 0:01:03,000
My father's way of dealing with racial conflict

18
0:01:03.711,000 --> 0:01:06,000
was to have my brother Bryan, my sister Christy and I in church

19
0:01:07.478,000 --> 0:01:09,000
what seemed like 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

20
0:01:10.362,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:12.406,000 --> 0:01:15,000
If anybody bothered us because of the color of our skin,

22
0:01:16.427,000 --> 0:01:18,000
he believed that you should pray for them,

23
0:01:18.649,000 --> 0:01:2,000
knowing that God would get them back in the end.

24
0:01:21.481,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:23.256,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You could say that his racial-coping approach was spiritual --

26
0:01:26.555,000 --> 0:01:27,000
for later on, one day,

27
0:01:28.534,000 --> 0:01:29,000
like Martin Luther King.

28
0:01:30.658,000 --> 0:01:32,000
My mother's coping approach was a little different.

29
0:01:33.121,000 --> 0:01:35,000
She was, uh, you could say, more relational --

30
0:01:35.92,000 --> 0:01:37,000
right now, like, in your face,

31
0:01:38.164,000 --> 0:01:39,000
right now.

32
0:01:39.826,000 --> 0:01:4,000
More like Malcolm X.

33
0:01:41.22,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:42.56,000 --> 0:01:43,000
She was raised from neighborhoods

35
0:01:44.164,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in which there was racial violence and segregation,

36
0:01:46.624,000 --> 0:01:48,000
where she was chased out of neighborhoods,

37
0:01:48.728,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and she exacted violence to chase others out of hers.

38
0:01:51.299,000 --> 0:01:52,000
When she came to Southern Delaware,

39
0:01:53.312,000 --> 0:01:55,000
she thought she had come to a foreign country.

40
0:01:56.023,000 --> 0:01:57,000
She didn't understand anybody,

41
0:01:58.087,000 --> 0:02:,000
particularly the few black and brown folks

42
0:02:00.976,000 --> 0:02:03,000
who were physically deferential and verbally deferential

43
0:02:04.258,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in the presence of whites.

44
0:02:06.238,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Not my mother.

45
0:02:07.416,000 --> 0:02:09,000
When she wanted to go somewhere, she walked.

46
0:02:09.671,000 --> 0:02:1,000
She didn't care what you thought.

47
0:02:11.78,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And she pissed a lot of people off with her cultural style.

48
0:02:15.66,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Before we get into the supermarket,

49
0:02:17.637,000 --> 0:02:18,000
she would give us the talk:

50
0:02:20.393,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Don't ask for nothin',

51
0:02:22.111,000 --> 0:02:23,000
don't touch nothin'.

52
0:02:24.149,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

53
0:02:28.168,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I don't care if all the other children are climbing the walls.

54
0:02:31.281,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They're not my children.

55
0:02:32.845,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?"

56
0:02:36.134,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In three-part harmony:

57
0:02:37.69,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Yes, Mom."

58
0:02:40.674,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Before we'd get into the supermarket,

59
0:02:43.171,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that talk was all we needed.

60
0:02:45.055,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, how many of you ever got that talk?

61
0:02:48.194,000 --> 0:02:5,000
How many of you ever give that talk?

62
0:02:50.42,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:51.895,000 --> 0:02:53,000
How many of you ever give that talk today?

64
0:02:55.898,000 --> 0:02:58,000
My mother didn't give us the talk because she was worried about money

65
0:02:59.268,000 --> 0:03:,000
or reputation

66
0:03:00.46,000 --> 0:03:01,000
or us misbehaving.

67
0:03:01.93,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We never misbehaved.

68
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We were too scared.

69
0:03:05.017,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We were in church 24 hours a day,

70
0:03:06.701,000 --> 0:03:07,000
seven days a week.

71
0:03:07.876,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:09.682,000 --> 0:03:1,000
She gave us that talk to remind us

73
0:03:11.693,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that some people in the world would interpret us as misbehaving

74
0:03:15.922,000 --> 0:03:16,000
just by being black.

75
0:03:18.122,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Not every parent has to worry about their children being misjudged

76
0:03:22.455,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because of the color of their skin,

77
0:03:24.362,000 --> 0:03:25,000
just by breathing.

78
0:03:26.71,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So we get into the supermarket,

79
0:03:28.692,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and people look at us --

80
0:03:29.886,000 --> 0:03:31,000
stare at us as if we just stole something.

81
0:03:33.793,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Every now and then, a salesperson would do something or say something

82
0:03:37.276,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because they were pissed with our cultural style,

83
0:03:39.673,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and it would usually happen at the conveyor belt.

84
0:03:42.006,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And the worst thing they could do was to throw our food into the bag.

85
0:03:46.858,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And when that happened, it was on.

86
0:03:48.717,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

87
0:03:49.813,000 --> 0:03:51,000
My mother began to tell them who they were,

88
0:03:52.036,000 --> 0:03:53,000
who their family was,

89
0:03:53.598,000 --> 0:03:54,000
where to go,

90
0:03:55.073,000 --> 0:03:56,000
how fast to get there.

91
0:03:56.628,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

92
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:04:,000
If you haven't been cursed out by my mother, you haven't lived.

93
0:04:01.131,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:02.783,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The person would be on the floor,

95
0:04:04.473,000 --> 0:04:07,000
writhing in utter decay and decomposition,

96
0:04:07.591,000 --> 0:04:09,000
whimpering in a pool of racial shame.

97
0:04:09.858,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:11.033,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, both my parents were Christians.

99
0:04:14.003,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The difference is my father prayed before a racial conflict

100
0:04:17.172,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and my mother prayed after.

101
0:04:18.875,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:20.813,000 --> 0:04:23,000
There is a time, if you use both of their strategies,

103
0:04:23.842,000 --> 0:04:25,000
if you use them in the right time and the right way.

104
0:04:27.073,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But it's never a time --

105
0:04:28.972,000 --> 0:04:3,000
there's a time for conciliation,

106
0:04:31.064,000 --> 0:04:33,000
there's a time for confrontation,

107
0:04:33.185,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but it's never a time to freeze up like a deer in the headlights,

108
0:04:37.695,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and it's never a time to lash out in heedless, thoughtless anger.

109
0:04:43.062,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The lesson in this is

110
0:04:45.175,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that when it comes to race relations,

111
0:04:46.998,000 --> 0:04:48,000
sometimes, we've got to know how to pray,

112
0:04:49.067,000 --> 0:04:51,000
think through, process, prepare.

113
0:04:51.63,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And other times, we've got to know how to push,

114
0:04:53.911,000 --> 0:04:54,000
how to do something.

115
0:04:55.309,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I'm afraid that neither of these two skills --

116
0:04:58.607,000 --> 0:04:59,000
preparing,

117
0:05:00.55,000 --> 0:05:01,000
pushing --

118
0:05:01.732,000 --> 0:05:03,000
are prevalent in our society today.

119
0:05:06.991,000 --> 0:05:09,000
If you look at the neuroscience research

120
0:05:11.8,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which says that when we are racially threatened,

121
0:05:14.448,000 --> 0:05:15,000
our brains go on lockdown,

122
0:05:16.142,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and we dehumanize black and brown people.

123
0:05:19.095,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Our brains imagine that children and adults are older than they really are,

124
0:05:25.309,000 --> 0:05:26,000
larger than they really are

125
0:05:27.012,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and closer than they really are.

126
0:05:29.901,000 --> 0:05:31,000
When we're at our worst, we convince ourselves

127
0:05:32.084,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that they don't deserve affection or protection.

128
0:05:35.797,000 --> 0:05:36,000
At the Racial Empowerment Collaborative,

129
0:05:37.764,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we know that some of the scariest moments are racial encounters,

130
0:05:43.302,000 --> 0:05:45,000
some of the scariest moments that people will ever face.

131
0:05:47.266,000 --> 0:05:51,000
If you look at the police encounters that have led to some wrongful deaths

132
0:05:51.811,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of mostly Native Americans and African-Americans in this country,

133
0:05:55.074,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they've lasted about two minutes.

134
0:05:58.266,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Within 60 seconds,

135
0:06:00.237,000 --> 0:06:02,000
our brains go on lockdown.

136
0:06:02.734,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And when we're unprepared,

137
0:06:04.142,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we overreact.

138
0:06:05.676,000 --> 0:06:06,000
At best, we shut down.

139
0:06:07.842,000 --> 0:06:09,000
At worst, we shoot first and ask no questions.

140
0:06:11.805,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Imagine if we could reduce the intensity of threat

141
0:06:15.258,000 --> 0:06:16,000
within those 60 seconds

142
0:06:17.164,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and keep our brains from going on lockdown.

143
0:06:20.695,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Imagine how many children would get to come home from school

144
0:06:23.95,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or 7-Eleven

145
0:06:25.133,000 --> 0:06:27,000
without getting expelled or shot.

146
0:06:28.256,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Imagine how many mothers and fathers wouldn't have to cry.

147
0:06:33.339,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Racial socialization can help young people negotiate 60-second encounters,

148
0:06:39.181,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but it's going to take more than a chat.

149
0:06:41.447,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It requires a racial literacy.

150
0:06:44.56,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now, how do parents have these conversations,

151
0:06:46.728,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and what is a racial literacy?

152
0:06:48.723,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Thank you for asking.

153
0:06:49.936,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:51.185,000 --> 0:06:55,000
A racial literacy involves the ability to read,

155
0:06:55.544,000 --> 0:06:58,000
recast and resolve a racially stressful encounter.

156
0:06:59.348,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Reading involves recognizing when a racial moment happens

157
0:07:02.79,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and noticing our stress reactions to it.

158
0:07:05.958,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Recasting involves

159
0:07:08.83,000 --> 0:07:12,000
taking mindfulness and reducing my tsunami interpretation of this moment

160
0:07:13.799,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and reducing it to a mountain-climbing experience,

161
0:07:17.104,000 --> 0:07:18,000
one that is --

162
0:07:18.595,000 --> 0:07:21,000
from impossible situation to one that is much more doable

163
0:07:22.25,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and challenging.

164
0:07:25.048,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Resolving a racially stressful encounter involves

165
0:07:28.316,000 --> 0:07:3,000
being able to make a healthy decision

166
0:07:30.473,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that is not an underreaction, where I pretend, "That didn't bother me,"

167
0:07:34.38,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or an overreaction, where I exaggerate the moment.

168
0:07:38.578,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Now, we can teach parents and children how to read, recast and resolve

169
0:07:43.831,000 --> 0:07:47,000
using a mindfulness strategy we call: "Calculate, locate, communicate,

170
0:07:48.826,000 --> 0:07:49,000
breathe and exhale."

171
0:07:50.11,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Stay with me.

172
0:07:51.663,000 --> 0:07:52,000
"Calculate" asks,

173
0:07:53.132,000 --> 0:07:54,000
"What feeling am I having right now,

174
0:07:54.891,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and how intense is it on a scale of one to 10?"

175
0:07:59.331,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"Locate" asks, "Where in my body do I feel it?"

176
0:08:03.209,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And be specific,

177
0:08:05.283,000 --> 0:08:09,000
like the Native American girl at a Chicago fifth-grade school said to me,

178
0:08:10.281,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"I feel angry at a nine because I'm the only Native American.

179
0:08:15.02,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And I can feel it in my stomach,

180
0:08:17.764,000 --> 0:08:19,000
like a bunch of butterflies are fighting with each other,

181
0:08:20.616,000 --> 0:08:23,000
so much so that they fly up into my throat and choke me."

182
0:08:24.545,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The more detailed you can be,

183
0:08:26.046,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the easier it is to reduce that spot.

184
0:08:28.703,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"Communicate" asks,

185
0:08:29.93,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"What self-talk and what images are coming in my mind?"

186
0:08:33.052,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And if you really want help, try breathing in

187
0:08:36.007,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and exhaling slowly.

188
0:08:38.648,000 --> 0:08:41,000
With the help of my many colleagues at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative,

189
0:08:42.406,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we use in-the-moment stress-reduction

190
0:08:44.645,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in several research and therapy projects.

191
0:08:47.881,000 --> 0:08:51,000
One project is where we use basketball to help youth manage their emotions

192
0:08:52.648,000 --> 0:08:54,000
during 60-second eruptions on the court.

193
0:08:56.035,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Another project, with the help of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott,

194
0:09:01.902,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we leverage the cultural style of African-American barbershops,

195
0:09:06.111,000 --> 0:09:09,000
where we train black barbers to be health educators in two areas:

196
0:09:10.475,000 --> 0:09:14,000
one, to safely reduce the sexual risk in their partner relationships;

197
0:09:14.528,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and the other,

198
0:09:15.909,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to stop retaliation violence.

199
0:09:18.636,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The cool part is the barbers use their cultural style

200
0:09:21.525,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to deliver this health education to 18- to 24-year-old men

201
0:09:25.359,000 --> 0:09:26,000
while they're cutting their hair.

202
0:09:27.991,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Another project is where we teach teachers

203
0:09:31.022,000 --> 0:09:35,000
how to read, recast and resolve stressful moments in the classroom.

204
0:09:36.275,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And a final project, in which we teach parents and their children separately

205
0:09:41.717,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to understand their racial traumas

206
0:09:44.067,000 --> 0:09:48,000
before we bring them together to problem-solve daily microaggressions.

207
0:09:49.394,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Now, racially literate conversations with our children can be healing,

208
0:09:53.076,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but it takes practice.

209
0:09:54.986,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I know some of you are saying, "Practice?

210
0:09:57.212,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Practice?

211
0:09:58.402,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We're talking about practice?"

212
0:10:00.365,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Yes, we are talking about practice.

213
0:10:03.126,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I have two sons.

214
0:10:05.703,000 --> 0:10:06,000
My oldest, Bryan, is 26,

215
0:10:07.398,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and my youngest, Julian, is 12.

216
0:10:10.069,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And we do not have time to talk about how that happened.

217
0:10:12.842,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

218
0:10:14.58,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But,

219
0:10:16.445,000 --> 0:10:17,000
when I think of them,

220
0:10:17.879,000 --> 0:10:18,000
they are still babies to me,

221
0:10:19.238,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and I worry every day that the world will misjudge them.

222
0:10:23.887,000 --> 0:10:25,000
In August of 2013,

223
0:10:26.966,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Julian, who was eight at the time, and I were folding laundry,

224
0:10:29.949,000 --> 0:10:31,000
which in and of itself is such a rare occurrence,

225
0:10:32.318,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I should have known something strange was going to happen.

226
0:10:35.568,000 --> 0:10:37,000
On the TV were Trayvon Martin's parents,

227
0:10:37.814,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and they were crying

228
0:10:40.027,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because of the acquittal of George Zimmerman.

229
0:10:42.296,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And Julian was glued to the TV.

230
0:10:46.281,000 --> 0:10:48,000
He had a thousand questions, and I was not prepared.

231
0:10:49.13,000 --> 0:10:5,000
He wanted to know why:

232
0:10:50.471,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Why would a grown man stalk and hunt down and kill

233
0:10:55.773,000 --> 0:10:56,000
an unarmed 17-year-old boy?

234
0:10:58.583,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And I did not know what to say.

235
0:11:00.171,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The best thing that could come out of my mouth was,

236
0:11:02.637,000 --> 0:11:04,000
"Julian, sometimes in this world, there are people

237
0:11:05.638,000 --> 0:11:07,000
who look down on black and brown people

238
0:11:08.985,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and do not treat them -- and children, too --

239
0:11:11.208,000 --> 0:11:12,000
do not treat them as human."

240
0:11:13.506,000 --> 0:11:15,000
He interpreted the whole situation as sad.

241
0:11:16.981,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Voice-over) Julian Stevenson: That's sad.

242
0:11:19.014,000 --> 0:11:2,000
"We don't care. You're not our kind."

243
0:11:20.845,000 --> 0:11:21,000
HS: Yes.

244
0:11:22.02,000 --> 0:11:25,000
JS: It's like, "We're better than you."

245
0:11:25.405,000 --> 0:11:26,000
HS: Yes.

246
0:11:26.58,000 --> 0:11:29,000
JS: "And there's nothing you can do about that.

247
0:11:29.915,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And if you scare me, or something like that,

248
0:11:32.395,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I will shoot you because I'm scared of you."

249
0:11:35.049,000 --> 0:11:36,000
HS: Exactly.

250
0:11:36.775,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But if somebody's stalking you --

251
0:11:38.682,000 --> 0:11:39,000
JS: It's not the same for everyone else.

252
0:11:40.684,000 --> 0:11:42,000
HS: It's not always the same, no. You've got to be careful.

253
0:11:43.595,000 --> 0:11:45,000
JS: Yeah, because people can disrespect you.

254
0:11:45.683,000 --> 0:11:46,000
HS: Exactly.

255
0:11:46.885,000 --> 0:11:47,000
JS: And think that you're,

256
0:11:50.851,000 --> 0:11:54,000
"You don't look -- you don't look like you're ..."

257
0:11:55.611,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It's like they're saying that "You don't look right,

258
0:12:00.28,000 --> 0:12:02,000
so I guess I have the right to disrespect you."

259
0:12:02.737,000 --> 0:12:03,000
HS: Yeah, and that's what we call,

260
0:12:04.972,000 --> 0:12:05,000
we call that racism.

261
0:12:06.705,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And we call that racism, Julian,

262
0:12:08.544,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and yes, some people -- other people -- can wear a hoodie,

263
0:12:12.306,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and nothing happens to them.

264
0:12:13.712,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But you and Trayvon might,

265
0:12:16.747,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and that's why Daddy wants you to be safe.

266
0:12:20.38,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Voice-over) HS: And that's why --

267
0:12:22.036,000 --> 0:12:24,000
JS: So you mean like, when you said "other people,"

268
0:12:24.621,000 --> 0:12:26,000
you mean, like if Trayvon was a white,

269
0:12:28.362,000 --> 0:12:3,000
um, that he wouldn't be disrespected like that?

270
0:12:32.087,000 --> 0:12:34,000
HS: Yes, Julian, Daddy meant white people

271
0:12:34.111,000 --> 0:12:35,000
when I said, "other people," all right?

272
0:12:36.527,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So there was a way in which I was so awkward in the beginning,

273
0:12:39.489,000 --> 0:12:41,000
but once I started getting my rhythm and my groove,

274
0:12:41.945,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I started talking about stereotypes and issues of discrimination,

275
0:12:46.569,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and just when I was getting my groove on,

276
0:12:49.036,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Julian interrupted me.

277
0:12:51.688,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Voice-over) HS: ... dangerous, or you're a criminal because you're black,

278
0:12:55.231,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and you're a child or a boy --

279
0:12:56.705,000 --> 0:12:58,000
That is wrong, it doesn't matter who does it.

280
0:12:58.887,000 --> 0:12:59,000
JS: Dad, I need to stop you there.

281
0:13:00.555,000 --> 0:13:01,000
HS: What?

282
0:13:01.733,000 --> 0:13:02,000
JS: Remember when we were ...

283
0:13:03.561,000 --> 0:13:05,000
HS: So he interrupts me to tell me a story

284
0:13:05.696,000 --> 0:13:08,000
about when he was racially threatened at a swimming pool with a friend

285
0:13:09.366,000 --> 0:13:1,000
by two grown white men,

286
0:13:11.035,000 --> 0:13:12,000
which his mother confirmed.

287
0:13:12.908,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And I felt happy that he was able to talk about it;

288
0:13:15.781,000 --> 0:13:16,000
it felt like he was getting it.

289
0:13:17.412,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We moved from the sadness of Trayvon's parents

290
0:13:19.777,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and started talking about George Zimmerman's parents,

291
0:13:22.551,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which, I read in a magazine,

292
0:13:24.575,000 --> 0:13:26,000
condoned the stalking of Trayvon.

293
0:13:26.847,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And Julian's reaction to me was priceless.

294
0:13:29.57,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It made me feel like he was getting it.

295
0:13:32.079,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Voice-over) JS: What did they say about him?

296
0:13:34.251,000 --> 0:13:37,000
HS: Well, I think they basically felt that he was justified

297
0:13:37.509,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to follow and stalk --

298
0:13:39.911,000 --> 0:13:4,000
JS: What the -- ?

299
0:13:41.106,000 --> 0:13:42,000
HS: Yeah, I think that's wrong.

300
0:13:43.049,000 --> 0:13:44,000
JS: That's -- one minute.

301
0:13:44.488,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So they're saying he has the right to follow a black kid,

302
0:13:48.48,000 --> 0:13:49,000
get in a fight with him and shoot him?

303
0:13:51.789,000 --> 0:13:52,000
HS: As Julian was getting it,

304
0:13:53.402,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I started to lose it.

305
0:13:55.47,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Because in my mind's eye, I was thinking:

306
0:13:57.487,000 --> 0:13:59,000
What if my Julian or Bryan was Trayvon?

307
0:14:01.478,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I calculated my anger at a 10.

308
0:14:03.986,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I found, located, my right leg was shaking uncontrollably

309
0:14:07.292,000 --> 0:14:08,000
like I was running.

310
0:14:09.022,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And in my mind's eye, I could see somebody chasing Julian,

311
0:14:12.028,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and I was chasing them.

312
0:14:14.528,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And the only thing that could come out of my mouth

313
0:14:16.934,000 --> 0:14:19,000
was if anybody tries to bother my child ...

314
0:14:21.688,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Voice-over) HS: If anybody tries to bother my child ...

315
0:14:24.828,000 --> 0:14:25,000
mmm, mmm, mmm.

316
0:14:26.019,000 --> 0:14:27,000
JS: What will happen?

317
0:14:27.439,000 --> 0:14:28,000
HS: Well, they better run.

318
0:14:30.436,000 --> 0:14:32,000
JS: Because what? HS: I'm gonna get 'em.

319
0:14:32.677,000 --> 0:14:33,000
JS: See? (Laughs)

320
0:14:33.852,000 --> 0:14:34,000
HS: I'm gonna get 'em. JS: Really?

321
0:14:35.677,000 --> 0:14:36,000
HS: Oh, yeah.

322
0:14:36.859,000 --> 0:14:39,000
JS: Then they're gonna get you because they might have weapons.

323
0:14:39.94,000 --> 0:14:42,000
HS: Well, you know what, I'm gonna call police, too, like I should.

324
0:14:43.112,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But I feel like I wanna get 'em.

325
0:14:44.717,000 --> 0:14:47,000
But you can't; you're right, you can't just go chasing people.

326
0:14:47.746,000 --> 0:14:48,000
JS: They can be armed.

327
0:14:48.94,000 --> 0:14:49,000
HS: Yeah, you right. Yeah, you right.

328
0:14:50.873,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I feel like I wanna chase 'em.

329
0:14:52.352,000 --> 0:14:54,000
JS: Plus they could be an army or something.

330
0:14:54.461,000 --> 0:14:57,000
HS: I know -- I feel like I wanna go get 'em, messing with my son.

331
0:14:57.655,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I don't like that.

332
0:14:59.178,000 --> 0:15:,000
JS: Um ...

333
0:15:00.353,000 --> 0:15:02,000
HS: But you right. You gotta be careful.

334
0:15:03.07,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And um, you gotta be careful.

335
0:15:06.247,000 --> 0:15:09,000
You never know what some crazy people will think about you.

336
0:15:10.756,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Just as long as you believe you're beautiful

337
0:15:12.924,000 --> 0:15:14,000
like Daddy believes you're beautiful and handsome,

338
0:15:15.79,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and Mommy believes you're beautiful and handsome and smart.

339
0:15:20.202,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And you deserve to be on this planet,

340
0:15:23.206,000 --> 0:15:26,000
just as happy and beautiful and smart as you want to be.

341
0:15:27.18,000 --> 0:15:28,000
You can do anything you want, baby.

342
0:15:31.056,000 --> 0:15:35,000
HS: Racial socialization is not just what parents teach their children.

343
0:15:35.541,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It's also how children respond to what their parents teach.

344
0:15:40.277,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Is my child prepared?

345
0:15:43.097,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Can they recognize when a racial elephant shows up in a room?

346
0:15:47.288,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Can they reduce their tsunami interpretation

347
0:15:50.58,000 --> 0:15:52,000
down to a mountain-climbing adventure

348
0:15:52.775,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that they can engage and not run away?

349
0:15:55.568,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Can they make a healthy and just decision in 60 seconds?

350
0:16:00.511,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Can I?

351
0:16:02.103,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Can you?

352
0:16:03.66,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Yes, we can.

353
0:16:05.955,000 --> 0:16:08,000
We can build healthier relationships around race

354
0:16:09.541,000 --> 0:16:13,000
if we learn to calculate, locate communicate, breathe and exhale

355
0:16:13.955,000 --> 0:16:16,000
in the middle of our most threatening moments,

356
0:16:17.85,000 --> 0:16:19,000
when we come face-to-face with our lesser selves.

357
0:16:22.898,000 --> 0:16:24,000
If you take the centuries of racial rage

358
0:16:25.25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that boils up in all of our bodies, minds and souls --

359
0:16:29.851,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and anything that affects our bodies, minds and souls affects our health --

360
0:16:34.658,000 --> 0:16:37,000
we could probably use gun control for our hearts.

361
0:16:38.667,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I just want what all parents want for their children

362
0:16:41.731,000 --> 0:16:42,000
when we're not around:

363
0:16:43.081,000 --> 0:16:44,000
affection and protection.

364
0:16:46.244,000 --> 0:16:48,000
When police and teachers see my children,

365
0:16:48.815,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I want them to imagine their own,

366
0:16:51.404,000 --> 0:16:54,000
because I believe if you see our children as your children,

367
0:16:55.703,000 --> 0:16:56,000
you won't shoot them.

368
0:16:58.388,000 --> 0:17:,000
With racial literacy, and yes, practice,

369
0:17:00.941,000 --> 0:17:04,000
we can decode the racial trauma from our stories,

370
0:17:05.097,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and our healing will come in the telling.

371
0:17:07.53,000 --> 0:17:1,000
But we must never forget

372
0:17:11.848,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that our cultural differences are full of affection and protection,

373
0:17:16.018,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and remember always that the lion's story will never be known

374
0:17:19.964,000 --> 0:17:21,000
as long as the hunter is the one to tell it.

375
0:17:22.947,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Thank you very much.

376
0:17:24.171,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Applause)

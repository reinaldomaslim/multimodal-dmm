1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The stories we tell about each other

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
matter very much.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And most of all,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I think the way that we participate in each other's stories

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is of deep importance.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I was six years old

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
when I first heard stories about the poor.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I heard them from my Sunday school teacher

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I remember learning that people who were poor

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
needed something material --

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I also was taught, coupled with that,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
it was our job, apparently, to help.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is what Jesus asked of us.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now I was pretty psyched.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I was very eager to be useful in the world --

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I think we all have that feeling.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That was news to me,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But I also learned very soon thereafter

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the poor would always be with us.

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This frustrated and confused me;

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that I had to do, and I was excited to do,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but no matter what I would do, I would fail.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I felt overwhelmed.

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And for the first time,

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I began to fear this group of people

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that were never going away, that would always be with us.

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
which I was excited to do,

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
but I didn't know how it was going to work.

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
especially if the problem was never going away.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
In the years following,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the other stories I heard about the poor growing up

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
were no more positive.

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
For example, I saw pictures and images

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
frequently of sadness and suffering.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I heard about disease, I heard about war --

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
they always seemed to be kind of related.

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And in general,

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I got this sort of idea

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that the poor in the world lived lives

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that were wrought with suffering and sadness,

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
devastation, hopelessness.

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is this predictable response,

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And so naturally,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I started to distance myself.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I stopped listening to their stories

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
quite as closely as I had before.

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And I stopped expecting things to really change.

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I gave of my time and my money,

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I gave when solutions were on sale.

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I mean who can argue with that?

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that I gave to relieve my own suffering,

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
not someone else's.

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
not out of a genuine place of hope

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and excitement to help and of generosity.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It became a transaction for me,

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
became sort of a trade.

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I was purchasing something --

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I was buying my right to go on with my day

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And I think the way that we go through that sometimes

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
can, first of all,

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And it can also turn into a commodity,

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which is a very scary thing.

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we kind of buy our distance,

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It can get in the way of our desire

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and, in short to love.

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.

101
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but to give the shorthand version

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
for any who have not heard him speak,

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for his work pioneering modern microfinance.

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
think of that as financial services for the poor.

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Think of all the things you get at your bank

110
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and imagine those products and services

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Dr. Yunus shared his story,

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
explaining what that was,

114
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.

115
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
He also talked about, in particular, microlending,

116
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which is a tiny loan

117
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that could help someone start or grow a business.

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.

119
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world

120
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that, for once, showed me, maybe,

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a way to interact with someone

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and didn't make me feel bad --

124
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that was exciting.

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But more importantly, he told stories about the poor

126
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that were different than any stories I had heard before.

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
He was talking about strong, smart,

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day

130
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
was a little bit of capital.

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It was an amazing sort of insight for me.

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it's hard to express now how much that affected me --

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I moved to East Africa

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to try to see for myself what this was about.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
For the first time, actually, in a long time

140
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,

141
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and see for myself what their lives were actually about.

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to start or grow a business.

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And in fact, through those interactions,

146
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends

147
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that was supposed to be far away.

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And over and over again,

151
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,

152
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I did hear stories of life change

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and amazing little details of change.

154
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So I would hear from goat herders

155
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.

156
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Their business trajectory would change.

157
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
They would make a little bit more money;

158
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
their standard of living

159
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
would shift and would get better.

160
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,

161
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
like they would start to send their children to school.

162
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They might be able to buy mosquito nets.

163
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.

164
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea

165
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and offer that to me when I came as their guest

166
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and that made them feel proud.

167
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,

168
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and some days that's what happened --

169
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
these beautiful details of life change

170
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
that were meaningful to them.

171
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That was another thing that really touched me.

172
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It was really humbling to see for the first time,

173
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to really understand

174
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,

175
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.

176
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Because the best way for people to change their lives

177
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.

178
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So I saw that and it was very humbling.

179
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I never once was asked for a donation,

181
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which had kind of been my mode, right.

182
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
There's poverty, you give money to help --

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
no one asked me for a donation.

184
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.

185
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and to build on their own capabilities.

187
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So what I did hear, once in a while,

188
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
was that people wanted a loan --

189
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.

190
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,

191
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.

192
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I just got this impression that the money would work.

193
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And my introduction to business

194
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
was in these $100 little infuses of capital.

195
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,

196
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.

197
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So this idea

198
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that these new stories of business and hope

199
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
might be shared with my friends and family,

200
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to be able to continue their businesses as loans,

202
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
A few months later, I went back to Uganda

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
with a digital camera and a basic website

205
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,

206
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and took pictures of seven of my new friends,

207
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,

208
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.

209
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,

211
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
provide the money that they need?"

212
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The money came in basically overnight.

213
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We sent it over to Uganda.

214
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;

215
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the entrepreneurs received the money,

216
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,

217
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and they were able to support themselves

218
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and change the trajectory of their lives.

219
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In October of '05,

220
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
after those first seven loans were paid,

221
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.

222
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.

223
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Let's start for real." That was our official launch.

224
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And then that first year, October '05 through '06,

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.

226
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The second year, it was a total of 15 million.

227
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The third year, the total was up to around 40.

228
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The fourth year, we were just short of 100.

229
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And today, less than five years in,

230
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Kiva's facilitated

231
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,

232
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
from lenders and entrepreneurs --

233
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.

234
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.

235
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And while those numbers and those statistics

236
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,

237
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to me, Kiva's really about stories.

238
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's about retelling

239
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the story of the poor,

240
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and it's about giving ourselves

241
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
an opportunity to engage

242
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that validates their dignity,

243
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
validates a partnership relationship,

244
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
not a relationship that's based

245
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary

246
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
weirdness that can happen.

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But instead a relationship that can promote respect

248
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and hope

249
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and this optimism

250
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that together we can move forward.

251
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So what I hope is that,

252
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --

253
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that's a very positive and meaningful thing --

254
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,

255
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
between the traditional rich and poor categories

256
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that we're taught to see in the world,

257
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.

258
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.

259
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Because as that happens,

260
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I think we can feel free to interact

261
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in a way that's more open, more just and more creative,

262
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to engage with each other and to help each other.

263
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Imagine how you feel

264
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
when you see somebody on street who is begging

265
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and you're about to approach them.

266
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Imagine how you feel;

267
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody

268
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work

269
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
who wants to tell you about their business.

270
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.

271
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Imagine if you're speaking with somebody

272
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
who's growing things and making them flourish,

273
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
somebody who's using their talents

274
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to do something productive,

275
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
somebody who's built their own business from scratch,

276
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
someone who is surrounded by abundance,

277
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
not scarcity,

278
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
who's in fact creating abundance,

279
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
somebody with full hands with something to offer,

280
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
not empty hands

281
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
asking for you to give them something.

282
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect

283
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
of somebody who wakes up every day

284
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and works very, very hard to make their life better.

285
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.

286
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And if we can catalyze

287
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
a supportive community to come around these individuals

288
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and to participate in their story

289
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
by lending a little bit of money,

290
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I think that can change the way we believe in each other

291
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and each other's potential.

292
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.

293
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And as I look forward to what is next,

294
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.

295
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.

296
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,

297
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
have taught me what entrepreneurship is.

298
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.

299
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
You see an opportunity

300
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.

301
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today

302
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and going after that.

303
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.

304
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So they're not a donation.

305
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.

306
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But in fact, when you give something to someone

307
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,

308
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that's one thing.

309
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,

310
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.

311
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --

312
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
is a really big deal

313
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to build different kinds of relationships among us.

314
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,

315
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
when all else is equal,

316
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,

317
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
or money plus the support and encouragement

318
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of a global community,

319
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
people choose the community plus the money.

320
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.

321
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So with that in mind, this particular incident

322
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
has led to the things that I'm working on now.

323
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.

324
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And one thing that I've seen

325
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.

326
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
With social networks,

327
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us

328
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
in our own supportive communities, rapidly.

329
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And so, as I have been thinking about this,

330
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities

331
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas

332
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and to catalyze all of us

333
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to make tomorrow better than today?

334
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
As I've researched what's going on in the United States,

335
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
a few interesting little insights have come up.

336
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,

337
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world

338
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do

339
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
or they might need money during a hard month.

340
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But there's always a need for resources close by.

341
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Another thing is, it turns out,

342
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --

343
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
banks, venture capitalists,

344
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
other organizations and support structures --

345
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
they come from friends and family.

346
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses

347
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
comes from friends and family.

348
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
That's around 130 billion dollars a year --

349
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
it's a lot.

350
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,

351
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,

352
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
how to ask, what to promise in return,

353
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
even though they have the best of intentions

354
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and want to thank those people that are supporting them.

355
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way

356
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves

357
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
exactly what that financial exchange should look like,

358
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
exactly what fits them and the people around them,

359
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
this week actually,

360
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,

361
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need

362
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
through investments from their friends and family.

363
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And it's investments, not donations, not loans,

364
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
but investments that have a dynamic return.

365
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So the mapping of participating in the story,

366
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
it actually flows with the up and down.

367
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool

368
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
for small businesses to raise these funds.

369
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,

370
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
create investment terms in a really easy way.

371
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We make it really, really simple for me

372
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.

373
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.

374
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
They can raise up to a million dollars

375
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --

376
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
everyday people, heaven forbid --

377
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and they can share those returns over time --

378
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
again, whatever terms they set.

379
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
As investors choose to become involved

380
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
based on those terms,

381
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
they can either take their rewards back as cash,

382
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
or they can decide in advance

383
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to give those returns away to a non-profit.

384
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.

385
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea

386
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
a path to go do what they want to do in the world

387
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and to gather the people around them that they already have,

388
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
the people that know them best

389
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and that love them and want to support them,

390
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to gather them to make this happen.

391
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So that's what I'm working on now.

392
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.

393
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,

394
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.

395
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,

396
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
just like they've cared enough to use Kiva

397
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
to make those connections.

398
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --

399
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
I'm not even going to try.

400
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I don't think, even though we often hear,

401
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,

402
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
the religious reasons,

403
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."

404
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;

405
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
in fact, I think we know so much,

406
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and it's such a reality

407
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that we care so deeply,

408
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
that in fact, what usually stops us

409
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
is that we're afraid to try and to mess up,

410
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
because we care so very much about helping each other

411
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and being meaningful in each other's lives.

412
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So what I think I can do today,

413
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that best thing I can give you --

414
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.

415
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And I think I can remind us that we do care.

416
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I think we all already know that.

417
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And I think we know that love is resilient enough

418
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
for us to get out there and try.

419
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Just a sec.

420
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Applause)

421
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Thanks.

422
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
(Applause)

423
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Thanks.

424
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Applause)

425
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
For me, the best way to be inspired to try

426
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
is to stop and to listen

427
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
to someone else's story.

428
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.

429
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,

430
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
guaranteed, I am inspired --

431
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I am inspired by the person I am listening to.

432
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And I believe more and more every time I listen

433
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
in that that person's potential to do great things in the world

434
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and in my own potential to maybe help.

435
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And that --

436
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --

437
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that stuff's easy.

438
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Believing in each other,

439
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
really being sure when push comes to shove

440
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
that each one of us can do amazing things in the world,

441
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
that is what can make our stories into love stories

442
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and our collective story

443
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
into one that continually perpetuates hope

444
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and good things for all of us.

445
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
So that, this belief in each other,

446
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
knowing that without a doubt

447
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and practicing that every day in whatever you do,

448
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.

449
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Thank you.

450
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm a creative technologist

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and the focus of my work is on public installations.

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
One of my driving passions

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is this idea of exploring nature,

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and trying to find hidden data within nature.

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It seems to me that there is

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
this latent potential everywhere, all around us.

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Everything gives out some kind of data,

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
whether it's sound or smell or vibration.

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Through my work, I've been

11
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
trying to find ways to harness and unveil this.

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And so this basically led me to

13
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a subject called cymatics.

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water,

16
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
as you can see there.

17
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So, if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics

18
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
beginning with the observations of resonance,

19
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook

20
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and then Ernest Chladni.

21
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
He created an experiment using a metal plate,

22
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
covering it with sand and then bowing it

23
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right.

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Moving on from this, the next person to explore this field

25
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s.

26
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
He actually coined the term cymatics.

27
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Then bringing us into the present day

28
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is a fellow collaborator of mine

29
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed.

30
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
He's kindly recreated for us

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the Chladni experiment.

32
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What we can see here is

33
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver

34
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and being fed by a frequency generator.

35
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
As the frequencies increase,

36
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate.

37
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
As you can see with your own eyes.

38
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Applause)

39
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So, what excites me about cymatics?

40
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.

41
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world.

42
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics,

43
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen.

44
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here,

45
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns.

46
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day.

47
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
For example, in oceanography,

48
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created

49
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit.

50
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding

51
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of how they communicate.

52
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We can also use cymatics for healing and education.

53
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This is an installation developed with school children,

54
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where their hands are tracked. It allows them

55
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to control and position cymatic patterns

56
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the reflections that are caused by them.

57
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form.

58
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This image here is created from a snippet

59
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device.

60
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit.

61
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
This is Pink Floyd's "Machine"

62
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
playing in real time through the cymascope.

63
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature.

64
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature.

65
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature.

66
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.

67
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish.

68
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And there is thousands of these.

69
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So what does this all mean?

70
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Well, there is still a lot to explore

71
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field.

72
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But consider for a moment that sound does have form.

73
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter.

74
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming.

75
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
And think about the immense sound of the universe forming.

76
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps

77
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself.

78
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And here is some eye candy for you, from a range of

79
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
DIY scientists and artists

80
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
from all over the globe.

81
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Cymatics is accessible to everybody.

82
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I want to urge everybody here to

83
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
apply your passion, your knowledge

84
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and your skills to areas like cymatics.

85
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I think collectively we can build a global community.

86
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We can inspire each other.

87
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And we can evolve this exploration

88
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of the substance of things not seen. Thank you.

89
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Applause)

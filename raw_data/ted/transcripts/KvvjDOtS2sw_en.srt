1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm a writer and a journalist,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I'm also an insanely curious person,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so in 22 years as a journalist,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I've learned how to do a lot of new things.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
was to become invisible.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I became one of the working homeless.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I quit my job as a newspaper editor

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
after my father died in February of that same year,

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and decided to travel.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
His death hit me pretty hard.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I've camped my whole life. And I decided

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that living in a van for a year to do this

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
would be like one long camping trip.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and drove off into the sunset,

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
having fully failed to realize three critical things.

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
One: that society equates

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
living in a permanent structure, even a shack,

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
with having value as a person.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Two: I failed to realize how quickly

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the negative perceptions of other people

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
can impact our reality, if we let it.

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Three: I failed to realize

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that homelessness is an attitude,

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
not a lifestyle.

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
At first, living in the van was great.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I had time to relax and to grieve.

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job

34
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to pay the bills.

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What had been a really mild spring

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
turned into a miserably hot summer.

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And it became impossible to park anywhere --

38
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughs)

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
-- without being very obvious

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The cat came and went through an open window in the van.

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The doggy went into doggy day care.

43
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I sweated.

44
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Whenever I could, I used

45
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Or I washed up in public rest rooms.

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
making it difficult or impossible to sleep.

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Food rotted in the heat.

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours,

51
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and it was pretty miserable.

52
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I couldn't afford to find an apartment,

53
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me

54
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to have the Rottweiler and the cat.

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And I refused to give them up,

56
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
so I stayed in the van.

57
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And when the heat made me too sick

58
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom

59
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
outside my van at night,

60
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.

61
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped

62
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
below freezing. And they stayed there.

63
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I faced a whole new set of challenges.

64
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I parked a different place every night

65
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.

66
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I didn't always succeed.

67
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But I felt out of control of my life.

68
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I don't know when or how it happened,

69
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but the speed at which I went

70
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
from being a talented writer and journalist

71
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to being a homeless woman, living in a van,

72
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
took my breath away.

73
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.

74
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
My talent, my integrity, my values,

75
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
everything about me remained the same.

76
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But I had changed somehow.

77
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.

78
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.

79
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.

80
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.

81
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I just wasn't drunk or high.

82
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And when several of the homeless men realized that,

83
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
including a former university professor,

84
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"

85
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless,

86
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but I did.

87
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Then the professor listened to my story and he said,

88
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"You have a job. You have hope.

89
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The real homeless don't have hope."

90
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression

91
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
left me suicidal. And I remember thinking,

92
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"If I killed myself, no one would notice."

93
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
A friend told me, shortly after that,

94
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that she had heard that Tim Russert,

95
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a nationally renowned journalist,

96
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
had been talking about me on national T.V.

97
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
An essay I'd written about my father,

98
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.

99
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.

100
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,"

101
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
was talking about my writing,

102
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,

103
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I started laughing.

104
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
You should too.

105
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I started laughing

107
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because it got to the point where,

108
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?

109
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.

110
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I stood there. And I reread my essay.

111
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And I cried.

112
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Because I was a writer.

113
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I was a writer.

114
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.

115
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.

116
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I started writing again.

117
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.

118
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.

119
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I was no longer homeless.

120
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And I was no longer invisible.

121
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs,

122
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and live in their cars.

123
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize

124
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
living in your vehicle or on the streets.

125
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.

126
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But if you ever meet one,

127
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.

128
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.

129
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.

130
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.

131
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,

132
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
people are not where they live,

133
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
where they sleep,

134
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
or what their life situation is at any given time.

135
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Three years ago I was living in a van

136
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in a Wal-Mart parking lot,

137
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and today I'm speaking at TED.

138
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.

139
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Applause)

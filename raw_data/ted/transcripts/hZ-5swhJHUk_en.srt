1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Music)

2
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
[Sanskrit]

3
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This is an ode to the mother goddess,

4
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that most of us in India learn when we are children.

5
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I learned it when I was four

6
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
at my mother's knee.

7
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
That year she introduced me to dance,

8
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and thus began

9
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
my tryst with classical dance.

10
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Since then -- it's been four decades now --

11
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I've trained with the best in the field,

12
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
performed across the globe,

13
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
taught young and old alike,

14
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
created, collaborated,

15
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
choreographed,

16
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and wove a rich tapestry

17
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of artistry, achievement and awards.

18
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The crowning glory was in 2007,

19
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when I received this country's

20
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri,

21
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
for my contribution to art.

22
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Applause)

23
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But nothing, nothing prepared me

24
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for what I was to hear

25
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
on the first of July 2008.

26
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I heard the word "carcinoma."

27
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Yes, breast cancer.

28
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office,

29
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I heard other words:

30
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"cancer," "stage," "grade."

31
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac

32
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
sign of my friend,

33
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
stage was what I performed on,

34
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and grades were what I got in school.

35
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
That day, I realized

36
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I had an unwelcome, uninvited,

37
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
new life partner.

38
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
As a dancer,

39
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I know the nine rasas or the navarasas:

40
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
anger, valor,

41
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
disgust, humor

42
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and fear.

43
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I thought I knew what fear was.

44
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
That day, I learned what fear was.

45
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Overcome with the enormity of it all

46
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and the complete feeling of loss of control,

47
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I shed copious tears

48
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and asked my dear husband, Jayant.

49
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?

50
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Is this the end of my dance?"

51
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And he, the positive soul that he is,

52
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
said, "No, this is just a hiatus,

53
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a hiatus during the treatment,

54
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and you'll get back to doing what you do best."

55
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I realized then

56
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that I, who thought I had complete control of my life,

57
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
had control of only three things:

58
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
My thought, my mind --

59
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the images that these thoughts created --

60
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and the action that derived from it.

61
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So here I was wallowing

62
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in a vortex of emotions

63
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and depression and what have you,

64
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
with the enormity of the situation,

65
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.

66
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I wanted to go from where I was

67
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to where I wanted to be,

68
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
for which I needed something.

69
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.

70
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So I dried my tears,

71
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and I declared to the world at large ...

72
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life,

73
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."

74
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I also declared to the world at large

75
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that I would ride it out,

76
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and I would not allow cancer to ride me.

77
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But to go from where I was

78
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to where I wanted to be,

79
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I needed something.

80
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I needed an anchor, an image,

81
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
a peg

82
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to peg this process on,

83
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
so that I could go from there.

84
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I found that in my dance,

85
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion,

86
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
my very life breath.

87
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But it wasn't easy.

88
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.

89
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
How do you keep cheer

90
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
when you go from beautiful

91
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to bald in three days?

92
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
How do you not despair

93
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy,

94
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture,

95
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?

96
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
How do you not get overwhelmed

97
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
by the despair and the misery of it all?

98
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.

99
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But I kept telling myself fear and tears

100
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
are options I did not have.

101
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So I would drag myself into my dance studio --

102
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio,

103
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and learn everything I learned

104
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
when I was four, all over again,

105
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
reworked, relearned, regrouped.

106
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.

107
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Difficult.

108
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I focused on my mudras,

109
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
on the imagery of my dance,

110
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
on the poetry and the metaphor

111
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the philosophy of the dance itself.

112
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And slowly, I moved out

113
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of that miserable state of mind.

114
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But I needed something else.

115
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I needed something to go that extra mile,

116
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and I found it in that metaphor

117
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which I had learned from my mother when I was four.

118
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini,

119
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of Durga.

120
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one,

121
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.

122
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful,

123
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
her 18 arms

124
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
ready for warfare,

125
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
as she rode astride her lion

126
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.

127
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Durga, the epitome

128
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of creative feminine energy,

129
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
or shakti.

130
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Durga, the fearless one.

131
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I made that image of Durga

132
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and her every attribute, her every nuance,

133
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
my very own.

134
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Powered by the symbology of a myth

135
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and the passion of my training,

136
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance,

137
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
laser-sharp focus to such an extent

138
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that I danced a few weeks after surgery.

139
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles,

140
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
much to the dismay of my oncologist.

141
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles

142
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and badgered him to fit it

143
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to my performing dance schedule.

144
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
What I had done

145
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is I had tuned out of cancer

146
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and tuned into my dance.

147
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.

148
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
My story

149
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is a story of overcoming setbacks,

150
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
obstacles and challenges

151
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that life throws at you.

152
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
My story is the power of thought.

153
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
My story is the power of choice.

154
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's the power of focus.

155
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's the power of bringing ourselves

156
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
to the attention of something that so animates you,

157
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so moves you,

158
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.

159
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
My story is the power of a metaphor.

160
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's the power of an image.

161
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Mine was that of Durga,

162
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Durga the fearless one.

163
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
She was also called Simhanandini,

164
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the one who rode the lion.

165
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
As I ride out,

166
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
as I ride my own inner strength,

167
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
my own inner resilience,

168
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
armed as I am with what medication can provide

169
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and continue treatment,

170
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer,

171
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
asking my rogue cells to behave,

172
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I want to be known not as a cancer survivor,

173
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but as a cancer conqueror.

174
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I present to you an excerpt of that work

175
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"Simhanandini."

176
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Applause)

177
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Music)

178
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.54,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Every summer, my family and I travel across the world,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
3,000 miles away

3
0:00:19.14,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to the culturally diverse country of India.

4
0:00:22.58,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, India is a country infamous for its scorching heat and humidity.

5
0:00:27.58,000 --> 0:00:31,000
For me, the only relief from this heat is to drink plenty of water.

6
0:00:32.74,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, while in India,

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
my parents always remind me to only drink boiled or bottled water,

8
0:00:39.22,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because unlike here in America,

9
0:00:41.5,000 --> 0:00:45,000
where I can just turn on a tap and easily get clean, potable water,

10
0:00:46.3,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in India, the water is often contaminated.

11
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So my parents have to make sure

12
0:00:51.18,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that the water we drink is safe.

13
0:00:54.3,000 --> 0:00:56,000
However, I soon realized

14
0:00:56.7,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that not everyone is fortunate enough

15
0:00:59.38,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to enjoy the clean water we did.

16
0:01:02.98,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Outside my grandparents' house in the busy streets of India,

17
0:01:07.22,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I saw people standing in long lines

18
0:01:09.9,000 --> 0:01:1,000
under the hot sun

19
0:01:11.62,000 --> 0:01:13,000
filling buckets with water from a tap.

20
0:01:15.18,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I even saw children,

21
0:01:17.18,000 --> 0:01:19,000
who looked the same age as me,

22
0:01:19.86,000 --> 0:01:21,000
filling up these clear plastic bottles

23
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
with dirty water from streams on the roadside.

24
0:01:26.7,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Watching these kids

25
0:01:28.42,000 --> 0:01:3,000
forced to drink water

26
0:01:30.58,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that I felt was too dirty to touch

27
0:01:33.62,000 --> 0:01:35,000
changed my perspective on the world.

28
0:01:36.86,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This unacceptable social injustice

29
0:01:40.42,000 --> 0:01:43,000
compelled me to want to find a solution

30
0:01:43.5,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to our world's clean water problem.

31
0:01:46.66,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I wanted to know why these kids lacked water,

32
0:01:49.94,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a substance that is essential for life.

33
0:01:52.82,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I learned that we are facing

34
0:01:55.1,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a global water crisis.

35
0:01:58.54,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, this may seem surprising,

36
0:02:00.38,000 --> 0:02:04,000
as 75 percent of our planet is covered in water,

37
0:02:04.5,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but only 2.5 percent of that is freshwater,

38
0:02:08.58,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and less than one percent of Earth's freshwater supply

39
0:02:12.54,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is available for human consumption.

40
0:02:15.58,000 --> 0:02:16,000
With rising populations,

41
0:02:17.3,000 --> 0:02:19,000
industrial development and economic growth,

42
0:02:20.299,000 --> 0:02:22,000
our demand for clean water is increasing,

43
0:02:23.1,000 --> 0:02:26,000
yet our freshwater resources are rapidly depleting.

44
0:02:27.66,000 --> 0:02:29,000
According to the World Health Organization,

45
0:02:30.3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
660 million people in our world

46
0:02:34.22,000 --> 0:02:36,000
lack access to a clean water source.

47
0:02:37.78,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Lack of access to clean water is a leading cause of death

48
0:02:41.1,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in children under the age of five in developing countries,

49
0:02:44.14,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children

50
0:02:47.62,000 --> 0:02:49,000
die every day from a water-related disease.

51
0:02:52.1,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So after returning home one summer in eighth grade,

52
0:02:55.5,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I decided that I wanted to combine my passion

53
0:02:58.62,000 --> 0:03:,000
for solving the global water crisis

54
0:03:00.78,000 --> 0:03:02,000
with my interest in science.

55
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So I decided that the best thing to do

56
0:03:05.42,000 --> 0:03:08,000
would be to convert my garage into a laboratory.

57
0:03:10.98,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:12.98,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Actually, at first I converted my kitchen into a laboratory,

59
0:03:16.86,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but my parents didn't really approve and kicked me out.

60
0:03:21.22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I also read a lot of journal papers on water-related research,

61
0:03:25.7,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I learned that currently in developing countries,

62
0:03:28.58,000 --> 0:03:3,000
something called solar disinfection,

63
0:03:31.02,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or SODIS, is used to purify water.

64
0:03:34.82,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In SODIS, clear plastic bottles are filled with contaminated water

65
0:03:39.66,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours.

66
0:03:43.34,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The UV radiation from the sun

67
0:03:45.38,000 --> 0:03:48,000
destroys the DNA of these harmful pathogens

68
0:03:48.86,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and decontaminates the water.

69
0:03:51.7,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now, while SODIS is really easy to use and energy-efficient,

70
0:03:55.46,000 --> 0:03:57,000
as it only uses solar energy,

71
0:03:57.78,000 --> 0:03:58,000
it's really slow,

72
0:03:59.18,000 --> 0:04:01,000
as it can take up to two days when it's cloudy.

73
0:04:02.78,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So in order to make the SODIS process faster,

74
0:04:05.9,000 --> 0:04:08,000
this new method called photocatalysis

75
0:04:09.22,000 --> 0:04:1,000
has recently been used.

76
0:04:11.46,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So what exactly is this photocatalysis?

77
0:04:14.34,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Let's break it down:

78
0:04:15.58,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"photo" means from the sun,

79
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and a catalyst is something that speeds up a reaction.

80
0:04:20.86,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So what photocatalysis is doing

81
0:04:23.06,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is it's just speeding up this solar disinfection process.

82
0:04:27.22,000 --> 0:04:3,000
When sunlight comes in and strikes a photocatalyst,

83
0:04:30.58,000 --> 0:04:33,000
like TiO2, or titanium dioxide,

84
0:04:34.22,000 --> 0:04:37,000
it creates these really reactive oxygen species,

85
0:04:37.66,000 --> 0:04:41,000
like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals.

86
0:04:42.74,000 --> 0:04:43,000
These reactive oxygen species

87
0:04:44.66,000 --> 0:04:46,000
are able to remove bacteria and organics

88
0:04:47.58,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and a whole lot of contaminants from drinking water.

89
0:04:51.74,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But unfortunately, there are several disadvantages

90
0:04:54.98,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to the way photocatalytic SODIS is currently deployed.

91
0:04:59.46,000 --> 0:05:02,000
See, what they do is they take the clear plastic bottles

92
0:05:02.62,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and they coat the inside with this photocatalytic coating.

93
0:05:07.02,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide

94
0:05:10.34,000 --> 0:05:12,000
are actually commonly used in sunscreens

95
0:05:13.06,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to block UV radiation.

96
0:05:15.14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So when they're coated on the inside of these bottles,

97
0:05:18.02,000 --> 0:05:2,000
they're actually blocking some of the UV radiation

98
0:05:20.82,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and diminishing the efficiency of the process.

99
0:05:24.38,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Also, these photocatalytic coatings

100
0:05:26.54,000 --> 0:05:28,000
are not tightly bound to the plastic bottle,

101
0:05:29.42,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which means they wash off, and people end up drinking the catalyst.

102
0:05:34.34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
While TiO2 is safe and inert,

103
0:05:37.02,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it's really inefficient if you keep drinking the catalyst,

104
0:05:39.78,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because then you have to continue to replenish it,

105
0:05:42.18,000 --> 0:05:43,000
even after a few uses.

106
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So my goal was to overcome the disadvantages

107
0:05:47.54,000 --> 0:05:49,000
of these current treatment methods

108
0:05:49.58,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and create a safe, sustainable,

109
0:05:51.86,000 --> 0:05:54,000
cost-effective and eco-friendly method of purifying water.

110
0:05:56.94,000 --> 0:05:59,000
What started off as an eighth grade science fair project

111
0:06:00.02,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is now my photocatalytic composite for water purification.

112
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The composite combines titanium dioxide with cement.

113
0:06:09.66,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The cement-like composite can be formed into several different shapes,

114
0:06:13.66,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which results in an extremely versatile range of deployment methods.

115
0:06:17.98,000 --> 0:06:19,000
For example, you could create a rod

116
0:06:20.06,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use

117
0:06:24.38,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families.

118
0:06:29.62,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You can even coat the inside of an existing water tank

119
0:06:33.06,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to purify larger amounts of water

120
0:06:34.94,000 --> 0:06:36,000
for communities over a longer period of time.

121
0:06:39.46,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now, over the course of this,

122
0:06:41.42,000 --> 0:06:43,000
my journey hasn't really been easy.

123
0:06:43.9,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You know, I didn't have access to a sophisticated laboratory.

124
0:06:47.3,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I was 14 years old when I started,

125
0:06:50.82,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but I didn't let my age deter me

126
0:06:53.18,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in my interest in pursuing scientific research

127
0:06:56.06,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and wanting to solve the global water crisis.

128
0:06:59.62,000 --> 0:07:02,000
See, water isn't just the universal solvent.

129
0:07:03.46,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Water is a universal human right.

130
0:07:06.98,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And for that reason,

131
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I'm continuing to work on this science fair project from 2012

132
0:07:12.46,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to bring it from the laboratory into the real world.

133
0:07:15.66,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And this summer, I founded Catalyst for World Water,

134
0:07:19.14,000 --> 0:07:24,000
a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing solutions to the global water crisis.

135
0:07:25.1,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Applause)

136
0:07:32.06,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Alone, a single drop of water can't do much,

137
0:07:36.06,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but when many drops come together,

138
0:07:38.5,000 --> 0:07:4,000
they can sustain life on our planet.

139
0:07:42.1,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Just as water drops come together to form oceans,

140
0:07:45.46,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I believe that we all must come together

141
0:07:48.02,000 --> 0:07:5,000
when tackling this global problem.

142
0:07:50.9,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Thank you.

143
0:07:52.14,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Applause)

144
0:07:55.66,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Thank you.

145
0:07:57.02,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Applause)

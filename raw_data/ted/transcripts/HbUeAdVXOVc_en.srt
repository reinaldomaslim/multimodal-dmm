1
0:00:16.069,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to talk to you today

2
0:00:17.554,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about the design of medical technology for low-resource settings.

3
0:00:21.061,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I study health systems in these countries.

4
0:00:23.438,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And one of the major gaps in care,

5
0:00:25.377,000 --> 0:00:26,000
almost across the board,

6
0:00:27.06,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is access to safe surgery.

7
0:00:29.251,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now one of the major bottlenecks that we've found

8
0:00:31.934,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that's sort of preventing both the access in the first place,

9
0:00:35.193,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the safety of those surgeries that do happen, is anesthesia.

10
0:00:39.106,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And actually, it's the model that we expect to work

11
0:00:41.522,000 --> 0:00:43,000
for delivering anesthesia in these environments.

12
0:00:44.88,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Here, we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the US,

13
0:00:48.757,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or any other developed country.

14
0:00:50.258,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In the background there

15
0:00:51.469,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine.

16
0:00:54.064,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives

17
0:00:57.937,000 --> 0:01:,000
because it was designed with this environment in mind.

18
0:01:01.589,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In order to operate, this machine needs a number of things

19
0:01:04.545,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that this hospital has to offer.

20
0:01:06.469,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist

21
0:01:09.861,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with years of training with complex machines

22
0:01:12.336,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to help her monitor the flows of the gas

23
0:01:14.781,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and keep her patients safe and anesthetized

24
0:01:17.368,000 --> 0:01:18,000
throughout the surgery.

25
0:01:18.843,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms,

26
0:01:21.634,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running,

27
0:01:24.876,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and it's going to break pretty easily.

28
0:01:26.758,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers

29
0:01:29.694,000 --> 0:01:32,000
who understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts

30
0:01:33.027,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and keep it saving lives.

31
0:01:35.948,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's a pretty expensive machine.

32
0:01:37.506,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it

33
0:01:40.171,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $100,000.

34
0:01:45.556,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And perhaps most obviously,

35
0:01:47.479,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but also most importantly --

36
0:01:49.017,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and the path to concepts that we've heard about

37
0:01:51.877,000 --> 0:01:52,000
kind of illustrates this --

38
0:01:53.187,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity,

39
0:01:58.357,000 --> 0:02:01,000
of compressed oxygen, and other medical supplies

40
0:02:01.393,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that are so critical to the functioning of this machine.

41
0:02:05.695,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In other words, this machine requires a lot of stuff

42
0:02:09.018,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that this hospital cannot offer.

43
0:02:11.592,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi.

44
0:02:15.413,000 --> 0:02:16,000
In this hospital,

45
0:02:16.598,000 --> 0:02:18,000
there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia,

46
0:02:19.293,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and she's qualified

47
0:02:20.469,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because she has 12, maybe 18 months of training in anesthesia.

48
0:02:25.069,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In the hospital and in the entire region

49
0:02:27.34,000 --> 0:02:29,000
there's not a single biomedical engineer.

50
0:02:29.371,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So when this machine breaks,

51
0:02:30.964,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the machines that they have to work with break,

52
0:02:33.197,000 --> 0:02:34,000
they've got to try and figure it out,

53
0:02:34.99,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but most of the time, that's the end of the road.

54
0:02:37.306,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard.

55
0:02:39.547,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned

56
0:02:41.9,000 --> 0:02:43,000
could represent maybe a quarter or a third

57
0:02:43.985,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of the annual operating budget for this hospital.

58
0:02:47.84,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And finally, I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong.

59
0:02:51.248,000 --> 0:02:53,000
This hospital is connected to a very weak power grid,

60
0:02:53.946,000 --> 0:02:54,000
one that goes down frequently.

61
0:02:55.752,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So it runs frequently, the entire hospital,

62
0:02:58.322,000 --> 0:02:59,000
just on a generator.

63
0:02:59.769,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And you can imagine, the generator breaks down

64
0:03:01.949,000 --> 0:03:02,000
or runs out of fuel.

65
0:03:03.621,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And the World Bank sees this

66
0:03:05.672,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country

67
0:03:09.227,000 --> 0:03:12,000
can expect up to 18 power outages per month.

68
0:03:13.918,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Similarly, compressed oxygen and other medical supplies

69
0:03:17.135,000 --> 0:03:18,000
are really a luxury,

70
0:03:18.341,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and can often be out of stock for months or even a year.

71
0:03:21.647,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So it seems crazy, but the model that we have right now

72
0:03:24.835,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is taking those machines that were designed

73
0:03:27.064,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for that first environment that I showed you

74
0:03:29.371,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment.

75
0:03:34.121,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's not just inappropriate,

76
0:03:35.721,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it becomes really unsafe.

77
0:03:38.776,000 --> 0:03:39,000
One of our partners at Johns Hopkins

78
0:03:40.722,000 --> 0:03:44,000
was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago.

79
0:03:45.485,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case.

80
0:03:48.842,000 --> 0:03:5,000
A woman came in, she needed an emergency C-section

81
0:03:51.849,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to save her life and the life of her baby.

82
0:03:55.065,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And everything began pretty auspiciously.

83
0:03:57.043,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.

84
0:03:59.32,000 --> 0:04:,000
The nurse was there.

85
0:04:00.632,000 --> 0:04:02,000
She was able to anesthetize her quickly, and it was important

86
0:04:03.517,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because of the emergency nature of the situation.

87
0:04:05.877,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And everything began well

88
0:04:07.618,000 --> 0:04:09,000
until the power went out.

89
0:04:11.033,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And now in the middle of this surgery,

90
0:04:12.881,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case,

91
0:04:15.974,000 --> 0:04:17,000
which he can do -- he's got a headlamp.

92
0:04:18.35,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater

93
0:04:22.435,000 --> 0:04:24,000
trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient,

94
0:04:25.414,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to keep her patient asleep.

95
0:04:27.127,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Because her machine doesn't work when there's no power.

96
0:04:30.697,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced,

97
0:04:33.775,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and others are probably the product of, has now become a tragedy.

98
0:04:38.915,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event;

99
0:04:41.675,000 --> 0:04:43,000
this happens across the developing world.

100
0:04:44.198,000 --> 0:04:46,000
35 million surgeries are attempted every year

101
0:04:47.175,000 --> 0:04:48,000
without safe anesthesia.

102
0:04:49.47,000 --> 0:04:51,000
My colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton, was living this reality.

103
0:04:52.406,000 --> 0:04:53,000
He was the chief of anesthesiology

104
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in a hospital in Malawi, a teaching hospital.

105
0:04:57.288,000 --> 0:04:58,000
He went to work every day

106
0:04:58.806,000 --> 0:04:59,000
in an operating theater like this one,

107
0:05:00.798,000 --> 0:05:03,000
trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so

108
0:05:03.961,000 --> 0:05:04,000
using that same equipment

109
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that became so unreliable, and frankly unsafe, in his hospital.

110
0:05:10.299,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And after umpteen surgeries

111
0:05:12.103,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and, you can imagine, really unspeakable tragedy,

112
0:05:14.695,000 --> 0:05:16,000
he just said, "That's it. I'm done. That's enough.

113
0:05:17.061,000 --> 0:05:19,000
There has to be something better."

114
0:05:19.489,000 --> 0:05:2,000
He took a walk down the hall

115
0:05:21.06,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them,

116
0:05:24.515,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I think that's the scientific term,

117
0:05:26.216,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and he started tinkering.

118
0:05:27.582,000 --> 0:05:29,000
He took one part from here and another from there,

119
0:05:29.959,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and he tried to come up with a machine that would work

120
0:05:32.565,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in the reality that he was facing.

121
0:05:34.217,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And what he came up with:

122
0:05:35.455,000 --> 0:05:36,000
was this guy.

123
0:05:36.802,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine --

124
0:05:40.363,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients

125
0:05:43.684,000 --> 0:05:46,000
no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer.

126
0:05:47.779,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Here it is, back at home

127
0:05:49.284,000 --> 0:05:52,000
at that same hospital, developed a little further, 12 years later,

128
0:05:52.737,000 --> 0:05:55,000
working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics.

129
0:05:56.397,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Let me show you a little bit about how this machine works.

130
0:05:59.191,000 --> 0:06:,000
Voila!

131
0:06:01.712,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Here she is.

132
0:06:02.943,000 --> 0:06:03,000
When you have electricity,

133
0:06:04.211,000 --> 0:06:07,000
everything in this machine begins in the base.

134
0:06:07.253,000 --> 0:06:09,000
There's a built-in oxygen concentrator down there.

135
0:06:09.874,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Now you've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point.

136
0:06:13.027,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Essentially, to deliver anesthesia, you want as pure oxygen as possible,

137
0:06:16.839,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because eventually you're going to dilute it, essentially, with the gas.

138
0:06:20.286,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And the mixture that the patient inhales

139
0:06:22.746,000 --> 0:06:24,000
needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen

140
0:06:25.081,000 --> 0:06:26,000
or else it can become dangerous.

141
0:06:26.791,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But so in here when there's electricity,

142
0:06:28.733,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.

143
0:06:31.632,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now we know room air is gloriously free,

144
0:06:34.935,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it is abundant,

145
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and it's already 21 percent oxygen.

146
0:06:38.696,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it

147
0:06:42.397,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here,

148
0:06:46.241,000 --> 0:06:48,000
where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.

149
0:06:49.003,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs,

150
0:06:52.651,000 --> 0:06:54,000
it's going to pass by here -- you can't see it,

151
0:06:54.889,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but there's an oxygen sensor here --

152
0:06:56.695,000 --> 0:07:,000
that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered.

153
0:07:01.544,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now if you don't have power,

154
0:07:03.542,000 --> 0:07:06,000
or, God forbid, the power cuts out in the middle of a surgery,

155
0:07:07.172,000 --> 0:07:09,000
this machine transitions automatically,

156
0:07:09.54,000 --> 0:07:1,000
without even having to touch it,

157
0:07:11.313,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to drawing in room air from this inlet.

158
0:07:14.065,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Everything else is the same.

159
0:07:15.425,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The only difference is that now

160
0:07:17.045,000 --> 0:07:2,000
you're only working with 21 percent oxygen.

161
0:07:20.666,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now that used to be a dangerous guessing game,

162
0:07:23.511,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because you only knew if you gave too little oxygen

163
0:07:25.921,000 --> 0:07:26,000
once something bad happened.

164
0:07:27.321,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But we've put a long-life battery backup on here.

165
0:07:30.058,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This is the only part that's battery backed up.

166
0:07:32.276,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But this gives control to the provider, whether there's power or not,

167
0:07:35.705,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because they can adjust the flows

168
0:07:37.322,000 --> 0:07:4,000
based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving the patient.

169
0:07:41.314,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In both cases, whether you have power or not,

170
0:07:44.683,000 --> 0:07:46,000
sometimes the patient needs help breathing.

171
0:07:46.747,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It's just a reality of anesthesia, the lungs can be paralyzed.

172
0:07:49.972,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And so we've just added this manual bellows.

173
0:07:52.08,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We've seen surgeries for three or four hours

174
0:07:55.095,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to ventilate the patient on this.

175
0:07:57.684,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So it's a straightforward machine.

176
0:08:00.696,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I shudder to say simple; it's straightforward.

177
0:08:04.196,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And it's by design.

178
0:08:06.121,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You do not need to be a highly trained, specialized anesthesiologist

179
0:08:11.345,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to use this machine,

180
0:08:12.54,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which is good because, in these rural district hospitals,

181
0:08:15.316,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you're not going to get that level of training.

182
0:08:17.935,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It's also designed for the environment that it will be used in.

183
0:08:21.087,000 --> 0:08:22,000
This is an incredibly rugged machine.

184
0:08:22.888,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear

185
0:08:26.367,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that happens in hospitals in these rural districts.

186
0:08:29.509,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And so it's not going to break very easily,

187
0:08:31.928,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but if it does, virtually every piece in this machine

188
0:08:35.226,000 --> 0:08:37,000
can be swapped out and replaced

189
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.

190
0:08:41.01,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And finally, it's affordable.

191
0:08:43.294,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost

192
0:08:46.971,000 --> 0:08:49,000
of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier.

193
0:08:50.073,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So in other words, what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery

194
0:08:54.585,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and save lives,

195
0:08:55.781,000 --> 0:08:57,000
because it was designed for its environment,

196
0:08:58.795,000 --> 0:09:,000
just like the first machine I showed you.

197
0:09:01.237,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But we're not content to stop there.

198
0:09:03.265,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Is it working?

199
0:09:04.464,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Is this the design that's going to work in place?

200
0:09:07.07,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Well, we've seen good results so far.

201
0:09:08.861,000 --> 0:09:11,000
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries,

202
0:09:12.27,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries

203
0:09:16.227,000 --> 0:09:18,000
with no clinically adverse events.

204
0:09:18.8,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So we're thrilled.

205
0:09:19.991,000 --> 0:09:23,000
This really seems like a cost-effective, scalable solution

206
0:09:24.437,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to a problem that's really pervasive.

207
0:09:26.958,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But we still want to be sure

208
0:09:28.582,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that this is the most effective and safe device

209
0:09:31.023,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that we can be putting into hospitals.

210
0:09:33.104,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So to do that, we've launched a number of partnerships

211
0:09:35.652,000 --> 0:09:36,000
with NGOs and universities,

212
0:09:37.162,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to gather data on the user interface,

213
0:09:39.835,000 --> 0:09:41,000
on the types of surgeries it's appropriate for,

214
0:09:42.051,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and ways we can enhance the device itself.

215
0:09:44.462,000 --> 0:09:46,000
One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins

216
0:09:47.14,000 --> 0:09:48,000
just here in Baltimore.

217
0:09:48.537,000 --> 0:09:52,000
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore.

218
0:09:52.839,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So we're taking this machine

219
0:09:54.744,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and recreating some of the operating theater crises

220
0:09:58.342,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that this machine might face

221
0:09:59.873,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in one of the hospitals that it's intended for,

222
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and in a contained, safe environment,

223
0:10:04.408,000 --> 0:10:05,000
evaluating its effectiveness.

224
0:10:06.607,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We're then able to compare the results from that study

225
0:10:10.263,000 --> 0:10:11,000
with real-world experience,

226
0:10:11.707,000 --> 0:10:13,000
because we're putting two of these in hospitals

227
0:10:13.928,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone,

228
0:10:16.103,000 --> 0:10:19,000
including the hospital where that emergency C-section happened.

229
0:10:20.645,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So I've talked a lot about anesthesia, and I tend to do that.

230
0:10:23.797,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.

231
0:10:27.913,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And it really seems peripheral, we never think about it,

232
0:10:30.568,000 --> 0:10:32,000
until we don't have access to it,

233
0:10:32.796,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and then it becomes a gatekeeper.

234
0:10:34.782,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Who gets surgery and who doesn't?

235
0:10:37.084,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't?

236
0:10:40.476,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But you know, it's just one of so many ways

237
0:10:42.963,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that design, appropriate design,

238
0:10:46.094,000 --> 0:10:47,000
can have an impact on health outcomes.

239
0:10:48.578,000 --> 0:10:5,000
If more people in the health-delivery space

240
0:10:50.721,000 --> 0:10:53,000
really working on some of these challenges in low-income countries

241
0:10:54.314,000 --> 0:10:57,000
could start their design process, their solution search,

242
0:10:57.991,000 --> 0:10:58,000
from outside of that proverbial box

243
0:10:59.953,000 --> 0:11:,000
and inside of the hospital --

244
0:11:01.915,000 --> 0:11:02,000
In other words, if we could design

245
0:11:03.77,000 --> 0:11:06,000
for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world,

246
0:11:06.985,000 --> 0:11:08,000
rather than the one that we wished existed --

247
0:11:09.418,000 --> 0:11:11,000
we might just save a lot of lives.

248
0:11:12.047,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Thank you very much.

249
0:11:13.539,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Applause)

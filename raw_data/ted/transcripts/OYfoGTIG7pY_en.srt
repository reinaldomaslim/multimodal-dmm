1
0:00:19.21,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others,

2
0:00:22.882,000 --> 0:00:26,000
have put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.

3
0:00:27.463,000 --> 0:00:3,000
17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped,

4
0:00:31.36,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and we're just starting our third experiment:

5
0:00:33.52,000 --> 0:00:35,000
studying people who report that they're still in love

6
0:00:36.05,000 --> 0:00:38,000
after 10 to 25 years of marriage.

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So, this is the short story of that research.

8
0:00:42.88,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.

9
0:00:47.454,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It was built by the grandest Sun King, of the grandest city-state,

10
0:00:52.445,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of the grandest civilization of the Americas, the Mayas.

11
0:00:57.095,000 --> 0:00:59,000
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.

12
0:00:59.804,000 --> 0:01:,000
He stood over six feet tall.

13
0:01:02.107,000 --> 0:01:04,000
He lived into his 80s,

14
0:01:04.148,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD.

15
0:01:08.508,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife.

16
0:01:12.588,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So, he built a temple in her honor, facing his.

17
0:01:16.449,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And every spring and autumn, exactly at the equinox,

18
0:01:20.441,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the sun rises behind his temple,

19
0:01:22.9,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow.

20
0:01:27.96,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon,

21
0:01:31.735,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow.

22
0:01:35.743,000 --> 0:01:41,000
After 1,300 years, these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb.

23
0:01:42.806,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Around the world, people love.

24
0:01:45.123,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They sing for love, they dance for love,

25
0:01:47.891,000 --> 0:01:5,000
they compose poems and stories about love.

26
0:01:50.923,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They tell myths and legends about love.

27
0:01:53.522,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They pine for love, they live for love, they kill for love, and they die for love.

28
0:01:59.372,000 --> 0:02:03,000
As Walt Whitman once said, "O I would stake all for you."

29
0:02:04.117,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies.

30
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They've never found a society that did not have it.

31
0:02:12.446,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But love isn't always a happy experience.

32
0:02:15.17,000 --> 0:02:18,000
In one study of college students, they asked a lot of questions about love,

33
0:02:19.093,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but the two that stood out to me the most were:

34
0:02:22.056,000 --> 0:02:26,000
"Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved?"

35
0:02:26.686,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And the second question was:

36
0:02:28.127,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you?"

37
0:02:31.943,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both.

38
0:02:37.249,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Almost nobody gets out of love alive.

39
0:02:40.858,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So, before I start telling you about the brain,

40
0:02:44.137,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I want to read for you

41
0:02:45.621,000 --> 0:02:47,000
what I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth.

42
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
There's other love poems that are, of course, just as good,

43
0:02:51.171,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but I don't think this one can be surpassed.

44
0:02:53.767,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska

45
0:02:58.478,000 --> 0:03:,000
to a missionary in 1896.

46
0:03:01.967,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And here it is.

47
0:03:03.217,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I've never had the opportunity to say it before.

48
0:03:06.825,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you.

49
0:03:10.878,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you.

50
0:03:14.97,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you,

51
0:03:18.837,000 --> 0:03:21,000
consumed by fire with my love for you.

52
0:03:21.952,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I remember what you said to me.

53
0:03:24.082,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I am thinking of your love for me.

54
0:03:26.191,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I am torn by your love for me.

55
0:03:28.54,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Pain and more pain --

56
0:03:30.502,000 --> 0:03:32,000
where are you going with my love?

57
0:03:32.563,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I am told you will go from here.

58
0:03:34.363,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I am told you will leave me here.

59
0:03:36.83,000 --> 0:03:38,000
My body is numb with grief.

60
0:03:39.019,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Remember what I said, my love.

61
0:03:41.102,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Goodbye, my love, goodbye."

62
0:03:44.975,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Emily Dickinson once wrote, "Parting is all we need to know of hell."

63
0:03:51.186,000 --> 0:03:53,000
How many people have suffered

64
0:03:53.328,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in all the millions of years of human evolution?

65
0:03:56.947,000 --> 0:03:58,000
How many people around the world

66
0:03:59.106,000 --> 0:04:01,000
are dancing with elation at this very minute?

67
0:04:02.463,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth.

68
0:04:06.707,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, several years ago, I decided to look into the brain

69
0:04:10.165,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and study this madness.

70
0:04:13.029,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Our first study of people who were happily in love

71
0:04:15.63,000 --> 0:04:16,000
has been widely publicized,

72
0:04:16.995,000 --> 0:04:18,000
so I'm only going to say very little about it.

73
0:04:19.513,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain

74
0:04:23.517,000 --> 0:04:25,000
called the ventral tegmental area.

75
0:04:25.687,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We found activity in some cells called the A10 cells,

76
0:04:28.855,000 --> 0:04:3,000
cells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant,

77
0:04:31.808,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and spray it to many brain regions.

78
0:04:34.108,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Indeed, this part, the VTA, is part of the brain's reward system.

79
0:04:38.243,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It's way below your cognitive thinking process.

80
0:04:40.84,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's below your emotions.

81
0:04:42.455,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain,

82
0:04:45.708,000 --> 0:04:5,000
associated with wanting, with motivation, with focus and with craving.

83
0:04:50.978,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In fact, the same brain region where we found activity

84
0:04:54.108,000 --> 0:04:57,000
becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine.

85
0:04:57.981,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high --

86
0:05:00.948,000 --> 0:05:02,000
at least you come down from cocaine.

87
0:05:03.283,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Romantic love is an obsession, it possesses you.

88
0:05:06.588,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You lose your sense of self.

89
0:05:08.271,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You can't stop thinking about another human being.

90
0:05:11.663,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Somebody is camping in your head.

91
0:05:14.08,000 --> 0:05:19,000
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said, "My longing had no time when it ceases."

92
0:05:20.68,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Wild is love.

93
0:05:23.013,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected.

94
0:05:26.625,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientists on our project,

95
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
are looking at the data of the people

96
0:05:33.331,000 --> 0:05:36,000
who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped.

97
0:05:36.686,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It was very difficult actually, putting these people in the machine,

98
0:05:39.911,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because they were in such bad shape.

99
0:05:41.67,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So anyway, we found activity in three brain regions.

101
0:05:47.973,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We found activity in the brain region,

102
0:05:50.468,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love.

103
0:05:55.083,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What a bad deal.

104
0:05:56.983,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You know, when you've been dumped,

105
0:05:58.655,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being,

106
0:06:01.876,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and then go on with your life -- but no, you just love them harder.

107
0:06:05.925,000 --> 0:06:08,000
As the poet Terence, the Roman poet once said,

108
0:06:09.517,000 --> 0:06:12,000
he said, "The less my hope, the hotter my love."

109
0:06:12.558,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And indeed, we now know why.

110
0:06:14.818,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Two thousand years later, we can explain this in the brain.

111
0:06:18.06,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That brain system -- the reward system

112
0:06:20.483,000 --> 0:06:23,000
for wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus --

113
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
becomes more active when you can't get what you want.

114
0:06:27.816,000 --> 0:06:31,000
In this case, life's greatest prize: an appropriate mating partner.

115
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We found activity in other brain regions also --

116
0:06:35.382,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses.

117
0:06:40.298,000 --> 0:06:42,000
You're lying there, you're looking at the picture,

118
0:06:42.669,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and you're in this machine,

119
0:06:44.002,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and you're calculating what went wrong.

120
0:06:46.199,000 --> 0:06:48,000
What have I lost?

121
0:06:48.771,000 --> 0:06:51,000
As a matter of fact, Lucy and I have a little joke about this.

122
0:06:52.443,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It comes from a David Mamet play,

123
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and there's two con artists in the play,

124
0:06:57.428,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and the woman is conning the man,

125
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and the man looks at the woman and says,

126
0:07:01.535,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"Oh, you're a bad pony, I'm not going to bet on you."

127
0:07:06.511,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And indeed, it's this part of the brain,

128
0:07:09.105,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the core of the nucleus accumbens,

129
0:07:11.035,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that is becoming active as you're measuring your gains and losses.

130
0:07:14.657,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It's also the brain region that becomes active

131
0:07:17.027,000 --> 0:07:21,000
when you're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses.

132
0:07:21.948,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Last but not least, we found activity in a brain region

133
0:07:25.234,000 --> 0:07:28,000
associated with deep attachment to another individual.

134
0:07:29.913,000 --> 0:07:35,000
No wonder people suffer around the world, and we have so many crimes of passion.

135
0:07:36.06,000 --> 0:07:38,000
When you've been rejected in love,

136
0:07:38.2,000 --> 0:07:41,000
not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love,

137
0:07:42.153,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but you're feeling deep attachment to this individual.

138
0:07:44.931,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Moreover, this brain circuit for reward is working,

139
0:07:48.202,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and you're feeling intense energy, intense focus, intense motivation

140
0:07:53.402,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and the willingness to risk it all, to win life's greatest prize.

141
0:07:59.807,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So, what have I learned from this experiment

142
0:08:02.725,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that I would like to tell the world?

143
0:08:04.471,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Foremost, I have come to think

144
0:08:06.873,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that romantic love is a drive, a basic mating drive.

145
0:08:10.319,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Not the sex drive --

146
0:08:11.519,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the sex drive gets you looking for a whole range of partners.

147
0:08:14.413,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy

148
0:08:16.943,000 --> 0:08:18,000
on just one at a time, conserve your mating energy,

149
0:08:19.765,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and start the mating process with this single individual.

150
0:08:23.447,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love,

151
0:08:27.088,000 --> 0:08:3,000
what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato

152
0:08:30.934,000 --> 0:08:32,000
over 2,000 years ago.

153
0:08:33.061,000 --> 0:08:36,000
He said, "The god of love lives in a state of need.

154
0:08:37.171,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It is a need, it is an urge, it is a homeostatic imbalance.

155
0:08:42.483,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Like hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out."

156
0:08:47.411,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction:

157
0:08:50.722,000 --> 0:08:52,000
a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well,

158
0:08:53.293,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly.

159
0:08:56.389,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And indeed, it has all of the characteristics of addiction.

160
0:08:59.201,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You focus on the person, you obsessively think about them,

161
0:09:02.578,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you crave them, you distort reality,

162
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person.

163
0:09:08.654,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And it's got the three main characteristics of addiction:

164
0:09:11.365,000 --> 0:09:13,000
tolerance, you need to see them more, and more, and more;

165
0:09:14.07,000 --> 0:09:15,000
withdrawals;

166
0:09:15.631,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and last: relapse.

167
0:09:17.053,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair.

168
0:09:20.703,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It's been about eight months, she's beginning to feel better.

169
0:09:23.61,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And she was driving along in her car the other day,

170
0:09:26.1,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio

171
0:09:28.292,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that reminded her of this man.

172
0:09:29.751,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Not only did the instant craving come back,

173
0:09:32.638,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry.

174
0:09:36.704,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So, one thing I would like the medical community,

175
0:09:39.095,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and the legal community, and even the college community,

176
0:09:41.818,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to see if they can understand, that indeed, romantic love

177
0:09:45.655,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is one of the most addictive substances on Earth.

178
0:09:48.745,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I would also like to tell the world that animals love.

179
0:09:52.464,000 --> 0:09:54,000
There's not an animal on this planet

180
0:09:54.659,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that will copulate with anything that comes along.

181
0:09:57.079,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Too old, too young, too scruffy, too stupid, and they won't do it.

182
0:10:01.8,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Unless you're stuck in a laboratory cage --

183
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and you know, if you spend your entire life in a little box,

184
0:10:08.05,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with,

185
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but I've looked in a hundred species,

186
0:10:14.231,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and everywhere in the wild, animals have favorites.

187
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
As a matter of fact, ethologists know this.

188
0:10:19.357,000 --> 0:10:22,000
There are over eight words for what they call "animal favoritism:"

189
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
selective proceptivity, mate choice, female choice, sexual choice.

190
0:10:28.843,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And indeed, there are now three academic articles

191
0:10:31.843,000 --> 0:10:33,000
in which they've looked at this attraction,

192
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
which may only last for a second,

193
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but it's a definite attraction,

194
0:10:38.065,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and either this same brain region, this reward system,

195
0:10:41.371,000 --> 0:10:44,000
or the chemicals of that reward system are involved.

196
0:10:44.948,000 --> 0:10:46,000
In fact, I think animal attraction can be instant --

197
0:10:47.586,000 --> 0:10:49,000
you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant.

198
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And I think that this is really the origin

199
0:10:52.354,000 --> 0:10:55,000
of what you and I call "love at first sight."

200
0:10:56.788,000 --> 0:10:58,000
People have often asked me

201
0:10:58.908,000 --> 0:11:02,000
whether what I know about love has spoiled it for me.

202
0:11:02.936,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And I just simply say, "Hardly."

203
0:11:04.97,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake,

204
0:11:08.119,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and then when you sit down and eat that cake,

205
0:11:10.838,000 --> 0:11:11,000
you can still feel that joy.

206
0:11:12.681,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And certainly, I make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too,

207
0:11:16.363,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but it's really deepened my understanding

208
0:11:20.626,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and compassion, really, for all human life.

209
0:11:24.576,000 --> 0:11:27,000
As a matter of fact, in New York, I often catch myself

210
0:11:27.849,000 --> 0:11:3,000
looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot.

211
0:11:31.434,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry

212
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
for the chicken on my dinner plate,

213
0:11:36.353,000 --> 0:11:4,000
when I think of how intense this brain system is.

214
0:11:41.561,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Our newest experiment has been hatched

215
0:11:46.27,000 --> 0:11:48,000
by my colleague, Art Aron --

216
0:11:48.948,000 --> 0:11:51,000
putting people who are reporting that they are still in love,

217
0:11:52.133,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in a long-term relationship, into the functional MRI.

218
0:11:55.295,000 --> 0:11:57,000
We've put five people in so far,

219
0:11:57.672,000 --> 0:12:,000
and indeed, we found exactly the same thing.

220
0:12:00.752,000 --> 0:12:01,000
They're not lying.

221
0:12:02.117,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The brain areas associated with intense romantic love

222
0:12:08.124,000 --> 0:12:12,000
still become active, 25 years later.

223
0:12:12.886,000 --> 0:12:14,000
There are still many questions to be answered

224
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and asked about romantic love.

225
0:12:18.1,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The question that I'm working on right this minute --

226
0:12:20.639,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and I'm only going to say it for a second, and then end --

227
0:12:23.404,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is, why do you fall in love with one person, rather than another?

228
0:12:26.503,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I never would have even thought to think of this,

229
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but Match.com, the Internet dating site,

230
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
came to me three years ago and asked me that question.

231
0:12:34.149,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And I said, I don't know.

232
0:12:35.498,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I know what happens in the brain, when you do become in love,

233
0:12:38.899,000 --> 0:12:41,000
but I don't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another.

234
0:12:42.44,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And so, I've spent the last three years on this.

235
0:12:45.226,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person

236
0:12:48.262,000 --> 0:12:5,000
rather than another, that psychologists can tell you.

237
0:12:50.777,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background,

238
0:12:54.634,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the same general level of intelligence, of good looks, the same religious values.

239
0:12:58.492,000 --> 0:13:,000
Your childhood certainly plays a role, but nobody knows how.

240
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And that's about it, that's all they know.

241
0:13:03.515,000 --> 0:13:04,000
No, they've never found

242
0:13:05.149,000 --> 0:13:09,000
the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship.

243
0:13:09.532,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So, it began to occur to me

244
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another.

245
0:13:16.402,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree

246
0:13:20.962,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone.

247
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I think we've evolved four very broad personality types

248
0:13:28.625,000 --> 0:13:31,000
associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain.

249
0:13:32.748,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And on this dating site that I have created, called Chemistry.com,

250
0:13:36.973,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I ask you first a series of questions

251
0:13:40.606,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to see to what degree you express these chemicals,

252
0:13:43.763,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and I'm watching who chooses who to love.

253
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America.

254
0:13:51.762,000 --> 0:13:55,000
About 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries.

255
0:13:56.148,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I'm putting the data together now,

256
0:13:57.852,000 --> 0:14:,000
and at some point -- there will always be magic to love,

257
0:14:01.196,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but I think I will come closer to understanding

258
0:14:04.635,000 --> 0:14:08,000
why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background,

259
0:14:08.936,000 --> 0:14:11,000
your same general level of intelligence, good looks,

260
0:14:12.488,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and you don't feel pulled towards all of them.

261
0:14:14.7,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I think there's biology to that.

262
0:14:16.603,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I think we're going to end up, in the next few years,

263
0:14:19.188,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms

264
0:14:21.402,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that pull us to one person rather than another.

265
0:14:24.736,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So, I will close with this.

266
0:14:27.153,000 --> 0:14:29,000
These are my older people.

267
0:14:30.269,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Faulkner said, "The past is not dead, it's not even past."

268
0:14:35.761,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain.

269
0:14:40.742,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And so, there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature,

270
0:14:48.107,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and this reminds me of it.

271
0:14:50.132,000 --> 0:14:51,000
These are two women.

272
0:14:51.58,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do.

273
0:14:54.736,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking.

274
0:14:57.02,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We swivel towards each other,

275
0:14:58.941,000 --> 0:15:02,000
we do what we call the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.

276
0:15:03.067,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This is intimacy to women.

277
0:15:04.654,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I think it comes from millions of years

278
0:15:06.563,000 --> 0:15:08,000
of holding that baby in front of your face,

279
0:15:08.669,000 --> 0:15:11,000
cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.

280
0:15:12.103,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Men tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing.

281
0:15:15.72,000 --> 0:15:18,000
As soon as one guy looks up, the other guy will look away.

282
0:15:19.114,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Laughter)

283
0:15:20.837,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I think it comes from millions of years sitting behind the bush,

284
0:15:25.958,000 --> 0:15:29,000
looking straight ahead, trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.

285
0:15:30.429,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I think, for millions of years, men faced their enemies,

286
0:15:33.22,000 --> 0:15:35,000
they sat side-by-side with friends.

287
0:15:35.972,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So my final statement is: love is in us.

288
0:15:40.248,000 --> 0:15:42,000
It's deeply embedded in the brain.

289
0:15:42.84,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Our challenge is to understand each other.

290
0:15:45.669,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Thank you.

291
0:15:46.894,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit,

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.

4
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
AM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio --

5
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it might have given it away --

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs.

7
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was amputated at age one,

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place.

9
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
SS: Well, why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why don't we start there?

10
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Why don't we start there?

11
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
AM: I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school.

13
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
They pick three students out of the nation every year

14
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to get involved in international affairs,

15
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and so I won a full ride to Georgetown

16
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I've been there for four years. Love it.

17
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
SS: When Aimee got there,

18
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
she decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field,

19
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
so she decided to call someone and start asking about it.

20
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So, why don't you tell that story?

21
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
AM: Yeah. Well, I guess I've always been involved in sports.

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I played softball for five years growing up.

23
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I skied competitively throughout high school,

24
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I got a little restless in college

25
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.

26
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know --

27
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.

28
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That's all I'd ever known.

29
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
In fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.

30
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners,

31
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this,

32
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about."

33
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old

34
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.

35
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet

36
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to see how far I could run,

37
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.

38
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And I had these legs that were made of

39
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps --

40
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
big, thick, five-ply wool socks on --

41
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known.

42
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And I'm up there in Boston against people

43
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite

44
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things --

45
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and they're all looking at me like,

46
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
OK, we know who's not going to win this race.

47
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And, I mean, I went up there expecting --

48
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I don't know what I was expecting --

49
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg

50
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump

51
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
and clear it at six feet, two inches ...

52
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta,

53
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of --

54
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
these are truly accomplished athletes,

55
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
without qualifying that word "athlete."

56
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding,

57
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder

58
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
by three hundredths of a second,

59
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and became the new national record-holder on my first try out.

60
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And, you know, people said,

61
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"Aimee, you know, you've got speed -- you've got natural speed --

62
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.

63
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You were all over the place.

64
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We all saw how hard you were working."

65
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.

66
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.

67
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
He's coached five Olympians, and

68
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling

69
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
with All America certificates

70
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of all these athletes he's coached.

71
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
He's just a rather intimidating figure.

72
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..."

73
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
"I want to see if I can, you know --

75
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices,

76
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
see what drills you do and whatever."

77
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
That's all I wanted -- just two practices.

78
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"Can I just sit in and see what you do?"

79
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything."

80
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?"

81
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So, I met the man, walked in his office,

82
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.

83
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And we got to talking,

84
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and it turned out to be a great partnership

85
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because he'd never coached a disabled athlete,

86
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
so therefore he had no preconceived notions

87
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of what I was or wasn't capable of,

88
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I'd never been coached before.

89
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So this was like, "Here we go -- let's start on this trip."

90
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break,

91
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
his free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.

92
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So that's how I met Frank.

93
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around,

94
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
he said, "You know, you're good enough.

95
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You can run on our women's track team here."

96
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And I said, "No, come on."

97
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And he said, "No, no, really. You can.

98
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You can run with our women's track team."

99
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team

100
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.

101
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level.

102
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So I don't know, it started to become an interesting mix.

103
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
SS: Well, on your way to the Olympics,

104
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.

105
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Why don't you just tell them?

106
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
AM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets --

107
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
everything I competed in -- and, you know, training in Georgetown

108
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
and knowing that I was going to have to get used to

109
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
seeing the backs of all these women's shirts --

110
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo --

111
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and they're all looking at me like,

112
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?"

113
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And putting on my Georgetown uniform

114
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and going out there and knowing that, you know,

115
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in order to become better -- and I'm already the best in the country --

116
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you.

117
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And I went out there and made it to the Big East,

118
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.

119
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It was really, really hot.

120
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And it's the first --

121
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio,

122
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and I didn't realize at that time that

123
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock --

124
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it actually acted like a lubricant

125
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.

126
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory,

127
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I came out of my leg.

128
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.

129
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I, I mean, was just mortified --

130
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
because I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour.

131
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Laughter)

132
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I went to my coach: "Please, don't make me do this."

133
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off.

134
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.

135
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And he just sat there like this.

136
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
My pleas fell on deaf ears, thank god.

137
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Because you know, the man is from Brooklyn;

138
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
he's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off?

139
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You pick it up, you put the damn thing back on,

140
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and finish the goddamn race!"

141
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

142
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And I did. So, he kept me in line.

143
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
He kept me on the right track.

144
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
SS: So, then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics,

145
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and she's all excited. Her family's coming down -- it's a big deal.

146
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's now two years that you've been running?

147
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
AM: No, a year.

148
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
SS: A year. And why don't you tell them what happened

149
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
right before you go run your race?

150
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
AM: Okay, well, Atlanta.

151
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification,

152
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities --

153
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes --

154
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
as opposed to the Special Olympics,

155
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which deals with people with mental disabilities.

156
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta,

157
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I'm just blown away by the fact that

158
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.

159
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And so, here I am -- never lost.

160
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May,

161
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and was sure that I was coming home with the gold.

162
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" -- below the knee.

163
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.

164
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I had just done the long jump,

165
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says,

166
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot,

167
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
so we can't get off on the springboard."

168
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that."

169
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So, it's funny -- I'm three inches within the world record --

170
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and kept on from that point, you know,

171
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
so I'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up?

172
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
No, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.

173
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And I'm sure of it, you know?

174
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I made the front page of my hometown paper

175
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that I delivered for six years, you know?

176
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It was, like, this is my time for shine.

177
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And we're at the trainee warm-up track,

178
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.

179
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
These legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now --

180
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I was the first person in the world on these legs.

181
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I was the guinea pig., I'm telling you,

182
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
this was, like -- talk about a tourist attraction.

183
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Everyone was taking pictures -- "What is this girl running on?"

184
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition?

185
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's my first international meet.

186
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I tried to get it out of anybody I could,

187
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
you know, "Who am I running against here?"

188
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"Oh, Aimee, we'll have to get back to you on that one."

189
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I wanted to find out times.

190
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"Don't worry, you're doing great."

191
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium,

192
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.

193
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.

194
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Then I'm looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.

195
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Lane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?"

196
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And they shove us all into the shuttle bus,

197
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and all the women there are missing a hand.

198
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

199
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So, I'm just, like --

200
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know?

201
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
I'm sitting there, like, "Oh, my god. Oh, my god."

202
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
You know, I'd never lost anything,

203
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
like, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know,

204
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first.

205
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And Georgetown -- that was great.

206
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I was losing, but it was the best training because this was Atlanta.

207
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Here we are, like, crème de la crème,

208
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.

209
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And, you know, I'm just thinking,

210
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
"Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van

211
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and drove down here from Pennsylvania."

212
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter.

213
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So they call us out and, you know --

214
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
"Ladies, you have one minute."

215
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified

216
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd,

217
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
like, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.

218
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
And I'm like, "I know! Look! This isn't right."

219
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here;

220
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
if I'm not going to beat these girls,

221
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I'm going to mess their heads a little, you know?

222
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Laughter)

223
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I mean, it was definitely the "Rocky IV" sensation of me versus Germany,

224
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat.

225
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And the gun went off, and all I remember was

226
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
finishing last and

227
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible --

228
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
this feeling of just being overwhelmed.

229
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And I had to think, "Why did I do this?"

230
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
If I had won everything -- but it was like, what was the point?

231
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
All this training -- I had transformed my life.

232
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.

233
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And it made me really think about how

234
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the achievement was getting there.

235
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before,

236
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying,

237
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
"Here's my life going in this direction --

238
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and I want to take it here for a while,

239
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and just seeing how far I could push it."

240
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And the fact that I asked for help -- how many people jumped on board?

241
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
How many people gave of their time and their expertise,

242
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and their patience, to deal with me?

243
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And that was this collective glory --

244
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that there was, you know, 50 people behind me

245
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.

246
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So, I apply this sort of philosophy now

247
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to everything I do:

248
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
sitting back and realizing the progression,

249
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.

250
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's important to focus on a goal, I think, but

251
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
also recognize the progression on the way there

252
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and how you've grown as a person.

253
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
That's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement.

254
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
SS: Why don't you show them your legs?

255
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
AM: Oh, sure.

256
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
SS: You know, show us more than one set of legs.

257
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
AM: Well, these are my pretty legs.

258
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
(Laughter)

259
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
No, these are my cosmetic legs, actually,

260
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and they're absolutely beautiful.

261
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
You've got to come up and see them.

262
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
There are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.

263
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And, seriously, like, I can wear heels.

264
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Like, you guys don't understand what that's like

265
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.

266
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
SS: You got to pick your height?

267
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
AM: I got to pick my height, exactly.

268
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Laughter)

269
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s,

270
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
comes back every summer.

271
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room

272
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
because he'd come in with foot injuries.

273
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.

274
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off."

275
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Laughter)

276
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
He didn't find it as humorous as I did, anyway.

277
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
OK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite,

278
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
like I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket.

279
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
No, I've got so many legs in here.

280
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
These are -- do you want to hold that actually?

281
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
That's another leg I have for, like, tennis and softball.

282
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound

283
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
when you jump around on it. All right.

284
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over,

285
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to keep it on. Which, when I sweat,

286
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
you know, I'm pistoning out of it.

287
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
SS: Are you a different height?

288
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
AM: In these?

289
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
SS: In these.

290
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
AM: I don't know. I don't think so.

291
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on.

292
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
SS: She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving, so ...

293
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
AM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving,

294
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and balance is a little bit of an art in them.

295
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
But without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.

296
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these.

297
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Applause)

298
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.

299
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
If you ever watch a sprinter,

300
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.

301
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So when I stand in these legs,

302
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
my hamstring and my glutes are contracted,

303
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet.

304
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
(Audience: Who made them?)

305
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
AM: It's a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot.

306
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be

307
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.

308
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
But actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.

309
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know,

310
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
it's like a big -- it's come full circle.

311
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Moderator: Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2,

312
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and we'll talk about the design of them.

313
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
AM: Yes, we'll do that.

314
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
SS: Yes, there you go.

315
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
AM: So, these are the sprint legs, and I can put my other...

316
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
SS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs?

317
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
AM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England,

318
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
about two hours south of London,

319
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and I'm the only person in the United States with these,

320
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
which is a crime because they are so beautiful.

321
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.

322
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
For me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track,

323
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
I want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important

324
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
not to be limited in any capacity,

325
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
whether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion.

326
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere

327
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want, the skirts I want --

328
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here

329
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and make them accessible to a lot of people.

330
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
They're also silicon.

331
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
This is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.

332
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
It's like a Barbie foot under this.

333
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
(Laughter)

334
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
It is. It's just stuck in this position,

335
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
so I have to wear a two-inch heel.

336
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it.

337
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
I don't know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.

338
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
There're veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink,

339
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and my Achilles' tendon -- that moves a little bit.

340
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.

341
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And this is just a silicon piece of skin.

342
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
I mean, what happened was, two years ago

343
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
this man in Belgium was saying, "God,

344
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum

345
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes,

346
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
looking so real as if she breathed,

347
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
why can't they build a limb for someone

348
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
that looks like a leg, or an arm, or a hand?"

349
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
I mean, they make ears for burn victims.

350
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
They do amazing stuff with silicon.

351
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
SS: Two weeks ago, Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs.

352
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
And she came into town and she rushed around

353
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and she said, "I have to buy some new shoes!"

354
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
We're an hour before the ESPYs,

355
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and she thought she'd gotten a two-inch heel

356
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:24,000
but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel.

357
0:19:24.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
AM: And this poses a problem for me,

358
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
because it means I'm walking like that all night long.

359
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
SS: For 45 minutes. Luckily, the hotel was terrific.

360
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes.

361
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
(Laughter)

362
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
AM: I said to the receptionist -- I mean, I am just harried, and Sheryl's at my side --

363
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
I said, "Look, do you have anybody here who could help me?

364
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
Because I have this problem ... "

365
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
You know, at first they were just going to write me off, like,

366
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
"If you don't like your shoes, sorry. It's too late."

367
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:54,000
"No, no, no, no. I've got these special feet

368
0:19:54.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
that need a two-inch heel. I have a three-inch heel.

369
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
I need a little bit off."

370
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
They didn't even want to go there.

371
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:04,000
They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it.

372
0:20:04.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
No, these legs are great.

373
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks

374
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
to get some improvements.

375
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
I want to get legs like these made for flat feet

376
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
so I can wear sneakers, because I can't with these ones.

377
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
So... Moderator: That's it.

378
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
SS: That's Aimee Mullins.

379
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
(Applause)

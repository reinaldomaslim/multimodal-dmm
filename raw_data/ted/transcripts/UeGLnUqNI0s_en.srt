1
0:00:13.031,000 --> 0:00:19,000
At no point did I think superheroes would become such a huge part of my life.

2
0:00:21.113,000 --> 0:00:24,000
As a kid, I looked at them, and I saw everything I wasn't.

3
0:00:25.041,000 --> 0:00:26,000
They had big muscles,

4
0:00:27.035,000 --> 0:00:28,000
supermodel good looks,

5
0:00:28.75,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and phenomenal cosmic powers.

6
0:00:32.462,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And me?

7
0:00:34.397,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I kind of looked like this,

8
0:00:36.302,000 --> 0:00:39,000
except shorter and with frizzier hair,

9
0:00:39.43,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I never felt powerful.

10
0:00:43.35,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I was always just one big ball of nervous, soft energy,

11
0:00:46.89,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and superheroes, much like the bullies at school,

12
0:00:51.176,000 --> 0:00:53,000
didn't seem to have a lot of room for that, for me.

13
0:00:54.772,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So I stayed away.

14
0:00:57.565,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And besides, who needs superheroes

15
0:00:59.891,000 --> 0:01:02,000
when you're surrounded by Puerto Rican women from the Bronx?

16
0:01:02.919,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:05.042,000 --> 0:01:08,000
My tías were cops and paramedics,

18
0:01:08.319,000 --> 0:01:11,000
my abuelas were seamstresses and sold jewelry up the street,

19
0:01:12.184,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and my mom got her master's degree

20
0:01:15.074,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in education and taught kindergarten in New York City public schools

21
0:01:18.312,000 --> 0:01:19,000
for over 30 years.

22
0:01:20.065,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So my superheroes were sitting around the dinner table with me.

23
0:01:24.247,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I don't know how much time

24
0:01:25.745,000 --> 0:01:27,000
you've spent with Puerto Rican women from the Bronx,

25
0:01:28.452,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but we're also some of the world's greatest storytellers.

26
0:01:33.412,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I'd sit there at my grandmother's dining room table

27
0:01:37.11,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I'd listen to the women in my family

28
0:01:41.134,000 --> 0:01:46,000
tell these wild, rambunctious tales about navigating their lives in the Bronx.

29
0:01:47.338,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I wanted to be them so bad.

30
0:01:50.247,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But I wasn't tough like them either.

31
0:01:52.366,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So mostly, I listened,

32
0:01:54.131,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I soaked it in,

33
0:01:56.718,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I found myself gravitating to the soft threads in their stories,

34
0:02:02.245,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and I wrote those down.

35
0:02:04.442,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The funny, the goofy, the gentle --

36
0:02:08.433,000 --> 0:02:1,000
those were my in to storytelling,

37
0:02:12.139,000 --> 0:02:16,000
so much so that I wrote a young-adult novel

38
0:02:16.356,000 --> 0:02:18,000
called "Juliet Takes a Breath,"

39
0:02:18.927,000 --> 0:02:21,000
about a chubby, queer Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx

40
0:02:22.236,000 --> 0:02:25,000
navigating sexuality, family and identity.

41
0:02:27.006,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And on the strength of "Juliet,"

42
0:02:29.017,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Marvel Comics tapped me to write the solo series

43
0:02:33.557,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for their first-ever Latina lesbian superhero,

44
0:02:38.387,000 --> 0:02:39,000
America Chavez.

45
0:02:40.277,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Yeah!

46
0:02:41.452,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Cheers)

47
0:02:43.856,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:45.341,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Listen, OK.

49
0:02:46.596,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Created by Joe Casey and Nick Dragotta for the Marvel miniseries "Vengeance,"

50
0:02:52.349,000 --> 0:02:54,000
America Chavez has been in the Marvel Universe

51
0:02:55.245,000 --> 0:02:56,000
for over seven years.

52
0:02:57.182,000 --> 0:02:59,000
She's tough, Latina,

53
0:02:59.217,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and she's so strong that she can punch portals into other dimensions.

54
0:03:03.415,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:04.527,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I know, right?

56
0:03:05.782,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:07.091,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And people were so excited,

58
0:03:08.79,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because finally, someone who shared her identities -- queer and Latina --

59
0:03:13.465,000 --> 0:03:14,000
would be writing her story.

60
0:03:15.633,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And I saw that, right?

61
0:03:17.807,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And also, when I looked at America,

62
0:03:19.915,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I saw a young Latina in survival mode.

63
0:03:24.118,000 --> 0:03:27,000
See, because her moms had sacrificed themselves to the universe

64
0:03:27.927,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when she was a kid,

65
0:03:29.109,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and she'd been on her own ever since.

66
0:03:32.354,000 --> 0:03:33,000
No wonder she had to be tough.

67
0:03:35.549,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And that link, that link of having to be tough,

68
0:03:38.708,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that rested heavy with me.

69
0:03:41.112,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Like I said, I'm from the Bronx, and the Bronx is tough,

70
0:03:44.104,000 --> 0:03:47,000
tough like walking past sidewalk memorials

71
0:03:47.373,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and dodging cop towers on your way to the train type of tough.

72
0:03:51.873,000 --> 0:03:53,000
When stuff happens that's bad, people are like,

73
0:03:54.168,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"Yo, you gotta keep it moving. You gotta keep trucking.

74
0:03:56.857,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Don't cry. Don't let it get to you."

75
0:03:59.016,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And my mom and my tías and my abuelas,

76
0:04:02.413,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I never saw them take a moment to rest or to invest in self-care.

77
0:04:08.01,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And their soft? It never left the house.

78
0:04:13.414,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And so that was the first thing that I wanted to give to America,

79
0:04:16.661,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the thing that I wished I'd been able to give to my abuelas and my tías,

80
0:04:20.645,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the thing that I'm trying to give to my mom now:

81
0:04:24.436,000 --> 0:04:26,000
permission to be soft.

82
0:04:26.714,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Like, it's OK to sit in silence

83
0:04:31.02,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and go on a journey just to discover yourself,

84
0:04:33.608,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and your pain will make you crumble and you will fall

85
0:04:36.315,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and you will need to ask people for help,

86
0:04:38.753,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and that's OK,

87
0:04:40.943,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that being vulnerable is good for us.

88
0:04:44.585,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But see, I didn't come to all this compassion and healing stuff

89
0:04:47.869,000 --> 0:04:48,000
like, you know, out of nowhere,

90
0:04:49.87,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and so when it came to America's story,

91
0:04:52.838,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I wanted to give her the space to be human, to mess up,

92
0:04:57.163,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and to find soft on her own.

93
0:05:01.448,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So she kind of had to quit her day job. You know what I'm saying?

94
0:05:04.606,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I had to give her a superhero sabbatical,

95
0:05:07.573,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:08.604,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the first thing I did was enroll her in Justice Sonia Sotomayor University.

97
0:05:13.948,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:17.281,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Applause)

99
0:05:18.719,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Because where else would she feel safe and represented and liberated

100
0:05:24.14,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but a university dedicated to the first Puerto Rican woman

101
0:05:27.745,000 --> 0:05:3,000
nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States?

102
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And her first class is "Intergalactic Revolutionaries and You,"

103
0:05:36.77,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and America is so excited, she's ready to show off her strength,

104
0:05:40.314,000 --> 0:05:42,000
she's ready to show off her portal-punching skills,

105
0:05:43.055,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:44.08,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and I stripped that safety net from her right away.

107
0:05:47.502,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And I limited her powers, and I changed up her location

108
0:05:50.668,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and shook up her world, because that is what college is like,

109
0:05:55.268,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:56.293,000 --> 0:05:57,000
especially if you're alone.

111
0:05:59.602,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But I didn't want America to be alone for long,

112
0:06:03.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and so in a homework assignment gone totally wrong,

113
0:06:06.537,000 --> 0:06:08,000
she lands on a battlefield with the X-Men.

114
0:06:09.664,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:10.727,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Because, when I was in college,

116
0:06:12.854,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the Reverend Kelly Brown Douglas was my mentor,

117
0:06:16.187,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and I knew that America Chavez needed one, too.

118
0:06:21.513,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And who better to mentor America Chavez than Storm,

119
0:06:26.243,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the first black female superhero

120
0:06:29.189,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and one of the most powerful members of the X-Men?

121
0:06:32.786,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Nobody, that's who.

122
0:06:34.65,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:36.263,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And Storm teaches America how to quiet her mind

124
0:06:39.916,000 --> 0:06:4,000
inside of a star portal,

125
0:06:41.899,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and when America quiets her mind, she opens up the dimensions,

126
0:06:45.319,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and in that silence,

127
0:06:46.67,000 --> 0:06:49,000
she can listen for anything and anyone.

128
0:06:52.053,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And no one has ever offered her silence and deep reflection

129
0:06:56.576,000 --> 0:06:57,000
as a way to be powerful.

130
0:06:59.443,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And at first, she rejects it, but with Storm's encouragement,

131
0:07:03.451,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it clicks,

132
0:07:05.376,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and America quiets the world around her,

133
0:07:09.432,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and she leans into a deep vulnerability.

134
0:07:12.512,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I mean, her and Storm even hug.

135
0:07:15.884,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I know.

136
0:07:17.913,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And that's because my mentors loved me enough

137
0:07:22.305,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to encourage me to investigate myself and my ancestors,

138
0:07:26.539,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and when you're 19, how do you even know what that means?

139
0:07:30.811,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I didn't learn about the history of my people in college.

140
0:07:34.874,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I learned about the history of my people sitting on my grandmother's lap

141
0:07:38.308,000 --> 0:07:39,000
when she pulled out the photo album

142
0:07:40.005,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and she named everyone that was here and everyone still left on the island.

143
0:07:44.807,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So obviously, I had to crash-land a grandma on America Chavez,

144
0:07:49.186,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and not just any grandma -- a big, strong, luchador grandma,

145
0:07:54.864,000 --> 0:07:59,000
one that loved her enough to take her to the ancestral plain,

146
0:08:00.547,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where America Chavez could see the history of her people

147
0:08:03.808,000 --> 0:08:04,000
play out in the skies above.

148
0:08:07.307,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And America gets to see Planeta Fuertona,

149
0:08:10.709,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the birth planet of her grandmother,

150
0:08:13.744,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and she sees it get invaded,

151
0:08:15.573,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and she sees her grandmother and her mom flee.

152
0:08:19.436,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And she also sees the joy that they experience

153
0:08:22.499,000 --> 0:08:25,000
when their new homeland accepts them openly

154
0:08:26.148,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and offers them tremendous care.

155
0:08:29.235,000 --> 0:08:33,000
She gets to see great pain met with even greater compassion,

156
0:08:33.594,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and that's right alongside the tremendous strength of her family.

157
0:08:39.066,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And so everywhere that I could, right,

158
0:08:41.265,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I wrote her little love notes

159
0:08:44.224,000 --> 0:08:46,000
for her and for all the other queer kids of color

160
0:08:47.044,000 --> 0:08:48,000
trying to be magnificent.

161
0:08:50.437,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Like, when you lose yourself,

162
0:08:53.066,000 --> 0:08:57,000
dig deep into your ancestry, because you will find the pieces there.

163
0:08:59.173,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And also, reminders that soft is not a pass to duck,

164
0:09:05.739,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to hide, to be silent, to cower.

165
0:09:09.659,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Soft is also a push

166
0:09:11.908,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to hold ourselves accountable.

167
0:09:14.786,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Kind of like when America lands in World War II

168
0:09:17.916,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and comes face-to-face with Hitler,

169
0:09:19.823,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and she knocks him the hell out ...

170
0:09:21.545,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:23.039,000 --> 0:09:26,000
just like Captain America did in 1941,

172
0:09:26.123,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and who knew we'd need America Chavez to punch Nazis in 2018.

173
0:09:29.999,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:31.675,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Applause)

175
0:09:35.675,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Laughter)

176
0:09:36.979,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And even that, that justified act kind of wrecks her a little bit,

177
0:09:41.486,000 --> 0:09:44,000
so I made sure that she linked up with her best friend,

178
0:09:44.74,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and they talk feelings and they go on a road trip

179
0:09:47.652,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and they sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt at the top of their lungs.

180
0:09:51.352,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

181
0:09:53.305,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And when Midas, a sinister corporation,

182
0:09:56.848,000 --> 0:09:57,000
takes control of Sotomayor,

183
0:09:58.838,000 --> 0:10:01,000
threatens to ban portals and almost kills America ...

184
0:10:04.764,000 --> 0:10:05,000
her ancestors reach for her ...

185
0:10:08.177,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because they know that she needs to heal.

186
0:10:12.318,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And it is that burst of care, that healing, that gives her the fuel

187
0:10:16.175,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to defeat Midas and reclaim herself.

188
0:10:22.244,000 --> 0:10:24,000
See, because that myth

189
0:10:24.549,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of having to go it alone and having to be tough ...

190
0:10:29.543,000 --> 0:10:3,000
doesn't serve us.

191
0:10:31.904,000 --> 0:10:33,000
America Chavez is a whole superhero,

192
0:10:34.502,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and she still needed a team of support to help her find herself.

193
0:10:40.538,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And she needed that gentleness,

194
0:10:43.475,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the type of gentleness that is rooted in compassion

195
0:10:46.992,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and still very much invested in justice and liberation.

196
0:10:53.279,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Because it's in that space where softness and vulnerability meet strength

197
0:11:00.742,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that we transcend our everyday selves,

198
0:11:03.719,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that we become something greater, something majestic,

199
0:11:07.751,000 --> 0:11:09,000
maybe even something super.

200
0:11:10.968,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Thank you.

201
0:11:12.143,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Applause)

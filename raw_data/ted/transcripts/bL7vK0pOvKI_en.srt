1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and one of the delights of ethnographic research

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is the opportunity to live amongst those

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who have not forgotten the old ways,

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
who still feel their past in the wind,

6
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
touch it in stones polished by rain,

7
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.

8
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,

9
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,

10
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
or that in the Himalaya,

11
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,

12
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,

13
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and that is the idea that the world in which we live

14
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
does not exist in some absolute sense,

15
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but is just one model of reality,

16
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices

17
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.

18
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.

19
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We're all born. We all bring our children into the world.

20
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We go through initiation rites.

21
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,

22
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,

23
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we all have art.

24
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song,

25
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the rhythm of the dance in every culture.

26
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,

27
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,

28
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,

29
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,

30
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara --

31
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with

32
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:,000
a month ago --

33
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,

34
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Everest, the goddess mother of the world.

35
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being,

36
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:09,000
other ways of thinking,

37
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.

38
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And this is an idea, if you think about it,

39
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
can only fill you with hope.

40
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now, together the myriad cultures of the world

41
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:22,000
make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life

42
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that envelops the planet,

43
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and is as important to the well-being of the planet

44
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.

45
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And you might think of this cultural web of life

46
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:33,000
as being an ethnosphere,

47
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and you might define the ethnosphere

48
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,

49
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being

50
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.

51
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.

52
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's the symbol of all that we are

53
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.

54
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,

55
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
so too is the ethnosphere

56
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
-- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.

57
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
No biologists, for example, would dare suggest

58
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are

59
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,

60
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario

61
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in the realm of biological diversity --

62
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario

63
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in the realm of cultural diversity.

64
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.

65
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
When each of you in this room were born,

66
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.

67
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary

68
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or a set of grammatical rules.

69
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
A language is a flash of the human spirit.

70
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture

71
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:39,000
comes into the material world.

72
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind,

73
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.

74
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey,

75
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:54,000
fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.

76
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They're no longer being taught to babies,

77
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
which means, effectively, unless something changes,

78
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:,000
they're already dead.

79
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,

80
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to be the last of your people to speak your language,

81
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors

82
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or anticipate the promise of the children?

83
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody

84
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,

85
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because every two weeks, some elder dies

86
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and carries with him into the grave the last syllables

87
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of an ancient tongue.

88
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better,

89
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:26,000
wouldn't the world be a better place

90
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
if we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great,

91
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:32,000
let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.

92
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Let's make it Kogi."

93
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like

94
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to be unable to speak your own language.

95
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And so, what I'd like to do with you today

96
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere,

97
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
a brief journey through the ethnosphere,

98
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.

99
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget

100
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that when I say "different ways of being,"

101
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I really do mean different ways of being.

102
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon,

103
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the people of the anaconda

104
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river

105
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.

106
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, this is a people who cognitively

107
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
do not distinguish the color blue from the color green

108
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because the canopy of the heavens

109
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is equated to the canopy of the forest

110
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
upon which the people depend.

111
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They have a curious language and marriage rule

112
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
which is called "linguistic exogamy:"

113
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
you must marry someone who speaks a different language.

114
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And this is all rooted in the mythological past,

115
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
yet the curious thing is in these long houses,

116
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
where there are six or seven languages spoken

117
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because of intermarriage,

118
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you never hear anyone practicing a language.

119
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They simply listen and then begin to speak.

120
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with,

121
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador,

122
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.

123
0:05:56,000 --> 0:06:,000
In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact

124
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and made a critical mistake.

125
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:02,000
They dropped from the air

126
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:04,000
8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves

127
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in what we would say to be friendly gestures,

128
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
forgetting that these people of the rainforest

129
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.

130
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor,

131
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,

132
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards

133
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.

134
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.

135
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They speared each other.

136
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:28,000
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.

137
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We traced genealogies back eight generations,

138
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and we found two instances of natural death

139
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and when we pressured the people a little bit about it,

140
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old

141
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter)

142
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge

143
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of the forest that was astonishing.

144
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces

145
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and tell you what species left it behind.

146
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment

147
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
when I was asked by my professor at Harvard

148
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
if I was interested in going down to Haiti,

149
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
infiltrating the secret societies

150
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength

151
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and Tonton Macoutes,

152
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and securing the poison used to make zombies.

153
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
In order to make sense out of sensation, of course,

154
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I had to understand something about this remarkable faith

155
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.

156
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.

157
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's interesting.

158
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world,

159
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:21,000
what would you say?

160
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.

161
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
There's always one continent left out,

162
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa

163
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did

164
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and Voodoo is simply the distillation

165
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
of these very profound religious ideas

166
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.

167
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But, what makes Voodoo so interesting

168
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is that it's this living relationship

169
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:42,000
between the living and the dead.

170
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So, the living give birth to the spirits.

171
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,

172
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:48,000
responding to the rhythm of the dance

173
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to momentarily displace the soul of the living,

174
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.

175
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
That's why the Voodooists like to say

176
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that "You white people go to church and speak about God.

177
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We dance in the temple and become God."

178
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit --

179
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:05,000
how can you be harmed?

180
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So you see these astonishing demonstrations:

181
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance

182
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
handling burning embers with impunity,

183
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind

184
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to affect the body that bears it

185
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.

186
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with,

187
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the most extraordinary are the Kogi

188
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.

189
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization

190
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,

191
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in the wake of the conquest,

192
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif

193
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.

194
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In a bloodstained continent,

195
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.

196
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood

197
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.

198
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The young acolytes are taken away from their families

199
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
at the age of three and four,

200
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness

201
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:

202
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:02,000
two nine-year periods

203
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation

204
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
they spend in their natural mother's womb;

205
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.

206
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And for this entire time,

207
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they are inculturated into the values of their society,

208
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
values that maintain the proposition that their prayers

209
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic --

210
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
or we might say the ecological -- balance.

211
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And at the end of this amazing initiation,

212
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
one day they're suddenly taken out

213
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,

214
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:33,000
they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness

215
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes

216
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:37,000
of the stunningly beautiful landscape,

217
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract

218
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back

219
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you.

220
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect."

221
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
They call themselves the "elder brothers"

222
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and they say we, who are the younger brothers,

223
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
are the ones responsible for destroying the world.

224
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.

225
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,

226
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
we either invoke Rousseau

227
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and the old canard of the "noble savage,"

228
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
which is an idea racist in its simplicity,

229
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau

230
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.

231
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental

232
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
nor weakened by nostalgia.

233
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
There's not a lot of room for either

234
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in the malarial swamps of the Asmat

235
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,

236
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:28,000
through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth

237
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,

238
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but on a far subtler intuition:

239
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the idea that the Earth itself can only exist

240
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.

241
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now, what does that mean?

242
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It means that a young kid from the Andes

243
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit

244
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that will direct his or her destiny

245
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
will be a profoundly different human being

246
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and have a different relationship to that resource

247
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
or that place than a young kid from Montana

248
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock

249
0:10:58,000 --> 0:10:59,000
ready to be mined.

250
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.

251
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship

252
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
between the individual and the natural world.

253
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia

254
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to believe those forests existed to be cut.

255
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
That made me a different human being

256
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth

257
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw

258
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and the Crooked Beak of Heaven

259
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,

260
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.

261
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Now, if you begin to look at the idea

262
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that these cultures could create different realities,

263
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:31,000
you could begin to understand

264
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:36,000
some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.

265
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.

266
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,

267
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the most powerful psychoactive preparation

268
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
of the shaman's repertoire.

269
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What makes ayahuasca fascinating

270
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,

271
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:

272
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
on the one hand, this woody liana

273
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,

274
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic --

275
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to take the vine alone

276
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke

277
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
drift across your consciousness --

278
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family

279
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
called Psychotria viridis.

280
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,

281
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:21,000
very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,

282
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:22,000
5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.

283
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
If you've ever seen the Yanomami

284
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
blowing that snuff up their noses,

285
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that substance they make from a different set of species

286
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:33,000
also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.

287
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
To have that powder blown up your nose

288
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel

289
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:46,000
lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter)

290
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It doesn't create the distortion of reality;

291
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:49,000
it creates the dissolution of reality.

292
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:52,000
In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes --

293
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era

294
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
with his discovery of the magic mushrooms

295
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
in Mexico in the 1930s --

296
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines

297
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:03,000
as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects

298
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:07,000
there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)

299
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally

300
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because they're denatured by an enzyme

301
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.

302
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction

303
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.

304
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Now, the fascinating things

305
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:26,000
are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana

306
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary

307
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.

308
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,

309
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:41,000
do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants

310
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that when combined in this way,

311
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
created a kind of biochemical version

312
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?

313
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error,"

314
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:5,000
which is exposed to be meaningless.

315
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us."

316
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Well, what does that mean?

317
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:59,000
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,

318
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,

319
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:07,000
all of which are referable to our eye as one species.

320
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy

321
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.

322
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No."

323
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties

324
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:2,000
in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.

325
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,

326
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:26,000
but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)

327
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Now --

328
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Applause) --

329
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
the problem -- the problem is that even those of us

330
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:34,000
sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people

331
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:35,000
view them as quaint and colorful

332
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
but somehow reduced to the margins of history

333
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.

334
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,

335
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:45,000
is not going to be remembered for its wars

336
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:46,000
or its technological innovations,

337
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but rather as the era in which we stood by

338
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and either actively endorsed or passively accepted

339
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity

340
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:57,000
on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.

341
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
All cultures through all time

342
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:02,000
have constantly been engaged in a dance

343
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:03,000
with new possibilities of life.

344
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And the problem is not technology itself.

345
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux

346
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:1,000
when they gave up the bow and arrow

347
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
any more than an American stopped being an American

348
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
when he gave up the horse and buggy.

349
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:15,000
It's not change or technology

350
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,

351
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
the crude face of domination.

352
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Wherever you look around the world,

353
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;

354
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
these are dynamic living peoples

355
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
being driven out of existence by identifiable forces

356
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:33,000
that are beyond their capacity to adapt to:

357
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
whether it's the egregious deforestation

358
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
in the homeland of the Penan --

359
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak --

360
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:45,000
a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,

361
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution

362
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
on the banks of the rivers,

363
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:54,000
where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt

364
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away

365
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:57,000
to the South China Sea,

366
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon

367
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:03,000
ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest --

368
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:04,000
or, in the case of the Yanomami,

369
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:06,000
it's the disease entities that have come in,

370
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:08,000
in the wake of the discovery of gold.

371
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet,

372
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:12,000
where I'm doing a lot of research recently,

373
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:16,000
you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.

374
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people

375
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
is universally condemned, but ethnocide,

376
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:24,000
the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,

377
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:27,000
it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated

378
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:29,000
as part of a development strategy.

379
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet

380
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
until you move through it at the ground level.

381
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China

382
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:41,000
overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa

383
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:45,000
with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa

384
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
that I understood the face behind the statistics

385
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:49,000
you hear about:

386
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:53,000
6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,

387
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:56,000
1.2 million people killed by the cadres

388
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:57,000
during the Cultural Revolution.

389
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.

390
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
That meant he was instantly killed

391
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
at the time of the Chinese invasion.

392
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora

393
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that took the people to Nepal.

394
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:11,000
His mother was incarcerated

395
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:13,000
for the crime of being wealthy.

396
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two

397
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
to hide beneath her skirt tails

398
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:2,000
because she couldn't bear to be without him.

399
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:22,000
The sister who had done that brave deed

400
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:23,000
was put into an education camp.

401
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:25,000
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband

402
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
of Mao, and for that transgression,

403
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:31,000
she was given seven years of hard labor.

404
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:34,000
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,

405
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:37,000
but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.

406
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice:

407
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:44,000
do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony

408
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:47,000
or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?

409
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,

410
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards

411
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:55,000
this blandly amorphous generic world view

412
0:17:55,000 --> 0:18:,000
not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination

413
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:04,000
reduced to a more narrow modality of thought,

414
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:05,000
but that we would wake from a dream one day

415
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:08,000
having forgotten there were even other possibilities.

416
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps,

417
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:14,000
been around for [150,000] years.

418
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:17,000
The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture,

419
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:19,000
at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;

420
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:21,000
the poetry of the shaman was displaced

421
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:22,000
by the prose of the priesthood;

422
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:25,000
we created hierarchy specialization surplus --

423
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:27,000
is only 10,000 years ago.

424
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:29,000
The modern industrial world as we know it

425
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:31,000
is barely 300 years old.

426
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me

427
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
that we have all the answers for all of the challenges

428
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:38,000
that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.

429
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:4,000
When these myriad cultures of the world

430
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:43,000
are asked the meaning of being human,

431
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:45,000
they respond with 10,000 different voices.

432
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility

433
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:54,000
of being what we are: a fully conscious species,

434
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:57,000
fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens

435
0:18:57,000 --> 0:19:03,000
find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.

436
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:06,000
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island

437
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:08,000
when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,

438
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:12,000
and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.

439
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:15,000
The Canadian government has not always been kind

440
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:17,000
to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,

441
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:2,000
to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.

442
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:24,000
This old man's grandfather refused to go.

443
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:28,000
The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,

444
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:29,000
all of his tools.

445
0:19:3,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;

446
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:33,000
they took advantage of it.

447
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish

448
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:37,000
wrapped in caribou hide.

449
0:19:37,000 --> 0:19:42,000
So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night

450
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:44,000
or the blizzard that was blowing.

451
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:47,000
He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers

452
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,

453
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:54,000
he shaped it into the form of a blade.

454
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:56,000
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife

455
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:59,000
and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.

456
0:19:59,000 --> 0:20:02,000
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness,

457
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:05,000
took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,

458
0:20:06,000 --> 0:20:07,000
harnessed up an adjacent dog,

459
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:11,000
and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.

460
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Talk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)

461
0:20:15,000 --> 0:20:16,000
And this, in many ways --

462
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
(Applause) --

463
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:2,000
is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people

464
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:23,000
and of all indigenous people around the world.

465
0:20:23,000 --> 0:20:25,000
The Canadian government in April of 1999

466
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:28,000
gave back to total control of the Inuit

467
0:20:28,000 --> 0:20:31,000
an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.

468
0:20:31,000 --> 0:20:33,000
It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.

469
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:37,000
It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.

470
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:39,000
An amazing example of how a nation-state

471
0:20:39,000 --> 0:20:43,000
can seek restitution with its people.

472
0:20:44,000 --> 0:20:47,000
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious

473
0:20:47,000 --> 0:20:48,000
at least to all of all us who've traveled

474
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:5,000
in these remote reaches of the planet,

475
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:53,000
to realize that they're not remote at all.

476
0:20:53,000 --> 0:20:55,000
They're homelands of somebody.

477
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:57,000
They represent branches of the human imagination

478
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:01,000
that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,

479
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:04,000
the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,

480
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:07,000
become part of the naked geography of hope.

481
0:21:07,000 --> 0:21:11,000
So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally,

482
0:21:11,000 --> 0:21:15,000
is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.

483
0:21:15,000 --> 0:21:16,000
We think that polemics --

484
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:18,000
(Applause) --

485
0:21:18,000 --> 0:21:2,000
we think that polemics are not persuasive,

486
0:21:2,000 --> 0:21:23,000
but we think that storytelling can change the world,

487
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:26,000
and so we are probably the best storytelling institution

488
0:21:26,000 --> 0:21:29,000
in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.

489
0:21:29,000 --> 0:21:32,000
156 nations carry our television channel.

490
0:21:33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
Our magazines are read by millions.

491
0:21:35,000 --> 0:21:38,000
And what we're doing is a series of journeys

492
0:21:38,000 --> 0:21:4,000
to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience

493
0:21:4,000 --> 0:21:42,000
to places of such cultural wonder

494
0:21:43,000 --> 0:21:45,000
that they cannot help but come away dazzled

495
0:21:45,000 --> 0:21:47,000
by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,

496
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:5,000
embrace gradually, one by one,

497
0:21:5,000 --> 0:21:52,000
the central revelation of anthropology:

498
0:21:52,000 --> 0:21:56,000
that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,

499
0:21:56,000 --> 0:21:57,000
that we can find a way to live

1
0:00:12.842,000 --> 0:00:13,000
She wrote:

2
0:00:14.454,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"When I become famous, I will tell everyone

3
0:00:17.025,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that I know a hero named Marlon Peterson."

4
0:00:20.058,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Heroes rarely look like me.

5
0:00:22.429,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In fact,

6
0:00:23.878,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm what garbage looks like.

7
0:00:26.162,000 --> 0:00:28,000
No, not the most appealing way to open a talk

8
0:00:28.99,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or start a conversation,

9
0:00:30.711,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and perhaps you have some questions going through your head about that.

10
0:00:34.208,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Why would this man say such a thing about himself?

11
0:00:36.606,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What does he mean?

12
0:00:38.103,000 --> 0:00:42,000
How can someone view him as a hero when he sees himself as garbage?

13
0:00:43.073,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I believe we learn more from questions than we do from answers.

14
0:00:46.18,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Because when we're questioning something,

15
0:00:48.487,000 --> 0:00:51,000
we're invested in taking in some sort of new information,

16
0:00:51.845,000 --> 0:00:55,000
or grappling with some sort of ignorance that makes us feel uncomfortable.

17
0:00:56.106,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And that's why I'm here:

18
0:00:57.836,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to push us to question,

19
0:00:59.395,000 --> 0:01:01,000
even when it makes us uncomfortable.

20
0:01:02.089,000 --> 0:01:04,000
My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago,

21
0:01:05.056,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the southernmost island in the Caribbean.

22
0:01:07.293,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Trinidad is also home to the only acoustic instrument

23
0:01:10.295,000 --> 0:01:11,000
invented in the 20th century:

24
0:01:12.189,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the steel pan.

25
0:01:14.138,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Deriving from the African drums

26
0:01:16.555,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and evolving from the genius of one of the ghettos in Trinidad,

27
0:01:19.856,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a city called Laventille,

28
0:01:21.566,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and the disregard of the American military ...

29
0:01:25.357,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Well, I should tell you,

30
0:01:26.677,000 --> 0:01:29,000
America, during WWII, had military bases set up in Trinidad,

31
0:01:30.068,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and when the war ended,

32
0:01:31.513,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they left the island littered with empty oil drums --

33
0:01:35.073,000 --> 0:01:36,000
their trash.

34
0:01:36.767,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So people from Laventille repurposed the old drums left behind

35
0:01:41.075,000 --> 0:01:43,000
into the full chromatic scale:

36
0:01:43.302,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the steel pan.

37
0:01:44.907,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Playing music now from Beethoven to Bob Marley to 50 Cent,

38
0:01:49.315,000 --> 0:01:53,000
those people literally made music out of garbage.

39
0:01:54.574,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Twelve days before my 20th birthday,

40
0:01:57.097,000 --> 0:02:,000
I was arrested for my role in a violent robbery attempt

41
0:02:00.992,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in lower Manhattan.

42
0:02:02.821,000 --> 0:02:04,000
While people were sitting in a coffee shop,

43
0:02:06.172,000 --> 0:02:07,000
four people were shot.

44
0:02:09.192,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Two were killed.

45
0:02:11.504,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Five of us were arrested.

46
0:02:14.033,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We were all the products of Trinidad and Tobago.

47
0:02:16.695,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We were the "bad immigrants,"

48
0:02:18.628,000 --> 0:02:22,000
or the "anchor babies" that Trump and millions of Americans easily malign.

49
0:02:23.715,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I was discarded, like waste material --

50
0:02:26.805,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and justifiably so to many.

51
0:02:29.033,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I eventually served 10 years, two months and seven days of a prison sentence.

52
0:02:34.025,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I was sentenced to a decade of punishment in a correctional institution.

53
0:02:39.786,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I was sentenced to irrelevance --

54
0:02:42.354,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the opposite of humanity.

55
0:02:45.069,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Interestingly,

56
0:02:46.654,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it was during those years in prison that a series of letters redeemed me,

57
0:02:51.701,000 --> 0:02:53,000
helped me move beyond the darkness and the guilt

58
0:02:54.564,000 --> 0:02:56,000
associated with the worst moment of my young life.

59
0:02:58.025,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It gave me a sense that I was useful.

60
0:03:00.758,000 --> 0:03:01,000
She was 13 years old.

61
0:03:03.156,000 --> 0:03:05,000
She had wrote that she saw me as a hero.

62
0:03:06.318,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I remember reading that,

63
0:03:07.73,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and I remember crying when I read those words.

64
0:03:11.234,000 --> 0:03:13,000
She was one of over 50 students

65
0:03:13.702,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and 150 letters that I wrote during a mentoring correspondence program

66
0:03:17.776,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that I co-designed with a friend

67
0:03:19.41,000 --> 0:03:21,000
who was a teacher at a middle school in Brooklyn,

68
0:03:21.764,000 --> 0:03:22,000
my hometown.

69
0:03:22.944,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We called it the Young Scholars Program.

70
0:03:25.693,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Every time those young people shared their stories with me,

71
0:03:29.439,000 --> 0:03:3,000
their struggles,

72
0:03:31.07,000 --> 0:03:34,000
every time they drew a picture of their favorite cartoon character

73
0:03:34.867,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and sent it to me,

74
0:03:36.326,000 --> 0:03:4,000
every time they said they depended on my letters or my words of advice,

75
0:03:40.72,000 --> 0:03:41,000
it boosted my sense of worthiness.

76
0:03:43.661,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It gave me a sense of what I could contribute to this planet.

77
0:03:47.328,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It transformed my life.

78
0:03:49.368,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Because of those letters and what they shared with me,

79
0:03:52.29,000 --> 0:03:53,000
their stories of teen life,

80
0:03:54.179,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they gave me the permission,

81
0:03:56.273,000 --> 0:03:58,000
they gave me the courage to admit to myself

82
0:03:58.713,000 --> 0:04:,000
that there were reasons -- not excuses --

83
0:04:01.54,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but that there were reasons for that fateful day in October of 1999;

84
0:04:06.617,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that the trauma associated with living in a community

85
0:04:09.283,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where guns are easier to get than sneakers;

86
0:04:12.612,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that the trauma associated with being raped at gunpoint at the age of 14;

87
0:04:19.427,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that those are reasons for me

88
0:04:22.148,000 --> 0:04:23,000
why making that decision,

89
0:04:23.962,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that fatal decision,

90
0:04:25.151,000 --> 0:04:26,000
was not an unlikely proposition.

91
0:04:28.012,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Because those letters mattered so much to me,

92
0:04:30.743,000 --> 0:04:31,000
because writing and receiving

93
0:04:32.175,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and having that communication with those folks

94
0:04:34.456,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so hugely impacted my life,

95
0:04:35.979,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I decided to share the opportunity with some friends of mine

96
0:04:38.885,000 --> 0:04:39,000
who were also inside with me.

97
0:04:40.305,000 --> 0:04:41,000
My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks,

98
0:04:42.286,000 --> 0:04:44,000
all in prison for violent crimes also,

99
0:04:44.534,000 --> 0:04:46,000
shared their words of wisdom with the young people as well,

100
0:04:47.362,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and received the sense of relevancy in return.

101
0:04:50.142,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We are now published writers and youth program innovators

102
0:04:53.352,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and trauma experts

103
0:04:55.125,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and gun violence prevention advocates,

104
0:04:57.018,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and TED talkers and --

105
0:04:58.42,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:59.47,000 --> 0:05:,000
and good daddies.

107
0:05:00.948,000 --> 0:05:02,000
That's what I call a positive return of investment.

108
0:05:04.57,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Above all else,

109
0:05:05.744,000 --> 0:05:08,000
what building that program taught me was that when we sow,

110
0:05:09.671,000 --> 0:05:12,000
when we invest in the humanity of people no matter where they're at,

111
0:05:13.457,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we can reap amazing rewards.

112
0:05:16.811,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In this latest era of criminal justice reform,

113
0:05:19.17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I often question and wonder why --

114
0:05:22.812,000 --> 0:05:23,000
why is it that so many believe

115
0:05:24.369,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that only those who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses

116
0:05:27.859,000 --> 0:05:3,000
merit empathy and recognized humanity?

117
0:05:32.908,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Criminal justice reform is human justice.

118
0:05:35.813,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Am I not human?

119
0:05:38.7,000 --> 0:05:42,000
When we invest in resources that amplify the relevancy of people

120
0:05:43.202,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in communities like Laventille

121
0:05:44.696,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you,

122
0:05:46.869,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we can literally create the communities that we want.

123
0:05:50.044,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We can do better.

124
0:05:51.447,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We can do better than investing solely in law enforcement as a resource,

125
0:05:55.059,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because they don't give us a sense of relevancy

126
0:05:57.98,000 --> 0:06:,000
that is at the core of why so many of us do so many harmful things

127
0:06:01.554,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in the pursuit of mattering.

128
0:06:05.176,000 --> 0:06:09,000
See, gun violence is just a visible display of a lot of underlying traumas.

129
0:06:10.263,000 --> 0:06:13,000
When we invest in the redemptive value of relevancy,

130
0:06:13.319,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we can render a return of both personal responsibility and healing.

131
0:06:18.124,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That's the people work I care about,

132
0:06:20.392,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because people work.

133
0:06:23.133,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Family, I'm asking you to do the hard work,

134
0:06:27.085,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the difficult work,

135
0:06:28.557,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the churning work of bestowing undeserved kindness

136
0:06:31.516,000 --> 0:06:33,000
upon those who we can relegate as garbage,

137
0:06:33.987,000 --> 0:06:35,000
who we can disregard and discard easily.

138
0:06:36.843,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I'm asking myself.

139
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Over the past two months,

140
0:06:41.274,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I've lost two friends to gun violence,

141
0:06:43.961,000 --> 0:06:44,000
both innocent bystanders.

142
0:06:46.748,000 --> 0:06:49,000
One was caught in a drive-by while walking home.

143
0:06:50.92,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The other was sitting in a café while eating breakfast,

144
0:06:54.057,000 --> 0:06:55,000
while on vacation in Miami.

145
0:06:57.595,000 --> 0:07:,000
I'm asking myself to see the redemptive value of relevancy

146
0:07:00.937,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in the people that murdered them,

147
0:07:03.519,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because of the hard work of seeing the value in me.

148
0:07:06.671,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'm pushing us to challenge our own capacity

149
0:07:10.829,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to fully experience our humanity,

150
0:07:13.218,000 --> 0:07:14,000
by understanding the full biography

151
0:07:15.231,000 --> 0:07:18,000
of people who we can easily choose not to see,

152
0:07:19.728,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because heroes are waiting to be recognized,

153
0:07:22.969,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and music is waiting to be made.

154
0:07:25.656,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Thank you.

155
0:07:26.948,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Applause)

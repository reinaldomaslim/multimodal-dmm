1
0:00:13.359,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Our ability to create and sustain economic growth

2
0:00:18.48,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is the defining challenge of our time.

3
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Of course there are other challenges --

4
0:00:23.8,000 --> 0:00:26,000
health care, disease burdens and pandemics,

5
0:00:26.96,000 --> 0:00:27,000
environmental challenges

6
0:00:29.4,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and, of course, radicalized terrorism.

7
0:00:32.8,000 --> 0:00:33,000
However,

8
0:00:34.04,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge,

9
0:00:38.64,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it will take us a long way

10
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.

11
0:00:43.4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
More importantly,

12
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:49,000
unless and until we solve economic growth

13
0:00:49.6,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and create sustainable, long-term economic growth,

14
0:00:53.64,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we'll be unable to address

15
0:00:56.08,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today,

16
0:01:01.44,000 --> 0:01:05,000
whether it's health care, education or economic development.

17
0:01:06.68,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The fundamental question is this:

18
0:01:09.52,000 --> 0:01:11,000
How are we going to create economic growth

19
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe

20
0:01:16.76,000 --> 0:01:18,000
at a time when they continue to struggle

21
0:01:18.84,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to create economic growth after the financial crisis?

22
0:01:22.48,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They continue to underperform

23
0:01:25.28,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth:

24
0:01:30.04,000 --> 0:01:33,000
capital, labor and productivity.

25
0:01:34.12,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In particular,

26
0:01:35.6,000 --> 0:01:39,000
these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits,

27
0:01:40.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor

28
0:01:45.44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and they also see productivity stalling.

29
0:01:48.6,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In a similar vein,

30
0:01:50.32,000 --> 0:01:53,000
how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets,

31
0:01:53.76,000 --> 0:01:56,000
where 90 percent of the world's population lives

32
0:01:57.04,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and where, on average,

33
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:01,000
70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?

34
0:02:02.64,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In these countries,

35
0:02:04.12,000 --> 0:02:08,000
it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year

36
0:02:08.32,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in order to put a dent in poverty

37
0:02:10.44,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and to double per capita incomes in one generation.

38
0:02:14.52,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And yet today,

39
0:02:16.6,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the largest emerging economies --

40
0:02:18.72,000 --> 0:02:2,000
countries with at least 50 million people --

41
0:02:21.44,000 --> 0:02:24,000
continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.

42
0:02:25.76,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Worse than that,

43
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China

44
0:02:31.64,000 --> 0:02:33,000
are falling below that seven percent number

45
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and, in many cases, actually regressing.

46
0:02:37.8,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Economic growth matters.

47
0:02:40.44,000 --> 0:02:41,000
With economic growth,

48
0:02:41.92,000 --> 0:02:45,000
countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle

49
0:02:46.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.

50
0:02:51.24,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Without growth, countries contract and atrophy,

51
0:02:55.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
not just in the annals of economic statistics

52
0:02:58.32,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.

53
0:03:02.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual.

54
0:03:07.12,000 --> 0:03:08,000
If growth wanes,

55
0:03:08.76,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the risk to human progress

56
0:03:10.8,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the risk of political and social instability rises,

57
0:03:15.24,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.

58
0:03:20.6,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The context matters.

59
0:03:22.32,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And countries in emerging markets

60
0:03:23.96,000 --> 0:03:26,000
do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.

61
0:03:29.24,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.

62
0:03:34.68,000 --> 0:03:35,000
There are some people here

63
0:03:36.56,000 --> 0:03:38,000
who will turn around and be quite disillusioned

64
0:03:39.12,000 --> 0:03:4,000
by what's happened around the world

65
0:03:40.92,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and basically ascribe that to economic growth.

66
0:03:44.24,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You worry about the overpopulation of the planet.

67
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections

68
0:03:50.68,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet

69
0:03:53.4,000 --> 0:03:55,000
before it plateaus in 2100,

70
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you're concerned about what that does to natural resources --

71
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
arable land, potable water, energy and minerals.

72
0:04:04.8,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.

73
0:04:08.76,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And you worry about how man,

74
0:04:11.92,000 --> 0:04:13,000
embodied in the corporate globalist,

75
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
has become greedy and corrupt.

76
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth

77
0:04:21.96,000 --> 0:04:24,000
has been the backbone of changes in living standards

78
0:04:25.36,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of millions of people around the world.

79
0:04:27.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And more importantly,

80
0:04:29.8,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.

81
0:04:36.28,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The definition of capitalism, very simply put,

82
0:04:39.76,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is that the factors of production,

83
0:04:41.84,000 --> 0:04:44,000
such as trade and industry, capital and labor,

84
0:04:45.24,000 --> 0:04:48,000
are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.

85
0:04:49.68,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's really essential here that we understand

86
0:04:52.44,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se

87
0:04:57.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but what has happened to capitalism.

88
0:04:59.56,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term,

89
0:05:03.6,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.

90
0:05:09.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Economic growth needs capitalism,

91
0:05:12.24,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but it needs it to work properly.

92
0:05:14.84,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And as I mentioned a moment ago,

93
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.

94
0:05:23.72,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy.

95
0:05:27.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.

96
0:05:31.12,000 --> 0:05:33,000
When in practical experience,

97
0:05:33.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
capitalism is much more of a spectrum.

98
0:05:36.28,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And we have countries such as China,

99
0:05:38.56,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which have practiced more state capitalism,

100
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and we have countries like the Unites States

101
0:05:43.12,000 --> 0:05:44,000
which are more market capitalist.

102
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however,

103
0:05:48.32,000 --> 0:05:51,000
have tended to focus on countries like China

104
0:05:51.56,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.

105
0:05:55.6,000 --> 0:05:58,000
However, there is a real reason and real concern

106
0:05:59.28,000 --> 0:06:03,000
for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism,

107
0:06:03.96,000 --> 0:06:05,000
particularly those embodied by the United States.

108
0:06:07.28,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is really important

109
0:06:09.08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because this type of capitalism

110
0:06:11.56,000 --> 0:06:14,000
has increasingly been afforded the critique

111
0:06:14.84,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that it is now fostering corruption

112
0:06:17.28,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and, worse still,

113
0:06:18.68,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it's increasing income inequality --

114
0:06:22.12,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.

115
0:06:28.76,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The two really critical questions that we need to address

116
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is how can we fix capitalism

117
0:06:34.72,000 --> 0:06:36,000
so that it can help create economic growth

118
0:06:37.52,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but at the same time can help to address social ills.

119
0:06:41.72,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves,

120
0:06:45.12,000 --> 0:06:46,000
how does capitalism work today?

121
0:06:47.76,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Very simplistically,

122
0:06:49.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer --

123
0:06:55.76,000 --> 0:06:59,000
a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.

124
0:07:00.08,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And only after they've maximized their utility

125
0:07:03.24,000 --> 0:07:05,000
do they then decide it's important

126
0:07:05.76,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to provide support to other social contracts.

127
0:07:09.36,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Of course, in this system governments do tax,

128
0:07:12.8,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs,

129
0:07:16.56,000 --> 0:07:18,000
recognizing that government's role is not just regulation

130
0:07:19.44,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but also to be arbiter of social goods.

131
0:07:23.32,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But nevertheless,

132
0:07:24.64,000 --> 0:07:25,000
this framework --

133
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
this two-stage framework --

134
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is the basis from which we must now start

135
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.

136
0:07:33.52,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.

137
0:07:37.52,000 --> 0:07:38,000
First of all,

138
0:07:38.76,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we can draw on the right-wing policies

139
0:07:41.72,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to see what could be beneficial for us

140
0:07:43.6,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to think about how we can improve capitalism.

141
0:07:46.44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In particular,

142
0:07:47.72,000 --> 0:07:48,000
right-leaning policies

143
0:07:49.48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers,

144
0:07:52.96,000 --> 0:07:55,000
where we pay and reward people for doing the things

145
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that we actually think can help enhance economic growth.

146
0:07:59.48,000 --> 0:08:,000
For example,

147
0:08:00.72,000 --> 0:08:01,000
sending children to school,

148
0:08:02.36,000 --> 0:08:04,000
parents could earn money for that,

149
0:08:04.6,000 --> 0:08:07,000
or getting their children inoculated or immunized,

150
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
parents could get paid for doing that.

151
0:08:10.36,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Now, quite apart from the debate

152
0:08:12.48,000 --> 0:08:14,000
on whether or not we should be paying people

153
0:08:14.8,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to do what we think they should do anyway,

154
0:08:17.52,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the fact of the matter is that pay for performance

155
0:08:20.72,000 --> 0:08:22,000
has actually yielded some positive results

156
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in places like Mexico,

157
0:08:24.88,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in Brazil

158
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and also in pilot programs in New York.

159
0:08:29.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But there are also benefits

160
0:08:31.04,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies.

161
0:08:35.88,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility

162
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
so that it's not so narrowly defined

163
0:08:42.4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and that government should be much more of an arbiter

164
0:08:44.919,000 --> 0:08:45,000
of the factors of production

165
0:08:46.32,000 --> 0:08:48,000
have become commonplace with the success of China.

166
0:08:49.4,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But also we've started to have debates

167
0:08:51.72,000 --> 0:08:53,000
about how the role of the private sector

168
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
should move away from just being a profit motive

169
0:08:56.6,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs.

170
0:09:00.12,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Things like the corporate social responsibility programs,

171
0:09:03.36,000 --> 0:09:04,000
albeit small in scale,

172
0:09:05.36,000 --> 0:09:06,000
are moving in that right direction.

173
0:09:07.96,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines

174
0:09:13.2,000 --> 0:09:15,000
between government, NGOs and private sector.

175
0:09:16.8,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States,

176
0:09:20.8,000 --> 0:09:21,000
when the infrastructure rollout

177
0:09:22.44,000 --> 0:09:25,000
was really about public-private partnerships.

178
0:09:25.56,000 --> 0:09:26,000
More recently, of course,

179
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world

180
0:09:30.64,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.

181
0:09:36.24,000 --> 0:09:39,000
My fundamental message to you is this:

182
0:09:39.32,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges

183
0:09:44.76,000 --> 0:09:48,000
by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological.

184
0:09:49.8,000 --> 0:09:52,000
In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth

185
0:09:53.64,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today,

186
0:09:57.96,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we're going to have to be more broad-minded

187
0:10:00.28,000 --> 0:10:01,000
about what might work.

188
0:10:02.28,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Ultimately,

189
0:10:03.88,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.

190
0:10:08.04,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Thank you.

191
0:10:09.28,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Applause)

192
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa,

193
0:10:18.08,000 --> 0:10:2,000
because one could react to your last sentence

194
0:10:20.24,000 --> 0:10:21,000
by saying growth is also an ideology,

195
0:10:22.08,000 --> 0:10:24,000
it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times.

196
0:10:24.44,000 --> 0:10:26,000
What do you say to those who react that way?

197
0:10:26.56,000 --> 0:10:28,000
DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate,

198
0:10:29.04,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and I think that we're already having that discussion.

199
0:10:31.64,000 --> 0:10:33,000
There's a lot of work going on around happiness

200
0:10:33.88,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and other metrics being used for measuring people's success

201
0:10:37.4,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and improvements in living standards.

202
0:10:39.24,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And so I think that we should be open

203
0:10:41.32,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards

204
0:10:44.32,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and continue to reduce poverty around the world.

205
0:10:46.6,000 --> 0:10:48,000
BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth,

206
0:10:49.44,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but the only way for that happen

207
0:10:51.04,000 --> 0:10:53,000
without compromising the capacity of the earth,

208
0:10:53.4,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to take us on a long journey,

209
0:10:54.96,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is for economic growth

210
0:10:56.64,000 --> 0:10:58,000
somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources.

211
0:10:59.36,000 --> 0:11:,000
Do you see that happening?

212
0:11:00.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity.

213
0:11:05.24,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I think if we start to constrain ourselves

214
0:11:07.44,000 --> 0:11:1,000
using the finite, scarce and depleting resources

215
0:11:10.52,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that we know today,

216
0:11:11.8,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we could get quite negative

217
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and quite concerned about the way the world is.

218
0:11:15.4,000 --> 0:11:17,000
However, we've seen the Club of Rome,

219
0:11:17.72,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we've seen previous claims

220
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that the world would be running out of resources,

221
0:11:22.52,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and it's not to argue that those things are not valid.

222
0:11:25.12,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination,

223
0:11:27.8,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I think we could reinvest in energy,

224
0:11:29.76,000 --> 0:11:31,000
so that we can actually get better outcomes.

225
0:11:31.92,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And so in that sense,

226
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.

227
0:11:35.56,000 --> 0:11:36,000
BG: The thing that strikes me

228
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
about your proposals for rehabilitating growth

229
0:11:40.4,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and taking a different direction

230
0:11:42.04,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism --

231
0:11:47.12,000 --> 0:11:5,000
with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive

232
0:11:50.76,000 --> 0:11:54,000
or developing a bigger role for business in social issues.

233
0:11:54.96,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Is that what you're suggesting?

234
0:11:56.48,000 --> 0:11:58,000
DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded.

235
0:11:58.64,000 --> 0:12:,000
I think it is absolutely the case

236
0:12:00.88,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that traditional models of economic growth

237
0:12:03.36,000 --> 0:12:05,000
are not working the way we would like them to.

238
0:12:05.8,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I think it's no accident

239
0:12:07.72,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that today the largest economy in the world, the United States,

240
0:12:11.04,000 --> 0:12:12,000
has democracy,

241
0:12:12.36,000 --> 0:12:15,000
liberal democracy, as it's core political stance

242
0:12:15.48,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and it has free market capitalism --

243
0:12:17.68,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to the extent that it is free --

244
0:12:19.28,000 --> 0:12:21,000
free market capitalism as its economic stance.

245
0:12:21.48,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The second largest economy is China.

246
0:12:23.64,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It has deprioritized democracy

247
0:12:25.8,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model.

248
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
These two countries, completely different political models

249
0:12:31.76,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and completely different economic models,

250
0:12:33.76,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and yet they have the same income inequality number

251
0:12:36.2,000 --> 0:12:37,000
measured as a Gini coefficient.

252
0:12:37.72,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I think those are the debates we should have,

253
0:12:39.88,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because it's not clear at all

254
0:12:42.04,000 --> 0:12:43,000
what model we should be adopting,

255
0:12:43.88,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and I think there needs to be much more discourse

256
0:12:46.24,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know.

257
0:12:49.68,000 --> 0:12:52,000
BG: One last question. The COP21 is going on in Paris.

258
0:12:53.08,000 --> 0:12:54,000
If you could send a tweet

259
0:12:54.6,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there,

260
0:12:57.92,000 --> 0:12:58,000
what would you say?

261
0:12:59.32,000 --> 0:13:01,000
DM: Again, I would be very much about being open-minded.

262
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:03,000
As you're aware,

263
0:13:03.24,000 --> 0:13:05,000
the issues around the environmental concerns

264
0:13:05.36,000 --> 0:13:06,000
have been on the agenda many times now --

265
0:13:07.36,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm --

266
0:13:09.64,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and we keep revisiting these issues

267
0:13:11.96,000 --> 0:13:14,000
partly because there is not a fundamental agreement,

268
0:13:15.56,000 --> 0:13:16,000
in fact there's a schism

269
0:13:16.84,000 --> 0:13:18,000
between what the developed countries believe and want

270
0:13:19.6,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and what emerging market countries want.

271
0:13:21.96,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth

272
0:13:25.2,000 --> 0:13:28,000
so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries.

273
0:13:28.64,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Developed countries recognize

274
0:13:30.8,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that they have a real, important responsibility

275
0:13:33.08,000 --> 0:13:35,000
not only just to manage their CO2 emissions

276
0:13:35.92,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world,

277
0:13:39.12,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but also as trendsetters in R&D.

278
0:13:40.92,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And so they have to come to the table as well.

279
0:13:43.2,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But in essence, it cannot be a situation

280
0:13:45.68,000 --> 0:13:49,000
where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets

281
0:13:49.84,000 --> 0:13:5,000
without developed countries themselves

282
0:13:51.72,000 --> 0:13:53,000
also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing

283
0:13:54.12,000 --> 0:13:56,000
both in demand and supply in developed markets.

284
0:13:56.92,000 --> 0:13:59,000
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED. DM: Thank you very much.

285
0:14:00.04,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Applause)

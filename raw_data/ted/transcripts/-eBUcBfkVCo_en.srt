1
0:00:15.952,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,

2
0:00:19.838,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and Mourners to and fro

3
0:00:22.24,000 --> 0:00:24,000
kept treading -- treading -- till [it seemed]

4
0:00:25.067,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that Sense was breaking through --

5
0:00:27.836,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And when they all were seated,

6
0:00:29.605,000 --> 0:00:3,000
a Service, like a Drum --

7
0:00:31.603,000 --> 0:00:34,000
kept beating -- beating -- till I [thought]

8
0:00:35.079,000 --> 0:00:36,000
my Mind was going numb --

9
0:00:37.831,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul

10
0:00:41.994,000 --> 0:00:44,000
with those same Boots of Lead, again,

11
0:00:45.053,000 --> 0:00:47,000
then Space -- began to toll,

12
0:00:48.07,000 --> 0:00:52,000
As [all] the Heavens were a Bell, and Being, [but] an Ear,

13
0:00:52.201,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I, and Silence, some strange Race,

14
0:00:55.284,000 --> 0:00:57,000
wrecked, solitary, here --

15
0:00:58.493,000 --> 0:01:01,000
[And] then a Plank in Reason, broke,

16
0:01:01.67,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I fell down and down --

17
0:01:05.011,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and hit a World, at every plunge,

18
0:01:07.686,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and Finished knowing -- then --"

19
0:01:12.198,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We know depression through metaphors.

20
0:01:15.68,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language,

21
0:01:19.389,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Goya in an image.

22
0:01:22.238,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states.

23
0:01:27.997,000 --> 0:01:3,000
As for me, I had always thought myself tough,

24
0:01:31.875,000 --> 0:01:32,000
one of the people who could survive

25
0:01:33.701,000 --> 0:01:35,000
if I'd been sent to a concentration camp.

26
0:01:36.614,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In 1991, I had a series of losses.

27
0:01:39.676,000 --> 0:01:4,000
My mother died,

28
0:01:41.198,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a relationship I'd been in ended,

29
0:01:43.324,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I moved back to the United States from some years abroad,

30
0:01:47.268,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I got through all of those experiences intact.

31
0:01:50.617,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But in 1994, three years later,

32
0:01:53.54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I found myself losing interest in almost everything.

33
0:01:58.059,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do,

34
0:02:01.959,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and I didn't know why.

35
0:02:03.987,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality.

36
0:02:09.127,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And it was vitality

37
0:02:10.595,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that seemed to seep away from me in that moment.

38
0:02:14.231,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Everything there was to do seemed like too much work.

39
0:02:18.597,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I would come home

40
0:02:20.058,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine,

41
0:02:23.41,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends,

42
0:02:25.974,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I would think,

43
0:02:27.187,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"What a lot of people that is to have to call back."

44
0:02:30.368,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Or I would decide I should have lunch,

45
0:02:32.954,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out

46
0:02:35.715,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and put it on a plate

47
0:02:37.501,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and cut it up and chew it and swallow it,

48
0:02:41.389,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross.

49
0:02:45.286,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression

50
0:02:49.443,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is that you know it's ridiculous.

51
0:02:51.801,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it.

52
0:02:54.768,000 --> 0:02:55,000
You know that most people manage

53
0:02:56.681,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to listen to their messages and eat lunch

54
0:02:58.995,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and organize themselves to take a shower

55
0:03:00.925,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and go out the front door

56
0:03:02.167,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and that it's not a big deal,

57
0:03:03.819,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and yet you are nonetheless in its grip

58
0:03:06.985,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and you are unable to figure out any way around it.

59
0:03:10.99,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And so I began to feel myself doing less

60
0:03:15.236,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and thinking less

61
0:03:17.546,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and feeling less.

62
0:03:19.829,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It was a kind of nullity.

63
0:03:22.049,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And then the anxiety set in.

64
0:03:24.567,000 --> 0:03:27,000
If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month,

65
0:03:28.283,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I would say, "As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it."

66
0:03:31.546,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But if you said to me,

67
0:03:32.816,000 --> 0:03:35,000
"You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,"

68
0:03:36.153,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I would rather slit my wrist than go through it.

69
0:03:38.496,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It was the feeling all the time

70
0:03:40.078,000 --> 0:03:42,000
like that feeling you have if you're walking

71
0:03:42.306,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you,

72
0:03:45.851,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but instead of lasting half a second, the way that does,

73
0:03:48.587,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it lasted for six months.

74
0:03:50.492,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's a sensation of being afraid all the time

75
0:03:53.445,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of.

76
0:03:57.057,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And it was at that point that I began to think

77
0:03:59.692,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that it was just too painful to be alive,

78
0:04:03.476,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and that the only reason not to kill oneself

79
0:04:06.06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
was so as not to hurt other people.

80
0:04:09.295,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And finally one day, I woke up

81
0:04:12.2,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,

82
0:04:14.421,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because I lay in bed completely frozen,

83
0:04:16.939,000 --> 0:04:17,000
looking at the telephone, thinking,

84
0:04:18.888,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"Something is wrong and I should call for help,"

85
0:04:22.451,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I couldn't reach out my arm

86
0:04:24.186,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and pick up the phone and dial.

87
0:04:26.801,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it,

88
0:04:30.876,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the phone rang,

89
0:04:32.164,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and somehow I managed to pick it up,

90
0:04:34.567,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and it was my father, and I said,

91
0:04:37.519,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something."

92
0:04:41.528,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The next day I started with the medications and the therapy.

93
0:04:47.352,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And I also started reckoning with this terrible question:

94
0:04:51.579,000 --> 0:04:53,000
If I'm not the tough person

95
0:04:53.707,000 --> 0:04:55,000
who could have made it through a concentration camp,

96
0:04:56.231,000 --> 0:04:57,000
then who am I?

97
0:04:57.743,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And if I have to take medication,

98
0:04:59.628,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is that medication making me more fully myself,

99
0:05:03.565,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or is it making me someone else?

100
0:05:05.807,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else?

101
0:05:10.101,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I had two advantages as I went into the fight.

102
0:05:13.585,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The first is that I knew that, objectively speaking,

103
0:05:16.28,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I had a nice life,

104
0:05:17.901,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and that if I could only get well,

105
0:05:19.786,000 --> 0:05:22,000
there was something at the other end that was worth living for.

106
0:05:23.01,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And the other was that I had access to good treatment.

107
0:05:26.343,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,

108
0:05:29.816,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and emerged and relapsed,

109
0:05:32.351,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and emerged and relapsed,

110
0:05:35.369,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and finally understood

111
0:05:37.333,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever.

112
0:05:41.769,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I thought,

113
0:05:42.96,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem?

114
0:05:45.77,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure?"

115
0:05:49.727,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I couldn't figure out which it was.

116
0:05:51.878,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And then I understood that actually,

117
0:05:54.002,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully.

118
0:05:58.013,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The chemical cure and the psychological cure

119
0:06:01.364,000 --> 0:06:02,000
both have a role to play,

120
0:06:03.062,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and I also figured out that depression was something

121
0:06:07.06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that was braided so deep into us

122
0:06:09.308,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that there was no separating it from our character and personality.

123
0:06:13.552,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling.

124
0:06:18.038,000 --> 0:06:19,000
They're not very effective.

125
0:06:19.958,000 --> 0:06:2,000
They're extremely costly.

126
0:06:21.752,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They come with innumerable side effects.

127
0:06:24.273,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They're a disaster.

128
0:06:26.027,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago,

129
0:06:30.718,000 --> 0:06:32,000
when there would have been almost nothing to be done.

130
0:06:33.662,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I hope that 50 years hence,

131
0:06:36.069,000 --> 0:06:38,000
people will hear about my treatments

132
0:06:38.115,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science.

133
0:06:42.885,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Depression is the flaw in love.

134
0:06:47.441,000 --> 0:06:5,000
If you were married to someone and thought,

135
0:06:50.582,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"Well, if my wife dies, I'll find another one,"

136
0:06:54.316,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it wouldn't be love as we know it.

137
0:06:57.364,000 --> 0:07:01,000
There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss,

138
0:07:01.955,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy.

139
0:07:08.204,000 --> 0:07:1,000
There are three things people tend to confuse:

140
0:07:11.059,000 --> 0:07:14,000
depression, grief and sadness.

141
0:07:14.966,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Grief is explicitly reactive.

142
0:07:18.329,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy,

143
0:07:21.234,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and then, six months later,

144
0:07:22.933,000 --> 0:07:25,000
you are still deeply sad, but you're functioning a little better,

145
0:07:26.042,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it's probably grief,

146
0:07:27.851,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure.

147
0:07:31.61,000 --> 0:07:33,000
If you experience a catastrophic loss,

148
0:07:34.439,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and you feel terrible,

149
0:07:35.765,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and six months later you can barely function at all,

150
0:07:38.578,000 --> 0:07:4,000
then it's probably a depression that was triggered

151
0:07:41.116,000 --> 0:07:43,000
by the catastrophic circumstances.

152
0:07:43.648,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The trajectory tells us a great deal.

153
0:07:47.196,000 --> 0:07:5,000
People think of depression as being just sadness.

154
0:07:50.58,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's much, much too much sadness,

155
0:07:52.775,000 --> 0:07:53,000
much too much grief

156
0:07:54.55,000 --> 0:07:56,000
at far too slight a cause.

157
0:07:57.47,000 --> 0:07:59,000
As I set out to understand depression,

158
0:08:00.279,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and to interview people who had experienced it,

159
0:08:02.95,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I found that there were people who seemed, on the surface,

160
0:08:06.767,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to have what sounded like relatively mild depression

161
0:08:10.004,000 --> 0:08:12,000
who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it.

162
0:08:13.297,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And there were other people who had what sounded

163
0:08:15.734,000 --> 0:08:18,000
as they described it like terribly severe depression

164
0:08:18.82,000 --> 0:08:19,000
who nonetheless had good lives

165
0:08:20.584,000 --> 0:08:22,000
in the interstices between their depressive episodes.

166
0:08:23.885,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people

167
0:08:27.874,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to be more resilient than other people.

168
0:08:30.127,000 --> 0:08:33,000
What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive?

169
0:08:33.652,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And I went out and I interviewed person after person

170
0:08:36.874,000 --> 0:08:37,000
who was suffering with depression.

171
0:08:38.874,000 --> 0:08:4,000
One of the first people I interviewed

172
0:08:41.089,000 --> 0:08:45,000
described depression as a slower way of being dead,

173
0:08:45.967,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and that was a good thing for me to hear early on

174
0:08:48.325,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead

175
0:08:51.456,000 --> 0:08:53,000
can lead to actual deadness,

176
0:08:53.76,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that this is a serious business.

177
0:08:55.741,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's the leading disability worldwide,

178
0:08:58.154,000 --> 0:09:,000
and people die of it every day.

179
0:09:01.184,000 --> 0:09:04,000
One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this

180
0:09:04.927,000 --> 0:09:07,000
was a beloved friend who I had known for many years,

181
0:09:08.812,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college,

182
0:09:13.289,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and then plummeted into a horrific depression.

183
0:09:16.115,000 --> 0:09:17,000
She had bipolar illness,

184
0:09:17.778,000 --> 0:09:19,000
or manic depression, as it was then known.

185
0:09:20.289,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And then she did very well for many years on lithium,

186
0:09:24.098,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and then eventually, she was taken off her lithium

187
0:09:27.271,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to see how she would do without it,

188
0:09:29.106,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and she had another psychosis,

189
0:09:31.081,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen

190
0:09:35.465,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in which she sat in her parents' apartment,

191
0:09:38.306,000 --> 0:09:41,000
more or less catatonic, essentially without moving,

192
0:09:41.602,000 --> 0:09:42,000
day after day after day.

193
0:09:43.943,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later --

194
0:09:47.451,000 --> 0:09:5,000
she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins --

195
0:09:50.576,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when I interviewed her, she said,

196
0:09:53.646,000 --> 0:09:56,000
"I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone,'

197
0:09:57.189,000 --> 0:09:59,000
over and over, to occupy my mind.

198
0:10:00.555,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying,

199
0:10:03.375,000 --> 0:10:07,000
which were, 'You are nothing. You are nobody.

200
0:10:08.159,000 --> 0:10:09,000
You don't even deserve to live.'

201
0:10:10.691,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And that was when I really started thinking

202
0:10:13.121,000 --> 0:10:14,000
about killing myself."

203
0:10:15.193,000 --> 0:10:18,000
You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil

204
0:10:19.127,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood.

205
0:10:23.001,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You think that the veil has been taken away,

206
0:10:26.015,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the veil of happiness,

207
0:10:27.643,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and that now you're seeing truly.

208
0:10:30.247,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive

209
0:10:33.031,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised,

210
0:10:37.029,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but it's difficult with depressives,

211
0:10:39.379,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because we believe we are seeing the truth.

212
0:10:43.04,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But the truth lies.

213
0:10:45.987,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I became obsessed with that sentence:

214
0:10:47.985,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"But the truth lies."

215
0:10:50.435,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And I discovered, as I talked to depressive people,

216
0:10:52.899,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that they have many delusional perceptions.

217
0:10:55.815,000 --> 0:10:56,000
People will say, "No one loves me."

218
0:10:57.577,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And you say, "I love you,

219
0:10:58.813,000 --> 0:11:,000
your wife loves you, your mother loves you."

220
0:11:01.335,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people.

221
0:11:05.124,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But people who are depressed will also say,

222
0:11:07.314,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end."

223
0:11:11.385,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Or they'll say, "There can be no true communion

224
0:11:13.638,000 --> 0:11:14,000
between two human beings.

225
0:11:15.024,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Each of us is trapped in his own body."

226
0:11:17.805,000 --> 0:11:18,000
To which you have to say,

227
0:11:19.449,000 --> 0:11:2,000
"That's true,

228
0:11:20.952,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast."

229
0:11:24.484,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:26.669,000 --> 0:11:27,000
A lot of the time,

231
0:11:28.338,000 --> 0:11:3,000
what they are expressing is not illness, but insight,

232
0:11:31.336,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and one comes to think what's really extraordinary

233
0:11:33.891,000 --> 0:11:36,000
is that most of us know about those existential questions

234
0:11:37.047,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and they don't distract us very much.

235
0:11:39.428,000 --> 0:11:4,000
There was a study I particularly liked

236
0:11:41.274,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people

237
0:11:45.041,000 --> 0:11:47,000
were asked to play a video game for an hour,

238
0:11:47.789,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and at the end of the hour,

239
0:11:49.433,000 --> 0:11:52,000
they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed.

240
0:11:53.067,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent,

241
0:11:57.076,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and the non-depressed people

242
0:11:58.671,000 --> 0:12:02,000
guessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters --

243
0:12:03.149,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Laughter)

244
0:12:04.324,000 --> 0:12:05,000
as they had actually killed.

245
0:12:07.945,000 --> 0:12:1,000
A lot of people said, when I chose to write about my depression,

246
0:12:11.185,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet,

247
0:12:14.674,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to have people know.

248
0:12:16.007,000 --> 0:12:18,000
They said, "Do people talk to you differently?"

249
0:12:18.3,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I said, "Yes, people talk to me differently.

250
0:12:20.403,000 --> 0:12:21,000
They talk to me differently insofar

251
0:12:22.189,000 --> 0:12:24,000
as they start telling me about their experience,

252
0:12:24.88,000 --> 0:12:25,000
or their sister's experience,

253
0:12:26.715,000 --> 0:12:27,000
or their friend's experience.

254
0:12:28.729,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Things are different because now I know

255
0:12:30.951,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that depression is the family secret that everyone has.

256
0:12:35.715,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I went a few years ago to a conference,

257
0:12:39.365,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and on Friday of the three-day conference,

258
0:12:41.82,000 --> 0:12:44,000
one of the participants took me aside, and she said,

259
0:12:44.849,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it,

260
0:12:51.122,000 --> 0:12:52,000
but I've been taking this medication,

261
0:12:52.988,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and I just wanted to ask you what you think?"

262
0:12:56.126,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could.

263
0:12:58.77,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And then she said, "You know, my husband would never understand this.

264
0:13:03.281,000 --> 0:13:06,000
He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense,

265
0:13:06.573,000 --> 0:13:08,000
so, you know, it's just between us."

266
0:13:08.721,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And I said, "Yes, that's fine."

267
0:13:10.733,000 --> 0:13:11,000
On Sunday of the same conference,

268
0:13:12.616,000 --> 0:13:13,000
her husband took me aside,

269
0:13:14.516,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Laughter)

270
0:13:15.854,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and he said, "My wife wouldn't think

271
0:13:17.639,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that I was really much of a guy if she knew this,

272
0:13:19.974,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication,

273
0:13:23.756,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and I wondered what you think?"

274
0:13:26.205,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They were hiding the same medication

275
0:13:28.519,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in two different places in the same bedroom.

276
0:13:31.918,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Laughter)

277
0:13:33.14,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And I said that I thought communication within the marriage

278
0:13:36.102,000 --> 0:13:38,000
might be triggering some of their problems.

279
0:13:38.174,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Laughter)

280
0:13:42.593,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But I was also struck

281
0:13:44.18,000 --> 0:13:47,000
by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy.

282
0:13:48.141,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Depression is so exhausting.

283
0:13:50.026,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It takes up so much of your time and energy,

284
0:13:52.996,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and silence about it,

285
0:13:54.551,000 --> 0:13:56,000
it really does make the depression worse.

286
0:13:57.276,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And then I began thinking

287
0:13:58.509,000 --> 0:14:,000
about all the ways people make themselves better.

288
0:14:00.856,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I'd started off as a medical conservative.

289
0:14:03.341,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked,

290
0:14:05.999,000 --> 0:14:06,000
it was clear what they were --

291
0:14:07.468,000 --> 0:14:08,000
there was medication,

292
0:14:08.992,000 --> 0:14:09,000
there were certain psychotherapies,

293
0:14:10.683,000 --> 0:14:12,000
there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment,

294
0:14:13.128,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and that everything else was nonsense.

295
0:14:15.741,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But then I discovered something.

296
0:14:17.693,000 --> 0:14:18,000
If you have brain cancer,

297
0:14:19.35,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning

298
0:14:22.562,000 --> 0:14:23,000
makes you feel better,

299
0:14:23.739,000 --> 0:14:25,000
it may make you feel better, but you still have brain cancer,

300
0:14:26.741,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and you'll still probably die from it.

301
0:14:29.387,000 --> 0:14:31,000
But if you say that you have depression,

302
0:14:31.697,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and standing on your head for 20 minutes every day

303
0:14:34.061,000 --> 0:14:36,000
makes you feel better, then it's worked,

304
0:14:36.281,000 --> 0:14:38,000
because depression is an illness of how you feel,

305
0:14:38.746,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and if you feel better,

306
0:14:40.1,000 --> 0:14:42,000
then you are effectively not depressed anymore.

307
0:14:43.112,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So I became much more tolerant

308
0:14:45.223,000 --> 0:14:47,000
of the vast world of alternative treatments.

309
0:14:47.936,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And I get letters, I get hundreds of letters

310
0:14:50.272,000 --> 0:14:52,000
from people writing to tell me about what's worked for them.

311
0:14:53.106,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation.

312
0:14:56.695,000 --> 0:14:59,000
My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman

313
0:15:00.391,000 --> 0:15:02,000
who wrote and said that she had tried therapy, medication,

314
0:15:03.336,000 --> 0:15:04,000
she had tried pretty much everything,

315
0:15:05.19,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world,

316
0:15:08.12,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and that was making little things from yarn.

317
0:15:11.716,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Laughter)

318
0:15:14.633,000 --> 0:15:15,000
She sent me some of them.

319
0:15:16.193,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Laughter)

320
0:15:18.247,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And I'm not wearing them right now.

321
0:15:20.136,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Laughter)

322
0:15:21.845,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I suggested to her that she also should look up

323
0:15:24.36,000 --> 0:15:27,000
obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.

324
0:15:28.979,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And yet, when I went to look at alternative treatments,

325
0:15:31.693,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I also gained perspective on other treatments.

326
0:15:34.605,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal

327
0:15:37.347,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that involved a great deal of ram's blood

328
0:15:39.36,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and that I'm not going to detail right now,

329
0:15:41.422,000 --> 0:15:43,000
but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda,

330
0:15:43.446,000 --> 0:15:44,000
working on a different project,

331
0:15:45.367,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and I happened to describe my experience to someone,

332
0:15:47.976,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and he said,

333
0:15:49.159,000 --> 0:15:51,000
"Well, that's West Africa, and we're in East Africa,

334
0:15:51.641,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and our rituals are in some ways very different,

335
0:15:53.922,000 --> 0:15:54,000
but we do have some rituals

336
0:15:55.247,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that have something in common with what you're describing."

337
0:15:58.071,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And he said,

338
0:15:59.262,000 --> 0:16:02,000
"But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers,

339
0:16:02.497,000 --> 0:16:04,000
especially the ones who came right after the genocide."

340
0:16:05.139,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I said, "What kind of trouble did you have?"

341
0:16:07.213,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And he said, "Well, they would do this bizarre thing.

342
0:16:10.989,000 --> 0:16:12,000
They didn't take people out in the sunshine

343
0:16:13.061,000 --> 0:16:14,000
where you begin to feel better.

344
0:16:14.574,000 --> 0:16:17,000
They didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going.

345
0:16:17.75,000 --> 0:16:18,000
They didn't involve the whole community.

346
0:16:19.68,000 --> 0:16:22,000
They didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit.

347
0:16:22.94,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms

348
0:16:27.977,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and had them talk for an hour

349
0:16:29.382,000 --> 0:16:31,000
about bad things that had happened to them."

350
0:16:31.55,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Laughter)

351
0:16:33.617,000 --> 0:16:36,000
(Applause)

352
0:16:37.01,000 --> 0:16:39,000
He said, "We had to ask them to leave the country."

353
0:16:39.463,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Laughter)

354
0:16:42.429,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Now at the other end of alternative treatments,

355
0:16:45.031,000 --> 0:16:47,000
let me tell you about Frank Russakoff.

356
0:16:47.15,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man.

357
0:16:52.876,000 --> 0:16:53,000
He was constantly depressed.

358
0:16:54.869,000 --> 0:16:55,000
He was, when I met him,

359
0:16:56.338,000 --> 0:16:59,000
at a point at which every month, he would have electroshock treatment.

360
0:17:00.168,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week.

361
0:17:02.743,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Then he would feel okay for a week.

362
0:17:04.546,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Then he would have a week of going downhill.

363
0:17:06.664,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And then he would have another electroshock treatment.

364
0:17:09.278,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And he said to me when I met him,

365
0:17:10.875,000 --> 0:17:12,000
"It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way.

366
0:17:13.264,000 --> 0:17:14,000
I can't go on this way,

367
0:17:14.735,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and I've figured out how I'm going to end it

368
0:17:16.869,000 --> 0:17:17,000
if I don't get better."

369
0:17:18.226,000 --> 0:17:22,000
"But," he said to me, "I heard about a protocol at Mass General

370
0:17:22.352,000 --> 0:17:25,000
for a procedure called a cingulotomy, which is a brain surgery,

371
0:17:25.598,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and I think I'm going to give that a try."

372
0:17:27.891,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone

373
0:17:31.208,000 --> 0:17:33,000
who clearly had so many bad experiences

374
0:17:34.229,000 --> 0:17:36,000
with so many different treatments

375
0:17:36.389,000 --> 0:17:39,000
still had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism

376
0:17:39.453,000 --> 0:17:4,000
to reach out for one more.

377
0:17:41.76,000 --> 0:17:45,000
And he had the cingulotomy, and it was incredibly successful.

378
0:17:45.981,000 --> 0:17:46,000
He's now a friend of mine.

379
0:17:47.617,000 --> 0:17:5,000
He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children.

380
0:17:50.966,000 --> 0:17:52,000
He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery,

381
0:17:53.915,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and he said,

382
0:17:55.104,000 --> 0:17:57,000
"My father sent me two presents this year,

383
0:17:57.731,000 --> 0:17:59,000
First, a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image

384
0:18:00.282,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that I didn't really need,

385
0:18:01.704,000 --> 0:18:03,000
but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate

386
0:18:03.965,000 --> 0:18:06,000
the fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love.

387
0:18:07.635,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And the other present was a photo of my grandmother,

388
0:18:10.9,000 --> 0:18:11,000
who committed suicide.

389
0:18:12.955,000 --> 0:18:14,000
As I unwrapped it, I began to cry,

390
0:18:15.884,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and my mother came over and said,

391
0:18:17.765,000 --> 0:18:19,000
'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew?'

392
0:18:21.162,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And I said, 'She had the same disease I have.'

393
0:18:25.242,000 --> 0:18:27,000
I'm crying now as I write to you.

394
0:18:27.878,000 --> 0:18:3,000
It's not that I'm so sad, but I get overwhelmed,

395
0:18:31.189,000 --> 0:18:33,000
I think, because I could have killed myself,

396
0:18:33.41,000 --> 0:18:36,000
but my parents kept me going, and so did the doctors,

397
0:18:36.862,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and I had the surgery.

398
0:18:38.716,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I'm alive and grateful.

399
0:18:41.531,000 --> 0:18:45,000
We live in the right time, even if it doesn't always feel like it."

400
0:18:47.856,000 --> 0:18:48,000
I was struck by the fact that depression

401
0:18:49.799,000 --> 0:18:54,000
is broadly perceived to be a modern, Western, middle-class thing,

402
0:18:54.829,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts,

403
0:18:58.984,000 --> 0:19:,000
and one of the things I was most interested in

404
0:19:01.199,000 --> 0:19:02,000
was depression among the indigent.

405
0:19:03.138,000 --> 0:19:04,000
And so I went out to try to look

406
0:19:04.71,000 --> 0:19:06,000
at what was being done for poor people with depression.

407
0:19:07.487,000 --> 0:19:09,000
And what I discovered is that poor people

408
0:19:09.638,000 --> 0:19:11,000
are mostly not being treated for depression.

409
0:19:12.19,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability,

410
0:19:14.888,000 --> 0:19:17,000
which is presumably evenly distributed in the population,

411
0:19:18.262,000 --> 0:19:19,000
and triggering circumstances,

412
0:19:19.999,000 --> 0:19:22,000
which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished.

413
0:19:23.777,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life

414
0:19:27.304,000 --> 0:19:28,000
but feel miserable all the time,

415
0:19:28.91,000 --> 0:19:29,000
you think, "Why do I feel like this?

416
0:19:30.72,000 --> 0:19:31,000
I must have depression."

417
0:19:32.013,000 --> 0:19:34,000
And you set out to find treatment for it.

418
0:19:34.173,000 --> 0:19:35,000
But if you have a perfectly awful life,

419
0:19:36.129,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and you feel miserable all the time,

420
0:19:37.896,000 --> 0:19:4,000
the way you feel is commensurate with your life,

421
0:19:40.93,000 --> 0:19:41,000
and it doesn't occur to you to think,

422
0:19:42.809,000 --> 0:19:43,000
"Maybe this is treatable."

423
0:19:44.37,000 --> 0:19:47,000
And so we have an epidemic in this country

424
0:19:47.596,000 --> 0:19:49,000
of depression among impoverished people

425
0:19:50.278,000 --> 0:19:52,000
that's not being picked up and that's not being treated

426
0:19:52.874,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and that's not being addressed,

427
0:19:54.846,000 --> 0:19:56,000
and it's a tragedy of a grand order.

428
0:19:57.219,000 --> 0:19:58,000
And so I found an academic

429
0:19:58.843,000 --> 0:20:01,000
who was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C.,

430
0:20:02.092,000 --> 0:20:05,000
where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems

431
0:20:05.259,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and diagnosed them with depression,

432
0:20:07.038,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and then provided six months of the experimental protocol.

433
0:20:10.134,000 --> 0:20:12,000
One of them, Lolly, came in,

434
0:20:12.463,000 --> 0:20:14,000
and this is what she said the day she came in.

435
0:20:15.069,000 --> 0:20:19,000
She said, and she was a woman, by the way, who had seven children.

436
0:20:19.658,000 --> 0:20:21,000
She said, "I used to have a job but I had to give it up

437
0:20:22.467,000 --> 0:20:24,000
because I couldn't go out of the house.

438
0:20:25.134,000 --> 0:20:26,000
I have nothing to say to my children.

439
0:20:27.447,000 --> 0:20:29,000
In the morning, I can't wait for them to leave,

440
0:20:29.953,000 --> 0:20:32,000
and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head,

441
0:20:33.179,000 --> 0:20:34,000
and three o'clock when they come home,

442
0:20:35.078,000 --> 0:20:36,000
it just comes so fast."

443
0:20:36.544,000 --> 0:20:38,000
She said, "I've been taking a lot of Tylenol,

444
0:20:38.862,000 --> 0:20:4,000
anything I can take so that I can sleep more.

445
0:20:41.389,000 --> 0:20:44,000
My husband has been telling me I'm stupid, I'm ugly.

446
0:20:45.41,000 --> 0:20:47,000
I wish I could stop the pain."

447
0:20:48.935,000 --> 0:20:5,000
Well, she was brought into this experimental protocol,

448
0:20:51.555,000 --> 0:20:53,000
and when I interviewed her six months later,

449
0:20:53.77,000 --> 0:20:57,000
she had taken a job working in childcare

450
0:20:58.019,000 --> 0:21:02,000
for the U.S. Navy, she had left the abusive husband,

451
0:21:02.093,000 --> 0:21:04,000
and she said to me,

452
0:21:04.14,000 --> 0:21:06,000
"My kids are so much happier now."

453
0:21:06.419,000 --> 0:21:08,000
She said, "There's one room in my new place for the boys

454
0:21:09.125,000 --> 0:21:1,000
and one room for the girls,

455
0:21:11.036,000 --> 0:21:13,000
but at night, they're just all up on my bed,

456
0:21:13.399,000 --> 0:21:15,000
and we're doing homework all together and everything.

457
0:21:16.011,000 --> 0:21:17,000
One of them wants to be a preacher,

458
0:21:17.709,000 --> 0:21:18,000
one of them wants to be a firefighter,

459
0:21:19.626,000 --> 0:21:21,000
and one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer.

460
0:21:22.35,000 --> 0:21:24,000
They don't cry like they used to,

461
0:21:24.578,000 --> 0:21:25,000
and they don't fight like they did.

462
0:21:27.144,000 --> 0:21:29,000
That's all I need now, is my kids.

463
0:21:30.826,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Things keep on changing,

464
0:21:32.795,000 --> 0:21:36,000
the way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act.

465
0:21:37.909,000 --> 0:21:4,000
I can go outside not being afraid anymore,

466
0:21:41.734,000 --> 0:21:44,000
and I don't think those bad feelings are coming back,

467
0:21:45.246,000 --> 0:21:47,000
and if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that,

468
0:21:48.206,000 --> 0:21:51,000
I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head,

469
0:21:51.752,000 --> 0:21:52,000
if I were still alive at all.

470
0:21:54.097,000 --> 0:21:57,000
I asked the Lord to send me an angel,

471
0:21:57.627,000 --> 0:21:58,000
and He heard my prayers."

472
0:22:02.308,000 --> 0:22:04,000
I was really moved by these experiences,

473
0:22:05.312,000 --> 0:22:07,000
and I decided that I wanted to write about them

474
0:22:07.851,000 --> 0:22:09,000
not only in a book I was working on, but also in an article,

475
0:22:10.692,000 --> 0:22:12,000
and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine

476
0:22:13.295,000 --> 0:22:15,000
to write about depression among the indigent.

477
0:22:15.438,000 --> 0:22:16,000
And I turned in my story,

478
0:22:16.699,000 --> 0:22:19,000
and my editor called me and said, "We really can't publish this."

479
0:22:20.668,000 --> 0:22:21,000
And I said, "Why not?"

480
0:22:21.851,000 --> 0:22:23,000
And she said, "It just is too far-fetched.

481
0:22:23.946,000 --> 0:22:26,000
These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society

482
0:22:27.633,000 --> 0:22:29,000
and then they get a few months of treatment

483
0:22:29.672,000 --> 0:22:31,000
and they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley?

484
0:22:32.069,000 --> 0:22:33,000
It's just too implausible."

485
0:22:34.013,000 --> 0:22:36,000
She said, "I've never even heard of anything like it."

486
0:22:36.618,000 --> 0:22:38,000
And I said, "The fact that you've never heard of it

487
0:22:39.095,000 --> 0:22:41,000
is an indication that it is news."

488
0:22:41.907,000 --> 0:22:45,000
(Laughter)

489
0:22:45.954,000 --> 0:22:48,000
(Applause)

490
0:22:49.317,000 --> 0:22:51,000
"And you are a news magazine."

491
0:22:51.95,000 --> 0:22:54,000
So after a certain amount of negotiation, they agreed to it.

492
0:22:55.034,000 --> 0:22:58,000
But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way

493
0:22:58.944,000 --> 0:23:01,000
to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment,

494
0:23:02.549,000 --> 0:23:03,000
the notion that somehow if we went out

495
0:23:04.431,000 --> 0:23:06,000
and treated a lot of people in indigent communities,

496
0:23:07.278,000 --> 0:23:08,000
that would be exploitative,

497
0:23:09.158,000 --> 0:23:1,000
because we would be changing them.

498
0:23:10.88,000 --> 0:23:13,000
There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us,

499
0:23:14.711,000 --> 0:23:16,000
that treatment of depression,

500
0:23:16.843,000 --> 0:23:18,000
the medications and so on, are an artifice,

501
0:23:19.142,000 --> 0:23:21,000
and that it's not natural.

502
0:23:21.489,000 --> 0:23:23,000
And I think that's very misguided.

503
0:23:24.456,000 --> 0:23:27,000
It would be natural for people's teeth to fall out,

504
0:23:27.813,000 --> 0:23:3,000
but there is nobody militating against toothpaste,

505
0:23:31.025,000 --> 0:23:32,000
at least not in my circles.

506
0:23:33.915,000 --> 0:23:34,000
People then say,

507
0:23:35.183,000 --> 0:23:38,000
"But isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience?

508
0:23:38.468,000 --> 0:23:39,000
Didn't we evolve to have depression?

509
0:23:40.224,000 --> 0:23:41,000
Isn't it part of your personality?"

510
0:23:41.999,000 --> 0:23:43,000
To which I would say, mood is adaptive.

511
0:23:44.462,000 --> 0:23:47,000
Being able to have sadness and fear

512
0:23:47.563,000 --> 0:23:48,000
and joy and pleasure

513
0:23:49.493,000 --> 0:23:52,000
and all of the other moods that we have, that's incredibly valuable.

514
0:23:53.272,000 --> 0:23:54,000
And major depression

515
0:23:55.21,000 --> 0:23:58,000
is something that happens when that system gets broken.

516
0:23:58.596,000 --> 0:23:59,000
It's maladaptive.

517
0:24:00.224,000 --> 0:24:01,000
People will come to me and say,

518
0:24:01.863,000 --> 0:24:03,000
"I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year,

519
0:24:04.689,000 --> 0:24:05,000
I think I can just get through this."

520
0:24:06.566,000 --> 0:24:08,000
And I always say to them, "You may get through it,

521
0:24:09.114,000 --> 0:24:11,000
but you'll never be 37 again.

522
0:24:11.733,000 --> 0:24:14,000
Life is short, and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up.

523
0:24:15.982,000 --> 0:24:16,000
Think it through."

524
0:24:17.694,000 --> 0:24:19,000
It's a strange poverty of the English language,

525
0:24:20.366,000 --> 0:24:22,000
and indeed of many other languages,

526
0:24:22.474,000 --> 0:24:24,000
that we use this same word, depression,

527
0:24:24.868,000 --> 0:24:27,000
to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday,

528
0:24:28.606,000 --> 0:24:32,000
and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide.

529
0:24:33.495,000 --> 0:24:36,000
People say to me, "Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?"

530
0:24:36.525,000 --> 0:24:39,000
And I say, in a way it's continuous with normal sadness.

531
0:24:39.656,000 --> 0:24:41,000
There is a certain amount of continuity,

532
0:24:41.854,000 --> 0:24:42,000
but it's the same way there's continuity

533
0:24:43.815,000 --> 0:24:45,000
between having an iron fence outside your house

534
0:24:46.045,000 --> 0:24:47,000
that gets a little rust spot

535
0:24:47.489,000 --> 0:24:49,000
that you have to sand off and do a little repainting,

536
0:24:50.111,000 --> 0:24:52,000
and what happens if you leave the house for 100 years

537
0:24:52.963,000 --> 0:24:55,000
and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust.

538
0:24:57.082,000 --> 0:24:58,000
And it's that orange dust spot,

539
0:24:58.959,000 --> 0:24:59,000
that orange dust problem,

540
0:25:00.748,000 --> 0:25:02,000
that's the one we're setting out to address.

541
0:25:04.04,000 --> 0:25:06,000
So now people say,

542
0:25:06.278,000 --> 0:25:08,000
"You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?"

543
0:25:08.981,000 --> 0:25:09,000
And I don't.

544
0:25:10.594,000 --> 0:25:12,000
But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch,

545
0:25:13.586,000 --> 0:25:15,000
and I don't feel sad about my answering machine,

546
0:25:16.451,000 --> 0:25:18,000
and I don't feel sad about taking a shower.

547
0:25:19.324,000 --> 0:25:21,000
I feel more, in fact, I think,

548
0:25:21.951,000 --> 0:25:23,000
because I can feel sadness without nullity.

549
0:25:24.704,000 --> 0:25:28,000
I feel sad about professional disappointments,

550
0:25:28.934,000 --> 0:25:3,000
about damaged relationships,

551
0:25:31.242,000 --> 0:25:32,000
about global warming.

552
0:25:33.114,000 --> 0:25:35,000
Those are the things that I feel sad about now.

553
0:25:35.839,000 --> 0:25:37,000
And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion?

554
0:25:38.573,000 --> 0:25:4,000
How did those people who have better lives

555
0:25:41.134,000 --> 0:25:43,000
even with bigger depression manage to get through?

556
0:25:43.964,000 --> 0:25:45,000
What is the mechanism of resilience?

557
0:25:46.583,000 --> 0:25:47,000
And what I came up with over time

558
0:25:48.569,000 --> 0:25:5,000
was that the people who deny their experience,

559
0:25:51.419,000 --> 0:25:53,000
and say, "I was depressed a long time ago,

560
0:25:53.459,000 --> 0:25:54,000
I never want to think about it again,

561
0:25:55.254,000 --> 0:25:56,000
I'm not going to look at it

562
0:25:56.572,000 --> 0:25:58,000
and I'm just going to get on with my life,"

563
0:25:58.619,000 --> 0:26:02,000
ironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have.

564
0:26:03.241,000 --> 0:26:05,000
Shutting out the depression strengthens it.

565
0:26:05.78,000 --> 0:26:07,000
While you hide from it, it grows.

566
0:26:09.185,000 --> 0:26:11,000
And the people who do better

567
0:26:11.747,000 --> 0:26:15,000
are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition.

568
0:26:16.324,000 --> 0:26:19,000
Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience.

569
0:26:20.516,000 --> 0:26:21,000
So Frank Russakoff said to me,

570
0:26:22.152,000 --> 0:26:25,000
"If I had a do-over, I suppose I wouldn't do it this way,

571
0:26:25.898,000 --> 0:26:28,000
but in a strange way, I'm grateful for what I've experienced.

572
0:26:29.39,000 --> 0:26:32,000
I'm glad to have been in the hospital 40 times.

573
0:26:33.023,000 --> 0:26:35,000
It taught me so much about love,

574
0:26:35.658,000 --> 0:26:37,000
and my relationship with my parents and my doctors

575
0:26:38.603,000 --> 0:26:41,000
has been so precious to me, and will be always."

576
0:26:42.772,000 --> 0:26:43,000
And Maggie Robbins said,

577
0:26:44.698,000 --> 0:26:46,000
"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,

578
0:26:47.687,000 --> 0:26:49,000
and I would just talk and talk and talk,

579
0:26:50.701,000 --> 0:26:54,000
and the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive, and I thought,

580
0:26:54.758,000 --> 0:26:56,000
'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.'"

581
0:26:57.278,000 --> 0:26:58,000
(Laughter)

582
0:26:58.542,000 --> 0:26:59,000
"And then I realized,

583
0:27:00.184,000 --> 0:27:02,000
I realized that they weren't going to do more

584
0:27:02.351,000 --> 0:27:04,000
than make those first few minutes of small talk.

585
0:27:04.858,000 --> 0:27:06,000
It was simply going to be an occasion

586
0:27:06.921,000 --> 0:27:08,000
where I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying,

587
0:27:09.894,000 --> 0:27:11,000
but could tolerate the fact that they did

588
0:27:12.796,000 --> 0:27:13,000
and they were.

589
0:27:14.503,000 --> 0:27:17,000
Our needs are our greatest assets.

590
0:27:18.202,000 --> 0:27:22,000
It turns out I've learned to give all the things I need."

591
0:27:24.16,000 --> 0:27:27,000
Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse,

592
0:27:28.045,000 --> 0:27:3,000
but it may make the prospect of relapse

593
0:27:30.706,000 --> 0:27:33,000
and even relapse itself easier to tolerate.

594
0:27:35.004,000 --> 0:27:38,000
The question is not so much of finding great meaning

595
0:27:38.686,000 --> 0:27:4,000
and deciding your depression has been very meaningful.

596
0:27:41.281,000 --> 0:27:44,000
It's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again,

597
0:27:45.296,000 --> 0:27:48,000
"This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it."

598
0:27:49.487,000 --> 0:27:51,000
I have learned in my own depression

599
0:27:51.751,000 --> 0:27:53,000
how big an emotion can be,

600
0:27:53.973,000 --> 0:27:56,000
how it can be more real than facts,

601
0:27:57.057,000 --> 0:27:59,000
and I have found that that experience

602
0:27:59.81,000 --> 0:28:01,000
has allowed me to experience positive emotion

603
0:28:02.702,000 --> 0:28:04,000
in a more intense and more focused way.

604
0:28:06.222,000 --> 0:28:09,000
The opposite of depression is not happiness,

605
0:28:09.829,000 --> 0:28:1,000
but vitality,

606
0:28:11.163,000 --> 0:28:13,000
and these days, my life is vital,

607
0:28:14.142,000 --> 0:28:16,000
even on the days when I'm sad.

608
0:28:16.823,000 --> 0:28:19,000
I felt that funeral in my brain,

609
0:28:19.962,000 --> 0:28:23,000
and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world,

610
0:28:24.526,000 --> 0:28:27,000
and I have discovered something inside of myself

611
0:28:28.437,000 --> 0:28:3,000
that I would have to call a soul

612
0:28:30.525,000 --> 0:28:33,000
that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago

613
0:28:34.062,000 --> 0:28:37,000
when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.

614
0:28:38.841,000 --> 0:28:41,000
I think that while I hated being depressed

615
0:28:42.678,000 --> 0:28:44,000
and would hate to be depressed again,

616
0:28:45.204,000 --> 0:28:47,000
I've found a way to love my depression.

617
0:28:47.894,000 --> 0:28:51,000
I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy.

618
0:28:52.681,000 --> 0:28:55,000
I love it because each day I decide,

619
0:28:56.294,000 --> 0:28:57,000
sometimes gamely,

620
0:28:57.707,000 --> 0:28:59,000

0:29:02.978,000 --> 0:29:05,000
And that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture.

623
0:29:07.076,000 --> 0:29:08,000
Thank you.

624
0:29:08.356,000 --> 0:29:12,000
(Applause)

625
0:29:12.381,000 --> 0:29:13,000
Thank you.

0:29:13.556,000 --> 0:29:15,000

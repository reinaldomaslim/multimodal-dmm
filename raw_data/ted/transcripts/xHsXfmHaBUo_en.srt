1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
On simplicity. What a great way to start.

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
First of all, I've been watching this trend

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
where we have these books like such and such "For Dummies."

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Do you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?"

5
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.

6
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?"

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.

11
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But I really like that, so I wrote a book called "The Laws of Simplicity."

12
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.

14
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity?

15
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Is it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I'm not sure.

16
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity,"

17
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.

18
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And so in my life, I've discovered that

19
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.

20
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Because your companies will always take away your life,

21
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but they can never take away your vacation -- in theory.

22
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity,

24
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.

25
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever,

26
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and unfortunately, their branding was all about "Keep It Simple."

27
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I opened up a magazine, and Visa's branding was,

29
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"Business Takes Simplicity."

30
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I develop photographs, and Kodak said, "Keep It Simple."

31
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So, I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around.

32
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much,

33
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently.

34
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And she has this show, "The Simple Life."

35
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So I watched this. It's not very simple, a little bit confusing.

36
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So, I looked for a different show to watch.

38
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So, I opened up this TV Guide thing,

39
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and on the E! channel, this "Simple Life" show is very popular.

40
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
They'll play it over, and over, and over.

41
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So it was traumatizing, actually.

43
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So, I wanted to escape again, so I went out to my car.

44
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.

45
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And when you drive, these signs are very important.

46
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching."

47
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.

48
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly,

50
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
so I thought, "Ah, simplicity. Very important."

51
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But then I thought, "Oh, simplicity. What would that be like on a beach?

52
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:57,000
What if the sky was 41 percent gray? Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?"

53
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I mean that simplicity sky.

54
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But in reality, the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful, complex sky.

55
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You know, with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity.

56
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We're human beings: we love complex things.

57
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We love relationships -- very complex. So we love this kind of stuff.

58
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I'm at this place called the Media Lab.

59
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place.

60
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's designed by I. M. Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.

61
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Modernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.

62
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And some of you guys are entrepreneurs, etc., whatever.

64
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Last month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man.

65
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options.

66
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:4,000
See, in academia, we get titles, lots of titles.

67
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Last year at TED, these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles.

68
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.

69
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles,

70
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in addition to my previous titles.

71
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Another "Associate Director of Research."

72
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And this also happened, so I have five daughters now.

73
0:03:58,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
That's my baby Reina. (Applause) Thank you.

75
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And so, my life is much more complex because of the baby, actually,

76
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but that's okay. We will still stay married, I think.

77
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But looking way back, when I was a child --

78
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.

79
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu,

80
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food.

81
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's very hard work to make tofu.

82
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:26,000
As a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.

83
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.

84
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So often, seven days a week. Family business equals child labor.

85
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We were a great model. So, I loved going to school.

86
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
School was great, and maybe going to school

87
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
helped me get to this Media Lab place, I'm not sure.

88
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Thank you.

90
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me

91
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because as a student, I was a computer science undergrad,

92
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and I discovered design later on in my life.

93
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And there was this person, Muriel Cooper.

94
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
Who knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?

95
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Wasn't she amazing? Muriel Cooper. She was wacky.

96
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And she was a TEDster, exactly, and she showed us,

97
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:1,000
she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.

98
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And she's very important in my life,

99
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.

100
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school, because of her.

101
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
She passed away in 1994,

102
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.

103
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This amazing person, Muriel Cooper.

104
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
When I was in Japan -- I went to an art school in Japan --

105
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.

106
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Some of you guys know Paul Rand,

107
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the greatest graphic designer -- I'm sorry -- out there.

108
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The great graphic designer Paul Rand

109
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.

110
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
He basically said, "I've designed everything."

111
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life --

112
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan,

113
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
like Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji.

114
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
When you have mentors -- and yesterday,

115
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors,

116
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:07,000
these people in your life -- the problem with mentors is that they all die.

117
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is a sad thing, but it's actually a happy thing in a way,

118
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because you can remember them in their pure form.

119
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.

120
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever,

121
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the mentors calm us down.

122
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And I'm grateful for my mentors, and I'm sure all of you are too.

123
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT.

124
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The T doesn't stand for "human," it stands for "technology."

125
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.

126
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So, I've always been Googling this word, "human,"

127
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to find out how many hits I get.

128
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And in 2001, I had 26 million hits, and for "computer,"

129
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because computers are against humans a bit,

130
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I have 42 million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here.

131
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So, if you sort of compare that, like this,

132
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
you'll see that computer versus human --

133
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I've been tracking this for the last year --

134
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
computer versus human over the last year has changed.

135
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up.

136
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Very good, us humans! We're catching up with the computers.

137
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
In the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.

138
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So if you compare complexities to simplicity,

139
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
it's also catching up in a way, too.

140
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.

141
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I have a confession: I'm not a man of simplicity.

142
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.

143
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Lots of complex stuff.

144
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.

145
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.

146
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.

147
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So, I hid in a time dimension.

148
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I built things in a time-graphics dimension.

149
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.

150
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
This is a floral theme calendar in 1997,

151
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space,

152
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks,

153
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you're cooler for some reason.

154
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This is why they have fireworks in the summer.

155
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
A very extreme culture.

156
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Lastly, this is a fall-based calendar,

157
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because I have so many leaves in my yard.

158
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.

159
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And so I made a lot of these types of things.

160
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things,

161
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.

162
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I feel kind of bad about that.

163
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Tomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.

164
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
She has this show right now at MoMA,

165
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls.

166
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
If you're in New York, please go and see that.

167
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But I've had a problem, because I make all this flying stuff

168
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and people say, "Oh, I know your work.

169
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
You're the guy that makes eye candy."

170
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And when you're told this, you feel kind of weird.

171
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
"Eye candy" -- sort of pejorative, don't you think?

172
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So, I say, "No, I make eye meat," instead.

173
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous,

175
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
something more powerful, perhaps. But what could that be, eye meat?

176
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.

177
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Computer programs are essentially trees,

178
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.

179
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Whenever you make art with a computer program,

180
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
you're always on the tree, and the paradox is that

181
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
for excellent art, you want to be off the tree.

182
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So, this is sort of a complication I've found.

183
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So, to get off the tree, I began to use my old computers.

184
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.

185
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.

186
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
You can't type very much on this.

187
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions

188
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.

189
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing --

190
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, "whack," like that.

191
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But I thought, "This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test?"

192
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So I have a crash test.

193
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made,

195
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
just to sort of understand what these things are.

196
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

197
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Shortly after this, 9/11 happened, and I was very depressed.

198
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I was concerned with contemporary art

199
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that was all about piss, and sort of really sad things,

200
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and so I wanted to think about something happy.

201
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So I focused on food as my area --

202
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
these sort of clementine peel things.

203
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel

204
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
just in one piece. Who's done that before? One-piece clementine?

205
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Oh, you guys are missing out, if you haven't done it yet.

206
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this,

207
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
actually, in different forms.

208
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff,

209
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.

210
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries,

211
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme,

212
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images.

213
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know,

214
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,"

215
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
so I made this amber waves image.

216
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries.

217
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And also, as a child, I was the fattest kid in class,

218
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
so I used to love Cheetos. Oh, I love Cheetos, yummy.

219
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.

220
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint.

221
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.

222
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Laughter)

223
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material.

224
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And with these Cheetos, I began to think,

225
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"What can I make with these Cheetos?"

226
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And so, I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks, and also pretzels.

227
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I was looking for some kind of form,

228
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and in the end, I made 100 butter-fries. Do you get it?

229
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And each butter-fry is composed of different pieces.

231
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
People ask me how they make the antenna.

232
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Sometimes, they find a hair in the food. That's my hair.

233
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:4,000
My hair's clean -- it's okay.

234
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I'm a tenured professor, which means, basically, I don't have to work anymore.

235
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday

236
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte.

237
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
End of story.

238
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

239
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But I realized that life could be very boring,

240
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:56,000
so I've been thinking about life, and I notice that my camera --

241
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
my digital camera versus my car, a very strange thing.

242
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The car is so big, the camera is so small,

243
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:07,000
yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.

244
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It doesn't make any sense.

245
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Laughter)

246
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So, I was in the Cape one time, and I typed the word "simplicity,"

247
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and I discovered, in this weird, M. Night Shyamalan way,

248
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that I discovered [the] letters, M, I, T. You know the word?

249
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:24,000
In the words "simplicity" and "complexity," M, I, T occur in perfect sequence.

250
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?

251
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something.

252
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."

253
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.

254
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The ten laws and three keys -- I won't go over them because that's why I have a book,

255
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and also that's why it's on the Web for free.

256
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way: there are all kinds.

257
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
In Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.

258
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
You know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging.

259
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
People hate number ten like they hate uni, actually.

260
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The three keys are easy to eat, so this is anago, cooked already, so easy to eat.

261
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity.

262
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Because I want to simplify them for you.

263
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing.

264
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So, if I simplify the laws of simplicity,

265
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.

266
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid

267
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
a big cookie or a small cookie,

268
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
which cookie are they going to take? The big cookie.

269
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it,

270
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie.

271
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold,

272
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose?

273
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Strangely, not the big pile. So, I think it's as simple as this.

274
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
You know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it.

275
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
When you want less, it's because it's about work.

276
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life

277
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
with more enjoyment and less pain.

278
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I think this is sort of simple more versus less.

279
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Basically, it always depends.

280
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
This book I wrote because I want to figure out life.

281
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things.

282
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity,

283
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because you're trying to simplify your life.

284
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place.

285
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
By being at TED, we see so many things at one time.

286
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.

287
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Like everything you see, every time you wake up.

288
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
It's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.

289
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:22,000
From everything from a weird hotel lobby,

290
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:25,000
to Saran wrap placed over your window,

291
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black,

292
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun.

293
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And so, this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here,

294
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
because life is finite.

295
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:41,000
This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.

296
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
He's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are --

297
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:48,000
twelve years old, twenty-four years old, seventy-four, ninety-six years old --

298
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and this is some medical data. So, brain strength increases up to 60,

299
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and then after 60, it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way.

300
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
Also, if you look at your physical strength.

301
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
You know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them,

302
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
"Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger,

303
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
but in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die."

304
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
OK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.

305
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And if you have your vision, vision is interesting.

306
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:19,000
As you age from infant age, your vision gets better,

307
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you're looking for a mate,

308
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and your vision goes after that.

309
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Laughter)

310
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Your social responsibility is very interesting.

311
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:33,000
So, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever.

312
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more --

313
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that's very good, too.

314
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But if any of you people ask,

315
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
"What actually goes up? Does anything go up?

316
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
What's the positive part of this, you know?" I think wisdom always goes up.

317
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.

318
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:51,000
They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom,

319
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and I think -- you know, this TED thing, I've come here.

320
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.

321
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:01,000
This whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.

322
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris.

323
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And this is an amazing experience for me as well.

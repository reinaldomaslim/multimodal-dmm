1
0:00:13.198,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to tell you the story of a song.

2
0:00:15.864,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was in Madrid one night in 2002

3
0:00:20.282,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,

4
0:00:22.609,000 --> 0:00:24,000
when he said he had something to give me.

5
0:00:25.599,000 --> 0:00:26,000
He said,

6
0:00:26.965,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"Jorge, I have some lines that you need to put into a song.

7
0:00:30.346,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Take these down, take these down."

8
0:00:32.029,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I looked on the table but all I found was a circular coaster,

9
0:00:35.057,000 --> 0:00:37,000
on which I wrote the lines my teacher dictated.

10
0:00:37.433,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They were four lines that went like this:

11
0:00:39.93,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"I am a Jewish Moor living among Christians

12
0:00:43.291,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are."

13
0:00:48.357,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Those lines really made an impression on me.

14
0:00:51.402,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I said, "What beautiful lyrics, Joaquín. Did you write them?"

15
0:00:54.41,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He said no, they were by another composer named Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,

16
0:00:59.912,000 --> 0:01:01,000
who was less known than Joaquín, but also a great poet.

17
0:01:03.732,000 --> 0:01:04,000
These lines came to me at a time

18
0:01:05.316,000 --> 0:01:07,000
where I had been wanting to express something for a while,

19
0:01:08.146,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but didn't quite know how.

20
0:01:09.81,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I was getting up to leave and go home to write,

21
0:01:12.72,000 --> 0:01:14,000
when Joaquín stopped me and said, "Hang on, hang on,"

22
0:01:15.234,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and presented me with this challenge:

23
0:01:17.982,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"Write the stanzas for this song

24
0:01:21.001,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in Décimas."

25
0:01:23.086,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Now, at this point in my life,

26
0:01:25.601,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I still wasn't completely sure what Décimas were,

27
0:01:29.397,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but I was too embarrassed to tell my teacher I didn't know.

28
0:01:33.683,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So I put on my best "Yeah, I totally understand" face,

29
0:01:37.392,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and went home to look up what Décimas were.

30
0:01:40.155,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I learned that a Décima is a type of verse

31
0:01:43.659,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that only exists in Spanish,

32
0:01:45.098,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and that it has 10 lines.

33
0:01:46.386,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's very, very complex --

34
0:01:48.411,000 --> 0:01:51,000
perhaps the most complex style of stanza that we have in Spanish.

35
0:01:51.605,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It also has a very concrete date of origin,

36
0:01:54.088,000 --> 0:01:56,000
which is very rare for a style of stanza.

37
0:01:56.446,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,

38
0:02:01.693,000 --> 0:02:05,000
by a guy named Vicente Espinel, a musician and poet from Málaga.

39
0:02:07.448,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And listen to this coincidence: he was the same guy

40
0:02:10.922,000 --> 0:02:11,000
who added the sixth string

41
0:02:12.638,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to what would later be called the Spanish guitar.

42
0:02:14.965,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This string right here --

43
0:02:16.355,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it's called the "bordona."

44
0:02:18.604,000 --> 0:02:21,000
From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,

45
0:02:22.072,000 --> 0:02:26,000
crosses over to America, just like the Spanish guitar,

46
0:02:26.903,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but in contrast to the Décima,

47
0:02:28.457,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the Spanish guitar continues to live today

48
0:02:30.93,000 --> 0:02:31,000
on both sides of the Atlantic.

49
0:02:32.643,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,

50
0:02:35.759,000 --> 0:02:36,000
disappeared; it died out.

51
0:02:38.213,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It died out about 200 years ago,

52
0:02:40.556,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and yet in Latin America, from Mexico to Chile,

53
0:02:45.244,000 --> 0:02:48,000
all our countries maintain some form of the Décima

54
0:02:49.222,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in our popular traditions.

55
0:02:52.331,000 --> 0:02:54,000
In each place, they've given it a different name,

56
0:02:54.669,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and set it to different music.

57
0:02:56.756,000 --> 0:03:,000
It has a lot of different names -- more than 20 in total on the continent.

58
0:03:01.715,000 --> 0:03:04,000
In Mexico, for example, it's called the "Son Jarocho,"

59
0:03:04.833,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"Canto de mejorana" in Panama;

60
0:03:06.662,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"Galerón" in Venezuela;

61
0:03:08.24,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"Payada" in Uruguay and Argentina;

62
0:03:11.297,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Repentismo" in Cuba.

63
0:03:12.735,000 --> 0:03:14,000
In Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,

64
0:03:15.041,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because the Décima becomes so integrated into our traditions,

65
0:03:18.164,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that if someone asks, people from each place are completely convinced

66
0:03:21.721,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that the Décima was invented in their country.

67
0:03:24.5,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:25.873,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's also got a really surprising feature,

69
0:03:28.048,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which is that despite the fact that it developed independently

70
0:03:31.341,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in each of the different countries,

71
0:03:33.402,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it maintains even today, 400 years after its creation,

72
0:03:37.804,000 --> 0:03:43,000
exactly the same rhyme, syllable and line structure --

73
0:03:44.996,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it during the Spanish Baroque period.

74
0:03:48.727,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Here's the structure --

75
0:03:49.932,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I'll give you the basic idea and then later you can look online

76
0:03:52.982,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and learn more about it.

77
0:03:55.126,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The Décima is ten lines long; each line has eight syllables.

78
0:03:59.961,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The first line rhymes with the fourth and the fifth;

79
0:04:02.46,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the second line, with the third;

80
0:04:04.032,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the sixth line, with the seventh and the tenth;

81
0:04:06.863,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.

82
0:04:09.321,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's a bit complicated, to be honest.

83
0:04:12.132,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And me -- imagine me, trying to write in Décimas.

84
0:04:16.207,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But it's not as complicated as it seems.

85
0:04:19.063,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Plus, it's amazing that it's survived with the same structure

86
0:04:22.248,000 --> 0:04:23,000
for more than four centuries.

87
0:04:24.86,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's not that complicated, because it has an impressive musicality to it,

88
0:04:28.356,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a type of musicality

89
0:04:30.796,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that's very hard to describe technically.

90
0:04:34.096,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I prefer that you listen to it.

91
0:04:35.713,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So I'm going to recite a Décima,

92
0:04:39.282,000 --> 0:04:42,000
one of the Décimas that I wrote for this song.

93
0:04:45.12,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I'm going to ask that you concentrate just on the musicality of the rhymes.

94
0:04:50.112,000 --> 0:04:51,000
For those of you with headphones on --

95
0:04:52.053,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I see that some of you are listening to the translation --

96
0:04:57.692,000 --> 0:04:59,000
please take them off for a minute.

97
0:04:59.781,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(English) Take your headphones off, it you have them.

98
0:05:03.408,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(English) Forget about the meaning of the words for a few seconds,

99
0:05:09.449,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(English) and then you'll put them back.

100
0:05:11.444,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(English) Forget about the structure.

101
0:05:13.274,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Spanish) Forget about the structure.

102
0:05:15.086,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(English) And just ... it's all about the choreography of sound of the Décima.

103
0:05:20.352,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Spanish) A choreography of sound.

104
0:05:24.752,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Sings in Spanish) "There is not one death that does not cause me pain,

105
0:05:28.188,000 --> 0:05:29,000
there are no winners,

106
0:05:29.249,000 --> 0:05:31,000
here’s nothing but suffering and another life blown away.

107
0:05:32.191,000 --> 0:05:35,000
War is a terrible school no matter what the disguise,

108
0:05:35.592,000 --> 0:05:37,000
forgive me for not enlisting under any flag,

109
0:05:38.514,000 --> 0:05:42,000
any daydream is worth more than a sad piece of cloth."

110
0:05:46.021,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That's a Décima.

111
0:05:48.151,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(English) You can put your headphones back on.

112
0:05:50.482,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

113
0:05:51.584,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(English) Thank you.

114
0:05:52.761,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:57.356,000 --> 0:06:,000
I also applaud Vicente Espinel, because here it is 426 years later,

116
0:06:00.679,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and the Décima lives on everywhere

117
0:06:02.43,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in its original state.

118
0:06:03.652,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I wrote three like that one; you just heard the second.

119
0:06:06.276,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I wrote the first one having only recently learned how,

120
0:06:08.974,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and it has some errors in terms of meter,

121
0:06:11.103,000 --> 0:06:13,000
so it's not presentable in its current state.

122
0:06:13.292,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But the one I sang was good, more or less.

123
0:06:15.935,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So: What was it about?

124
0:06:19.472,000 --> 0:06:21,000
What was the meaning behind those lines?

125
0:06:21.714,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I had just returned from doing a concert in Israel,

126
0:06:26.173,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and I was very emotional over a problem that hits really close to home,

127
0:06:29.914,000 --> 0:06:31,000
which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

128
0:06:32.005,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,

129
0:06:34.152,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and my mom's family are non-practicing Christians.

130
0:06:37.049,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I was raised in a home where the two traditions lived together

131
0:06:41.632,000 --> 0:06:42,000
more or less in harmony.

132
0:06:44.788,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa dressed as Santa Claus, for example,

133
0:06:48.599,000 --> 0:06:51,000
or to see my non-Jewish grandpa at the synagogue wearing his kippah,

134
0:06:51.861,000 --> 0:06:54,000
at family celebrations, wearing the same expression that I probably had

135
0:06:55.3,000 --> 0:06:56,000
when Sabina told me --

136
0:06:56.687,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:57.751,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that he had some Décima lines for me.

138
0:07:02.166,000 --> 0:07:05,000
For someone raised in that kind of environment,

139
0:07:05.821,000 --> 0:07:1,000
it's especially painful to see the difficulty the opposing parties have

140
0:07:11.056,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in putting themselves in the other side's shoes even for a moment.

141
0:07:14.267,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So that's what I wrote about.

142
0:07:16.403,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I already had the lyrics,

143
0:07:17.677,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I had the form -- the Décima -- and the content.

144
0:07:21.127,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I needed to write the music.

145
0:07:24.14,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I'll give you some context.

146
0:07:25.594,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I had only recently moved from Uruguay, where I'm from, to Spain.

147
0:07:30.293,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,

148
0:07:33.139,000 --> 0:07:35,000
like many of you here, who are away from home.

149
0:07:37.09,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And I wanted my song to be very, very Uruguayan,

150
0:07:40.564,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the most Uruguayan type of song there is -- the milonga.

151
0:07:44.31,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So now, I had been studying the Décima, and after finding out

152
0:07:49.823,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that everyone tried to claim the Décima as their own,

153
0:07:52.407,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that it was invented in their country,

154
0:07:54.299,000 --> 0:07:55,000
it made me wonder:

155
0:07:55.477,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What does it mean when we say the milonga is Uruguayan?

156
0:07:58.116,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The milonga has a rhythmic pattern that we musicians call 3-3-2.

157
0:08:04.31,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Counts out the beats) One two three, one two three, one two.

158
0:08:11.918,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And it has a characteristic emphasis.

159
0:08:14.443,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Sings)

160
0:08:22.924,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But this characteristic rhythm pattern

161
0:08:25.679,000 --> 0:08:26,000
comes from Africa.

162
0:08:27.58,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In the ninth century you could find it in the brothels of Persia,

163
0:08:30.714,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and in the thirteenth,

164
0:08:33.331,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in Spain, from where, five centuries later,

165
0:08:36.017,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it would cross over to America with the African slaves.

166
0:08:39.877,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Meanwhile, in the Balkans, it encounters the Roma scale --

167
0:08:44.278,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Sings)

168
0:08:51.569,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which in part, gives birth to klezmer music,

169
0:08:55.082,000 --> 0:08:59,000
which Ukrainian Jewish immigrants bring to Brooklyn, New York.

170
0:08:59.848,000 --> 0:09:,000
They sing it in their banquet halls.

171
0:09:02.711,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Sings "Hava Nagila")

172
0:09:09.485,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And their neighbor, an Argentine kid of Italian origin

173
0:09:12.435,000 --> 0:09:14,000
named Astor Piazzolla,

174
0:09:14.725,000 --> 0:09:16,000
hears it,

175
0:09:16.767,000 --> 0:09:17,000
assimilates it

176
0:09:18.318,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and transforms the tango of the second half of the 20th century

177
0:09:21.343,000 --> 0:09:22,000
with his ...

178
0:09:22.52,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Counts out the beats) One two three, one two three, one two.

179
0:09:26.025,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Sings "Adios Nonino")

180
0:09:34.114,000 --> 0:09:38,000
He also played it on his bandoneon, a 19th-century German instrument

181
0:09:38.829,000 --> 0:09:42,000
created for churches that couldn't afford to buy organs,

182
0:09:42.98,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and that ends up, incredibly, in Río de la Plata,

183
0:09:45.371,000 --> 0:09:49,000
forming the very essence of the tango and the milonga,

184
0:09:49.482,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in the very same way another instrument just as important as the bandoneon did:

185
0:09:54.525,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the Spanish guitar.

186
0:09:56.1,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

187
0:10:08.457,000 --> 0:10:1,000
To which, by the way, Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century,

188
0:10:11.305,000 --> 0:10:12,000
added a sixth string.

189
0:10:12.581,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It's amazing how all these things are coming full circle.

190
0:10:15.475,000 --> 0:10:17,000
What have I learned in these 15 years since the song was born

191
0:10:18.379,000 --> 0:10:21,000
from going all over the world with four lines written on a coaster

192
0:10:21.739,000 --> 0:10:22,000
from a bar in Madrid?

193
0:10:24.553,000 --> 0:10:25,000
That Décimas,

194
0:10:26.691,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the milonga,

195
0:10:27.955,000 --> 0:10:28,000
songs, people --

196
0:10:30.461,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the closer you get to them,

197
0:10:32.438,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the more complex their identity becomes,

198
0:10:35.605,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and the more nuances and details appear.

199
0:10:38.818,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I learned that identity is infinitely dense,

200
0:10:41.991,000 --> 0:10:43,000
like an infinite series of real numbers,

201
0:10:44.567,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and that even if you get very close

202
0:10:46.339,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and zoom in,

203
0:10:47.521,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it never ends.

204
0:10:50.467,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Before I sing you a song and say goodbye,

205
0:10:55.064,000 --> 0:10:57,000
allow me to tell you one last story.

206
0:10:57.362,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Not long ago, we were in Mexico after a concert.

207
0:11:02.902,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And since the concert promoters know me,

208
0:11:05.187,000 --> 0:11:08,000
they knew I was a Décima freak and that everywhere I go I ask about it,

209
0:11:09.135,000 --> 0:11:1,000
insisting on hearing Décima artists.

210
0:11:10.897,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So they organized a son jarocho show for me at their house.

211
0:11:16.096,000 --> 0:11:2,000
If you recall, the son jarocho is one of the styles of music

212
0:11:20.735,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that uses Décimas in its verses.

213
0:11:24.552,000 --> 0:11:27,000
When these amazing musicians finished playing

214
0:11:28.388,000 --> 0:11:3,000
what is for me, something amazing, which is the son jarocho,

215
0:11:31.29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
they finished playing and were ...

216
0:11:32.979,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I went up to greet them, really excited,

217
0:11:35.222,000 --> 0:11:39,000
getting ready to thank them for their gift of music,

218
0:11:39.49,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and this young kid says to me --

219
0:11:43.443,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and he says it with the best of intentions -- he says,

220
0:11:46.337,000 --> 0:11:52,000
"We're very proud, sir, to be keeping alive the purest origins

221
0:11:53.325,000 --> 0:11:55,000
of our Mexican identity."

222
0:11:56.418,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And to tell you the truth, I didn't really know what to say.

223
0:11:59.358,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Laughter)

224
0:12:00.411,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I stood there looking at him. I gave him a hug and left, but ...

225
0:12:03.6,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Laughter)

226
0:12:04.89,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But he was right, too, though. Right?

227
0:12:06.899,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In reality, the Décima is its origin, but at the same time,

228
0:12:09.754,000 --> 0:12:11,000
just like in the milonga and in the Décima,

229
0:12:12.148,000 --> 0:12:15,000
are the roots of many more cultures from all over the place, like he said.

230
0:12:18.013,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Later, when I got back to the hotel, I thought about it for a while.

231
0:12:21.714,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And I thought:

232
0:12:22.904,000 --> 0:12:24,000
things only look pure

233
0:12:27.093,000 --> 0:12:29,000
if you look at them from far away.

234
0:12:30.041,000 --> 0:12:33,000
It's very important to know about our roots,

235
0:12:33.41,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to know where we come from, to understand our history.

236
0:12:37.456,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But at the same time, as important as knowing where we're from,

237
0:12:40.478,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is understanding that deep down,

238
0:12:44.078,000 --> 0:12:45,000
we're not completely from one place,

239
0:12:46.062,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and a little from everywhere.

240
0:12:47.711,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Thank you very much.

241
0:12:48.96,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Applause)

242
0:12:58.21,000 --> 0:13:,000
This is "The milonga of the Jewish Moor."

243
0:13:02.178,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Music)

244
0:13:14.636,000 --> 0:13:16,000
(Sings)

245
0:13:16.661,000 --> 0:13:21,000
For every wall a lament in Jerusalem the golden

246
0:13:24.236,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and 1000 wasted lives for every commandment.

247
0:13:31.536,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I am dust in your wind and although I bleed through your wound,

248
0:13:39.047,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and every beloved stone has my deepest affection,

249
0:13:45.748,000 --> 0:13:51,000
there is not a stone in the world worth more than a human life.

250
0:13:54.491,000 --> 0:14:,000
I am a Jewish Moor who lives among Christians

251
0:14:01.834,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.

252
0:14:10.211,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.

253
0:14:19.659,000 --> 0:14:24,000
There is not one death that does not cause me pain, there are no winners

254
0:14:27.02,000 --> 0:14:33,000
there's nothing but suffering and another life blown away.

255
0:14:34.496,000 --> 0:14:39,000
War is a terrible school no matter what the disguise,

256
0:14:41.862,000 --> 0:14:46,000
forgive me for not enlisting under any flag,

257
0:14:48.531,000 --> 0:14:54,000
any daydream is worth more than a sad piece of cloth.

258
0:14:57.126,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I am a Jewish Moor who lives among Christians

259
0:15:04.342,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.

260
0:15:12.511,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.

261
0:15:25.858,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And nobody has my permission for killing in my name,

262
0:15:33.143,000 --> 0:15:39,000
a man is but a man and if there is a God, this was his wish,

263
0:15:40.54,000 --> 0:15:45,000
the very ground I tread will live on, once I am gone

264
0:15:47.912,000 --> 0:15:52,000
on my way to oblivion, and all doctrines will suffer the same fate,

265
0:15:54.126,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and there is not one nation that has not proclaimed itself

266
0:15:59.147,000 --> 0:16:01,000
the chosen people.

267
0:16:03.807,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I am a Jewish Moor who lives among Christians

268
0:16:10.806,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.

269
0:16:19.052,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.

270
0:16:24.903,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I am a Jewish Moor who lives among Christians

271
0:16:32.084,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Applause)

272
0:16:33.508,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Thank you.

273
0:16:34.698,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Applause)

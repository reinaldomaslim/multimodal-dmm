1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You should be nice

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to nerds.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
In fact, I'd go so far as to say,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
if you don't already have a nerd in your life,

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you should get one.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm just saying.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Scientists and engineers

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
change the world.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'd like to tell you

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about a magical place called DARPA

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
where scientists and engineers

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
defy the impossible

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and refuse to fear failure.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now these two ideas

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
are connected more than you may realize,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because when you remove the fear of failure,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
impossible things

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
suddenly become possible.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
If you want to know how,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
ask yourself this question:

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
What would you attempt to do

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
if you knew you could not fail?

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
If you really ask yourself

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
this question,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
you can't help but feel uncomfortable.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I feel a little uncomfortable.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Because when you ask it,

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you begin to understand

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
how the fear of failure constrains you,

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
how it keeps us

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
from attempting great things,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and life gets dull,

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
amazing things stop happening.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Sure, good things happen,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but amazing things

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
stop happening.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now I should be clear,

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I'm not encouraging failure,

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I'm discouraging

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
fear of failure.

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Because it's not failure itself

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that constrains us.

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The path to truly new,

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
never-been-done-before things

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
always has failure along the way.

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We're tested.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And in part, that testing feels an appropriate part

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of achieving something great.

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Clemenceau said,

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"Life gets interesting when we fail,

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
because it's a sign

52
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that we've surpassed ourselves."

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In 1895,

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Lord Kelvin declared

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that heavier-than-air flying machines

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
were impossible.

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In October of 1903,

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the prevailing opinion

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of expert aerodynamicists

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
was that maybe in 10 million years

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we could build an aircraft that would fly.

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And two months later on December 17th,

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Orville Wright powered the first airplane

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
across a beach in North Carolina.

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The flight lasted 12 seconds

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and covered 120 feet.

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That was 1903.

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
One year later,

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the next declarations of impossibilities began.

70
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Ferdinand Foch, a French army general

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in the French army,

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
said, "Airplanes are interesting toys,

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but of no military value."

75
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
40 years later,

76
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
aero experts coined the term transonic.

77
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They debated, should it have one S or two?

78
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime,

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and it wasn't at all clear

80
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.

81
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
In 1947,

82
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
there was no wind tunnel data

83
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
beyond Mach 0.85.

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And yet,

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,

86
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit

87
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of his Bell X-1

88
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and he flew

89
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
towards an unknown possibility,

90
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and in so doing,

91
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
he became the first pilot

92
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to fly faster than the speed of sound.

93
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Six of eight Atlas rockets

94
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
blew up on the pad.

95
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
After 11 complete mission failures,

96
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we got our first images from space.

97
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And on that first flight

98
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we got more data

99
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
than in all U-2 missions combined.

100
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It took a lot of failures

101
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to get there.

102
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Since we took to the sky,

103
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we have wanted to fly

104
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
faster and farther.

105
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And to do so,

106
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we've had to believe in impossible things.

107
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And we've had to refuse

108
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
to fear failure.

109
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
That's still true today.

110
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Today, we don't talk about flying transonically,

111
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or even supersonically,

112
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we talk about flying hypersonically --

113
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
not Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
At Mach 20,

115
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
we can fly from New York to Long Beach

116
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in 11 minutes and 20 seconds.

117
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
At that speed,

118
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the surface of the airfoil

119
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is the temperature of molten steel --

120
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
3,500 degrees Fahrenheit --

121
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
like a blast furnace.

122
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We are essentially burning the airfoil

123
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as we fly it.

124
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And we are flying it,

125
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
or trying to.

126
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle

127
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is the fastest maneuvering aircraft

128
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
ever built.

129
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's boosted to near-space

130
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
atop a Minotaur IV rocket.

131
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse,

132
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
so we have to bleed it off

133
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
by flying the rocket

134
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
at an 89 degree angle of attack

135
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for portions of the trajectory.

136
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
That's an unnatural act

137
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
for a rocket.

138
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The third stage has a camera.

139
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We call it rocketcam.

140
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And it's pointed

141
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
at the hypersonic glider.

142
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This is the actual rocketcam footage

143
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
from flight one.

144
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit.

145
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But this is what it looks like

146
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
from the third stage of the rocket

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
looking at the unmanned glider

148
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
as it heads into the atmosphere

149
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
back towards Earth.

150
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We've flown twice.

151
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
In the first flight,

152
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
no aerodynamic control of the vehicle.

153
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But we collected more hypersonic flight data

154
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
than in 30 years

155
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of ground-based testing combined.

156
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And in the second flight,

157
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
three minutes of fully-controlled,

158
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
aerodynamic flight

159
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
at Mach 20.

160
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We must fly again,

161
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because amazing, never-been-done-before things

162
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
require that you fly.

163
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You can't learn to fly at Mach 20

164
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
unless you fly.

165
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And while there's no substitute for speed,

166
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
maneuverability is a very close second.

167
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds

168
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to get from New York to Long Beach,

169
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
a hummingbird would take,

170
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
well, days.

171
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic,

172
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but they are maneuverable.

173
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In fact, the hummingbird is the only bird

174
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that can fly backwards.

175
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It can fly up, down,

176
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
forwards, backwards,

177
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
even upside-down.

178
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And so if we wanted to fly in this room

179
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
or places where humans can't go,

180
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we'd need an aircraft

181
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
small enough and maneuverable enough

182
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to do so.

183
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This is a hummingbird drone.

184
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It can fly in all directions,

185
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
even backwards.

186
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It can hover and rotate.

187
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This prototype aircraft

188
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is equipped with a video camera.

189
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It weighs less than one AA battery.

190
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It does not eat nectar.

191
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
In 2008,

192
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it flew for a whopping 20 seconds,

193
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a year later, two minutes,

194
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
then six,

195
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
eventually 11.

196
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Many prototypes crashed -- many.

197
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But there's no way

198
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to learn to fly like a hummingbird

199
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
unless you fly.

200
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Applause)

201
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's beautiful, isn't it.

202
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Wow.

203
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's great.

204
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.

205
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Applause)

206
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Failure is part of creating

207
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
new and amazing things.

208
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We cannot both fear failure

209
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and make amazing new things --

210
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
like a robot

211
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
with the stability of a dog on rough terrain,

212
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
or maybe even ice;

213
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
a robot that can run like a cheetah,

214
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or climb stairs like a human

215
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
with the occasional clumsiness of a human.

216
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Or perhaps, Spider Man

217
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
will one day be Gecko Man.

218
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
A gecko can support

219
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
its entire body weight

220
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
with one toe.

221
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
One square millimeter of a gecko's footpad

222
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
has 14,000 hair-like structures

223
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
called setae.

224
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They are used to help it grip to surfaces

225
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
using intermolecular forces.

226
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Today we can manufacture structures

227
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot.

228
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The result,

229
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
a four-by-four-inch

230
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
artificial nano-gecko adhesive.

231
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
can support a static load

232
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
of 660 pounds.

233
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
That's enough to stick

234
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
six 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall,

235
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
no nails.

236
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So much for Velcro, right?

237
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And it's not just passive structures,

238
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it's entire machines.

239
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This is a spider mite.

240
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It's one millimeter long,

241
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
but it looks like Godzilla

242
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
next to these micromachines.

243
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
In the world of Godzilla spider mites,

244
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
we can make millions of mirrors,

245
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
each one-fifth the diameter

246
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
of a human hair,

247
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second

248
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to make large screen displays,

249
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
so that we can watch movies like "Godzilla"

250
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in high-def.

251
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And if we can build machines

252
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
at that scale,

253
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
what about Eiffel Tower-like trusses

254
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
at the microscale?

255
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Today we are making metals

256
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that are lighter than Styrofoam,

257
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
so light

258
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
they can sit atop a dandelion puff

259
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and be blown away

260
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
with a wisp of air --

261
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
so light

262
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that you can make a car that two people can lift,

263
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but so strong

264
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV.

265
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
From the smallest wisp of air

266
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to the powerful forces of nature's storms.

267
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
There are 44 lightning strikes per second

268
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
around the globe.

269
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Each lightning bolt heats the air

270
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit --

271
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
hotter than the surface of the Sun.

272
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
What if we could use

273
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
these electromagnetic pulses

274
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
as beacons,

275
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
beacons in a moving network

276
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
of powerful transmitters?

277
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Experiments suggest

278
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that lightning could be the next GPS.

279
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains.

280
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Using a grid the size of your thumb,

281
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
with 32 electrodes

282
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
on the surface of his brain,

283
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Tim uses his thoughts

284
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to control an advanced prosthetic arm.

285
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And his thoughts

286
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
made him reach for Katie.

287
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
This is the first time

288
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
a human has controlled a robot

289
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
with thought alone.

290
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And it is the first time

291
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that Tim has held Katie's hand

292
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in seven years.

293
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
That moment mattered

294
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to Tim and Katie,

295
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and this green goo

296
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
may someday matter to you.

297
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
This green goo

298
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.

299
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It was made in tobacco plants.

300
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Tobacco plants

301
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
can make millions of doses of vaccine

302
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
in weeks instead of months,

303
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and it might just be

304
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the first healthy use of tobacco ever.

305
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And if it seems far-fetched

306
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that tobacco plants could make people healthy,

307
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
what about gamers that could solve problems

308
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that experts can't solve?

309
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Last September,

310
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the gamers of Foldit

311
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
solved the three-dimensional structure

312
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
of the retroviral protease

313
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.

314
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now understanding this structure

315
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
is very important for developing treatments.

316
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
For 15 years,

317
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
it was unsolved

318
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in the scientific community.

319
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The gamers of Foldit

320
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
solved it in 15 days.

321
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Now they were able to do so

322
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
by working together.

323
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
They were able to work together

324
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because they're connected by the Internet.

325
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And others, also connected to the Internet,

326
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
used it as an instrument of democracy.

327
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And together

328
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
they changed the fate of their nation.

329
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
The Internet is home to two billion people,

330
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
or 30 percent of the world's population.

331
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It allows us to contribute

332
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and to be heard

333
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
as individuals.

334
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It allows us to amplify

335
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
our voices and our power

336
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
as a group.

337
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
But it too had humble beginnings.

338
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
In 1969, the internet was but a dream,

339
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
a few sketches on a piece of paper.

340
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And then on October 29th,

341
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
the first packet-switched message was sent

342
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
from UCLA to SRI.

343
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
The first two letters of the word "Login,"

344
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that's all that made it through --

345
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
an L and an O --

346
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and then a buffer overflow crashed the system.

347
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

348
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Two letters,

349
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
an L and an O,

350
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
now a worldwide force.

351
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So who are these scientists and engineers

352
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
at a magical place called DARPA?

353
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
They are nerds,

354
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and they are heroes among us.

355
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
They challenge existing perspectives

356
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
at the edges of science

357
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and under the most demanding of conditions.

358
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
They remind us

359
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
that we can change the world

360
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
if we defy the impossible

361
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and we refuse to fear failure.

362
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
They remind us

363
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that we all have nerd power.

364
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Sometimes we just forget.

365
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
You see, there was a time

366
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
when you weren't afraid of failure,

367
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
when you were a great artist or a great dancer

368
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and you could sing, you were good at math,

369
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
you could build things, you were an astronaut,

370
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
an adventurer, Jacques Cousteau,

371
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
you could jump higher, run faster,

372
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
kick harder than anyone.

373
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
You believed in impossible things

374
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and you were fearless.

375
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
You were totally and completely in touch

376
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
with your inner superhero.

377
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Scientists and engineers

378
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
can indeed change the world.

379
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
So can you.

380
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
You were born to.

381
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
So go ahead,

382
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
ask yourself,

383
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
what would you attempt to do

384
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
if you knew you could not fail?

385
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Now I want to say,

386
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
this is not easy.

387
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
It's hard to hold onto this feeling,

388
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
really hard.

389
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I guess in some way,

390
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard.

391
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Doubt and fear always creep in.

392
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
We think someone else, someone smarter than us,

393
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
someone more capable,

394
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
someone with more resources will solve that problem.

395
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
But there isn't anyone else;

396
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
there's just you.

397
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And if we're lucky,

398
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
in that moment,

399
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
someone steps into that doubt and fear,

400
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
takes a hand and says,

401
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
"Let me help you believe."

402
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Jason Harley did that for me.

403
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Jason started at DARPA

404
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
on March 18th, 2010.

405
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
He was with our transportation team.

406
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I saw Jason nearly every day,

407
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
sometimes twice a day.

408
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And more so than most,

409
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
he saw the highs and the lows,

410
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
the celebrations and the disappointments.

411
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And on one particularly dark day for me,

412
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Jason sat down

413
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and he wrote an email.

414
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
He was encouraging,

415
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
but firm.

416
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
And when he hit send,

417
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.

418
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
It mattered to me.

419
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
In that moment

420
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and still today

421
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
when I doubt,

422
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
when I feel afraid,

423
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
when I need to reconnect

424
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
with that feeling,

425
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
I remember his words,

426
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
they were so powerful.

427
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Text: "There is only time enough to iron your cape

428
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
and back to the skies for you."

429
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000

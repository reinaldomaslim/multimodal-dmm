1
0:00:12.944,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want you to imagine that you are a Child Protective Services worker.

2
0:00:17.563,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And you have to respond to a report of child abuse.

3
0:00:21.159,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You walk into a home, unannounced, unexpected, certainly uninvited.

4
0:00:27.189,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The first thing you see is a mattress in the middle of the room, on the floor.

5
0:00:30.927,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Three kids lying on it, asleep.

6
0:00:33.982,000 --> 0:00:36,000
There's a small table nearby with a couple of ashtrays,

7
0:00:37.562,000 --> 0:00:38,000
empty beer cans.

8
0:00:40.268,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Large rat traps are set in the corner,

9
0:00:42.871,000 --> 0:00:45,000
not too far from where the kids lie asleep.

10
0:00:46.061,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So you make a note.

11
0:00:49.173,000 --> 0:00:52,000
A part of your job is walking through the entire home.

12
0:00:52.371,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So you start with the kitchen, where there's very little food.

13
0:00:56.315,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You notice another mattress in the bedroom, on the floor,

14
0:00:59.617,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that the mother shares with her infant child.

15
0:01:04.419,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, generally, at this point, two things may happen.

16
0:01:08.649,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The children are deemed unsafe and removed from the home,

17
0:01:12.167,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and placed in state custody for a specified period of time.

18
0:01:16.657,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Or the children remain with their family

19
0:01:19.898,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and the child welfare system provides help and support.

20
0:01:25.699,000 --> 0:01:27,000
When I was a Child Protective Services worker,

21
0:01:27.866,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I saw things like this all the time.

22
0:01:30.474,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Some far better, some far worse.

23
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I asked you to imagine yourself in that home,

24
0:01:36.022,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because I wonder what crossed your mind.

25
0:01:38.459,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What guides your decisions?

26
0:01:40.729,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What's going to impact your opinion of that family?

27
0:01:44.539,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What race, ethnicity, did you think the family was?

28
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I want you to realize that if those children were white,

29
0:01:53.109,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it is more likely that their family stays together after that visit.

30
0:01:58.601,000 --> 0:02:,000
Research done at the University of Pennsylvania

31
0:02:00.863,000 --> 0:02:04,000
found that white families, on average, have access to more help and more support

32
0:02:05.696,000 --> 0:02:06,000
from the child welfare system.

33
0:02:07.632,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And their cases are less likely to go through a full investigation.

34
0:02:14.333,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But on the other hand, if those kids are black,

35
0:02:17.976,000 --> 0:02:19,000
they are four times more likely to be removed,

36
0:02:20.887,000 --> 0:02:23,000
they spend longer periods of time in foster care,

37
0:02:24.188,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and it's harder to find them a stable foster placement.

38
0:02:29.299,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Foster care is meant to be an immediate shelter of protection

39
0:02:32.212,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for kids who are at high risk.

40
0:02:33.887,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But it's also a confusing and traumatic exit from the family.

41
0:02:39.027,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Research done at the University of Minnesota

42
0:02:41.162,000 --> 0:02:43,000
found that kids who went through foster care

43
0:02:43.701,000 --> 0:02:46,000
had more behavioral problems and internalized issues

44
0:02:46.932,000 --> 0:02:5,000
than kids who remain with their families while receiving help and support.

45
0:02:52.691,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The scenario I mentioned earlier is not uncommon.

46
0:02:55.405,000 --> 0:02:57,000
A single mother, living in low-income housing

47
0:02:57.762,000 --> 0:02:58,000
with her four children.

48
0:02:59.695,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the rats make it almost impossible to keep food,

49
0:03:02.328,000 --> 0:03:04,000
let alone fresh food in the home.

50
0:03:05.792,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Does that mother deserve to have her children taken from her?

51
0:03:10.934,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Emma Ketteringham, a family court attorney,

52
0:03:13.211,000 --> 0:03:15,000
says that if you live in a poor neighborhood,

53
0:03:16.109,000 --> 0:03:17,000
then you better be a perfect parent.

54
0:03:19.109,000 --> 0:03:22,000
She says that we place unfair, often unreachable standards

55
0:03:22.889,000 --> 0:03:24,000
on parents who are raising their kids with very little money.

56
0:03:26.199,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And their neighborhood and ethnicity

57
0:03:28.834,000 --> 0:03:3,000
impact whether or not their kids are removed.

58
0:03:33.783,000 --> 0:03:35,000
In the two years I spent on the front lines of child welfare,

59
0:03:36.675,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I made high-stakes decisions.

60
0:03:38.292,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I saw firsthand how my personal values impacted my work.

61
0:03:42.736,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now, as social work faculty at Florida State University,

62
0:03:47.053,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I lead an institute

63
0:03:48.228,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that curates the most innovative and effective child welfare research.

64
0:03:52.486,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And research tells us that there are twice as many black kids in foster care,

65
0:03:57.24,000 --> 0:03:58,000
twenty-eight percent,

66
0:03:59.161,000 --> 0:04:02,000
than there are in the general population, 14 percent.

67
0:04:03.673,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And although there are several reasons why,

68
0:04:05.76,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I want to discuss one reason today:

69
0:04:08.022,000 --> 0:04:09,000
implicit bias.

70
0:04:10.815,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Let's start with "implicit."

71
0:04:12.411,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's subconscious, something you're not aware of.

72
0:04:16.752,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Bias -- those stereotypes and attitudes

73
0:04:19.039,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that we all have about certain groups of people.

74
0:04:22.021,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So, implicit bias is what lurks in the background

75
0:04:25.036,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of every decision that we make.

76
0:04:28.608,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So how can we fix it?

77
0:04:30.973,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I have a promising solution that I want to share.

78
0:04:34.671,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Now, in almost every state,

79
0:04:36.043,000 --> 0:04:39,000
there are high numbers of black kids going into foster care.

80
0:04:40.206,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But data revealed that Nassau County,

81
0:04:43.357,000 --> 0:04:44,000
a community in New York,

82
0:04:45.024,000 --> 0:04:48,000
had managed to decrease the number of black kids being removed.

83
0:04:48.921,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And in 2016, I went into that community with my team

84
0:04:54.076,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and led a research study,

85
0:04:55.917,000 --> 0:04:58,000
discovering the use of blind removal meetings.

86
0:04:59.887,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is how it works.

87
0:05:02.014,000 --> 0:05:04,000
A case worker responds to a report of child abuse.

88
0:05:05.196,000 --> 0:05:06,000
They go out to the home,

89
0:05:06.609,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but before the children are removed,

90
0:05:08.696,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the case worker must come back to the office

91
0:05:11.117,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and present what they found.

92
0:05:13.22,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But here's the distinction:

93
0:05:14.934,000 --> 0:05:15,000
When they present to the committee,

94
0:05:16.753,000 --> 0:05:19,000
they delete names, ethnicity, neighborhood, race,

95
0:05:20.726,000 --> 0:05:21,000
all identifiable information.

96
0:05:23.297,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They focus on what happened, family strength, relevant history

97
0:05:29.077,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and the parents' ability to protect the child.

98
0:05:32.815,000 --> 0:05:35,000
With that information, the committee makes a recommendation,

99
0:05:36.212,000 --> 0:05:38,000
never knowing the race of the family.

100
0:05:40.3,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Blind removals have made a drastic impact in that community.

101
0:05:44.125,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In 2011, 57 percent of the kids going into foster care were black.

102
0:05:49.712,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But after five years of blind removals, that is down to 21 percent.

103
0:05:54.667,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Applause)

104
0:06:01.151,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Here's what we learned from talking to some of the case workers.

105
0:06:04.916,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"When a family has a history with the department,

106
0:06:07.908,000 --> 0:06:09,000
many of us hold that history against them,

107
0:06:10.583,000 --> 0:06:12,000
even if they're trying to do things differently."

108
0:06:13.892,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"When I see a case from a certain apartment building,

109
0:06:16.534,000 --> 0:06:17,000
neighborhood or zip code,

110
0:06:18.535,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I just automatically think the worst."

111
0:06:22.034,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"Child welfare is very subjective, because it's an emotional field.

112
0:06:26.114,000 --> 0:06:29,000
There's no one who doesn't have emotions around this work.

113
0:06:29.25,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it's very hard to leave all of your stuff at the door

114
0:06:32.17,000 --> 0:06:33,000
when you do this work.

115
0:06:33.432,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So let's take the subjectivity of race and neighborhood out of it,

116
0:06:38.72,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and you might get different outcomes."

117
0:06:42.72,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Blind removals seem to be bringing us closer

118
0:06:45.502,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to solving the problem of implicit bias in foster-care decisions.

119
0:06:50.49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
My next step is figuring out

120
0:06:52.838,000 --> 0:06:54,000
how to use artificial intelligence and machine learning

121
0:06:55.823,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to bring this project to scale

122
0:06:57.855,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and make it more accessible to other states.

123
0:07:00.514,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I know we can transform child welfare.

124
0:07:03.522,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We can hold organizations accountable

125
0:07:05.712,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to developing the social consciousness of their employees.

126
0:07:09.292,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We can hold ourselves accountable

127
0:07:11.006,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to making sure our decisions are driven by ethics and safety.

128
0:07:15.419,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Let's imagine a child welfare system that focuses on partnering with parents,

129
0:07:21.008,000 --> 0:07:22,000
empowering families,

130
0:07:22.555,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and no longer see poverty as failure.

131
0:07:26.666,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Let's work together to build a system

132
0:07:29.238,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that wants to make families stronger instead of pulling them apart.

133
0:07:34.563,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Thank you.

134
0:07:35.762,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Applause) (Cheering)

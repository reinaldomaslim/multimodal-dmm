1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Humans in the developed world

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
where they breathe in and come into contact

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
microorganisms.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Buildings are complex ecosystems

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that are an important source

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of microbes that are good for us,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and some that are bad for us.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
What determines the types and distributions

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
of microbes indoors?

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that enter through windows

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and through mechanical ventilation systems.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And they are brought inside

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
by humans and other creatures.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The fate of microbes indoors

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
depends on complex interactions

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
with humans,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and with the human-built environment.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And today, architects and biologists

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
are working together

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to explore smart building design

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that will create

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
healthy buildings for us.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We spend an extraordinary amount of time

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in buildings

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that are extremely controlled environments,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
like this building here --

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
environments that have mechanical ventilation systems

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that include filtering,

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
heating and air conditioning.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors,

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it's important to understand

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
how this affects our health.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
At the Biology and the Built Environment Center,

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we carried out a study in a hospital

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
where we sampled air

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and pulled the DNA

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
out of microbes in the air.

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And we looked at three different types of rooms.

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated,

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which are the data points in the blue.

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated,

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in a wing of the building

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and pry open the windows

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that were no longer operable,

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but they made them operable for our study.

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And we also sampled the outdoor air.

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
If you look at the x-axis of this graph,

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you'll see that what we commonly want to do --

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
which is keeping the outdoors out --

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So if you look at the green data points,

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which is air that's outside,

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity,

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or variety of microbial types.

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But if you look at the blue data points,

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which is mechanically ventilated air,

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it's not as diverse.

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But being less diverse

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is not necessarily good for our health.

64
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
If you look at the y-axis of this graph,

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air,

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
you have a higher probability

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of encountering a potential pathogen,

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or germ,

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
than if you're outdoors.

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So to understand why this was the case,

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
we took our data

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and put it into an ordination diagram,

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which is a statistical map

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that tells you something

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
about how related the microbial communities are

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in the different samples.

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The data points that are closer together

78
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
have microbial communities that are more similar

79
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
than data points that are far apart.

80
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And the first things that you can see from this graph

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is, if you look at the blue data points,

82
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which are the mechanically ventilated air,

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
they're not simply a subset of the green data points,

84
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
which are the outdoor air.

85
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
looks like humans.

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It has microbes on it

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that are commonly associated with our skin

89
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and with our mouth, our spit.

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And this is because

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we're all constantly shedding microbes.

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So all of you right now

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
are sharing your microbes with one another.

94
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And when you're outdoors,

95
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that type of air has microbes

96
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Why does this matter?

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
It matters because the health care industry

99
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is the second most energy intensive industry

100
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in the United States.

101
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Hospitals use two and a half times

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the amount of energy as office buildings.

103
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And the model that we're working with

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
in hospitals,

105
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and also with many, many different buildings,

106
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is to keep the outdoors out.

107
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And this model

108
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
may not necessarily be the best for our health.

109
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And given the extraordinary amount

110
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of nosocomial infections,

111
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or hospital-acquired infections,

112
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
this is a clue that it's a good time

113
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to reconsider our current practices.

114
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So just as we manage national parks,

115
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
where we promote the growth of some species

116
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and we inhibit the growth of others,

117
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we're working towards thinking about buildings

118
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
using an ecosystem framework

119
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
where we can promote the kinds of microbes

120
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that we want to have indoors.

121
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I've heard somebody say

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that you're as healthy as your gut.

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt

124
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
so they can promote a healthy gut flora.

125
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And what we ultimately want to do

126
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is to be able to use this concept

127
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to promote a healthy group

128
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
of microorganisms inside.

129
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Thank you.

130
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

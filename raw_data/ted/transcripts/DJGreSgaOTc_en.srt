1
0:00:12.08,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Cyndi Stivers: So, future of storytelling.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Before we do the future,

3
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
let's talk about what is never going to change about storytelling.

4
0:00:19.92,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Shonda Rhimes: What's never going to change.

5
0:00:22.04,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Obviously, I think good stories are never going to change,

6
0:00:24.8,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the need for people to gather together and exchange their stories

7
0:00:28.6,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and to talk about the things that feel universal,

8
0:00:31.84,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the idea that we all feel a compelling need to watch stories,

9
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to tell stories, to share stories --

10
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:39,000
sort of the gathering around the campfire

11
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to discuss the things that tell each one of us

12
0:00:42.32,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that we are not alone in the world.

13
0:00:44.88,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Those things to me are never going to change.

14
0:00:47.04,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That essence of storytelling is never going to change.

15
0:00:50.88,000 --> 0:00:52,000
CS: OK. In preparation for this conversation,

16
0:00:53.76,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I checked in with Susan Lyne,

17
0:00:55.68,000 --> 0:00:57,000
who was running ABC Entertainment

18
0:00:57.8,000 --> 0:00:59,000
when you were working on "Grey's Anatomy" --

19
0:01:00.6,000 --> 0:01:01,000
SR: Yes.

20
0:01:01.84,000 --> 0:01:03,000
CS: And she said that there was this indelible memory she had

21
0:01:04.76,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of your casting process,

22
0:01:06.76,000 --> 0:01:08,000
where without discussing it with any of the executives,

23
0:01:09.44,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you got people coming in to read for your scripts,

24
0:01:11.84,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and every one of them was the full range of humanity,

25
0:01:15.96,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you did not type anyone in any way,

26
0:01:19.24,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and that it was completely surprising.

27
0:01:22.08,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So she said, in addition to retraining the studio executives,

28
0:01:26.76,000 --> 0:01:28,000
you also, she feels,

29
0:01:28.88,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I think this is -- I agree,

30
0:01:31.44,000 --> 0:01:35,000
retrained the expectations of the American TV audience.

31
0:01:36.36,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So what else does the audience not yet realize that it needs?

32
0:01:42.48,000 --> 0:01:43,000
SR: What else does it not yet realize?

33
0:01:44.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Well, I mean, I don't think we're anywhere near there yet.

34
0:01:47.52,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I mean, we're still in a place

35
0:01:49.28,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in which we're far, far behind what looks like the real world in actuality.

36
0:01:56.24,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I wasn't bringing in a bunch of actors

37
0:01:59.96,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who looked very different from one another

38
0:02:02.6,000 --> 0:02:04,000
simply because I was trying to make a point,

39
0:02:04.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I wasn't trying to do anything special.

40
0:02:07.08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It never occurred to me that that was new, different or weird.

41
0:02:11.08,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I just brought in actors because I thought they were interesting

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and to me, the idea that it was completely surprising to everybody --

43
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I didn't know that for a while.

44
0:02:20.199,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I just thought: these are the actors I want to see play these parts.

45
0:02:23.44,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I want to see what they look like if they read.

46
0:02:25.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We'll see what happens.

47
0:02:26.96,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So I think the interesting thing that happens is

48
0:02:30.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that when you look at the world through another lens,

49
0:02:32.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when you're not the person normally in charge of things,

50
0:02:37.2,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it just comes out a different way.

51
0:02:40.4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
CS: So you now have this big machine that you run,

52
0:02:44.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
as a titan -- as you know, last year when she gave her talk --

53
0:02:47.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
she's a titan.

54
0:02:49.84,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So what do you think is going to happen as we go on?

55
0:02:53.24,000 --> 0:02:57,000
There's a huge amount of money involved in producing these shows.

56
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
While the tools of making stories have gone and gotten greatly democratized,

57
0:03:04.4,000 --> 0:03:06,000
there's still this large distribution:

58
0:03:06.96,000 --> 0:03:11,000
people who rent networks, who rent the audience to advertisers

59
0:03:12.08,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and make it all pay.

60
0:03:13.8,000 --> 0:03:18,000
How do you see the business model changing now that anyone can be a storyteller?

61
0:03:19.04,000 --> 0:03:2,000
SR: I think it's changing every day.

62
0:03:20.8,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I mean, the rapid, rapid change that's happening is amazing.

63
0:03:23.76,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And I feel -- the panic is palpable,

64
0:03:27.12,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and I don't mean that in a bad way.

65
0:03:28.96,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I think it's kind of exciting.

66
0:03:30.64,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The idea that there's sort of an equalizer happening,

67
0:03:35.32,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that sort of means that anybody can make something, is wonderful.

68
0:03:39.12,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I think there's some scary in the idea that you can't find the good work now.

69
0:03:44.88,000 --> 0:03:45,000
There's so much work out there.

70
0:03:46.4,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I think there's something like 417 dramas on television right now

71
0:03:49.52,000 --> 0:03:51,000
at any given time in any given place,

72
0:03:52.08,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but you can't find them.

73
0:03:53.36,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You can't find the good ones.

74
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So there's a lot of bad stuff out there because everybody can make something.

75
0:03:58.48,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's like if everybody painted a painting.

76
0:04:00.52,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You know, there's not that many good painters.

77
0:04:03.04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But finding the good stories, the good shows,

78
0:04:06.08,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is harder and harder and harder.

79
0:04:07.68,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because if you have one tiny show over here on AMC

80
0:04:10.32,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and one tiny show over here over there,

81
0:04:12.24,000 --> 0:04:14,000
finding where they are becomes much harder.

82
0:04:14.6,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So I think that ferreting out the gems

83
0:04:16.48,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and finding out who made the great webisode and who made this,

84
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it's -- I mean, think about the poor critics

85
0:04:21.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
who now are spending 24 hours a day

86
0:04:23.44,000 --> 0:04:25,000
trapped in their homes watching everything.

87
0:04:25.52,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's not an easy job right now.

88
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So the distribution engines are getting more and more vast,

89
0:04:31.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but finding the good programming for everybody in the audience

90
0:04:34.2,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is getting harder.

91
0:04:35.44,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And unlike the news,

92
0:04:37.24,000 --> 0:04:4,000
where everything's getting winnowed down to just who you are,

93
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:41,000
television seems to be getting --

94
0:04:42.44,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and by television I mean anything you can watch, television shows on --

95
0:04:46.4,000 --> 0:04:48,000
seems to be getting wider and wider and wider.

96
0:04:48.64,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And so anybody's making stories,

97
0:04:51.32,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and the geniuses are sometimes hidden.

98
0:04:53.64,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But it's going to be harder to find,

99
0:04:56.44,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and at some point that will collapse.

100
0:04:58.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
People keep talking about peak TV.

101
0:05:00.24,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I don't know when that's going to happen.

102
0:05:02.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I think at some point it'll collapse a little bit

103
0:05:04.72,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and we'll, sort of, come back together.

104
0:05:06.64,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I don't know if it will be network television.

105
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I don't know if that model is sustainable.

106
0:05:11.44,000 --> 0:05:12,000
CS: What about the model

107
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that Amazon and Netflix are throwing a lot of money around right now.

108
0:05:19.52,000 --> 0:05:21,000
SR: That is true.

109
0:05:21.84,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I think it's an interesting model.

110
0:05:23.52,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I think there's something exciting about it.

111
0:05:25.64,000 --> 0:05:28,000
For content creators, I think there's something exciting about it.

112
0:05:28.8,000 --> 0:05:3,000
For the world, I think there's something exciting about it.

113
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The idea that there are programs now

114
0:05:33.32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that can be in multiple languages with characters from all over the world

115
0:05:36.8,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that are appealing and come out for everybody at the same time

116
0:05:39.8,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is exciting.

117
0:05:41.24,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I mean, I think the international sense that television can now take on

118
0:05:45.76,000 --> 0:05:46,000
makes sense to me,

119
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that programming can now take on.

120
0:05:48.64,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Television so much is made for, like -- here's our American audience.

121
0:05:51.92,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We make these shows,

122
0:05:53.2,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and then they shove them out into the world

123
0:05:55.24,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and hope for the best,

124
0:05:56.56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
as opposed to really thinking about the fact that America is not it.

125
0:06:00.52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I mean, we love ourselves and everything, but it's not i.

126
0:06:03.28,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And we should be taking into account the fact

127
0:06:06.48,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that there are all of these other places in the world

128
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that we should be interested in while we're telling stories.

129
0:06:12.04,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It makes the world smaller.

130
0:06:15.52,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I don't know.

131
0:06:16.76,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I think it pushes forward the idea that the world is a universal place,

132
0:06:21.76,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and our stories become universal things.

133
0:06:23.72,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We stop being other.

134
0:06:25.64,000 --> 0:06:28,000
CS: You've pioneered, as far as I can see,

135
0:06:29.48,000 --> 0:06:31,000
interesting ways to launch new shows, too.

136
0:06:32.12,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I mean, when you launched "Scandal" in 2012,

137
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
there was this amazing groundswell of support on Twitter

138
0:06:38.64,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the likes of which nobody had seen before.

139
0:06:41.8,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve

140
0:06:44.24,000 --> 0:06:46,000
when you launch your next one?

141
0:06:46.4,000 --> 0:06:48,000
What do you think will happen in that regard?

142
0:06:48.56,000 --> 0:06:5,000
SR: We do have some interesting ideas.

143
0:06:51.04,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We have a show called "Still Star-Crossed" coming out this summer.

144
0:06:54.2,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We have some interesting ideas for that.

145
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do them in time.

146
0:06:58.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I thought they were fun.

147
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But the idea that we would live-tweet our show

148
0:07:02.36,000 --> 0:07:04,000
was really just us thinking that would be fun.

149
0:07:04.56,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We didn't realize that the critics would start to live-tweet along with us.

150
0:07:08.12,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But the fans -- getting people to be a part of it,

151
0:07:10.52,000 --> 0:07:11,000
making it more of a campfire --

152
0:07:12.08,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you know, when you're all on Twitter together

153
0:07:14.24,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and you're all talking together,

154
0:07:15.84,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it is more of a shared experience,

155
0:07:17.52,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and finding other ways to make that possible

156
0:07:19.68,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and finding other ways to make people feel engaged

157
0:07:22.04,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is important.

158
0:07:24.32,000 --> 0:07:27,000
CS: So when you have all those different people making stories

159
0:07:28.96,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and only some of them are going to break through

160
0:07:31.28,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and get that audience somehow,

161
0:07:33.08,000 --> 0:07:35,000
how do you think storytellers will get paid?

162
0:07:36.08,000 --> 0:07:38,000
SR: I actually have been struggling with this concept as well.

163
0:07:39.04,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Is it going to be a subscriber model?

164
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Are people going to say, like, I'm going to watch this particular person's shows,

165
0:07:45.84,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and that's how we're going to do it?

166
0:07:47.6,000 --> 0:07:49,000
CS: I think we should buy a passport to Shondaland. Right?

167
0:07:50.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
SR: I don't know about that, but yeah. That's a lot more work for me.

168
0:07:53.64,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I do think that there are going to be different ways,

169
0:07:56.48,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but I don't know necessarily.

170
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:,000
I mean, I'll be honest and say a lot of content creators

171
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:03,000
are not necessarily interested in being distributors,

172
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:07,000
mainly because what I dream of doing

173
0:08:07.36,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is creating content.

174
0:08:08.8,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I really love to create content.

175
0:08:10.68,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I want to get paid for it

176
0:08:11.92,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and I want to get paid the money that I deserve to get paid for it,

177
0:08:15.12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and there's a hard part in finding that.

178
0:08:17.08,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But I also want it to be made possible

179
0:08:19.64,000 --> 0:08:21,000
for, you know, the people who work with me,

180
0:08:22.64,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the people who work for me,

181
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
everybody to sort of get paid in a way, and they're all making a living.

182
0:08:27.4,000 --> 0:08:3,000
How it gets distributed is getting harder and harder.

183
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
CS: How about the many new tools,

184
0:08:34.64,000 --> 0:08:37,000
you know, VR, AR ...

185
0:08:37.88,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I find it fascinating that you can't really binge-watch,

186
0:08:41.92,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you can't fast-forward in those things.

187
0:08:45.2,000 --> 0:08:48,000
What do you see as the future of those for storytelling?

188
0:08:48.36,000 --> 0:08:5,000
SR: I spent a lot of time in the past year

189
0:08:51.12,000 --> 0:08:52,000
just exploring those,

190
0:08:52.72,000 --> 0:08:54,000
getting lots of demonstrations and paying attention.

191
0:08:55.4,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I find them fascinating,

192
0:08:57.24,000 --> 0:08:58,000
mainly because I think that --

193
0:08:59.24,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I think most people think of them for gaming,

194
0:09:01.56,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I think most people think of them for things like action,

195
0:09:04.28,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and I think that there is a sense of intimacy

196
0:09:06.96,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that is very present in those things,

197
0:09:10.88,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the idea that -- picture this,

198
0:09:13.4,000 --> 0:09:16,000
you can sit there and have a conversation with Fitz,

199
0:09:16.92,000 --> 0:09:18,000
or at least sit there while Fitz talks to you,

200
0:09:19.12,000 --> 0:09:2,000
President Fitzgerald Grant III,

201
0:09:21.04,000 --> 0:09:22,000
while he talks to you

202
0:09:22.36,000 --> 0:09:24,000
about why he's making a choice that he makes,

203
0:09:24.52,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and it's a very heartfelt moment.

204
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And instead of you watching a television screen,

205
0:09:28.76,000 --> 0:09:31,000
you're sitting there next to him, and he's having this conversation.

206
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now, you fall in love with the man

207
0:09:33.68,000 --> 0:09:35,000
while he's doing it from a television screen.

208
0:09:35.84,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Imagine sitting next to him,

209
0:09:37.24,000 --> 0:09:41,000
or being with a character like Huck who's about to execute somebody.

210
0:09:41.32,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And instead of having a scene

211
0:09:42.84,000 --> 0:09:45,000
where, you know, he's talking to another character very rapidly,

212
0:09:46.68,000 --> 0:09:49,000
he goes into a closet and turns to you and tells you, you know,

213
0:09:50.08,000 --> 0:09:52,000
what's going to happen and why he's afraid and nervous.

214
0:09:52.72,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It's a little more like theater, and I'm not sure it would work,

215
0:09:55.76,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but I'm fascinating by the concept of something like that

216
0:09:58.48,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and what that would mean for an audience.

217
0:10:00.48,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And to get to play with those ideas would be interesting,

218
0:10:03.2,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and I think, you know, for my audience, the people who watch my shows,

219
0:10:07.64,000 --> 0:10:09,000
which is, you know, women 12 to 75,

220
0:10:09.96,000 --> 0:10:11,000
there's something interesting in there for them.

221
0:10:14.72,000 --> 0:10:16,000
CS: And how about the input of the audience?

222
0:10:17.52,000 --> 0:10:18,000
How interested are you in the things

223
0:10:19.36,000 --> 0:10:22,000
where the audience can actually go up to a certain point

224
0:10:22.52,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and then decide, oh wait, I'm going to choose my own adventure.

225
0:10:26.2,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I'm going to run off with Fitz or I'm going to run off with --

226
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
SR: Oh, the choose- your-own-adventure stories.

227
0:10:31.4,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I have a hard time with those,

228
0:10:32.88,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and not necessarily because I want to be in control of everything,

229
0:10:36.04,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but because when I'm watching television or I'm watching a movie,

230
0:10:39.44,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I know for a fact that a story is not as good

231
0:10:44.28,000 --> 0:10:46,000
when I have control over exactly what's going to happen

232
0:10:47.08,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to somebody else's character.

233
0:10:48.84,000 --> 0:10:51,000
You know, if I could tell you exactly what I wanted to happen to Walter White,

234
0:10:52.64,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that's great, but the story is not the same, and it's not as powerful.

235
0:10:56.24,000 --> 0:10:58,000
You know, if I'm in charge of how "The Sopranos" ends,

236
0:10:58.84,000 --> 0:11:01,000
then that's lovely and I have an ending that's nice and satisfying,

237
0:11:02.04,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but it's not the same story and it's not the same emotional impact.

238
0:11:05.24,000 --> 0:11:08,000
CS: I can't stop imagining what that might be.

239
0:11:08.64,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Sorry, you're losing me for a minute.

240
0:11:10.48,000 --> 0:11:12,000
SR: But what's wonderful is I don't get to imagine it,

241
0:11:13.08,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because Vince has his own ending,

242
0:11:15.24,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and it makes it really powerful to know that somebody else has told.

243
0:11:18.8,000 --> 0:11:2,000
You know, if you could decide that, you know,

244
0:11:21.08,000 --> 0:11:23,000
in "Jaws," the shark wins or something,

245
0:11:23.32,000 --> 0:11:26,000
it doesn't do what it needs to do for you.

246
0:11:26.44,000 --> 0:11:27,000
The story is the story that is told,

247
0:11:28.179,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and you can walk away angry and you can walk away debating

248
0:11:30.92,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and you can walk away arguing,

249
0:11:32.4,000 --> 0:11:33,000
but that's why it works.

250
0:11:34.28,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That is why it's art.

251
0:11:35.56,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Otherwise, it's just a game,

252
0:11:37.4,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and games can be art, but in a very different way.

253
0:11:40.44,000 --> 0:11:43,000
CS: Gamers who actually sell the right to sit there

254
0:11:44.04,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and comment on what's happening,

255
0:11:46.2,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to me that's more community than storytelling.

256
0:11:49.2,000 --> 0:11:5,000
SR: And that is its own form of campfire.

257
0:11:51.2,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I don't discount that as a form of storytelling,

258
0:11:54.36,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but it is a group form, I suppose.

259
0:11:58.2,000 --> 0:12:01,000
CS: All right, what about the super-super --

260
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the fact that everything's getting shorter, shorter, shorter.

261
0:12:04.92,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And, you know, Snapchat now has something it calls shows

262
0:12:08.2,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that are one minute long.

263
0:12:11.08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
SR: It's interesting.

264
0:12:14.88,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Part of me thinks it sounds like commercials.

265
0:12:18.32,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I mean, it does -- like, sponsored by.

266
0:12:21.12,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But part of me also gets it completely.

267
0:12:23.76,000 --> 0:12:25,000
There's something really wonderful about it.

268
0:12:25.88,000 --> 0:12:26,000
If you think about a world

269
0:12:27.2,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in which most people are watching television on their phones,

270
0:12:30.12,000 --> 0:12:31,000
if you think about a place like India,

271
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:33,000
where most of the input is coming in

272
0:12:33.76,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and that's where most of the product is coming in,

273
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
shorter makes sense.

274
0:12:37.44,000 --> 0:12:4,000
If you can charge people more for shorter periods of content,

275
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
some distributor has figured out a way to make a lot more money.

276
0:12:44.28,000 --> 0:12:46,000
If you're making content,

277
0:12:46.32,000 --> 0:12:48,000
it costs less money to make it and put it out there.

278
0:12:49.24,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And, by the way,

279
0:12:50.48,000 --> 0:12:54,000
if you're 14 and have a short attention span, like my daughter,

280
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that's what you want to see, that's what you want to make,

281
0:12:57.76,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that's how it works.

282
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And if you do it right and it actually feels like narrative,

283
0:13:03.24,000 --> 0:13:05,000
people will hang on for it no matter what you do.

284
0:13:06.56,000 --> 0:13:07,000
CS: I'm glad you raised your daughters,

285
0:13:08.48,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because I am wondering how are they going to consume entertainment,

286
0:13:13.32,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and also not just entertainment,

287
0:13:15.6,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but news, too.

288
0:13:17.96,000 --> 0:13:19,000
When they're not -- I mean, the algorithmic robot overlords

289
0:13:20.96,000 --> 0:13:23,000
are going to feed them what they've already done.

290
0:13:24.08,000 --> 0:13:28,000
How do you think we will correct for that and make people well-rounded citizens?

291
0:13:29.76,000 --> 0:13:31,000
SR: Well, me and how I correct for it

292
0:13:31.96,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is completely different than how somebody else might do it.

293
0:13:34.76,000 --> 0:13:36,000
CS: Feel free to speculate.

294
0:13:36.88,000 --> 0:13:38,000
SR: I really don't know how we're going to do it in the future.

295
0:13:39.88,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I mean, my poor children have been the subject of all of my experiments.

296
0:13:43.32,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We're still doing what I call "Amish summers"

297
0:13:45.72,000 --> 0:13:46,000
where I turn off all electronics

298
0:13:47.48,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and pack away all their computers and stuff

299
0:13:49.56,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and watch them scream for a while until they settle down

300
0:13:52.56,000 --> 0:13:54,000
into, like, an electronic-free summer.

301
0:13:56.28,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But honestly, it's a very hard world

302
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in which now, as grown-ups,

303
0:14:01.04,000 --> 0:14:04,000
we're so interested in watching our own thing,

304
0:14:04.2,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and we don't even know that we're being fed, sometimes,

305
0:14:07.4,000 --> 0:14:08,000
just our own opinions.

306
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
You know, the way it's working now,

307
0:14:10.88,000 --> 0:14:11,000
you're watching a feed,

308
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and the feeds are being corrected

309
0:14:13.8,000 --> 0:14:15,000
so that you're only getting your own opinions

310
0:14:15.96,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and you're feeling more and more right about yourself.

311
0:14:18.52,000 --> 0:14:19,000
So how do you really start to discern?

312
0:14:20.4,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It's getting a little bit disturbing.

313
0:14:22.24,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So maybe it'll overcorrect, maybe it'll all explode,

314
0:14:25.08,000 --> 0:14:26,000
or maybe we'll all just become --

315
0:14:28.08,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I hate to be negative about it,

316
0:14:29.64,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but maybe we'll all just become more idiotic.

317
0:14:33.6,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Cyndi laughs)

318
0:14:35.36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
CS: Yeah, can you picture any corrective that you could do

319
0:14:38.8,000 --> 0:14:4,000
with scripted, fictional work?

320
0:14:41.72,000 --> 0:14:44,000
SR: I think a lot about the fact that television has the power

321
0:14:45.4,000 --> 0:14:46,000
to educate people in a powerful way,

322
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and when you're watching television --

323
0:14:49.04,000 --> 0:14:52,000
for instance, they do studies about medical shows.

324
0:14:52.32,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I think it's 87 percent, 87 percent of people

325
0:14:54.48,000 --> 0:14:57,000
get most of their knowledge about medicine and medical facts

326
0:14:57.88,000 --> 0:14:58,000
from medical shows,

327
0:14:59.36,000 --> 0:15:01,000
much more so than they do from their doctors,

328
0:15:01.52,000 --> 0:15:02,000
than from articles.

329
0:15:02.92,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So we work really hard to be accurate, and every time we make a mistake,

330
0:15:06.36,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I feel really guilty, like we're going to do something bad,

331
0:15:09.2,000 --> 0:15:11,000
but we also give a lot of good medical information.

332
0:15:11.88,000 --> 0:15:14,000
There are so many other ways to give information on those shows.

333
0:15:14.96,000 --> 0:15:15,000
People are being entertained

334
0:15:16.36,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and maybe they don't want to read the news,

335
0:15:18.44,000 --> 0:15:21,000
but there are a lot of ways to give fair information out on those shows,

336
0:15:21.88,000 --> 0:15:25,000
not in some creepy, like, we're going to control people's minds way,

337
0:15:26.52,000 --> 0:15:28,000
but in a way that's sort of very interesting and intelligent

338
0:15:29.4,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and not about pushing one side's version or the other,

339
0:15:32.88,000 --> 0:15:33,000
like, giving out the truth.

340
0:15:34.24,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It would be strange, though,

341
0:15:36.2,000 --> 0:15:39,000
if television drama was how we were giving the news.

342
0:15:39.96,000 --> 0:15:4,000
CS: It would be strange,

343
0:15:41.24,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but I gather a lot of what you've written as fiction

344
0:15:44.48,000 --> 0:15:46,000
has become prediction this season?

345
0:15:47.56,000 --> 0:15:5,000
SR: You know, "Scandal" has been very disturbing for that reason.

346
0:15:50.84,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We have this show that's about politics gone mad,

347
0:15:53.84,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and basically the way we've always told the show --

348
0:15:56.8,000 --> 0:15:58,000
you know, everybody pays attention to the papers.

349
0:15:59.2,000 --> 0:16:01,000
We read everything. We talk about everything.

350
0:16:01.36,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We have lots of friends in Washington.

351
0:16:03.32,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And we'd always sort of done our show as a speculation.

352
0:16:06.2,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We'd sit in the room and think,

353
0:16:07.72,000 --> 0:16:09,000
what would happen if the wheels came off the bus

354
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and everything went crazy?

355
0:16:11.32,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And that was always great,

356
0:16:12.88,000 --> 0:16:14,000
except now it felt like the wheels were coming off the bus

357
0:16:15.84,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and things were actually going crazy,

358
0:16:17.68,000 --> 0:16:19,000
so the things that we were speculating were really coming true.

359
0:16:20.68,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I mean, our season this year

360
0:16:22.08,000 --> 0:16:25,000
was going to end with the Russians controlling the American election,

361
0:16:25.88,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and we'd written it, we'd planned for it,

362
0:16:28.56,000 --> 0:16:29,000
it was all there,

363
0:16:29.8,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and then the Russians were suspected of being involved in the American election

364
0:16:33.64,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and we suddenly had to change what we were going to do for our season.

365
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I walked in and I was like,

366
0:16:38.36,000 --> 0:16:4,000
"That scene where our mystery woman starts speaking Russian?

367
0:16:41.24,000 --> 0:16:43,000
We have to fix that and figure out what we're going to do."

368
0:16:44.12,000 --> 0:16:45,000
That just comes from extrapolating

369
0:16:45.8,000 --> 0:16:47,000
out from what we thought was going to happen,

370
0:16:48.04,000 --> 0:16:49,000
or what we thought was crazy.

371
0:16:50.52,000 --> 0:16:51,000
CS: That's great.

372
0:16:51.84,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So where else in US or elsewhere in the world do you look?

373
0:16:56.76,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Who is doing interesting storytelling right now?

374
0:16:59.24,000 --> 0:17:02,000
SR: I don't know, there's a lot of interesting stuff out there.

375
0:17:02.28,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Obviously British television is always amazing

376
0:17:05.24,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and always does interesting things.

377
0:17:07.88,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I don't get to watch a lot of TV,

378
0:17:10.2,000 --> 0:17:12,000
mainly because I'm busy working.

379
0:17:12.64,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And I pretty much try not to watch very much television at all,

380
0:17:16.28,000 --> 0:17:18,000
even American television, until I'm done with a season,

381
0:17:19.2,000 --> 0:17:21,000
because things start to creep into my head otherwise.

382
0:17:21.72,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I start to wonder, like,

383
0:17:23.68,000 --> 0:17:26,000
why can't our characters wear crowns and talk about being on a throne?

384
0:17:27.119,000 --> 0:17:28,000
It gets crazy.

385
0:17:28.8,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So I try not to watch much until the seasons are over.

386
0:17:32.56,000 --> 0:17:35,000
But I do think that there's a lot of interesting European television out there.

387
0:17:36.319,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I was at the International Emmys

388
0:17:38.24,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and looking around and seeing the stuff that they were showing,

389
0:17:41.24,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and I was kind of fascinated.

390
0:17:42.68,000 --> 0:17:44,000
There's some stuff I want to watch and check out.

391
0:17:45.44,000 --> 0:17:46,000
CS: Can you imagine --

392
0:17:46.72,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I know that you don't spend a lot of time thinking about tech stuff,

393
0:17:50.28,000 --> 0:17:53,000
but you know how a few years ago we had someone here at TED

394
0:17:53.32,000 --> 0:17:55,000
talking about seeing,

395
0:17:55.6,000 --> 0:18:01,000
wearing Google Glass and seeing your TV shows essentially in your eye?

396
0:18:01.76,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Do you ever fantasize when, you know --

397
0:18:04.08,000 --> 0:18:06,000
the little girl who sat on the pantry floor

398
0:18:06.56,000 --> 0:18:07,000
in your parents' house,

399
0:18:08.32,000 --> 0:18:1,000
did you ever imagine any other medium?

400
0:18:12.2,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Or would you now?

401
0:18:13.68,000 --> 0:18:14,000
SR: Any other medium.

402
0:18:15.04,000 --> 0:18:16,000
For storytelling, other than books?

403
0:18:16.76,000 --> 0:18:18,000
I mean, I grew up wanting to be Toni Morrison, so no.

404
0:18:19.6,000 --> 0:18:2,000
I mean, I didn't even imagine television.

405
0:18:21.6,000 --> 0:18:24,000
So the idea that there could be some bigger world,

406
0:18:25.48,000 --> 0:18:27,000
some more magical way of making things ---

407
0:18:27.68,000 --> 0:18:29,000
I'm always excited when new technology comes out

408
0:18:29.96,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and I'm always the first one to want to try it.

409
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
The possibilities feel endless and exciting right now,

410
0:18:36.2,000 --> 0:18:37,000
which is what excites me.

411
0:18:39.04,000 --> 0:18:42,000
We're in this sort of Wild West period, to me, it feels like,

412
0:18:42.12,000 --> 0:18:44,000
because nobody knows what we're going to settle on.

413
0:18:44.56,000 --> 0:18:46,000
You can put stories anywhere right now

414
0:18:46.8,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and that's cool to me,

415
0:18:48.28,000 --> 0:18:52,000
and it feels like once we figure out how to get the technology

416
0:18:52.44,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and the creativity of storytelling to meet,

417
0:18:55.92,000 --> 0:18:56,000
the possibilities are endless.

418
0:18:58.28,000 --> 0:19:02,000
CS: And also the technology has enabled the thing I briefly flew by earlier,

419
0:19:03.04,000 --> 0:19:05,000
binge-viewing, which is a recent phenomenon,

420
0:19:06.04,000 --> 0:19:08,000
since you've been doing shows, right?

421
0:19:08.24,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And how do you think does that change the storytelling process at all?

422
0:19:12.96,000 --> 0:19:15,000
You always had a bible for the whole season beforehand, right?

423
0:19:16.8,000 --> 0:19:19,000
SR: No, I just always knew where we were going to end.

424
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
So for me,

425
0:19:22.52,000 --> 0:19:23,000
the only way I can really comment on that

426
0:19:24.52,000 --> 0:19:28,000
is that I have a show that's been going on for 14 seasons

427
0:19:29.24,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and so there are the people who have been watching it for 14 seasons,

428
0:19:32.56,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and then there are the 12-year-old girls I'd encounter in the grocery store

429
0:19:36.12,000 --> 0:19:39,000
who had watched 297 episodes in three weeks.

430
0:19:40.12,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Seriously, and that's a very different experience for them,

431
0:19:42.96,000 --> 0:19:43,000
because they've been inside of something

432
0:19:44.92,000 --> 0:19:47,000
really intensely for a very short period of time

433
0:19:48.36,000 --> 0:19:49,000
in a very intense way,

434
0:19:49.88,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and to them the story has a completely different arc

435
0:19:52.84,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and a completely different meaning

436
0:19:54.52,000 --> 0:19:55,000
because it never had any breaks.

437
0:19:56.12,000 --> 0:19:59,000
CS: It's like visiting a country and then leaving it. It's a strange --

438
0:19:59.48,000 --> 0:20:02,000
SR: It's like reading an amazing novel and then putting it down.

439
0:20:02.56,000 --> 0:20:05,000
I think that is the beauty of the experience.

440
0:20:05.64,000 --> 0:20:07,000
You don't necessarily have to watch something for 14 seasons.

441
0:20:08.6,000 --> 0:20:1,000
It's not necessarily the way everything's supposed to be.

442
0:20:12.32,000 --> 0:20:15,000
CS: Is there any topic that you don't think we should touch?

443
0:20:16.6,000 --> 0:20:18,000
SR: I don't think I think of story that way.

444
0:20:18.8,000 --> 0:20:21,000
I think of story in terms of character and what characters would do

445
0:20:22,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and what characters need to do in order to make them move forward,

446
0:20:25.24,000 --> 0:20:28,000
so I'm never really thinking of story in terms of just plot,

447
0:20:28.44,000 --> 0:20:3,000
and when writers come into my writer's room and pitch me plot,

448
0:20:31.4,000 --> 0:20:33,000
I say, "You're not speaking English."

449
0:20:33.52,000 --> 0:20:34,000
Like, that's the thing I say.

450
0:20:34.96,000 --> 0:20:36,000
We're not speaking English. I need to hear what's real.

451
0:20:37.6,000 --> 0:20:38,000
And so I don't think of it that way.

452
0:20:39.36,000 --> 0:20:42,000
I don't know if there's a way to think there's something I wouldn't do

453
0:20:42.72,000 --> 0:20:45,000
because that feels like I'm plucking pieces of plot off a wall or something.

454
0:20:46.36,000 --> 0:20:49,000
CS: That's great. To what extent do you think you will use --

455
0:20:49.52,000 --> 0:20:51,000
You know, you recently went on the board of Planned Parenthood

456
0:20:52.48,000 --> 0:20:54,000
and got involved in the Hillary Clinton campaign.

457
0:20:55.2,000 --> 0:20:58,000
To what extent do you think you will use your storytelling

458
0:20:58.84,000 --> 0:20:59,000
in the real world

459
0:21:00.6,000 --> 0:21:01,000
to effect change?

460
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:05,000
SR: Well, you know, there's --

461
0:21:07.32,000 --> 0:21:08,000
That's an intense subject to me,

462
0:21:08.92,000 --> 0:21:1,000
because I feel like the lack of narrative

463
0:21:11.72,000 --> 0:21:16,000
that a lot of people have is difficult.

464
0:21:17.72,000 --> 0:21:19,000
You know, like, there's a lot of organizations

465
0:21:19.92,000 --> 0:21:23,000
that don't have a positive narrative that they've created for themselves

466
0:21:23.96,000 --> 0:21:24,000
that would help them.

467
0:21:26,000 --> 0:21:27,000
There's a lot of campaigns

468
0:21:27.84,000 --> 0:21:3,000
that could be helped with a better narrative.

469
0:21:31.48,000 --> 0:21:33,000
The Democrats could do a lot

470
0:21:34,000 --> 0:21:36,000
with a very strong narrative for themselves.

471
0:21:36.12,000 --> 0:21:38,000
There's a lot of different things that could happen

472
0:21:38.56,000 --> 0:21:39,000
in terms of using storytelling voice,

473
0:21:40.4,000 --> 0:21:41,000
and I don't mean that in a fiction way,

474
0:21:42.32,000 --> 0:21:46,000
I mean that in a same way that any speechwriter would mean it.

475
0:21:46.48,000 --> 0:21:47,000
And I see that,

476
0:21:47.72,000 --> 0:21:51,000
but I don't necessarily know that that's, like, my job to do that.

477
0:21:51.92,000 --> 0:21:52,000
CS: All right.

478
0:21:53.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
Please help me thank Shonda. SR: Thank you.

479
0:21:55.8,000 --> 0:21:56,000

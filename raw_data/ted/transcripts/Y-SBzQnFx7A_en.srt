1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I want to take you back basically to my hometown,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and to a picture of my hometown of the week

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that "Emergence" came out.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And it's a picture we've seen several times.

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Basically, "Emergence" was published on 9/11.

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I live right there in the West Village,

7
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
so the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us.

8
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours --

9
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we hadn't taken it from somebody else.

10
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences

12
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close --

13
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all

14
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building,

15
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written.

16
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power

17
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and creative potential of density, of largely urban density,

18
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of connecting people and putting them together in one place,

19
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas

20
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and share physical space together.

21
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And it seemed to me looking at that -- that tower burning and then falling,

22
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
those towers burning and falling -- that in fact, one of the lessons

23
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
here was that density kills.

24
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And that of all the technologies that were exploited

25
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to make that carnage come into being,

26
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives

27
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
were those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings

28
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
110 stories above the ground.

29
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
If they hadn't been crowded --

30
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers,

31
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and you can see that very powerfully.

32
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density --

33
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call.

34
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days.

35
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit,

36
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and you could sense that the air was not healthy.

37
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village

38
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
where we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know,

39
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond,

40
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which was located about 20 blocks away, north.

41
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so I went out.

42
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell -- (Laughter) --

43
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks.

44
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me

45
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
as I was walking north to buy this air filter,

46
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which was that the streets were completely alive with people.

47
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
There was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day,

48
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
as it was for about a week after,

49
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and the West Village had never seemed more lively.

50
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I walked up along Hudson Street --

51
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book

52
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that so influenced what I was writing in "Emergence" --

53
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
past the White Horse Tavern,

54
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death,

55
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids.

56
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And all the people who lived in the neighborhood,

57
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood,

58
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
were all out there -- had them all open.

59
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
People were out.

60
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways.

61
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And it was a beautiful urban day,

62
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working.

63
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The city was there.

64
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
All the things that make a great city successful

65
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and all the things that make a great city stimulating --

66
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
they were all on display there on those streets.

67
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I thought, well, this is the power of a city.

68
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I mean, the power of the city --

69
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we talked about cities as being centralized in space,

70
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but what makes them so strong most of the time

71
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is they're decentralized in function.

72
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out

73
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and cause the whole thing to fail.

74
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
If they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero.

75
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there,

76
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
was destroyed by the attacks,

77
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives.

78
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later,

79
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the city had never looked more alive.

80
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
If you'd gone into the minds of the people,

81
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
well, you would have seen a lot of trauma,

82
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and you would have seen a lot of heartache,

83
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.

84
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But the system itself of this city was thriving.

85
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I took heart in seeing that.

86
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well,

87
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and how some of those reasons kind of map

88
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
on to where the Web is going right now.

89
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The question that I found myself asking to people

90
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
when I was talking about the book afterwards is --

91
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
when you've talked about emergent behavior,

92
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
when you've talked about collective intelligence,

93
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that

94
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
is to ask, who builds a neighborhood?

95
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Who decides that Soho should have this personality

96
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality?

97
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Well, there are some kind of executive decisions,

98
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody.

99
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Everybody contributes a little bit.

100
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
No single person is really the ultimate actor

101
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
behind the personality of a neighborhood.

102
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive

103
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
post-9/11 in my neighborhood?

104
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Well, it was the whole city.

105
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The whole system kind of working on it,

106
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and everybody contributing a small little part.

107
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web

108
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in a bunch of interesting ways --

109
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
most of which weren't around, actually,

110
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
except in very experimental things,

111
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when I was writing "Emergence" and when the book came out.

112
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So it's been a very optimistic time, I think,

113
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I want to just talk about a few of those things.

114
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity

115
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that's starting to emerge online right now.

116
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And the old one looked like this.

117
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is not the future King of England, although it looks like it.

118
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online

119
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
who's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus

120
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and "my hometown" -- those are his links.

121
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But nothing really says

122
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real,

123
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than

124
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
"Click here for a picture of my dog."

125
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That is -- you know, there's no sentence

126
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think,

127
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog

128
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and link to it, and somebody reading the page

129
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
has the power to click on that link or not click on that link.

130
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And, you know, I don't want to belittle that. That, in a sense --

131
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday --

132
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that

133
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web:

134
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it,

135
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.

136
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship.

137
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
There's one person putting up the link, and there's another person

138
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not.

139
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The new model is much more like this,

140
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and we've already seen a couple of references to this.

141
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This is what happens when you search "Steven Johnson" on Google.

142
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
About two months ago, I had the great breakthrough --

143
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
one of my great, kind of shining achievements --

144
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
which is that my website finally became a top result for "Steven Johnson."

145
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson

146
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
who has dropped two spots, I'm happy to say.

147
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this,

149
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing.

150
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze.

151
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Because effectively, what's happening here,

152
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this,

153
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but it's worth just thinking about it --

154
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson,

155
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but rather somehow the entire web of people

156
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it,

157
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and Google just sitting there and running the numbers.

158
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So there's this collective decision-making that's going on.

159
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web,

160
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and Google is just helping us

161
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place.

162
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, they're more innovative -- well, Google's pretty innovative --

163
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but there are some new twists on this.

164
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
There's this incredibly interesting new site -- Technorati --

165
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these.

166
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs.

167
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking.

168
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs,

169
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and so you have kind of an authority --

170
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
a weblog that has a lot of links to it

171
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.

172
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually,

173
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?

174
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And you can get a list.

175
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.

176
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
You can also rank it by the latest posts.

177
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So when I was talking in "Emergence,"

178
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture

179
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that, basically, you could link to somebody else

180
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.

181
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And that was one of the reasons why the web

182
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
wasn't quite as emergent as it could be

183
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism

184
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to be able to really do interesting things.

185
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Well, something like Technorati is supplying that.

186
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger,

187
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web --

188
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
there's nothing artificial.

189
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there,

190
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there.

191
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page "like a tree fungus."

192
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore.

193
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati

194
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
on the right-hand side of my page,

195
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.

196
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That little list there would change.

197
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I wouldn't really be directly in control of it.

198
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense,

199
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
wrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there.

200
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain

201
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.

202
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And there are all these interesting tools.

203
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Google does the Google Zeitgeist,

204
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
which looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in,

205
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and they publish it with lots of fun graphs.

206
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google,

207
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing.

208
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist,

209
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching

210
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
for Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news.

211
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia.

212
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Well, you know, we should expect to see that.

213
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
That's not necessarily something we didn't know already.

214
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So the key thing in terms of these new tools

215
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain,

216
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream --

217
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the question is, are you finding out something new?

218
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share

219
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
which is basically, you take an abstract term,

220
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and you search Google for that term,

221
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.

222
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So basically, the number of pages that mention this term,

223
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that also mention this page, the percentage of those pages

224
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is that person's Google Share of that term.

225
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So you can do kind of interesting contests.

226
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Like for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.

227
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So Richard Saul Wurman

228
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference.

229
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Our good friend Chris has about a six percent -- but with a bullet, I might add.

230
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Laughter)

231
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit.

232
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.

233
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I had no idea.

234
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
No, that's not true.

235
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Laughter)

236
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide

237
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of the Mola mola fish.

238
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Laughter)

239
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel --

240
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.

241
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
So right here -- now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages,

242
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
so this is 0.7 percent -- Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly.

243
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Right below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker.

244
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there.

245
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search

246
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.

247
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So Gary Bauer is not too far behind --

248
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.

249
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So --

250
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Laughter)

251
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.

252
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel,

253
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I think, right there.

254
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

255
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that,

256
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I think it would be good next year.

257
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Another quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing,

258
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but this analysis some of you may have seen.

259
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It just came out. This is bursty words,

260
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses.

261
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere,

262
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off,

263
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before.

264
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s --

265
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
slaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas.

266
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
That's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting.

267
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
They're talking about slavery in 1860.

268
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
1935 -- relief, depression, recovery banks.

269
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious.

270
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
1985, right at the center of the Reagan years --

271
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that's, we're, there's, we've, it's.

272
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Laughter)

273
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Now, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that

274
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
"emancipation" and "depression" and "recovery" all have a lot of syllables.

275
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So you know, you can actually download -- it's hard to remember those.

276
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But seriously, actually, what you can see there,

277
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise,

278
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country

279
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic --

280
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
contracting all those verbs.

281
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
You know, 20 years before it was still, "Ask not what you can do,"

282
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but with Reagan, it's, "that's where, there's Nancy and I," that kind of language.

283
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And so something we kind of knew,

284
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing.

285
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I'll go very quickly.

286
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
The question now -- and this is the really interesting question --

287
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now

288
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs

289
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
because they are really kind of at the cutting edge.

290
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.

291
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky

292
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that got a lot of attention about a month ago,

293
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and this is basically the distribution of links

294
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
on the web to all these various different blogs.

295
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs,

296
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and a long tail of blogs with very few links.

297
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.

298
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Now this is a very interesting thing.

299
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
It's caused a lot of controversy

300
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man,

301
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard.

302
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And so the question is, "Why is this happening?"

303
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
It's not being imposed by fiat from above.

304
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now.

305
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Now, what's great about it is that people are working on --

306
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing

307
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing.

308
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And basically, the shape appears

309
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage.

310
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
if you're the first site there, everybody links to you.

311
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
If you're the second site there, most people link to you.

312
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links,

313
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future,

314
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and then you get this kind of shape.

315
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on,

316
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
literally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece --

317
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers.

318
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links,

319
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.

320
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices.

321
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system.

322
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And it creates a kind of planned emergence.

323
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
You're not totally in control,

324
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways

325
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
because you have an end result which is

326
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
maybe a more democratic spread of voices.

327
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So the most amazing thing about this -- and I'll end on this note --

328
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems

329
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern

330
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not.

331
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate

332
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
about power laws and software that could change it

333
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
is the fact that we're having the conversation.

334
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I hope it continues here.

335
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Thanks a lot.

1
0:00:12.542,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Have you ever tried to understand a teenager?

2
0:00:16.875,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's exhausting, right?

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:23,000
You must be puzzled by the fact that some teens do well in school,

4
0:00:23.542,000 --> 0:00:24,000
lead clubs and teams

5
0:00:25.458,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and volunteer in their communities,

6
0:00:27.833,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but they eat Tide Pods for an online challenge,

7
0:00:31.792,000 --> 0:00:33,000
speed and text while driving,

8
0:00:34.25,000 --> 0:00:37,000
binge drink and experiment with illicit drugs.

9
0:00:38.083,000 --> 0:00:43,000
How can so many teens be so smart, skilled and responsible --

10
0:00:43.5,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and careless risk-takers at the same time?

11
0:00:47.125,000 --> 0:00:48,000
When I was 16,

12
0:00:48.833,000 --> 0:00:5,000
while frequently observing my peers in person

13
0:00:51.542,000 --> 0:00:53,000
as well as on social media,

14
0:00:53.708,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I began to wonder why so many teens took such crazy risks.

15
0:00:58.583,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It seems like getting a certificate from DARE class in the fifth grade

16
0:01:02.458,000 --> 0:01:03,000
can't stop them.

17
0:01:03.792,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:04.875,000 --> 0:01:05,000
What was even more alarming to me

19
0:01:06.5,000 --> 0:01:09,000
was that the more they exposed themselves to these harmful risks,

20
0:01:10.25,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the easier it became for them to continue taking risks.

21
0:01:14.542,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now this confused me,

22
0:01:16.583,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but it also made me incredibly curious.

23
0:01:20.083,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So, as someone with a name

24
0:01:21.667,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that literally means "to explore knowledge,"

25
0:01:24.625,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I started searching for a scientific explanation.

26
0:01:28.458,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now, it's no secret that teens ages 13 to 18

27
0:01:31.542,000 --> 0:01:34,000
are more prone to risk-taking than children or adults,

28
0:01:35.25,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but what makes them so daring?

29
0:01:38.333,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Do they suddenly become reckless,

30
0:01:40.333,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or is this just a natural phase that they're going through?

31
0:01:43.917,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Well neuroscientists have already found evidence

32
0:01:46.25,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that the teen brain is still in the process of maturation --

33
0:01:49.208,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and that this makes them exceptionally poor at decision-making,

34
0:01:52.708,000 --> 0:01:54,000
causing them to fall prey to risky behaviors.

35
0:01:56.25,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But in that case, if the maturing brain is to blame,

36
0:01:59.708,000 --> 0:02:01,000
then why are teens more vulnerable than children,

37
0:02:02.417,000 --> 0:02:05,000
even though their brains are more developed than those of children?

38
0:02:05.625,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Also, not all teens in the world take risks at the same level.

39
0:02:09.5,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Are there some other underlying or unintentional causes

40
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:14,000
driving them to risk-taking?

41
0:02:15.333,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, this is exactly what I decided to research.

42
0:02:19.833,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So, I founded my research on the basis of a psychological process

43
0:02:23.583,000 --> 0:02:24,000
known as "habituation,"

44
0:02:25.542,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or simply what we refer to as "getting used to it."

45
0:02:29.417,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Habituation explains how our brains adapt to some behaviors,

46
0:02:33.167,000 --> 0:02:36,000
like lying, with repeated exposures.

47
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And this concept inspired me to design a project

48
0:02:38.792,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to determine if the same principle

49
0:02:41.208,000 --> 0:02:45,000
could be applied to the relentless rise of risk-taking in teenagers.

50
0:02:46.125,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So I predicted that habituation to risk-taking

51
0:02:49.458,000 --> 0:02:52,000
may have the potential to change the already-vulnerable teenage brain

52
0:02:53.417,000 --> 0:02:55,000
by blunting or even eradicating

53
0:02:55.583,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the negative emotions associated with risk,

54
0:02:58.292,000 --> 0:02:59,000
like fear or guilt.

55
0:03:00.292,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I also thought because they would feel less fearful and guilty,

56
0:03:03.667,000 --> 0:03:06,000
this desensitization would lead them to even more risk-taking.

57
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In short, I wanted to conduct a research study

58
0:03:10.375,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to answer one big question:

59
0:03:12.958,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Why do teens keep making outrageous choices

60
0:03:15.583,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that are harmful to their health and well-being?

61
0:03:19.292,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But there was one big obstacle in my way.

62
0:03:22.083,000 --> 0:03:23,000
To investigate this problem,

63
0:03:24.042,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I needed teenagers to experiment on,

64
0:03:26.75,000 --> 0:03:29,000
laboratories and devices to measure their brain activity,

65
0:03:30.5,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and teachers or professors to supervise me and guide me along the way.

66
0:03:35.083,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I needed resources.

67
0:03:37.417,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But, you see, I attended a high school in South Dakota

68
0:03:40.458,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with limited opportunity for scientific exploration.

69
0:03:44.208,000 --> 0:03:46,000
My school had athletics,

70
0:03:46.333,000 --> 0:03:49,000
band, choir, debate and other clubs,

71
0:03:50.125,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but there were no STEM programs or research mentors.

72
0:03:53.458,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And the notion of high schoolers

73
0:03:55.083,000 --> 0:03:59,000
doing research or participating in a science fair was completely foreign.

74
0:04:00.75,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Simply put, I didn't exactly have the ingredients

75
0:04:03.667,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to make a chef-worthy dish.

76
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And these obstacles were frustrating,

77
0:04:09.208,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but I was also a stubborn teenager.

78
0:04:12.208,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And as the daughter of Bangladeshi immigrants

79
0:04:14.75,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and one of just a handful of Muslim students

80
0:04:16.875,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in my high school in South Dakota,

81
0:04:19.083,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I often struggled to fit in.

82
0:04:21.333,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I wanted to be someone with something to contribute to society,

83
0:04:25.792,000 --> 0:04:27,000
not just be deemed the scarf-wearing brown girl

84
0:04:28.583,000 --> 0:04:3,000
who was an anomaly in my homogenous hometown.

85
0:04:31.708,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I hoped that by doing this research,

86
0:04:33.458,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I could establish this

87
0:04:34.917,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and how valuable scientific exploration could be for kids like me

88
0:04:39.333,000 --> 0:04:41,000
who didn't necessarily find their niche elsewhere.

89
0:04:42.833,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So with limited research opportunities,

90
0:04:45.375,000 --> 0:04:5,000
inventiveness allowed me to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles.

91
0:04:50.542,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I became more creative in working with a variety of methodologies,

92
0:04:54.75,000 --> 0:04:56,000
materials and subjects.

93
0:04:57.333,000 --> 0:05:,000
I transformed my unassuming school library

94
0:05:00.5,000 --> 0:05:01,000
into a laboratory

95
0:05:02.292,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and my peers into lab rats.

96
0:05:04.583,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:05.792,000 --> 0:05:07,000
My enthusiastic geography teacher,

98
0:05:08.583,000 --> 0:05:11,000
who also happens to be my school's football coach,

99
0:05:11.75,000 --> 0:05:12,000
ended up as my cheerleader,

100
0:05:13.75,000 --> 0:05:16,000
becoming my mentor to sign necessary paperwork.

101
0:05:17.333,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And when it became logistically impossible

102
0:05:19.417,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to use a laboratory electroencephalography,

103
0:05:22.542,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or EEG,

104
0:05:23.875,000 --> 0:05:27,000
which are those electrode devices used to measure emotional responses,

105
0:05:28.125,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I bought a portable EEG headset with my own money,

106
0:05:31.292,000 --> 0:05:32,000
instead of buying the new iPhone X

107
0:05:32.958,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that a lot of kids my age were saving up for.

108
0:05:35.917,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So finally I started the research

109
0:05:38.458,000 --> 0:05:41,000
with 86 students, ages 13 to 18, from my high school.

110
0:05:42.5,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Using the computer cubicles in my school library,

111
0:05:45.333,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I had them complete a computerized decision-making simulation

112
0:05:48.917,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to measure their risk-taking behaviors comparable to ones in the real world,

113
0:05:53.125,000 --> 0:05:56,000
like alcohol use, drug use and gambling.

114
0:05:56.917,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Wearing the EEG headset,

115
0:05:58.75,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the students completed the test 12 times over three days

116
0:06:02.708,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to mimic repeated risk exposures.

117
0:06:05.583,000 --> 0:06:07,000
A control panel on the EEG headset

118
0:06:08.083,000 --> 0:06:1,000
measured their various emotional responses:

119
0:06:10.75,000 --> 0:06:13,000
like attention, interest, excitement, frustration,

120
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
guilt, stress levels and relaxation.

121
0:06:17.542,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They also rated their emotions

122
0:06:19.125,000 --> 0:06:22,000
on well-validated emotion-measuring scales.

123
0:06:22.375,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This meant that I had measured the process of habituation

124
0:06:25.25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and its effects on decision-making.

125
0:06:28.167,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it took 29 days to complete this research.

126
0:06:31.292,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And with months of frantically drafting proposals,

127
0:06:34.542,000 --> 0:06:38,000
meticulously computing data in a caffeinated daze at 2am,

128
0:06:39.042,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I was able to finalize my results.

129
0:06:41.708,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And the results showed that habituation to risk-taking

130
0:06:44.708,000 --> 0:06:48,000
could actually change a teen's brain by altering their emotional levels,

131
0:06:48.875,000 --> 0:06:49,000
causing greater risk-taking.

132
0:06:51.25,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The students' emotions that were normally associated with risks,

133
0:06:54.917,000 --> 0:06:57,000
like fear, stress, guilt and nervousness,

134
0:06:58.333,000 --> 0:06:59,000
as well as attention,

135
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
were high when they were first exposed to the risk simulator.

136
0:07:04.167,000 --> 0:07:07,000
This curbed their temptations and enforced self-control,

137
0:07:07.667,000 --> 0:07:09,000
which prevented them from taking more risks.

138
0:07:10.75,000 --> 0:07:13,000
However, the more they were exposed to the risks through the simulator,

139
0:07:14.708,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the less fearful, guilty and stressed they became.

140
0:07:18.667,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This caused a situation

141
0:07:20.25,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in which they were no longer able to feel

142
0:07:22.25,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the brain's natural fear and caution instincts.

143
0:07:25.875,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And also, because they are teenagers and their brains are still underdeveloped,

144
0:07:30.792,000 --> 0:07:33,000
they became more interested and excited in thrill-seeking behaviors.

145
0:07:35.708,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So what were the consequences?

146
0:07:38.25,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They lacked self-control for logical decision-making,

147
0:07:41.333,000 --> 0:07:42,000
took greater risks

148
0:07:43.083,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and made more harmful choices.

149
0:07:45.208,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So the developing brain alone isn't to blame.

150
0:07:48.75,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The process of habituation also plays a key role in risk-taking

151
0:07:52.458,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and risk escalation.

152
0:07:54.5,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Although a teen's willingness to seek risk

153
0:07:56.917,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is largely a result of the structural and functional changes

154
0:08:00.167,000 --> 0:08:02,000
associated with their developing brains,

155
0:08:02.958,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the dangerous part that my research was able to highlight

156
0:08:06.208,000 --> 0:08:08,000
was that a habituation to risks

157
0:08:08.25,000 --> 0:08:1,000
can actually physically change a teen's brain

158
0:08:10.958,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and cause greater risk-taking.

159
0:08:13.333,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So it's the combination of the immature teen brain

160
0:08:16.333,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and the impact of habituation

161
0:08:18.333,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that is like a perfect storm to create more damaging effects.

162
0:08:22.917,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And this research can help parents and the general public

163
0:08:26.542,000 --> 0:08:29,000
understand that teens aren't just willfully ignoring warnings

164
0:08:29.708,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or simply defying parents by engaging in increasingly more dangerous behavior.

165
0:08:34.875,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The biggest hurdle they're facing is their habituation to risks:

166
0:08:38.917,000 --> 0:08:42,000
all the physical, detectable and emotional functional changes

167
0:08:43.292,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that drive and control and influence their over-the-top risk-taking.

168
0:08:48.667,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So yes, we need policies that provide safer environments

169
0:08:52.417,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and limit exposures to high risks,

170
0:08:55.042,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but we also need policies that reflect this insight.

171
0:08:59.458,000 --> 0:09:02,000
These results are a wake-up call for teens, too.

172
0:09:02.5,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It shows them that the natural and necessary fear and guilt

173
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that protect them from unsafe situations

174
0:09:08.875,000 --> 0:09:11,000
actually become numb when they repeatedly choose risky behaviors.

175
0:09:13.917,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So with this hope to share my findings with fellow teenagers and scientists,

176
0:09:18.917,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I took my research

177
0:09:20.25,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF,

178
0:09:24.625,000 --> 0:09:26,000
a culmination of over 1,800 students

179
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
from 75 countries, regions and territories,

180
0:09:30.667,000 --> 0:09:33,000
who showcase their cutting-edge research and inventions.

181
0:09:34.417,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's like the Olympics of science fair.

182
0:09:36.917,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:38.125,000 --> 0:09:43,000
There, I was able to present my research to experts in neuroscience and psychology

184
0:09:43.292,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and garner valuable feedback.

185
0:09:45.833,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But perhaps the most memorable moment of the week

186
0:09:48.833,000 --> 0:09:51,000
was when the booming speakers suddenly uttered my name

187
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:53,000
during the awards ceremony.

188
0:09:54.125,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I was in such disbelief that I questioned myself:

189
0:09:57.458,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Was this just another "La La Land" blunder

190
0:10:00.125,000 --> 0:10:01,000
like at the Oscars?

191
0:10:01.417,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter)

192
0:10:02.875,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Luckily, it wasn't.

193
0:10:05.167,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I really had won first place

194
0:10:07.125,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in the category "Behavioral and Social Sciences."

195
0:10:09.667,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Applause)

196
0:10:16.042,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Needless to say,

197
0:10:17.417,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I was not only thrilled to have this recognition,

198
0:10:20.208,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but also the whole experience of science fair that validated my efforts

199
0:10:25.167,000 --> 0:10:27,000
keeps my curiosity alive

200
0:10:27.292,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and strengthens my creativity,

201
0:10:29.292,000 --> 0:10:31,000
perseverance and imagination.

202
0:10:32.792,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This still image of me experimenting in my school library

203
0:10:36.542,000 --> 0:10:37,000
may seem ordinary,

204
0:10:38.542,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but to me, it represents a sort of inspiration.

205
0:10:42.375,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It reminds me that this process taught me to take risks.

206
0:10:46.375,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I know that might sound incredibly ironic.

207
0:10:49.5,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But I took risks realizing

208
0:10:51.458,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that unforeseen opportunities often come from risk-taking --

209
0:10:55.542,000 --> 0:10:58,000
not the hazardous, negative type that I studied,

210
0:10:58.708,000 --> 0:10:59,000
but the good ones,

211
0:11:00.083,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the positive risks.

212
0:11:02.25,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The more risks I took,

213
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the more capable I felt of withstanding my unconventional circumstances,

214
0:11:08.75,000 --> 0:11:1,000
leading to more tolerance, resilience and patience

215
0:11:11.625,000 --> 0:11:13,000
for completing my project.

216
0:11:13.792,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And these lessons have led me to new ideas

217
0:11:16.875,000 --> 0:11:19,000
like: Is the opposite of negative risk-taking also true?

218
0:11:20.458,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Can positive risk-taking escalate with repeated exposures?

219
0:11:24.458,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Does positive action build positive brain functioning?

220
0:11:28.667,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I think I just might have my next research idea.

221
0:11:32.25,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

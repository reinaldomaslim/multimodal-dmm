1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We live on a human-dominated planet,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
putting unprecedented pressure

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
on the systems on Earth.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
it's also part of the good news.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We're the first generation -- thanks to science --

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to be informed that we may be

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
undermining the stability and the ability

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of planet Earth

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to support human development as we know it.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's also good news, because the planetary risks we're facing

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
are so large,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that business as usual is not an option.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In fact, we're in a phase

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
where transformative change is necessary,

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which opens the window for innovation,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for new ideas and new paradigms.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in the global phase of sustainability.

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
On this journey, I'd like to bring, apart from yourselves,

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a good friend,

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a stakeholder, who's always absent

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues,

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
a stakeholder who refuses to compromise --

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
planet Earth.

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage,

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to have her as a witness

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of a remarkable journey,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
which humbly reminds us

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
of the period of grace we've had

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
over the past 10,000 years.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It's a very important period --

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We've had the same, roughly, abilities

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that developed civilizations as we know it.

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
This is the environmental conditions on the planet.

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability.

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we leave Africa, we colonize Australia

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in another crisis, 60,000 years back,

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we leave Asia for Europe

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in another crisis, 40,000 years back,

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and then we enter

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
the remarkably stable Holocene phase,

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the only period in the whole history of the planet,

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that we know of, that can support human development.

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
A thousand years into this period,

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We go from a couple of million people

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to the seven billion people we are today.

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we domesticate animals and plants.

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The only phase, as we know it

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that can support humanity.

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
on this poor planet,

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
a quadruple sqeeze, which, as its first squeeze,

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
has population growth of course.

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, this is not only about numbers;

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
committed to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
have been caused by the rich minority,

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in the mid-18th century.

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The majority of the planet,

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
aspiring for development, having the right for development,

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle,

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a momentous pressure.

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda --

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is that it would be enough

75
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to avoid average temperatures

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
exceeding two degrees,

78
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing

79
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
holding six meters -- level rising,

81
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet,

82
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
holding another seven meters -- sea level rising.

83
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now, you would have wished the climate pressure

84
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,

85
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but unfortunately, the third pressure

86
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is the ecosystem decline.

87
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Never have we seen, in the past 50 years,

88
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
such a sharp decline

89
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
of ecosystem functions and services on the planet,

90
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,

91
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in our forests, land and biodiversity.

92
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The forth pressure is surprise,

93
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the notion and the evidence

94
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that we need to abandon our old paradigm,

95
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,

96
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems,

97
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and that in fact, surprise is universal,

98
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly

99
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and often irreversibly.

100
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet

101
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of momentous scale.

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We may, in fact, have entered a new geological era --

103
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the Anthropocene,

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
where humans are the predominant driver of change

105
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
at a planetary level.

106
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, as a scientist,

107
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
what's the evidence for this?

108
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Well, the evidence is,

109
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
unfortunately, ample.

110
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's not only carbon dioxide

111
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.

112
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You can take virtually any parameter

113
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that matters for human well-being --

114
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
nitrous oxide, methane,

115
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
deforestation, overfishing

116
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
land degredation, loss of species --

117
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
they all show the same pattern

118
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
over the past 200 years.

119
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,

120
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
10 years after the Second World War,

121
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise

122
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
starts in the mid-50s.

123
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.

124
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I can tell you,

125
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you enter the disciplinary research in each of these,

126
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you find something remarkably important,

127
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the conclusion that we may have come to the point

128
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
where we have to bend the curves,

129
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade

130
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in the history humanity on the planet,

131
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the decade when we have to bend the curves.

132
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, as if this was not enough --

133
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet --

134
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we also have to recognize the fact

135
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that systems do have multiple stable states,

136
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram,

137
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system.

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now, the system may gradually --

139
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
under pressure of climate change,

140
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
erosion, biodiversity loss --

141
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
lose the depth of the cup, the resilience,

142
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but appear to be healthy

143
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and appear to suddenly, under a threshold,

144
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
be tipping over. Upff.

145
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Sorry. Changing state

146
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and literally ending up

147
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in an undesired situation,

148
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
where new biophysical logic takes over,

149
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
new species take over, and the system gets locked.

150
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Do we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems.

151
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Biodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems

152
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
under multiple pressures of overfishing,

153
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
unsustainable tourism, climate change.

154
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
A trigger and the system tips over,

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
loses its resilience,

156
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
soft corals take over,

157
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and we get undesired systems

158
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that cannot support economic and social development.

159
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The Arctic -- a beautiful system --

160
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a regulating biome at the planetary level,

161
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
taking the knock after knock on climate change,

162
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
appearing to be in a good state.

163
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
No scientist could predict that in 2007,

164
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.

165
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent

166
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of its summer ice cover.

167
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And the drama is, of course, that

168
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
when the system does this, the logic may change.

169
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It may get locked in an undesired state,

170
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
because it changes color, absorbs more energy,

171
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and the system may get stuck.

172
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
In my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity

173
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that we are in a precarious situation.

174
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
As a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here

175
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was a submarine from an unnamed country

176
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic

177
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to be able to control the oil resources.

178
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now, if we have evidence, which we now have,

179
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that wetlands, forests,

180
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,

181
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
behave in this nonlinear way.

182
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
30 or so scientists around the world

183
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
gathered and asked a question for the first time,

184
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
"Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?"

185
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So we have to ask ourselves:

186
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?

187
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation

188
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
where we're coming too close

189
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to thresholds that could lead

190
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to deleterious and very undesired,

191
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
if now catastrophic, change

192
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
for human development?

193
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
You know, you don't want to stand there.

194
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In fact, you're not even allowed to stand

195
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
where this gentleman is standing,

196
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.

197
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
In fact, there's a fence

198
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
quite upstream of this threshold,

199
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
beyond which you are in a danger zone.

200
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And this is the new paradigm,

201
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which we gathered two, three years back,

202
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
recognizing that our old paradigm

203
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of just analyzing and pushing and predicting

204
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
parameters into the future,

205
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past.

206
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Now we to ask ourselves:

207
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
which are the large environmental processes

208
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that we have to be stewards of

209
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene?

210
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And could we even,

211
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science,

212
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
identify the thresholds,

213
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the points where we may expect nonlinear change?

214
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And could we even define

215
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
a planetary boundary, a fence,

216
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity?

217
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This work, which was published in "Nature,"

218
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
late 2009,

219
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
after a number of years of analysis,

220
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
led to the final proposition

221
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that we can only find

222
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
nine planetary boundaries

223
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
with which, under active stewardship,

224
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.

225
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
These include, of course, climate.

226
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It may surprise you that it's not only climate.

227
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,

228
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
with the three big systems, climate change,

229
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification

230
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
being the three big systems,

231
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds

232
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in the paleo-record of the history of the planet.

233
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But we also include, what we call, the slow variables,

234
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the systems that, under the hood,

235
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet --

236
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,

237
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
land use change, rate of biodiversity loss,

238
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
freshwater use,

239
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
functions which regulate

240
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
biomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.

241
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify --

242
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
air pollution,

243
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,

244
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but also chemical pollution.

245
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Together, these form an integrated whole

246
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
for guiding human development in the Anthropocene,

247
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
understanding that the planet

248
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is a complex self-regulating system.

249
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In fact, most evidence indicates

250
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that these nine may behave as three Musketeers,

251
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"One for all. All for one."

252
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
You degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,

253
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you undermine the ability of the climate system

254
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to stay stable.

255
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The drama here is, in fact, that

256
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
it may show that the climate challenge

257
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is the easy one,

258
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
if you consider the whole challenge

259
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
of sustainable development.

260
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development

261
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.

262
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space,

263
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the quantified boundaries,

264
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
as suggested by this analysis.

265
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,

266
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the pre-industrial point,

267
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
where we're very safely in the safe operating space.

268
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
In the '50s, we start branching out.

269
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
In the '60s already, through the green revolution

270
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and the Haber-Bosch process

271
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere --

272
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
you know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere

273
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.

274
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s,

275
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
actually, right after Rio.

276
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And today, we are in a situation where we estimate

277
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that we've transgressed three boundaries,

278
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the rate of biodiversity loss,

279
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity --

280
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs --

281
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
nitrogen and climate change.

282
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,

283
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but we are approaching fast

284
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
on land, water, phosphorus and oceans.

285
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But this gives a new paradigm

286
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to guide humanity,

287
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to put the light on our, so far

288
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
overpowered industrial vehicle,

289
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
which operates as if

290
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we're only on a dark, straight highway.

291
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Now the question then is:

292
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
how gloomy is this?

293
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Is then sustainable development utopia?

294
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Well, there's no science to suggest.

295
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
In fact, there is ample science

296
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to indicate that we can do this transformative change,

297
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that we have the ability

298
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to now move into a new innovative,

299
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
a transformative gear,

300
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
across scales.

301
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The drama is, of course,

302
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is that 200 countries on this planet

303
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
have to simultaneously start moving

304
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
in the same direction.

305
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm,

306
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
from the current linear,

307
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
command and control thinking,

308
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
looking at efficiencies and optimization

309
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
towards a much more flexible,

310
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
a much more adaptive approach,

311
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
where we recognize that redundancy,

312
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
both in social and environmental systems,

313
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is key to be able to deal

314
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
with a turbulent era of global change.

315
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We have to invest in persistence,

316
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
in the ability of social systems and ecological systems

317
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.

318
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We have to invest in transformations capability,

319
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
moving from crisis into innovation

320
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and the ability to rise after a crisis,

321
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and of course to adapt to unavoidable change.

322
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This is a new paradigm.

323
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We're not doing that at any scale on governance.

324
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But is it happening anywhere?

325
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Do we have any examples of success

326
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
on this mind shift being applied at the local level?

327
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Well, yes, in fact we do

328
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and the list can start becoming longer and longer.

329
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
There's good news here,

330
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
for example, from Latin America,

331
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
where plow-based farming systems

332
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
of the '50s and '60s

333
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
led farming basically to a dead-end,

334
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
with lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter

335
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels

336
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil,

337
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
leading to innovation and entrepreneurship

338
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
among farmers in partnership with scientists

339
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems

340
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
combined with mulch farming

341
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
with locally adapted technologies,

342
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
which today, for example, in some countries,

343
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
have led to a tremendous increase

344
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in area under mulch, zero till farming

345
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
which, not only produces more food,

346
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
but also sequesters carbon.

347
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story.

348
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Under the realization from tourist operators,

349
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
fishermen,

350
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists

351
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed

352
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
under the current governance regime.

353
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Global change, beautification rack culture,

354
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
overfishing and unsustainable tourism,

355
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
all together placing this system

356
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in the realization of crisis.

357
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset,

358
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
which today has led to a completely new governance strategy

359
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to build resilience,

360
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
acknowledge redundancy

361
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole,

362
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and then allow for much more redundancy in the system.

363
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Sweden, the country I come from, has other examples,

364
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as --

365
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
as in many countries -- as flood-prone polluted nuisance

366
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
in the peri-urban regions.

367
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
But again, a crisis, new partnerships,

368
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
actors locally, transforming these

369
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
into a key component

370
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
of sustainable urban planning.

371
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So crisis leading into opportunities.

372
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Now, what about the future?

373
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Well, the future, of course, has one massive challenge,

374
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
which is feeding a world of nine billion people.

375
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
We need nothing less than a new green revolution,

376
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and the planet boundaries shows

377
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.

378
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It has to basically do this on current land.

379
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We cannot expand anymore,

380
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
because it erodes the planetary boundaries.

381
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We cannot continue consuming water as we do today,

382
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean.

383
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And we need a transformation.

384
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Well, interestingly, and based on my work

385
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and others in Africa, for example,

386
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
we've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems,

387
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
with innovations and supplementary irrigation

388
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to bridge dry spells and droughts,

389
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients

390
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
from toilets back to farmers' fields,

391
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and innovations in tillage systems,

392
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
we can triple, quadruple, yield levels

393
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
on current land.

394
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Elinor Ostrom,

395
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
the latest Nobel laureate of economics,

396
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
clearly shows empirically across the world

397
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that we can govern the commons

398
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
if we invest in trust,

399
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
local, action-based partnerships

400
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and cross-scale institutional innovations,

401
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
where local actors,

402
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
together, can deal with the global commons

403
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
at a large scale.

404
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But even on the hard policy area we have innovations.

405
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence

406
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.

407
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And what shall we do?

408
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes,

409
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but for example, one policy measure,

410
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
feed-in tariffs on the energy system,

411
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
which is already applied,

412
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
from China doing it on offshore wind systems,

413
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
all the way to the U.S.

414
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy,

415
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but you can subsidize electricity to poor people.

416
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
You get people out of poverty.

417
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector,

418
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
while at the same time, stimulating innovation --

419
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
examples of things that can be out scaled quickly

420
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
at the planetary level.

421
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So there is -- no doubt -- opportunity here,

422
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and we can list many, many examples

423
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
of transformative opportunities around the planet.

424
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
The key though in all of these,

425
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
the red thread,

426
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
is the shift in mindset,

427
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves

428
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
into a dark future,

429
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
where we instead backcast our future,

430
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and we say, "What is the playing field on the planet?

431
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
What are the planetary boundaries

432
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
within which we can safely operate?"

433
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and then backtrack innovations within that.

434
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
But of course, the drama is, it clearly shows

435
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that incremental change is not an option.

436
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
So, there is scientific evidence.

437
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
They sort of say the harsh news,

438
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
that we are facing the largest

439
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
transformative development

440
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
since the industrialization.

441
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
In fact, what we have to do over the next 40 years

442
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
is much more dramatic and more exciting

443
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
than what we did when we moved into

444
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
the situation we're in today.

445
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Now, science indicates that,

446
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
yes, we can achieve a prosperous future

447
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
within the safe operating space,

448
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
if we move simultaneously,

449
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
collaborating on a global level, from local to global scale,

450
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
in transformative options, which build resilience on a finite planet.

451
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Thank you.

452
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
(Applause)

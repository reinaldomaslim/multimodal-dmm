1
0:00:12.992,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hello.

2
0:00:14.651,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well, I'm here to talk to you about my animal muse:

3
0:00:19.317,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the sloth.

4
0:00:20.754,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:23.244,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I've been documenting the strange lives of the world's slowest mammal

6
0:00:27.212,000 --> 0:00:28,000
for the last 10 years.

7
0:00:29.149,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I still remember the first time I saw one.

8
0:00:31.887,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was fascinated by their freaky biology.

9
0:00:36.008,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I mean, what's not to love about an animal that's born

10
0:00:39.65,000 --> 0:00:4,000
with a fixed grin on its face?

11
0:00:41.666,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:43.841,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And the need to hug.

13
0:00:45.904,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Audience: Awww.

14
0:00:47.967,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But sloths are massively misunderstood.

15
0:00:52.047,000 --> 0:00:55,000
They've been saddled with a name that speaks of sin

16
0:00:55.322,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and damned for their languorous lifestyle,

17
0:00:58.538,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which people seem to think has no place amongst the fittest

18
0:01:02.141,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in the fast-paced race for survival.

19
0:01:05.268,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Well, I'm here to tell you that we've got this animal all wrong --

20
0:01:10.506,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and how understanding the truth about the sloth

21
0:01:13.561,000 --> 0:01:17,000
may help save us and this planet we both call home.

22
0:01:19.546,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I traced sloth-based slander

23
0:01:22.053,000 --> 0:01:26,000
back to a Spanish conquistador called Valdés,

24
0:01:26.363,000 --> 0:01:31,000
who gave the first description of a sloth in his encyclopedia of the New World.

25
0:01:31.625,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He said the sloth was

26
0:01:33.564,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"the stupidest animal that can be found in the world ...

27
0:01:36.871,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I have never seen such an ugly animal or one that is more useless."

28
0:01:42.085,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:43.744,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Tell us what you really think, Valdés.

30
0:01:45.89,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:47.522,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'd like to have a word about Valdés's drawing skills.

32
0:01:51.721,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:53.816,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I mean, what is that?

34
0:01:56.287,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:58.158,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I've never seen an illustration of a sloth that's more useless.

36
0:02:01.719,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:02.974,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But I mean, on the plus side,

38
0:02:04.403,000 --> 0:02:06,000
he has given the sloth a remarkably humanlike face,

39
0:02:06.878,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and sloths do have remarkably humanlike faces.

40
0:02:10.966,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This sloth I photographed in Costa Rica, I think looks a lot like Ringo Starr.

41
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:17.919,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But then, sloths do bear an uncanny resemblance to the The Beatles.

43
0:02:22.792,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:26.132,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Particularly pleased with Paul, actually, on there.

45
0:02:30.999,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But like The Beatles, sloths are also extremely successful.

46
0:02:36.173,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They come from an ancient line of mammals, and there were once dozens of species

47
0:02:40.146,000 --> 0:02:44,000
including the giant ground sloth, which was the size of a small elephant

48
0:02:44.712,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and one of the only animals big enough to eat avocado pits whole

49
0:02:48.999,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and disperse them.

50
0:02:51.384,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So ... (Laughter)

51
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Some of you have worked it out already.

52
0:02:55.227,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:56.253,000 --> 0:02:57,000
That means that without sloths,

54
0:02:58.27,000 --> 0:03:01,000
there might be no avocado on toast today,

55
0:03:01.593,000 --> 0:03:05,000
leaving hipsters everywhere totally bereft at breakfast.

56
0:03:05.958,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:07.793,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Applause)

58
0:03:13.254,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Today, there are six surviving species, and they fall into two groups.

59
0:03:17.168,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You've got your Bradypus three-toed sloths,

60
0:03:19.792,000 --> 0:03:22,000
they're the ones with the Beatles haircuts and the Mona Lisa smiles.

61
0:03:24.569,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Then, there are the two-toed sloths.

62
0:03:27.495,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They look a little bit more like a cross between a Wookiee and a pig.

63
0:03:31.891,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They live in the jungles of Central and South America,

64
0:03:34.525,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and they're extremely prolific.

65
0:03:36.045,000 --> 0:03:38,000
There was a survey that was done in the 1970s

66
0:03:39.022,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in a Panamanian tropical forest

67
0:03:41.3,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that found that sloths were the most numerically abundant large animal.

68
0:03:46.228,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They took up one quarter of the mammalian biomass.

69
0:03:50.014,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, that's an awful lot of sloths

70
0:03:53.219,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and suggests they're doing something very right indeed.

71
0:03:58.188,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So what if, rather than deriding the sloth for being different,

72
0:04:05.003,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we tried to learn from it instead?

73
0:04:09.085,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We humans are obsessed with speed.

74
0:04:13.236,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Busyness is a badge of honor,

75
0:04:15.271,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and convenience trumps quality in our quest for quick.

76
0:04:20.553,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Our addiction to the express life is choking us and the planet.

77
0:04:26.773,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We idolize animals like the cheetah, the "Ferrari of the animal kingdom,"

78
0:04:32.117,000 --> 0:04:36,000
capable of doing naught to 60 in three seconds flat.

79
0:04:36.641,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Well, so what?

80
0:04:38.339,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:42.031,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Applause)

82
0:04:46.109,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So what?

83
0:04:47.284,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The sloth, on the other hand,

84
0:04:48.8,000 --> 0:04:51,000
can reach a leisurely 17 feet a minute

85
0:04:52.784,000 --> 0:04:53,000
with the wind behind it.

86
0:04:54.419,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:57.179,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But being fast is costly.

88
0:04:59.419,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The cheetah is speedy, but at the expense of strength.

89
0:05:03.427,000 --> 0:05:04,000
They can't risk getting in a fight,

90
0:05:05.204,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so they lose one in nine kills to tougher predators like hyenas.

91
0:05:09.593,000 --> 0:05:1,000
No wonder they're laughing.

92
0:05:11.181,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:12.355,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The sloth, on the other hand,

94
0:05:13.776,000 --> 0:05:15,000
has taken a more stealthy approach to dinner.

95
0:05:16.728,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They survive by capturing and consuming

96
0:05:20.491,000 --> 0:05:21,000
static leaves.

97
0:05:22.352,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:24.445,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But you see, leaves don't want to be eaten any more than antelope do,

99
0:05:27.739,000 --> 0:05:3,000
so they're loaded full of toxins and very hard to digest.

100
0:05:31.111,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So in order to consume them,

101
0:05:32.77,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the sloth has also had to become an athlete --

102
0:05:36.254,000 --> 0:05:38,000
a digesting athlete.

103
0:05:38.444,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:39.58,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The sloth's secret weapon is a four-chambered stomach

105
0:05:42.312,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and plenty of time.

106
0:05:44.561,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They have the slowest digestion rate of any mammal.

107
0:05:47.482,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And it can take up to a month to process a single leaf,

108
0:05:51.101,000 --> 0:05:55,000
which gives their liver plenty of time to process those toxins.

109
0:05:55.876,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So, sloths aren't lazy.

110
0:06:00.122,000 --> 0:06:02,000
No, they're busy.

111
0:06:02.859,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Digesting.

112
0:06:04.057,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:05.577,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Yeah, really busy.

114
0:06:07.694,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:09.498,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Hard at work, that sloth, very hard at work.

116
0:06:12.831,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And of course, leaves have little calorific value,

117
0:06:15.522,000 --> 0:06:19,000
so sloths have evolved to spend as little energy as possible.

118
0:06:19.76,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They do about 10 percent of the work of a similar-sized mammal

119
0:06:23.149,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and survive on as little as 100 calories a day,

120
0:06:27.006,000 --> 0:06:3,000
thanks to some ingenious adaptations.

121
0:06:31.053,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The Bradypus, three-toed sloths,

122
0:06:32.887,000 --> 0:06:34,000
they've got more neck bones than any other mammal,

123
0:06:35.379,000 --> 0:06:36,000
even a giraffe.

124
0:06:36.569,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Which means they can turn their head through 270 degrees

125
0:06:41.12,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and graze all around them,

126
0:06:43.278,000 --> 0:06:47,000
without having to actually bother with the effort of moving their body.

127
0:06:47.38,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:50.292,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It also means that they are surprisingly good swimmers.

129
0:06:53.95,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Sloths can bob along in water

130
0:06:56.439,000 --> 0:06:59,000
three times faster than they can move on land,

131
0:06:59.728,000 --> 0:07:,000
kept afloat by ...

132
0:07:01.722,000 --> 0:07:02,000
trapped wind.

133
0:07:03.284,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

134
0:07:05.37,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So --

135
0:07:06.568,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:07.593,000 --> 0:07:1,000
sloths are the only mammal that we know of that don't do flatulence.

137
0:07:11.528,000 --> 0:07:12,000
When they need to expel gas,

138
0:07:13.234,000 --> 0:07:15,000
it's actually reabsorbed into their bloodstream

139
0:07:16.076,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and expelled orally as a sort of mouth fart.

140
0:07:19.965,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:23.884,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Turning their lives upside down saves further energy.

142
0:07:27.376,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They have about half the skeletal muscle of a terrestrial mammal.

143
0:07:31.533,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They don't really have so many of the extensor muscles

144
0:07:35.809,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that are the weight-bearing muscles;

145
0:07:37.572,000 --> 0:07:4,000
instead, they rely on retractor muscles to pull themselves along.

146
0:07:41.913,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They have long, hooked claws and a high fatigue resistance,

147
0:07:45.981,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so they can literally hook on and hang like a happy, hairy hammock

148
0:07:50.989,000 --> 0:07:51,000
for hours on end.

149
0:07:52.869,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And sloths can do almost anything in this inverted position.

150
0:07:56.458,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They sleep, eat and even give birth.

151
0:07:59.157,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Their throat and blood vessels are uniquely adapted

152
0:08:02.53,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to pump blood and to swallow food against the force of gravity.

153
0:08:06.512,000 --> 0:08:08,000
They have sticky bits on their ribs

154
0:08:09.022,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that prevent their enormous stomach from crushing their lungs.

155
0:08:13.258,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And their fur grows the opposite direction,

156
0:08:16.046,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so they can drip dry after a tropical drenching.

157
0:08:20.704,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The only problem is, if you turn a sloth the other way up,

158
0:08:25.691,000 --> 0:08:28,000
gravity removes its dignity.

159
0:08:28.807,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Audience: Awww.

160
0:08:30.041,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They can't hold themselves upright.

161
0:08:32.863,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so they drag their bodies along as if mountaineering on a flat surface.

162
0:08:37.974,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And I think this is why the early explorers like Valdés

163
0:08:40.919,000 --> 0:08:41,000
thought so poorly of them,

164
0:08:42.204,000 --> 0:08:46,000
because they were observing sloths the wrong way up and out of context.

165
0:08:48.251,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I've spent many happy hours mesmerized by moving sloths.

166
0:08:53.403,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Their lack of muscle hasn't impeded their strength or agility.

167
0:08:57.703,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Nature's zen masters of mellow move like "Swan Lake" in slow mo --

168
0:09:03.256,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

169
0:09:04.748,000 --> 0:09:07,000
with the core control of a tai chi master.

170
0:09:08.537,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This one has fallen asleep mid-move, which is not uncommon.

171
0:09:13.658,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:17.728,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But you're probably wondering:

173
0:09:19.221,000 --> 0:09:22,000
How does a dangling bag of digesting leaves avoid being eaten?

174
0:09:23.411,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Good question.

175
0:09:24.593,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Well, this is one of the sloth's main predators.

176
0:09:26.942,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's the harpy eagle.

177
0:09:28.712,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It can fly at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour,

178
0:09:31.315,000 --> 0:09:33,000
has talons the size of a grizzly bear's,

179
0:09:34.03,000 --> 0:09:35,000
razor-sharp eyesight,

180
0:09:35.665,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and that ring of feathers focuses sound

181
0:09:38.482,000 --> 0:09:4,000
so that it can hear the slightest leaf rustle.

182
0:09:41.564,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The sloth, on the other hand, has poor hearing, bad eyesight,

183
0:09:46.675,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and running from danger is clearly not an option.

184
0:09:50.175,000 --> 0:09:53,000
No, they survive by wearing an invisibility cloak

185
0:09:54.171,000 --> 0:09:55,000
worthy of Harry Potter.

186
0:09:56.965,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Their fur has grooves that attract moisture

187
0:10:00.117,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and act as tiny hydroponic gardens for algae,

188
0:10:03.474,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and they also attract a host of invertebrates.

189
0:10:06.125,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So they are their own slow-moving, miniature ecosystem.

190
0:10:10.966,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They become one with the trees.

191
0:10:13.593,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And we think that their movements are so slow,

192
0:10:16.187,000 --> 0:10:18,000
they slip under the radar of the monstrous harpy

193
0:10:18.863,000 --> 0:10:21,000
as it's flying about the canopy, scanning for action.

194
0:10:23.244,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Sloths are stealth ninjas,

195
0:10:25.927,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and they rarely leave the safety of the canopy --

196
0:10:28.561,000 --> 0:10:29,000
except to defecate,

197
0:10:30.363,000 --> 0:10:33,000
which they do about once a week at the base of a tree.

198
0:10:34.387,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Now, this risky and energetic behavior has long been a mystery,

199
0:10:38.887,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and there are lots of theories as to why they do it.

200
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But I think they're leaving surreptitious scented messages for potential mates.

201
0:10:48.862,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Because, you see, sloths are generally silent, solitary creatures,

202
0:10:53.879,000 --> 0:10:55,000
except for when the female is in heat.

203
0:10:56.315,000 --> 0:11:,000
She will climb to the top of a tree and scream for sex.

204
0:11:01.498,000 --> 0:11:02,000
In D-sharp.

205
0:11:02.751,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Laughter)

206
0:11:04.752,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Don't believe me?

207
0:11:07.292,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Sound of sloth scream)

208
0:11:09.3,000 --> 0:11:1,000
D-sharp.

209
0:11:11.085,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This and only this note will get the male's attention.

210
0:11:14.378,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It mimics the sound of the kiskadee flycatcher.

211
0:11:16.908,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So the female remains covert,

212
0:11:18.883,000 --> 0:11:21,000
even when yodeling for sex at the top of her lungs.

213
0:11:22.825,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Her clandestine booty calls will carry for miles across the canopy,

214
0:11:27.436,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and males will beat a slow path towards her.

215
0:11:30.946,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Laughter)

216
0:11:35.263,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I think scented messages in her dung will help send Romeo up the right tree

217
0:11:40.002,000 --> 0:11:43,000
so that he doesn't waste precious energy scaling the wrong one.

218
0:11:44.807,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Sex, by the way, is the only thing that sloths do swiftly.

219
0:11:48.268,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I've seen them do it in the wild,

220
0:11:49.903,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and it's over and done with in a matter of seconds.

221
0:11:53.363,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But then, why waste precious energy on it,

222
0:11:56.085,000 --> 0:11:58,000
particularly after that journey?

223
0:11:58.117,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:59.823,000 --> 0:12:,000
Unlike other mammals,

225
0:12:01.125,000 --> 0:12:06,000
sloths don't also waste time maintaining a constant warm body temperature.

226
0:12:06.292,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Energy from the sun is free,

227
0:12:08.006,000 --> 0:12:1,000
so they bask in the sun like lizards

228
0:12:10.3,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and wear an unusually thick coat for the tropics to keep that heat in.

229
0:12:15.49,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Sloths have a freakishly low metabolism.

230
0:12:19.585,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And we think that this might be one of the reasons

231
0:12:22.181,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that they can sometimes recover from injuries

232
0:12:24.67,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that would kill most animals.

233
0:12:27.3,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This sloth recovered from a double amputation,

234
0:12:30.355,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and I've known sloths that have managed to survive

235
0:12:34.006,000 --> 0:12:36,000
even power line electrocutions.

236
0:12:36.68,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction.

237
0:12:42.631,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Researchers at Kansas University who were studying mollusks

238
0:12:46.125,000 --> 0:12:5,000
found that a high metabolism predicted which species of mollusk

239
0:12:50.577,000 --> 0:12:51,000
had gone extinct.

240
0:12:53.609,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Sloths have been around on this planet in one shape or another

241
0:12:56.609,000 --> 0:12:58,000
for over 40 million years.

242
0:12:59.768,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The secret to their success is their slothful nature.

243
0:13:04.49,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They are energy-saving icons.

244
0:13:09.022,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And I founded the Sloth Appreciation Society

245
0:13:11.451,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to both promote and protect their slow, steady, sustainable lives.

246
0:13:18.712,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I'm a pretty speedy character.

247
0:13:21.529,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I'm sure you've guessed.

248
0:13:22.99,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And the sloths have taught me a lot about slowing down.

249
0:13:26.752,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And I think that the planet would benefit

250
0:13:29.173,000 --> 0:13:33,000
if we all took a slowly digested leaf out of their book.

251
0:13:34.752,000 --> 0:13:38,000
How about we all embrace our inner sloth

252
0:13:38.807,000 --> 0:13:39,000
by slowing down,

253
0:13:40.394,000 --> 0:13:41,000
being more mindful,

254
0:13:41.933,000 --> 0:13:43,000
reducing wasteful convenience,

255
0:13:44.425,000 --> 0:13:46,000
being economical with our energy,

256
0:13:47.152,000 --> 0:13:49,000
recycling creatively

257
0:13:49.195,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and reconnecting with nature.

258
0:13:52.52,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Otherwise, I fear,

259
0:13:55.114,000 --> 0:13:58,000
it will be us humans that turn out to be

260
0:13:58.462,000 --> 0:14:01,000
"the stupidest animals that can be found in the world."

261
0:14:03.622,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you very much.

262
0:14:05.27,000 --> 0:14:06,000
May the sloth be with you!

263
0:14:06.692,000 --> 0:14:09,000
(Applause)

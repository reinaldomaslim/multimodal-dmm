0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Applause)

3
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Thank you.

4
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Imagining a solo cello concert,

5
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach

6
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
unaccompanied cello suites.

7
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
As a child

8
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
studying these eternal masterpieces,

9
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Bach's music would intermingle

10
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
with the singing voices of Muslim prayers

11
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
from the neighboring Arab village

12
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of the northern Kibbutz in Israel

13
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
where I grew up.

14
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Late at night, after hours of practicing,

15
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday

16
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
as the sounds of tango music

17
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
would be creeping from my parents' stereo.

18
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It all became music to me.

19
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I didn't hear the boundaries.

20
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I still start every day

21
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
practicing playing Bach.

22
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
His music never ceases

23
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to sound fresh and surprising to me.

24
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But as I was moving away

25
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
from the traditional classical repertoire

26
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and trying to find new ways

27
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of musical expression,

28
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I realized that with today's technological resources,

29
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
there's no reason to limit

30
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
what can be produced at one time

31
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
from a single string instrument.

32
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The power and coherency

33
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices

34
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
makes a very different experience.

35
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The excitement of a great orchestra performance

36
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians

37
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
producing one unified whole concept.

38
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The excitement from using multi-tracking,

39
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the way I did in the piece you will hear next,

40
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
comes from the attempt

41
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to build and create a whole universe

42
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
with many diverse layers,

43
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
all generated from a single source.

44
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
My cello and my voice are layered

45
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to create this large sonic canvas.

46
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
When composers write music for me,

47
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.

48
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I hope to arrive at new territories

49
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to discover sounds I have never heard before.

50
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I want to create endless possibilities

51
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
with this cello.

52
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I become the medium through which the music is being channeled,

53
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and in the process, when all is right,

54
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the music is transformed

55
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and so am I.

56
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Music)

57
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
(Applause)

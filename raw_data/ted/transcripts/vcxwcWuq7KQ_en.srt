1
0:00:12.72,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Code is the next universal language.

2
0:00:16.68,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation.

3
0:00:20.88,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In the eighties, it was probably money.

4
0:00:23.36,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But for my generation of people,

5
0:00:25.72,000 --> 0:00:29,000
software is the interface to our imagination and our world.

6
0:00:30.56,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And that means that we need

7
0:00:32.28,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a radically, radically more diverse set of people

8
0:00:35.56,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to build those products,

9
0:00:37.36,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic,

10
0:00:42.32,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to see them as things that they can tinker

11
0:00:44.32,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and turn around and twist, and so forth.

12
0:00:47.72,000 --> 0:00:5,000
My personal journey into the world of programming and technology

13
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
started at the tender age of 14.

14
0:00:54.52,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I had this mad teenage crush on an older man,

15
0:00:58.64,000 --> 0:01:,000
and the older man in question just happened to be

16
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.

17
0:01:05.44,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do.

18
0:01:08.52,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I wanted to somehow express all of this love,

19
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:12,000
so I built him a website, it's over here.

20
0:01:13.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And in 2001, there was no Tumblr,

21
0:01:16.319,000 --> 0:01:18,000
there was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest.

22
0:01:18.6,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So I needed to learn to code

23
0:01:20.76,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in order to express all of this longing and loving.

24
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And that is how programming started for me.

25
0:01:26.52,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It started as a means of self-expression.

26
0:01:29.08,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Just like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos.

27
0:01:32.72,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays.

28
0:01:37.92,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But then, there were other things to get excited about,

29
0:01:40.92,000 --> 0:01:42,000
like poetry and knitting socks

30
0:01:43.36,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and conjugating French irregular verbs

31
0:01:46.68,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and coming up with make-believe worlds

32
0:01:48.56,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.

33
0:01:51.72,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I started to be one of those people

34
0:01:53.64,000 --> 0:01:56,000
who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.

35
0:01:58.12,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Here's what I think today.

36
0:01:59.96,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.

37
0:02:04.04,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Little girls are amazing.

38
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They are really, really good at concentrating on things

39
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and being exact and they ask amazing questions like,

40
0:02:12.76,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?"

41
0:02:15.36,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.

42
0:02:19.76,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's the parents who do.

43
0:02:21.72,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It's us parents who feel

44
0:02:23.039,000 --> 0:02:28,000
like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline

45
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that only belongs to the mystery makers.

46
0:02:31.84,000 --> 0:02:33,000
That it's almost as far removed from everyday life

47
0:02:34.6,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as, say, nuclear physics.

48
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And they are partly right about that.

49
0:02:39.64,000 --> 0:02:42,000
There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures

50
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and algorithms and practices,

51
0:02:45.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
protocols and paradigms in programming.

52
0:02:48.44,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller.

53
0:02:52.76,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other

54
0:02:57.32,000 --> 0:02:58,000
between the man and the machine

55
0:02:58.84,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work

56
0:03:02.08,000 --> 0:03:04,000
or how to talk to them.

57
0:03:04.28,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And we do teach our kids how the human body works,

58
0:03:07.08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we teach them how the combustion engine functions

59
0:03:10.2,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut

60
0:03:13.24,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you can become one.

61
0:03:14.72,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But when the kid comes to us and asks,

62
0:03:16.92,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"

63
0:03:19.68,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Or, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,'

64
0:03:24.12,000 --> 0:03:25,000
how does it know which video to show?"

65
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?"

66
0:03:28.6,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We adults, we grow oddly silent.

67
0:03:32.4,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"It's magic," some of us say.

68
0:03:34.88,000 --> 0:03:36,000
"It's too complicated," the others say.

69
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Well, it's neither.

70
0:03:40.04,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It's not magic and it's not complicated.

71
0:03:42.64,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It all just happened really, really, really fast.

72
0:03:46.28,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines,

73
0:03:49.2,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but they made them very, very foreign to us,

74
0:03:51.64,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and also the language we speak to the computers

75
0:03:53.88,000 --> 0:03:56,000
so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore

76
0:03:56.92,000 --> 0:03:58,000
without our fancy user interfaces.

77
0:03:59.44,000 --> 0:04:,000
And that's why no one recognized

78
0:04:01.04,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs,

79
0:04:03.76,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills.

80
0:04:07.04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And when I was excited about knitting,

81
0:04:09.36,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands

82
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that included loops inside of them.

83
0:04:14.68,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest

84
0:04:17.12,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to find an exact language between English and mathematics

85
0:04:21.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
found its home inside of a computer.

86
0:04:24.08,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I was a programmer, but no one knew it.

87
0:04:27.08,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world.

88
0:04:31.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But unless we give them tools to build with computers,

89
0:04:34.8,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we are raising only consumers instead of creators.

90
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This whole quest led me to this little girl.

91
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.

92
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:47,000
She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy.

93
0:04:47.84,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And every time I would run into a problem

94
0:04:50.32,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in trying to teach myself programming like,

95
0:04:52.6,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?",

96
0:04:56.6,000 --> 0:05:,000
I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.

97
0:05:01.04,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it

98
0:05:03.72,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and the things Ruby taught me go like this.

99
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid

100
0:05:08.6,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of the bugs under your bed.

101
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And even the biggest of the problems

102
0:05:12.08,000 --> 0:05:15,000
are a group of tiny problems stuck together.

103
0:05:15.6,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And Ruby also introduced me to her friends,

104
0:05:18.36,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the colorful side of the Internet culture.

105
0:05:21.28,000 --> 0:05:22,000
She has friends like the Snow Leopard,

106
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids.

107
0:05:26.12,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy.

108
0:05:30.76,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And she has friends like Linux the penguin

109
0:05:32.96,000 --> 0:05:35,000
who's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand.

110
0:05:36.64,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And idealistic foxes, and so on.

111
0:05:39.88,000 --> 0:05:42,000
In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play.

112
0:05:43.56,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff,

113
0:05:46.8,000 --> 0:05:48,000
so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this.

114
0:05:49.72,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp

115
0:05:53.12,000 --> 0:05:54,000
clap, clap and jump."

116
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times.

117
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence

118
0:06:01.52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
while I'm standing on one leg.

119
0:06:03.32,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence

120
0:06:06.64,000 --> 0:06:08,000
until mom gets really mad.

121
0:06:08.72,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:09.76,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.

123
0:06:14.32,000 --> 0:06:16,000
When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world,

124
0:06:17.08,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world

125
0:06:20.4,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and what kind of questions they have

126
0:06:22.44,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and I would organize play testing sessions.

127
0:06:25.36,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I would start by showing the kids these four pictures.

128
0:06:28.48,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I would show them a picture of a car,

129
0:06:30.84,000 --> 0:06:32,000
a grocery store, a dog and a toilet.

130
0:06:33.28,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?"

131
0:06:37.48,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And the kids would be very conservative and go,

132
0:06:40.24,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"None of these is a computer.

133
0:06:42.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I know what a computer is:

134
0:06:43.72,000 --> 0:06:44,000
it's that glowing box

135
0:06:45.08,000 --> 0:06:48,000
in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time."

136
0:06:48.72,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But then we would talk

137
0:06:50.24,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer,

138
0:06:53.08,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it has a navigation system inside of it.

139
0:06:55.48,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And a dog -- a dog might not be a computer,

140
0:06:58.28,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but it has a collar

141
0:06:59.52,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and the collar might have a computer inside of it.

142
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers,

143
0:07:05.64,000 --> 0:07:08,000
like the cashier system and the burglar alarms.

144
0:07:09.08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And kids, you know what?

145
0:07:10.44,000 --> 0:07:12,000
In Japan, toilets are computers

146
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and there's even hackers who hack them.

147
0:07:14.92,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:16.72,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And we go further

149
0:07:17.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them.

150
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability

151
0:07:24.84,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to make anything in this room into a computer."

152
0:07:28.48,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And again, the kids go,

153
0:07:29.84,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this."

154
0:07:32.76,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But I tell them, "Don't worry,

155
0:07:34.36,000 --> 0:07:36,000
your parents don't know the right answer, either.

156
0:07:36.96,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They've just started to hear about this thing

157
0:07:39.2,000 --> 0:07:41,000
called The Internet of Things.

158
0:07:41.44,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But you kids, you are going to be the ones

159
0:07:43.44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."

160
0:07:47.84,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And then I had this little girl who came to me

161
0:07:50.08,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and took a bicycle lamp

162
0:07:51.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer,

163
0:07:55.64,000 --> 0:07:57,000
it would change colors."

164
0:07:57.68,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?"

165
0:08:00.72,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And she thinks and she thinks,

166
0:08:02.48,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp were a computer,

167
0:08:06.52,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we could go on a biking trip with my father

168
0:08:09.28,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and we would sleep in a tent

169
0:08:10.92,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector."

170
0:08:15.64,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And that's the moment I'm looking for,

171
0:08:18.4,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the moment when the kid realizes

172
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that the world is definitely not ready yet,

173
0:08:22.4,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that a really awesome way of making the world more ready

174
0:08:25.4,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is by building technology

175
0:08:27.64,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and that each one of us can be a part of that change.

176
0:08:31.2,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Final story, we also built a computer.

177
0:08:34.28,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM

178
0:08:39.04,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that help it remember things.

179
0:08:40.48,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And after we've assembled our computer together,

180
0:08:43.44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we also design an application for it.

181
0:08:46.12,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And my favorite story is this little boy,

182
0:08:48.159,000 --> 0:08:49,000
he's six years old

183
0:08:49.44,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut.

184
0:08:53.12,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And the boy, he has these huge headphones on

185
0:08:55.4,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer

186
0:08:58.68,000 --> 0:09:,000
because you see, he's built his own

187
0:09:00.72,000 --> 0:09:04,000
intergalactic planetary navigation application.

188
0:09:05.04,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit,

189
0:09:08.2,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is on the other side of the room

190
0:09:10.08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and the boy's important mission

191
0:09:11.72,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is to bring the father safely back to earth.

192
0:09:15.76,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world

193
0:09:19.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and the way we build it with technology.

194
0:09:22.84,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Finally, the more approachable, the more inclusive,

195
0:09:26.72,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and the more diverse we make the world of technology,

196
0:09:30.12,000 --> 0:09:33,000
the more colorful and better the world will look like.

197
0:09:34.12,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So, imagine with me, for a moment,

198
0:09:36.72,000 --> 0:09:38,000
a world where the stories we tell

199
0:09:39.32,000 --> 0:09:42,000
about how things get made don't only include

200
0:09:42.36,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys,

201
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians.

202
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Imagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,

203
0:09:54.24,000 --> 0:09:57,000
who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s,

204
0:09:57.48,000 --> 0:10:01,000
they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology.

205
0:10:02.12,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They embrace the powers and the opportunities

206
0:10:05.52,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and the limitations of the world.

207
0:10:07.68,000 --> 0:10:11,000
A world of technology that is wonderful, whimsical

208
0:10:11.84,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and a tiny bit weird.

209
0:10:15.12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
When I was a girl,

210
0:10:16.64,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I wanted to be a storyteller.

211
0:10:18.68,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I loved make-believe worlds

212
0:10:20.28,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and my favorite thing to do

213
0:10:21.92,000 --> 0:10:25,000
was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley.

214
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In the afternoons, I would roam around the Tatooines.

215
0:10:29.32,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And in the evenings, I would go to sleep in Narnia.

216
0:10:33.4,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me.

217
0:10:37.72,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I still create worlds.

218
0:10:39.68,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Instead of stories, I do them with code.

219
0:10:43.64,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Programming gives me this amazing power

220
0:10:46.72,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to build my whole little universe

221
0:10:49.12,000 --> 0:10:52,000
with its own rules and paradigms and practices.

222
0:10:54.12,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic.

223
0:10:58.92,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Thank you.

224
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

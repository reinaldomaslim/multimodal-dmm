2
0:00:12.401,000 --> 0:00:14,000
One of the things I want to establish right from the start

3
0:00:14.717,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots.

4
0:00:17.747,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I just wanted you to know that.

5
0:00:19.926,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So I am indeed a neurosurgeon,

6
0:00:22.335,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery,

7
0:00:26.262,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and what I'm going to tell you about today

8
0:00:27.855,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain,

9
0:00:30.173,000 --> 0:00:31,000
being able to go anywhere in the brain

10
0:00:32.128,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and turning areas of the brain up or down

11
0:00:34.547,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to help our patients.

12
0:00:36.759,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.

13
0:00:39.709,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's been around for about 7,000 years.

14
0:00:43.261,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In Mesoamerica, there used to be neurosurgery,

15
0:00:46.986,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients.

16
0:00:50.754,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And they were trying to -- they knew that the brain was involved

17
0:00:54.68,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in neurological and psychiatric disease.

18
0:00:57.032,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They didn't know exactly what they were doing.

19
0:00:59.193,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Not much has changed, by the way. (Laughter)

20
0:01:02.007,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But they thought that,

21
0:01:03.88,000 --> 0:01:05,000
if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease,

22
0:01:05.883,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it must be because you are possessed

23
0:01:08.474,000 --> 0:01:1,000
by an evil spirit.

24
0:01:10.826,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So if you are possessed by an evil spirit

25
0:01:12.795,000 --> 0:01:14,000
causing neurologic or psychiatric problems,

26
0:01:15.615,000 --> 0:01:17,000
then the way to treat this is, of course,

27
0:01:17.636,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape.

28
0:01:23.319,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So this was the thinking back then,

29
0:01:24.697,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and these individuals made these holes.

30
0:01:28.841,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant

31
0:01:31.824,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to go through this because, you can tell that

32
0:01:34.239,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the holes are made partially and then, I think,

33
0:01:36.69,000 --> 0:01:38,000
there was some trepanation, and then they left very quickly

34
0:01:38.705,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and it was only a partial hole,

35
0:01:40.606,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and we know they survived these procedures.

36
0:01:42.922,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But this was common.

37
0:01:44.13,000 --> 0:01:45,000
There were some sites where one percent

38
0:01:45.396,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of all the skulls have these holes, and so you can see

39
0:01:48.121,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common,

40
0:01:51.315,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago.

41
0:01:55.748,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now, in the course of time,

42
0:01:57.901,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we've come to realize that

43
0:02:00.121,000 --> 0:02:02,000
different parts of the brain do different things.

44
0:02:02.379,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So there are areas of the brain that are dedicated

45
0:02:03.566,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to controlling your movement or your vision

46
0:02:06.259,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or your memory or your appetite, and so on.

47
0:02:09.208,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And when things work well, then the nervous system

48
0:02:11.942,000 --> 0:02:12,000
works well, and everything functions.

49
0:02:13.611,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But once in a while, things don't go so well,

50
0:02:15.858,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and there's trouble in these circuits,

51
0:02:18.4,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring

52
0:02:21.104,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and causing trouble, or sometimes they're underactive

53
0:02:24.283,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and they're not quite working as they should.

54
0:02:26.827,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, the manifestation of this

55
0:02:28.964,000 --> 0:02:3,000
depends on where in the brain these neurons are.

56
0:02:31.448,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So when these neurons are in the motor circuit,

57
0:02:33.87,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you get dysfunction in the movement system,

58
0:02:36.282,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and you get things like Parkinson's disease.

59
0:02:38.448,000 --> 0:02:41,000
When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood,

60
0:02:41.744,000 --> 0:02:43,000
you get things like depression,

61
0:02:44.028,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function,

62
0:02:47.852,000 --> 0:02:49,000
then you get things like Alzheimer's disease.

63
0:02:50.373,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint

64
0:02:53.096,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where these disturbances are in the brain,

65
0:02:55.403,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and we've been able to intervene within these circuits

66
0:02:58.44,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down.

67
0:03:02.096,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So this is very much like choosing the correct station

68
0:03:04.38,000 --> 0:03:05,000
on the radio dial.

69
0:03:06.355,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Once you choose the right station, whether it be jazz or opera,

70
0:03:09.004,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in our case whether it be movement or mood,

71
0:03:11.337,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we can put the dial there,

72
0:03:13.303,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume,

73
0:03:16.074,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to turn it up or turn it down.

74
0:03:18.083,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So what I'm going to tell you about

75
0:03:19.311,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes

76
0:03:23.369,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and turning areas of the brain up and down

77
0:03:25.837,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to see if we can help our patients.

78
0:03:27.541,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And this is accomplished using this kind of device,

79
0:03:29.874,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and this is called deep brain stimulation.

80
0:03:32.335,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain.

81
0:03:35.406,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Again, we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime,

82
0:03:39.355,000 --> 0:03:41,000
putting an electrode in, and then this electrode

83
0:03:41.506,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is completely underneath the skin

84
0:03:43.734,000 --> 0:03:45,000
down to a pacemaker in the chest,

85
0:03:45.824,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and with a remote control very much like a television remote control,

86
0:03:50.352,000 --> 0:03:52,000
we can adjust how much electricity we deliver

87
0:03:53.331,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to these areas of the brain.

88
0:03:55.399,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We can turn it up or down, on or off.

89
0:03:58.29,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now, about a hundred thousand patients in the world

90
0:04:00.945,000 --> 0:04:01,000
have received deep brain stimulation,

91
0:04:02.821,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and I'm going to show you some examples

92
0:04:03.975,000 --> 0:04:05,000
of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement,

93
0:04:06.686,000 --> 0:04:1,000
disorders of mood and disorders of cognition.

94
0:04:11.2,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So this looks something like this when it's in the brain.

95
0:04:13.939,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain

96
0:04:16.174,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and resting there, and we can place this really anywhere in the brain.

97
0:04:19.357,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I tell my friends that no neuron is safe

98
0:04:21.817,000 --> 0:04:23,000
from a neurosurgeon, because we can really reach

99
0:04:23.999,000 --> 0:04:25,000
just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now.

100
0:04:26.565,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now the first example I'm going to show you is a patient

101
0:04:29.085,000 --> 0:04:3,000
with Parkinson's disease,

102
0:04:30.795,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and this lady has Parkinson's disease,

103
0:04:32.782,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and she has these electrodes in her brain,

104
0:04:35.092,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and I'm going to show you what she's like

105
0:04:36.374,000 --> 0:04:39,000
when the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms,

106
0:04:39.881,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and then we're going to turn it on.

107
0:04:42.214,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So this looks something like this.

108
0:04:44.909,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The electrodes are turned off now, and you can see that she has tremor.

109
0:04:49.42,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Video) Man: Okay. Woman: I can't. Man: Can you try to touch my finger?

110
0:04:53.139,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Video) Man: That's a little better. Woman: That side is better.

111
0:04:56.764,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We're now going to turn it on.

112
0:05:00.556,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It's on. Just turned it on.

113
0:05:06.561,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And this works like that, instantly.

114
0:05:09.824,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And the difference between shaking in this way and not --

115
0:05:12.806,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Applause)

116
0:05:17.407,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior

117
0:05:21.512,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of 25,000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus.

118
0:05:25.485,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So we now know how to find these troublemakers

119
0:05:28.061,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and tell them, "Gentlemen, that's enough.

120
0:05:29.452,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We want you to stop doing that."

121
0:05:30.786,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And we do that with electricity.

122
0:05:32.008,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So we use electricity to dictate how they fire,

123
0:05:35.422,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity.

124
0:05:38.884,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So in this case, we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons.

125
0:05:42.328,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We started using this technique in other problems,

126
0:05:44.89,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem

127
0:05:46.292,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that we encountered, a case of dystonia.

128
0:05:49.46,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So dystonia is a disorder affecting children.

129
0:05:51.965,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's a genetic disorder, and it involves a twisting motion,

130
0:05:55.027,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and these children get progressively more and more twisting

131
0:05:57.851,000 --> 0:05:58,000
until they can't breathe, until they get sores,

132
0:05:59.842,000 --> 0:06:01,000
urinary infections, and then they die.

133
0:06:01.873,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So back in 1997, I was asked to see this young boy,

134
0:06:05.246,000 --> 0:06:07,000
perfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia.

135
0:06:08.202,000 --> 0:06:1,000
There are eight children in the family.

136
0:06:10.421,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Five of them have dystonia.

137
0:06:13.78,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So here he is.

138
0:06:15.965,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This boy is nine years old, perfectly normal until the age six,

139
0:06:20.151,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and then he started twisting his body, first the right foot,

140
0:06:24.546,000 --> 0:06:27,000
then the left foot, then the right arm, then the left arm,

141
0:06:27.966,000 --> 0:06:3,000
then the trunk, and then by the time he arrived,

142
0:06:31.213,000 --> 0:06:33,000
within the course of one or two years of the disease onset,

143
0:06:34.153,000 --> 0:06:36,000
he could no longer walk, he could no longer stand.

144
0:06:36.473,000 --> 0:06:38,000
He was crippled, and indeed the natural progression

145
0:06:39.171,000 --> 0:06:42,000
as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted,

146
0:06:42.726,000 --> 0:06:47,000
progressively disabled, and many of these children do not survive.

147
0:06:48.416,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So he is one of five kids.

148
0:06:50.444,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this.

149
0:06:54.538,000 --> 0:06:55,000
He did not respond to any drugs.

150
0:06:56.494,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We did not know what to do with this boy.

151
0:06:58.434,000 --> 0:07:,000
We did not know what operation to do,

152
0:07:00.55,000 --> 0:07:02,000
where to go in the brain,

153
0:07:02.744,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease,

154
0:07:05.517,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we reasoned, why don't we try to suppress

155
0:07:07.522,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the same area in the brain that we suppressed

156
0:07:10.619,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in Parkinson's disease, and let's see what happens?

157
0:07:14.274,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So here he was. We operated on him

158
0:07:16.061,000 --> 0:07:19,000
hoping that he would get better. We did not know.

159
0:07:19.935,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So here he is now, back in Israel where he lives,

160
0:07:24.062,000 --> 0:07:28,000
three months after the procedure, and here he is.

161
0:07:28.115,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Applause)

162
0:07:36.669,000 --> 0:07:38,000
On the basis of this result, this is now a procedure

163
0:07:39.29,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that's done throughout the world,

164
0:07:40.538,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and there have been hundreds of children

165
0:07:41.833,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that have been helped with this kind of surgery.

166
0:07:46.04,000 --> 0:07:48,000
This boy is now in university

167
0:07:48.157,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and leads quite a normal life.

168
0:07:50.193,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This has been one of the most satisfying cases

169
0:07:52.561,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that I have ever done in my entire career,

170
0:07:54.54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to restore movement and walking to this kind of child.

171
0:07:57.917,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Applause)

172
0:08:04.172,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We realized that perhaps we could use this technology

173
0:08:07.041,000 --> 0:08:09,000
not only in circuits that control your movement

174
0:08:09.213,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but also circuits that control other things,

175
0:08:11.165,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and the next thing that we took on

176
0:08:12.312,000 --> 0:08:14,000
was circuits that control your mood.

177
0:08:15.305,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And we decided to take on depression,

178
0:08:17.381,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent,

179
0:08:19.64,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and as you know, there are many treatments for depression,

180
0:08:22.184,000 --> 0:08:24,000
with medication and psychotherapy,

181
0:08:24.221,000 --> 0:08:26,000
even electroconvulsive therapy,

182
0:08:26.283,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but there are millions of people,

183
0:08:27.617,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression

184
0:08:30.409,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that do not respond, and it is these patients that we want to help.

185
0:08:33.661,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And let's see if we can use this technique

186
0:08:35.764,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to help these patients with depression.

187
0:08:38.003,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So the first thing we did was, we compared,

188
0:08:39.853,000 --> 0:08:4,000
what's different in the brain of someone with depression

189
0:08:41.677,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and someone who is normal,

190
0:08:43.345,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain,

191
0:08:46.805,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and what we noticed is that in patients with depression

192
0:08:49.174,000 --> 0:08:51,000
compared to normals,

193
0:08:51.219,000 --> 0:08:52,000
areas of the brain are shut down,

194
0:08:52.717,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and those are the areas in blue.

195
0:08:53.982,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So here you really have the blues,

196
0:08:55.602,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and the areas in blue are areas that are involved

197
0:08:59.175,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in motivation, in drive and decision-making,

198
0:09:01.831,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and indeed, if you're severely depressed as these patients were,

199
0:09:04.326,000 --> 0:09:06,000
those are impaired. You lack motivation and drive.

200
0:09:07.018,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The other thing we discovered

201
0:09:08.897,000 --> 0:09:1,000
was an area that was overactive, area 25,

202
0:09:11.386,000 --> 0:09:12,000
seen there in red,

203
0:09:12.974,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and area 25 is the sadness center of the brain.

204
0:09:15.631,000 --> 0:09:17,000
If I make any of you sad, for example, I make you remember

205
0:09:18.504,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the last time you saw your parent before they died

206
0:09:20.791,000 --> 0:09:21,000
or a friend before they died,

207
0:09:22.424,000 --> 0:09:23,000
this area of the brain lights up.

208
0:09:23.63,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It is the sadness center of the brain.

209
0:09:25.353,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so patients with depression have hyperactivity.

210
0:09:28.565,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot.

211
0:09:30.743,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The thermostat is set at 100 degrees,

212
0:09:33.4,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and the other areas of the brain, involved in drive and motivation, are shut down.

213
0:09:36.528,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So we wondered, can we place electrodes in this area of sadness

214
0:09:39.525,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and see if we can turn down the thermostat,

215
0:09:41.954,000 --> 0:09:42,000
can we turn down the activity,

216
0:09:43.667,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and what will be the consequence of that?

217
0:09:45.789,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression.

218
0:09:48.916,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory.

219
0:09:51.403,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And we placed electrodes in area 25,

220
0:09:53.337,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and in the top scan you see before the operation,

221
0:09:55.622,000 --> 0:09:57,000
area 25, the sadness area is red hot,

222
0:09:57.908,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue,

223
0:10:00.302,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and then, after three months of continuous stimulation,

224
0:10:02.71,000 --> 0:10:05,000
24 hours a day, or six months of continuous stimulation,

225
0:10:05.725,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we have a complete reversal of this.

226
0:10:07.499,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We're able to drive down area 25,

227
0:10:10.338,000 --> 0:10:11,000
down to a more normal level,

228
0:10:12.29,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and we're able to turn back online

229
0:10:14.326,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the frontal lobes of the brain,

230
0:10:15.634,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and indeed we're seeing very striking results

231
0:10:17.503,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in these patients with severe depression.

232
0:10:20.25,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So now we are in clinical trials, and are in Phase III clinical trials,

233
0:10:23.152,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and this may become a new procedure,

234
0:10:25.695,000 --> 0:10:27,000
if it's safe and we find that it's effective,

235
0:10:27.878,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to treat patients with severe depression.

236
0:10:31.567,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation

237
0:10:34.527,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to treat the motor system

238
0:10:36.614,000 --> 0:10:38,000
in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia.

239
0:10:39.06,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit

240
0:10:41.445,000 --> 0:10:42,000
in cases of depression.

241
0:10:43.095,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter?

242
0:10:47.64,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Laughter)

243
0:10:49.736,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Anybody interested in that?

244
0:10:52.302,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Applause)

245
0:10:54.602,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Of course we can, right?

246
0:10:57.59,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So what we've decided to do is

247
0:10:59.804,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we're going to try to turbocharge

248
0:11:02.225,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the memory circuits in the brain.

249
0:11:04.43,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We're going to place electrodes within the circuits

250
0:11:07.166,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that regulate your memory and cognitive function

251
0:11:09.842,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to see if we can turn up their activity.

252
0:11:13.112,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Now we're not going to do this in normal people.

253
0:11:15.05,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits,

254
0:11:18.702,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease

255
0:11:22.161,000 --> 0:11:24,000
who have cognitive and memory deficits.

256
0:11:24.268,000 --> 0:11:25,000
As you know, this is the main symptom

257
0:11:26.207,000 --> 0:11:28,000
of early onset Alzheimer's disease.

258
0:11:28.63,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So we've placed electrodes within this circuit

259
0:11:30.824,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in an area of the brain called the fornix,

260
0:11:32.819,000 --> 0:11:34,000
which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit,

261
0:11:35.597,000 --> 0:11:38,000
with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit,

262
0:11:39.025,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and whether that can, in turn, help these patients

263
0:11:42.274,000 --> 0:11:44,000
with Alzheimer's disease.

264
0:11:44.583,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease,

265
0:11:46.901,000 --> 0:11:5,000
there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain.

266
0:11:50.973,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose.

267
0:11:54.391,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It uses 20 percent of all your --

268
0:11:56.151,000 --> 0:11:57,000
even though it only weighs two percent --

269
0:11:57.666,000 --> 0:12:,000
it uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight.

270
0:12:00.811,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain,

271
0:12:03.394,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and as you go from being normal

272
0:12:05.824,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to having mild cognitive impairment,

273
0:12:08.017,000 --> 0:12:1,000
which is a precursor for Alzheimer's, all the way to Alzheimer's disease,

274
0:12:10.472,000 --> 0:12:12,000
then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose.

275
0:12:13.161,000 --> 0:12:15,000
They shut down. They turn off.

276
0:12:15.456,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And indeed, what we see is that these areas in red

277
0:12:17.738,000 --> 0:12:18,000
around the outside ribbon of the brain

278
0:12:19.505,000 --> 0:12:21,000
are progressively getting more and more blue

279
0:12:21.781,000 --> 0:12:24,000
until they shut down completely.

280
0:12:24.953,000 --> 0:12:26,000
This is analogous to having a power failure

281
0:12:27.312,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in an area of the brain, a regional power failure.

282
0:12:29.855,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So the lights are out in parts of the brain

283
0:12:32.252,000 --> 0:12:34,000
in patients with Alzheimer's disease,

284
0:12:34.85,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and the question is, are the lights out forever,

285
0:12:37.259,000 --> 0:12:39,000
or can we turn the lights back on?

286
0:12:40.12,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again?

287
0:12:43.356,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix

288
0:12:45.906,000 --> 0:12:47,000
of patients with Alzheimer's disease, we turned it on,

289
0:12:48.519,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain.

290
0:12:52.03,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And indeed, at the top, you'll see before the surgery,

291
0:12:55.292,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal,

292
0:12:58.656,000 --> 0:13:,000
predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes.

293
0:13:00.864,000 --> 0:13:01,000
These areas of the brain are shut down.

294
0:13:02.574,000 --> 0:13:04,000
The lights are out in these areas of the brain.

295
0:13:05.249,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month

296
0:13:08.203,000 --> 0:13:09,000
or a year, and the areas in red

297
0:13:09.594,000 --> 0:13:12,000
represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization.

298
0:13:12.901,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And indeed, we are able to get these areas of the brain

299
0:13:15.021,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that were not using glucose to use glucose once again.

300
0:13:18.535,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So the message here is that, in Alzheimer's disease,

301
0:13:20.887,000 --> 0:13:22,000
the lights are out, but there is someone home,

302
0:13:23.216,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and we're able to turn the power back on

303
0:13:25.365,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to these areas of the brain, and as we do so,

304
0:13:27.671,000 --> 0:13:29,000
we expect that their functions will return.

305
0:13:30.607,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So this is now in clinical trials.

306
0:13:32.734,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We are going to operate on 50 patients

307
0:13:34.635,000 --> 0:13:35,000
with early Alzheimer's disease

308
0:13:36.613,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to see whether this is safe and effective,

309
0:13:38.67,000 --> 0:13:4,000
whether we can improve their neurologic function.

310
0:13:41.649,000 --> 0:13:48,000
(Applause)

311
0:13:49.129,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So the message I want to leave you with today is that,

312
0:13:52.077,000 --> 0:13:54,000
indeed, there are several circuits in the brain

313
0:13:54.681,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that are malfunctioning across various disease states,

314
0:13:58.607,000 --> 0:14:,000
whether we're talking about Parkinson's disease,

315
0:14:00.815,000 --> 0:14:03,000
depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's.

316
0:14:03.897,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We are now learning to understand what are the circuits,

317
0:14:06.927,000 --> 0:14:08,000
what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for

318
0:14:09.129,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases.

319
0:14:11.649,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We can now reach those circuits.

320
0:14:13.955,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We can introduce electrodes within those circuits.

321
0:14:16.587,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We can graduate the activity of those circuits.

322
0:14:19.569,000 --> 0:14:22,000
We can turn them down if they are overactive,

323
0:14:22.821,000 --> 0:14:24,000
if they're causing trouble, trouble that is felt throughout the brain,

324
0:14:25.778,000 --> 0:14:27,000
or we can turn them up if they are underperforming,

325
0:14:28.359,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and in so doing, we think that we may be able to help

326
0:14:30.752,000 --> 0:14:32,000
the overall function of the brain.

327
0:14:33.092,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The implications of this, of course, is that we may be able

328
0:14:35.646,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to modify the symptoms of the disease,

329
0:14:37.956,000 --> 0:14:38,000
but I haven't told you but there's also some evidence

330
0:14:39.865,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity,

331
0:14:44.028,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and this is something for the future, to see if, indeed,

332
0:14:46.48,000 --> 0:14:48,000
we not only change the activity but also

333
0:14:48.719,000 --> 0:14:5,000
some of the reparative functions of the brain

334
0:14:50.733,000 --> 0:14:51,000
can be harvested.

335
0:14:52.288,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So I envision that we're going to see a great expansion

336
0:14:55.335,000 --> 0:14:57,000
of indications of this technique.

337
0:14:57.787,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain.

338
0:15:00.566,000 --> 0:15:02,000
One of the most exciting things about this is that, indeed,

339
0:15:03.525,000 --> 0:15:04,000
it involves multidisciplinary work.

340
0:15:05.372,000 --> 0:15:07,000
It involves the work of engineers, of imaging scientists,

341
0:15:08.174,000 --> 0:15:1,000
of basic scientists, of neurologists,

342
0:15:10.376,000 --> 0:15:12,000
psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and certainly at the interface

343
0:15:13.128,000 --> 0:15:15,000
of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement.

344
0:15:16.069,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And I think that we will see that

345
0:15:18.826,000 --> 0:15:21,000
we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits

346
0:15:22.262,000 --> 0:15:23,000
out from the brain as time goes on,

347
0:15:24.158,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and the consequence of that, of course, will be

348
0:15:26.06,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that we will be able to help many more patients.

349
0:15:28.332,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank you very much.

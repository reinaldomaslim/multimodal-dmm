2
0:00:12.553,000 --> 0:00:16,000
OK, so today I want to talk about how we talk about love.

3
0:00:17.237,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And specifically,

4
0:00:18.411,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I want to talk about what's wrong with how we talk about love.

5
0:00:22.673,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Most of us will probably fall in love a few times

6
0:00:26.104,000 --> 0:00:27,000
over the course of our lives,

7
0:00:27.593,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and in the English language, this metaphor, falling,

8
0:00:31.827,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is really the main way that we talk about that experience.

9
0:00:35.592,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I don't know about you,

10
0:00:36.767,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but when I conceptualize this metaphor,

11
0:00:38.718,000 --> 0:00:4,000
what I picture is straight out of a cartoon --

12
0:00:42.076,000 --> 0:00:43,000
like there's a man,

13
0:00:43.396,000 --> 0:00:44,000
he's walking down the sidewalk,

14
0:00:45.137,000 --> 0:00:48,000
without realizing it, he crosses over an open manhole,

15
0:00:48.273,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and he just plummets into the sewer below.

16
0:00:51.958,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I picture it this way because falling is not jumping.

17
0:00:56.769,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Falling is accidental,

18
0:00:58.825,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it's uncontrollable.

19
0:01:00.751,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It's something that happens to us without our consent.

20
0:01:04.3,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And this --

21
0:01:05.517,000 --> 0:01:08,000
this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship.

22
0:01:10.336,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I am a writer and I'm also an English teacher,

23
0:01:14.127,000 --> 0:01:16,000
which means I think about words for a living.

24
0:01:16.436,000 --> 0:01:2,000
You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters,

25
0:01:20.61,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use

26
0:01:24.834,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to talk about love --

27
0:01:26.425,000 --> 0:01:27,000
maybe even most of them --

28
0:01:28.272,000 --> 0:01:29,000
are a problem.

29
0:01:30.7,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So, in love, we fall.

30
0:01:33.766,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We're struck.

31
0:01:35.255,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We are crushed.

32
0:01:37.331,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We swoon.

33
0:01:39.186,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We burn with passion.

34
0:01:41.738,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Love makes us crazy,

35
0:01:43.739,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and it makes us sick.

36
0:01:45.796,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Our hearts ache,

37
0:01:47.18,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and then they break.

38
0:01:50.226,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone

39
0:01:53.394,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to extreme violence or illness.

40
0:01:56.071,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:59.101,000 --> 0:02:,000
They do.

42
0:02:00.276,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And they position us as the victims

43
0:02:02.283,000 --> 0:02:05,000
of unforeseen and totally unavoidable circumstances.

44
0:02:06.547,000 --> 0:02:08,000
My favorite one of these is "smitten,"

45
0:02:09.294,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which is the past participle of the word "smite."

46
0:02:12.172,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And if you look this word up in the dictionary --

47
0:02:15.264,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:16.312,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you will see that it can be defined as both "grievous affliction,"

49
0:02:20.854,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and, "to be very much in love."

50
0:02:25.716,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I tend to associate the word "smite" with a very particular context,

51
0:02:29.084,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which is the Old Testament.

52
0:02:31.56,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In the Book of Exodus alone, there are 16 references to smiting,

53
0:02:36.332,000 --> 0:02:39,000
which is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God.

54
0:02:40.129,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:41.874,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Here we are using the same word to talk about love

56
0:02:44.603,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that we use to explain a plague of locusts.

57
0:02:47.053,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:48.105,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Right?

59
0:02:49.385,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So, how did this happen?

60
0:02:51.501,000 --> 0:02:54,000
How have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering?

61
0:02:55.516,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience

62
0:02:59.529,000 --> 0:03:01,000
as if we are victims?

63
0:03:02.556,000 --> 0:03:03,000
These are difficult questions,

64
0:03:04.271,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but I have some theories.

65
0:03:05.941,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And to think this through,

66
0:03:07.204,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I want to focus on one metaphor in particular,

67
0:03:09.856,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which is the idea of love as madness.

68
0:03:13.088,000 --> 0:03:15,000
When I first started researching romantic love,

69
0:03:15.819,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I found these madness metaphors everywhere.

70
0:03:18.604,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The history of Western culture

71
0:03:20.731,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is full of language that equates love to mental illness.

72
0:03:25.44,000 --> 0:03:26,000
These are just a few examples.

73
0:03:27.391,000 --> 0:03:28,000
William Shakespeare:

74
0:03:28.758,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"Love is merely a madness,"

75
0:03:30.215,000 --> 0:03:31,000
from "As You Like It."

76
0:03:32.092,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Friedrich Nietzsche:

77
0:03:33.373,000 --> 0:03:35,000
"There is always some madness in love."

78
0:03:36.559,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love -- "

79
0:03:39.449,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:41.542,000 --> 0:03:43,000
from the great philosopher, Beyoncé Knowles.

81
0:03:44.164,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:47.083,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I fell in love for the first time when I was 20,

83
0:03:49.941,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start.

84
0:03:53.459,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And it was long distance for the first couple of years,

85
0:03:56.688,000 --> 0:04:,000
so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows.

86
0:04:01.794,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I can remember one moment in particular.

87
0:04:04.58,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I was sitting on a bed in a hostel in South America,

88
0:04:07.949,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I was watching the person I love walk out the door.

89
0:04:12.151,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And it was late,

90
0:04:13.788,000 --> 0:04:14,000
it was nearly midnight,

91
0:04:15.072,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we'd gotten into an argument over dinner,

92
0:04:17.073,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and when we got back to our room,

93
0:04:19.046,000 --> 0:04:21,000
he threw his things in the bag and stormed out.

94
0:04:23.141,000 --> 0:04:26,000
While I can no longer remember what that argument was about,

95
0:04:26.424,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave.

96
0:04:31.122,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I was 22, it was my first time in the developing world,

97
0:04:35.424,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and I was totally alone.

98
0:04:38.412,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I had another week until my flight home,

99
0:04:41.803,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I knew the name of the town that I was in,

100
0:04:44.195,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out,

101
0:04:47.802,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but I had no idea how to get around.

102
0:04:51.842,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I had no guidebook and very little money,

103
0:04:55.043,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and I spoke no Spanish.

104
0:04:57.547,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Someone more adventurous than me

105
0:04:59.668,000 --> 0:05:01,000
might have seen this as a moment of opportunity,

106
0:05:02.122,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but I just froze.

107
0:05:04.406,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I just sat there.

108
0:05:06.738,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And then I burst into tears.

109
0:05:09.357,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But despite my panic,

110
0:05:11.752,000 --> 0:05:13,000
some small voice in my head thought,

111
0:05:14.346,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"Wow. That was dramatic.

112
0:05:16.707,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I must really be doing this love thing right."

113
0:05:19.43,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:21.242,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love.

115
0:05:26.226,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And it sounds so strange to me now, but at 22,

116
0:05:29.69,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I longed to have dramatic experiences,

117
0:05:32.859,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and in that moment, I was irrational and furious and devastated,

118
0:05:38.081,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and weirdly enough,

119
0:05:39.329,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had

120
0:05:42.729,000 --> 0:05:43,000
for the guy who had just left me.

121
0:05:46.163,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy,

122
0:05:50.55,000 --> 0:05:53,000
because I thought that that was how love worked.

123
0:05:55.141,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This really should not be surprising,

124
0:05:56.972,000 --> 0:05:58,000
considering that according to Wikipedia,

125
0:05:59.45,000 --> 0:06:01,000
there are eight films,

126
0:06:01.747,000 --> 0:06:02,000
14 songs,

127
0:06:03.768,000 --> 0:06:06,000
two albums and one novel with the title "Crazy Love."

128
0:06:07.837,000 --> 0:06:1,000
About half an hour later, he came back to our room.

129
0:06:10.987,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We made up.

130
0:06:12.162,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We spent another mostly happy week traveling together.

131
0:06:15.003,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And then, when I got home,

132
0:06:16.459,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I thought, "That was so terrible and so great.

133
0:06:21.989,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This must be a real romance."

134
0:06:25.006,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I expected my first love to feel like madness,

135
0:06:27.73,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and of course, it met that expectation very well.

136
0:06:31.941,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But loving someone like that --

137
0:06:33.656,000 --> 0:06:37,000
as if my entire well-being depended on him loving me back --

138
0:06:37.775,000 --> 0:06:39,000
was not very good for me

139
0:06:39.892,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or for him.

140
0:06:41.85,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual.

141
0:06:46.026,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love.

142
0:06:50.815,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In fact, there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal,

143
0:06:55.28,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because, neurochemically speaking,

144
0:06:57.19,000 --> 0:07:01,000
romantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished.

145
0:07:03.046,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This is true.

146
0:07:04.221,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This study from 1999 used blood tests

147
0:07:08.804,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love

148
0:07:11.922,000 --> 0:07:13,000
very closely resembled the serotonin levels

149
0:07:14.743,000 --> 0:07:17,000
of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

150
0:07:18.072,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:19.104,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Yes, and low levels of serotonin

152
0:07:21.825,000 --> 0:07:24,000
are also associated with seasonal affective disorder

153
0:07:25.451,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and depression.

154
0:07:27.687,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So there is some evidence

155
0:07:29.971,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors.

156
0:07:34.343,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And there are other studies to confirm

157
0:07:38.374,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that most relationships begin this way.

158
0:07:42.66,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin

159
0:07:46.847,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love,

160
0:07:50.906,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain.

161
0:07:54.988,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love.

162
0:07:57.943,000 --> 0:08:,000
But the good news is, it doesn't always last that long --

163
0:08:01.093,000 --> 0:08:04,000
usually from a few months to a couple of years.

164
0:08:05.352,000 --> 0:08:07,000
When I got back from my trip to South America,

165
0:08:08.184,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I spent a lot of time alone in my room,

166
0:08:11.785,000 --> 0:08:12,000
checking my email,

167
0:08:13.149,000 --> 0:08:15,000
desperate to hear from the guy I loved.

168
0:08:16.545,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction,

169
0:08:21.917,000 --> 0:08:22,000
then I did not need their friendship.

170
0:08:23.89,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So I stopped hanging out with most of them.

171
0:08:26.387,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And it was probably the most unhappy year of my life.

172
0:08:31.086,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable,

173
0:08:35.849,000 --> 0:08:36,000
because if I could be miserable,

174
0:08:37.665,000 --> 0:08:39,000
then I would prove how much I loved him.

175
0:08:40.356,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And if I could prove it,

176
0:08:42.265,000 --> 0:08:44,000
then we would have to end up together eventually.

177
0:08:46.05,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is the real madness,

178
0:08:48.162,000 --> 0:08:5,000
because there is no cosmic rule

179
0:08:50.581,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that says that great suffering equals great reward,

180
0:08:54.478,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but we talk about love as if this is true.

181
0:08:59.463,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural.

182
0:09:03.774,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Our biology tells us that love is good

183
0:09:06.257,000 --> 0:09:09,000
by activating these reward circuits in our brain,

184
0:09:09.435,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and it tells us that love is painful when, after a fight or a breakup,

185
0:09:14.079,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that neurochemical reward is withdrawn.

186
0:09:17.155,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And in fact -- and maybe you've heard this --

187
0:09:19.621,000 --> 0:09:2,000
neurochemically speaking,

188
0:09:21.489,000 --> 0:09:24,000
going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal,

189
0:09:25.675,000 --> 0:09:26,000
which I find reassuring.

190
0:09:27.335,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:29.066,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And then our culture uses language

192
0:09:31.922,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to shape and reinforce these ideas about love.

193
0:09:34.727,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In this case, we're talking about metaphors about pain

194
0:09:37.375,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and addiction and madness.

195
0:09:39.826,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's kind of an interesting feedback loop.

196
0:09:42.294,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Love is powerful and at times painful,

197
0:09:45.835,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and we express this in our words and stories,

198
0:09:49.182,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but then our words and stories prime us

199
0:09:51.704,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to expect love to be powerful and painful.

200
0:09:55.955,000 --> 0:09:58,000
What's interesting to me is that all of this happens

201
0:09:59.152,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in a culture that values lifelong monogamy.

202
0:10:02.658,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It seems like we want it both ways:

203
0:10:04.743,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we want love to feel like madness,

204
0:10:07.718,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and we want it to last an entire lifetime.

205
0:10:11.561,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That sounds terrible.

206
0:10:13.148,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:15.853,000 --> 0:10:16,000
To reconcile this,

208
0:10:17.473,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we need to either change our culture or change our expectations.

209
0:10:23.408,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So, imagine if we were all less passive in love.

210
0:10:27.642,000 --> 0:10:31,000
If we were more assertive, more open-minded, more generous

211
0:10:31.812,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and instead of falling in love,

212
0:10:35.137,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we stepped into love.

213
0:10:38.223,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I know that this is asking a lot,

214
0:10:40.176,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but I'm not actually the first person to suggest this.

215
0:10:45.012,000 --> 0:10:47,000
In their book, "Metaphors We Live By,"

216
0:10:47.545,000 --> 0:10:52,000
linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff suggest a really interesting solution

217
0:10:52.683,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to this dilemma,

218
0:10:54.491,000 --> 0:10:56,000
which is to change our metaphors.

219
0:10:57.795,000 --> 0:11:01,000
They argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world,

220
0:11:03.071,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and that they can even act as a guide for future actions,

221
0:11:06.593,000 --> 0:11:07,000
like self-fulfilling prophecies.

222
0:11:09.489,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love:

223
0:11:13.977,000 --> 0:11:15,000
love as a collaborative work of art.

224
0:11:16.872,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I really like this way of thinking about love.

225
0:11:21.028,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments,

226
0:11:24.574,000 --> 0:11:27,000
which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of,

227
0:11:28.394,000 --> 0:11:3,000
or ideas contained within, a given metaphor.

228
0:11:31.35,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And Johnson and Lakoff talk about everything

229
0:11:34.283,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that collaborating on a work of art entails:

230
0:11:36.976,000 --> 0:11:4,000
effort, compromise, patience, shared goals.

231
0:11:41.655,000 --> 0:11:44,000
These ideas align nicely with our cultural investment

232
0:11:45.509,000 --> 0:11:47,000
in long-term romantic commitment,

233
0:11:47.606,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but they also work well for other kinds of relationships --

234
0:11:52.02,000 --> 0:11:57,000
short-term, casual, polyamorous, non-monogamous, asexual --

235
0:11:57.7,000 --> 0:12:,000
because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas

236
0:12:01.609,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to the experience of loving someone.

237
0:12:04.67,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So if love is a collaborative work of art,

238
0:12:09.088,000 --> 0:12:12,000
then love is an aesthetic experience.

239
0:12:13.524,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Love is unpredictable,

240
0:12:16.153,000 --> 0:12:18,000
love is creative,

241
0:12:18.898,000 --> 0:12:22,000
love requires communication and discipline,

242
0:12:23.055,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it is frustrating and emotionally demanding.

243
0:12:26.677,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And love involves both joy and pain.

244
0:12:30.742,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Ultimately, each experience of love is different.

245
0:12:35.759,000 --> 0:12:36,000
When I was younger,

246
0:12:37.41,000 --> 0:12:41,000
it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love,

247
0:12:42.102,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that I didn't have to just accept whatever love offered.

248
0:12:46.775,000 --> 0:12:49,000
When 14-year-old Juliet first meets --

249
0:12:50.128,000 --> 0:12:53,000
or, when 14-year-old Juliet cannot be with Romeo,

250
0:12:54.077,000 --> 0:12:56,000
whom she has met four days ago,

251
0:12:56.738,000 --> 0:12:59,000
she does not feel disappointed or angsty.

252
0:13:01.022,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Where is she?

253
0:13:02.403,000 --> 0:13:03,000
She wants to die.

254
0:13:04.236,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Right?

255
0:13:05.411,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And just as a refresher, at this point in the play,

256
0:13:07.904,000 --> 0:13:08,000
act three of five,

257
0:13:09.236,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Romeo is not dead.

258
0:13:11.641,000 --> 0:13:12,000
He's alive,

259
0:13:13.005,000 --> 0:13:14,000
he's healthy,

260
0:13:14.417,000 --> 0:13:16,000
he's just been banished from the city.

261
0:13:17.853,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I understand that 16th-century Verona is unlike contemporary North America,

262
0:13:23.878,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and yet when I first read this play,

263
0:13:26.88,000 --> 0:13:28,000
also at age 14,

264
0:13:29.297,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Juliet's suffering made sense to me.

265
0:13:33.295,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Reframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire,

266
0:13:38.676,000 --> 0:13:4,000
rather than something that just happens to me

267
0:13:41.144,000 --> 0:13:43,000
without my control or consent,

268
0:13:43.69,000 --> 0:13:44,000
is empowering.

269
0:13:45.779,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It's still hard.

270
0:13:47.421,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Love still feels totally maddening and crushing some days,

271
0:13:52.977,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and when I feel really frustrated,

272
0:13:55.116,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I have to remind myself:

273
0:13:56.995,000 --> 0:13:59,000
my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner

274
0:14:00.363,000 --> 0:14:02,000
about what I want to make together.

275
0:14:03.923,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This isn't easy, either.

276
0:14:06.756,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But it's just so much better than the alternative,

277
0:14:10.672,000 --> 0:14:12,000
which is that thing that feels like madness.

278
0:14:14.839,000 --> 0:14:19,000
This version of love is not about winning or losing someone's affection.

279
0:14:20.761,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Instead, it requires that you trust your partner

280
0:14:24.383,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and talk about things when trusting feels difficult,

281
0:14:27.481,000 --> 0:14:29,000
which sounds so simple,

282
0:14:29.951,000 --> 0:14:33,000
but is actually a kind of revolutionary, radical act.

283
0:14:35.062,000 --> 0:14:38,000
This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself

284
0:14:39.23,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and what you're gaining or losing in your relationship,

285
0:14:42.395,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer.

286
0:14:46.811,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This version of love allows us to say things like,

287
0:14:50.24,000 --> 0:14:54,000
"Hey, we're not very good collaborators. Maybe this isn't for us."

288
0:14:55.733,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Or, "That relationship was shorter than I had planned,

289
0:14:59.618,000 --> 0:15:01,000
but it was still kind of beautiful."

290
0:15:02.836,000 --> 0:15:04,000
The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art

291
0:15:05.65,000 --> 0:15:07,000
is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself.

292
0:15:09.098,000 --> 0:15:12,000
This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like.

293
0:15:13.033,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Thank you.

294
0:15:14.208,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

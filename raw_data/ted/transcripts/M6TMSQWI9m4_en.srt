1
0:00:12.995,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Pat Mitchell: That day,

2
0:00:14.682,000 --> 0:00:17,000
January 8, 2011, began like all others.

3
0:00:18.555,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You were both doing the work that you love.

4
0:00:21.704,000 --> 0:00:23,000
You were meeting with constituents,

5
0:00:23.885,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which is something that you loved doing

6
0:00:26.05,000 --> 0:00:27,000
as a congresswoman,

7
0:00:27.217,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and Mark, you were happily preparing

8
0:00:29.622,000 --> 0:00:32,000
for your next space shuttle.

9
0:00:32.901,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And suddenly, everything that you had planned

10
0:00:37.08,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or expected in your lives

11
0:00:39.031,000 --> 0:00:42,000
was irrevocably changed forever.

12
0:00:42.88,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Mark Kelly: Yeah, it's amazing,

13
0:00:43.879,000 --> 0:00:44,000
it's amazing how everything can change

14
0:00:45.653,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for any of us in an instant.

15
0:00:47.86,000 --> 0:00:48,000
People don't realize that.

16
0:00:49.508,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I certainly didn't.

17
0:00:50.698,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Gabby Giffords: Yes.

18
0:00:51.356,000 --> 0:00:52,000
MK: And on that Saturday morning,

19
0:00:52.606,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I got this horrible phone call

20
0:00:55.57,000 --> 0:00:57,000
from Gabby's chief of staff.

21
0:00:57.628,000 --> 0:00:59,000
She didn't have much other information.

22
0:00:59.648,000 --> 0:01:01,000
She just said, "Gabby was shot."

23
0:01:01.977,000 --> 0:01:02,000
A few minutes later, I called her back

24
0:01:03.194,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I actually thought for a second,

25
0:01:05.575,000 --> 0:01:07,000
well, maybe I just imagined getting this phone call.

26
0:01:08.314,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I called her back, and that's when she told me

27
0:01:10.016,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that Gabby had been shot in the head.

28
0:01:12.319,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And from that point on,

29
0:01:14.144,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I knew that our lives were going to be a lot different.

30
0:01:17.756,000 --> 0:01:18,000
PM: And when you arrived at the hospital,

31
0:01:19.733,000 --> 0:01:21,000
what was the prognosis that they gave you

32
0:01:22.457,000 --> 0:01:25,000
about Gabby's condition and what recovery, if any,

33
0:01:25.705,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you could expect?

34
0:01:27.196,000 --> 0:01:28,000
MK: Well, for a gunshot wound to the head

35
0:01:29.136,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and a traumatic brain injury,

36
0:01:30.338,000 --> 0:01:33,000
they typically can't tell you much.

37
0:01:33.449,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Every injury is different. It's not predictable

38
0:01:36.198,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like often a stroke might be predictable,

39
0:01:38.012,000 --> 0:01:4,000
which is another TBI kind of injury.

40
0:01:40.746,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So they didn't know how long Gabby would be in a coma,

41
0:01:43.738,000 --> 0:01:45,000
didn't know when that would change

42
0:01:46.533,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and what the prognosis would be.

43
0:01:49.696,000 --> 0:01:52,000
PM: Gabby, has your recovery

44
0:01:53.502,000 --> 0:01:57,000
been an effort to create a new Gabby Giffords

45
0:01:58.004,000 --> 0:02:01,000
or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords?

46
0:02:01.287,000 --> 0:02:05,000
GG: The new one -- better, stronger, tougher.

47
0:02:05.853,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:10.21,000 --> 0:02:12,000
MK: That to say,

49
0:02:12.57,000 --> 0:02:15,000
when you look at the picture behind us,

50
0:02:15.976,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to come back from that kind of injury

51
0:02:17.62,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and come back strong and stronger than ever

52
0:02:19.848,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is a really tough thing to do.

53
0:02:21.684,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I don't know anybody

54
0:02:23.178,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that's as tough as my wonderful wife right here.

55
0:02:25.8,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Applause)

56
0:02:29.052,000 --> 0:02:31,000
PM: And what were the first signs

57
0:02:31.98,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that recovery was not only going to be possible

58
0:02:35.445,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but you were going to have some semblance

59
0:02:38.096,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of the life that you and Gabby had planned?

60
0:02:40.701,000 --> 0:02:42,000
MK: Well, the first thing, for me, was

61
0:02:42.979,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious,

62
0:02:46.439,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed

63
0:02:51.965,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that she used to do when we might

64
0:02:53.75,000 --> 0:02:54,000
be out to dinner at a restaurant,

65
0:02:55.685,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in that she pulled my ring off

66
0:02:57.568,000 --> 0:03:,000
and she flipped it from one finger to the next,

67
0:03:00.667,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and at that point I knew

68
0:03:02.812,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that she was still in there.

69
0:03:04.396,000 --> 0:03:05,000
PM: And there were certain words, too.

70
0:03:06.062,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Didn't she surprise you with words in the beginning?

71
0:03:09.113,000 --> 0:03:14,000
MK: Well, it was tough in the beginning. GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.

72
0:03:15.05,000 --> 0:03:16,000
MK: Yeah, that was it.

73
0:03:16.43,000 --> 0:03:19,000
For the first month, that was the extent

74
0:03:19.67,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of Gabby's vocabulary.

75
0:03:21.146,000 --> 0:03:23,000
For some reason, she has aphasia,

76
0:03:23.782,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which is difficulty with communication.

77
0:03:25.778,000 --> 0:03:27,000
She latched on to the word "chicken,"

78
0:03:28.22,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which isn't the best but certainly is not the worst.

79
0:03:31.496,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:32.981,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And we were actually worried

81
0:03:34.344,000 --> 0:03:38,000
it could have been a lot worse than that.

82
0:03:38.585,000 --> 0:03:4,000
PM: Gabby, what's been the toughest challenge

83
0:03:40.945,000 --> 0:03:42,000
for you during this recovery?

84
0:03:43.737,000 --> 0:03:47,000
GG: Talking. Really hard. Really.

85
0:03:48.041,000 --> 0:03:51,000
MK: Yeah, with aphasia, Gabby knows what she wants to say,

86
0:03:51.139,000 --> 0:03:52,000
she just can't get it out.

87
0:03:53.013,000 --> 0:03:54,000
She understands everything,

88
0:03:54.425,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but the communication is just very difficult

89
0:03:56.775,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because when you look at the picture,

90
0:03:59.017,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the part of your brain where those communication centers are

91
0:04:03.653,000 --> 0:04:04,000
are on the left side of your head,

92
0:04:05.433,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which is where the bullet passed through.

93
0:04:07.22,000 --> 0:04:09,000
PM: So you have to do a very dangerous thing:

94
0:04:09.433,000 --> 0:04:1,000
speak for your wife.

95
0:04:11.079,000 --> 0:04:12,000
MK: I do.

96
0:04:12.684,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It might be some of the most dangerous things I've ever done.

97
0:04:17.02,000 --> 0:04:18,000
PM: Gabby, are you optimistic

98
0:04:18.92,000 --> 0:04:21,000
about your continuing recovery --

99
0:04:22.183,000 --> 0:04:24,000
walking, talking,

100
0:04:24.407,000 --> 0:04:26,000
being able to move your arm and leg?

101
0:04:26.911,000 --> 0:04:3,000
GG: I'm optimistic. It will be a long, hard haul,

102
0:04:31.265,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but I'm optimistic.

103
0:04:34.113,000 --> 0:04:37,000
PM: That seems to be the number one characteristic of Gabby Giffords,

104
0:04:37.317,000 --> 0:04:38,000
wouldn't you say? (Applause)

105
0:04:38.596,000 --> 0:04:39,000
MK: Gabby's always been really optimistic.

106
0:04:40.026,000 --> 0:04:42,000
She works incredibly hard every day.

107
0:04:42.804,000 --> 0:04:45,000
GG: On the treadmill, walked on my treadmill,

108
0:04:45.808,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Spanish lessons, French horn.

109
0:04:49.285,000 --> 0:04:51,000
MK: It's only my wife who could be --

110
0:04:51.93,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and if you knew her before she was injured,

111
0:04:53.678,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you would kind of understand this --

112
0:04:55.59,000 --> 0:04:56,000
somebody who could be injured

113
0:04:57.3,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and have such a hard time communicating

114
0:05:00.22,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and meets with a speech therapist,

115
0:05:02.13,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and then about a month ago, she says,

116
0:05:04.165,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"I want to learn Spanish again."

117
0:05:07.867,000 --> 0:05:09,000
PM: Well, let's take a little closer look

118
0:05:09.901,000 --> 0:05:11,000
at the wife, and this was even before

119
0:05:12.799,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you met Gabby Giffords.

120
0:05:14.525,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And she's on a motor scooter there,

121
0:05:16.565,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but it's my understanding that's a very tame image

122
0:05:20.085,000 --> 0:05:22,000
of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up.

123
0:05:22.581,000 --> 0:05:24,000
MK: Yeah, Gabby, she used to race motorcycles.

124
0:05:25.333,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So that's a scooter, but she had --

125
0:05:27.253,000 --> 0:05:3,000
well, she still has a BMW motorcycle.

126
0:05:30.739,000 --> 0:05:32,000
PM: Does she ride it? MK: Well, that's a challenge

127
0:05:33.415,000 --> 0:05:35,000
with not being able to move her right arm,

128
0:05:36.063,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but I think with something I know about, Velcro,

129
0:05:40.249,000 --> 0:05:42,000
we might be able to get her back on the bike,

130
0:05:42.505,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar.

131
0:05:47.119,000 --> 0:05:49,000
PM: I have a feeling we might see that picture next,

132
0:05:49.417,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Gabby.

133
0:05:51.05,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But you meet, you're already decided

134
0:05:53.495,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that you're going to dedicate your life to service.

135
0:05:56.485,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You're going into the military

136
0:05:58.492,000 --> 0:06:,000
and eventually to become an astronaut.

137
0:06:00.773,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So you meet.

138
0:06:03.293,000 --> 0:06:05,000
What attracts you to Gabby?

139
0:06:06.07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
MK: Well, when we met, oddly enough,

140
0:06:09.674,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it was the last time we were in Vancouver,

141
0:06:12.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
about 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver,

142
0:06:14.726,000 --> 0:06:17,000
at the airport, on a trip that we were both taking

143
0:06:18.675,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to China,

144
0:06:20.53,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that I would actually, from my background,

145
0:06:22.574,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I would call it a boondoggle.

146
0:06:24.802,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Gabby would — GG: Fact-finding mission.

147
0:06:27.624,000 --> 0:06:3,000
MK: She would call it an important fact-finding mission.

148
0:06:31.194,000 --> 0:06:33,000
She was a state senator at the time,

149
0:06:33.58,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and we met here, at the airport,

150
0:06:36.614,000 --> 0:06:37,000
before a trip to China.

151
0:06:38.132,000 --> 0:06:4,000
PM: Would you describe it as a whirlwind romance?

152
0:06:40.738,000 --> 0:06:42,000
GG: No, no, no.

153
0:06:42.786,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:45.486,000 --> 0:06:46,000
A good friend.

155
0:06:47.252,000 --> 0:06:49,000
MK: Yeah, we were friends for a long time.

156
0:06:49.83,000 --> 0:06:53,000
GG: Yes. (Laughter)

157
0:06:54.711,000 --> 0:06:59,000
MK: And then she invited me on, about a year or so later,

158
0:07:00.567,000 --> 0:07:02,000
she invited me on a date.

159
0:07:03.267,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Where'd we go, Gabby?

160
0:07:04.701,000 --> 0:07:05,000
GG: Death row.

161
0:07:05.899,000 --> 0:07:09,000
MK: Yes. Our first date was to death row

162
0:07:10.245,000 --> 0:07:13,000
at the Florence state prison in Arizona,

163
0:07:13.549,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which was just outside Gabby's state senate district.

164
0:07:18.959,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They were working on some legislation

165
0:07:20.856,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that had to do with crime and punishment

166
0:07:23.691,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and capital punishment in the state of Arizona.

167
0:07:25.625,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So she couldn't get anybody else to go with her,

168
0:07:28.449,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and I'm like, "Of course I want to go to death row."

169
0:07:32.248,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So that was our first date.

170
0:07:34.637,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We've been together ever since. GG: Yes.

171
0:07:37.367,000 --> 0:07:39,000
PM: Well, that might have contributed to the reason

172
0:07:39.457,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that Gabby decided to marry you.

173
0:07:42.009,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You were willing to go to death row, after all.

174
0:07:44.781,000 --> 0:07:45,000
MK: I guess.

175
0:07:45.865,000 --> 0:07:48,000
PM: Gabby, what did make you want to marry Mark?

176
0:07:49.545,000 --> 0:07:55,000
GG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends.

177
0:07:55.781,000 --> 0:07:58,000
MK: I thought we always

178
0:07:59.271,000 --> 0:08:01,000
had a very special relationship.

179
0:08:01.503,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We've gone through some tough times

180
0:08:03.395,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and it's only made it stronger. GG: Stronger.

181
0:08:07.421,000 --> 0:08:09,000
PM: After you got married, however,

182
0:08:09.967,000 --> 0:08:11,000
you continued very independent lives.

183
0:08:12.89,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Actually, you didn't even live together.

184
0:08:15.211,000 --> 0:08:16,000
MK: We had one of those commuter marriages.

185
0:08:17.045,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In our case, it was Washington, D.C., Houston,

186
0:08:20.1,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Tucson.

187
0:08:21.223,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Sometimes we'd go clockwise,

188
0:08:22.903,000 --> 0:08:23,000
sometimes counterclockwise,

189
0:08:24.457,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to all those different places,

190
0:08:26.072,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we didn't really live together

191
0:08:29.949,000 --> 0:08:31,000
until that Saturday morning.

192
0:08:32.249,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Within an hour of Gabby being shot,

193
0:08:34.547,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I was on an airplane to Tucson,

194
0:08:36.129,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and that was the moment

195
0:08:38.01,000 --> 0:08:4,000
where that had changed things.

196
0:08:40.753,000 --> 0:08:42,000
PM: And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress

197
0:08:43.245,000 --> 0:08:45,000
after being a state senator

198
0:08:45.517,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and served in Congress for six years.

199
0:08:48.541,000 --> 0:08:49,000
What did you like best

200
0:08:50.067,000 --> 0:08:52,000
about being in Congress?

201
0:08:52.439,000 --> 0:08:55,000
GG: Fast pace. Fast pace.

202
0:08:56.231,000 --> 0:08:58,000
PM: Well it was the way you did it. GG: Yes, yes. Fast pace.

203
0:08:58.639,000 --> 0:09:,000
PM: I'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way.

204
0:09:01.483,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

205
0:09:03.196,000 --> 0:09:05,000
MK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often

206
0:09:05.296,000 --> 0:09:07,000
at a colossally slow pace,

207
0:09:07.683,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but my wife, and I have to admit,

208
0:09:10.111,000 --> 0:09:11,000
a lot of other members of Congress that I know,

209
0:09:11.78,000 --> 0:09:12,000
work incredibly hard.

210
0:09:13.188,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I mean, Gabby would run around like a crazy person,

211
0:09:15.463,000 --> 0:09:16,000
never take a day off,

212
0:09:17.317,000 --> 0:09:19,000
maybe a half a day off a month,

213
0:09:19.443,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and whenever she was awake she was working,

214
0:09:21.923,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and she really, really thrived on that,

215
0:09:24.308,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and still does today. GG: Yes. Yes.

216
0:09:26.689,000 --> 0:09:28,000
PM: Installing solar panels on the top of her house,

217
0:09:29.067,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I have to say.

218
0:09:30.349,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So after the tragic incident, Mark,

219
0:09:33.927,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you decided to resign

220
0:09:35.656,000 --> 0:09:36,000
your position as an astronaut,

221
0:09:37.356,000 --> 0:09:38,000
even though you were supposed to take

222
0:09:38.91,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the next space mission.

223
0:09:40.651,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Everybody, including Gabby,

224
0:09:42.332,000 --> 0:09:43,000
talked you into going back,

225
0:09:43.912,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and you did end up taking.

226
0:09:45.785,000 --> 0:09:48,000
MK: Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured,

227
0:09:48.953,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I called my boss, the chief astronaut,

228
0:09:51.057,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Dr. Peggy Whitson, and I said,

229
0:09:53.009,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"Peggy, I know I'm launching in space

230
0:09:54.674,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in three months from now.

231
0:09:56.967,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Gabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson.

232
0:09:59.418,000 --> 0:10:,000
You've got to find a replacement for me."

233
0:10:01.233,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut,

234
0:10:02.953,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but I gave up my job and they found a replacement.

235
0:10:05.875,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Months later, maybe about two months later,

236
0:10:08.865,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I started about getting my job back,

237
0:10:11.075,000 --> 0:10:12,000
which is something,

238
0:10:12.74,000 --> 0:10:14,000
when you become this primary caregiver person,

239
0:10:15.153,000 --> 0:10:17,000
which some people in the audience here

240
0:10:17.545,000 --> 0:10:19,000
have certainly been in that position,

241
0:10:20.093,000 --> 0:10:21,000
it's a challenging role but at some point

242
0:10:21.87,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you've got to figure out when you're going to get your life back,

243
0:10:24.591,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and at the time, I couldn't ask Gabby

244
0:10:26.364,000 --> 0:10:29,000
if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again.

245
0:10:30.045,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But I knew she was— GG: Yes. Yes. Yes.

246
0:10:32.607,000 --> 0:10:34,000
MK: She was the biggest supporter of my career,

247
0:10:34.647,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and I knew it was the right thing to do.

248
0:10:36.843,000 --> 0:10:38,000
PM: And yet I'm trying to imagine, Mark,

249
0:10:38.848,000 --> 0:10:41,000
what that was like, going off onto a mission,

250
0:10:42.126,000 --> 0:10:45,000
one presumes safely, but it's never a guarantee,

251
0:10:45.623,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and knowing that Gabby is —

252
0:10:48.66,000 --> 0:10:51,000
MK: Well not only was she still in the hospital,

253
0:10:52.128,000 --> 0:10:54,000
on the third day of that flight,

254
0:10:54.488,000 --> 0:10:55,000
literally while I was

255
0:10:55.75,000 --> 0:10:56,000
rendezvousing with the space station,

256
0:10:57.323,000 --> 0:11:,000
and you've got two vehicles moving at 17,500 miles an hour,

257
0:11:00.874,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I'm actually flying it, looking out the window,

258
0:11:03.489,000 --> 0:11:04,000
a bunch of computers,

259
0:11:05.168,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Gabby was in brain surgery,

260
0:11:07.992,000 --> 0:11:09,000
literally at that time having the final surgery

261
0:11:10.676,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to replace the piece of skull

262
0:11:13.618,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that they took out on the day she was injured

263
0:11:15.367,000 --> 0:11:18,000
with a prosthetic, yeah, which is the whole side of her head.

264
0:11:19.06,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Now if any of you guys would ever come

265
0:11:21.04,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to our house in Tucson for the first time,

266
0:11:24.276,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Gabby would usually go up to the freezer

267
0:11:26.012,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and pull out the piece of Tupperware

268
0:11:28.08,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that has the real skull. (Laughter)

269
0:11:31.14,000 --> 0:11:34,000
GG: The real skull. MK: Which freaks people out, sometimes.

270
0:11:34.244,000 --> 0:11:37,000
PM: Is that for appetizer or dessert, Mark?

271
0:11:37.936,000 --> 0:11:41,000
MK: Well, it just gets the conversation going.

272
0:11:42.034,000 --> 0:11:44,000
PM: But there was a lot of conversation about

273
0:11:44.062,000 --> 0:11:47,000
something you did, Gabby, after Mark's flight.

274
0:11:47.14,000 --> 0:11:5,000
You had to make another step of courage too,

275
0:11:50.578,000 --> 0:11:53,000
because here was Congress deadlocked again,

276
0:11:54.38,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and you got out of the rehabilitation center,

277
0:12:00.302,000 --> 0:12:02,000
got yourself to Washington

278
0:12:02.773,000 --> 0:12:04,000
so that you could walk on the floor of the House --

279
0:12:05.67,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I can barely talk about this without getting emotional —

280
0:12:08.322,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and cast a vote which could have been

281
0:12:11.281,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the deciding vote.

282
0:12:13.116,000 --> 0:12:16,000
GG: The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling.

283
0:12:16.365,000 --> 0:12:18,000
MK: Yeah, we had that vote,

284
0:12:18.924,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I guess about five months after Gabby was injured,

285
0:12:20.874,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and she made this bold decision to go back.

286
0:12:23.372,000 --> 0:12:25,000
A very controversial vote,

287
0:12:25.525,000 --> 0:12:26,000
but she wanted to be there

288
0:12:27.034,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to have her voice heard one more time.

289
0:12:29.631,000 --> 0:12:3,000
PM: And after that, resigned

290
0:12:31.406,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and began what has been a very slow

291
0:12:35.36,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and challenging recovery.

292
0:12:37.848,000 --> 0:12:4,000
What's life like, day to day?

293
0:12:40.986,000 --> 0:12:42,000
MK: Well, that's Gabby's service dog Nelson.

294
0:12:43.973,000 --> 0:12:43,000
GG: Nelson.

295
0:12:44.936,000 --> 0:12:46,000
MK: New member of our family. GG: Yes, yes.

296
0:12:47.479,000 --> 0:12:49,000
MK: And we got him from a—

297
0:12:50.271,000 --> 0:12:51,000
GG: Prison. Murder. MK: We have a lot of connections

298
0:12:52.134,000 --> 0:12:54,000
with prisons, apparently. (Laughter)

299
0:12:54.786,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Nelson came from a prison,

300
0:12:56.175,000 --> 0:13:,000
raised by a murderer in Massachusetts.

301
0:13:00.719,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But she did a great job with this dog.

302
0:13:05.049,000 --> 0:13:07,000
He's a fabulous service dog.

303
0:13:07.436,000 --> 0:13:09,000
PM: So Gabby, what have you learned

304
0:13:10.379,000 --> 0:13:14,000
from your experiences the past few years?

305
0:13:14.513,000 --> 0:13:2,000
MK: Yeah, what have you learned? GG: Deeper. Deeper.

306
0:13:20.521,000 --> 0:13:21,000
PM: Your relationship is deeper.

307
0:13:22.383,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It has to be. You're together all the time now.

308
0:13:25.582,000 --> 0:13:27,000
MK: I imagine being grateful, too, right?

309
0:13:28.04,000 --> 0:13:29,000
GG: Grateful.

310
0:13:29.422,000 --> 0:13:31,000
PM: This is a picture of family and friends gathering,

311
0:13:31.489,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but I love these pictures because they show

312
0:13:35.822,000 --> 0:13:38,000
the Gabby and Mark relationship now.

313
0:13:39.357,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And you describe it, Gabby, over and over,

314
0:13:41.885,000 --> 0:13:46,000
as deeper on so many levels. Yes?

315
0:13:47.71,000 --> 0:13:48,000
MK: I think when something tragic happens

316
0:13:49.262,000 --> 0:13:51,000
in a family, it can pull people together.

317
0:13:51.916,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Here's us watching the space shuttle

318
0:13:54.08,000 --> 0:13:56,000
fly over Tucson,

319
0:13:56.13,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the Space Shuttle Endeavour,

320
0:13:57.276,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the one that I was the commander on its last flight,

321
0:13:59.847,000 --> 0:14:02,000
on its final flight on top of an airplane

322
0:14:03.353,000 --> 0:14:06,000
on a 747 on its way to L.A.,

323
0:14:06.473,000 --> 0:14:1,000
NASA was kind enough to have it fly over Tucson.

324
0:14:11.083,000 --> 0:14:14,000
PM: And of course, the two of you

325
0:14:14.559,000 --> 0:14:15,000
go through these challenges

326
0:14:16.141,000 --> 0:14:18,000
of a slow and difficult recovery,

327
0:14:18.533,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and yet, Gabby, how do you maintain

328
0:14:21.214,000 --> 0:14:24,000
your optimism and positive outlook?

329
0:14:24.941,000 --> 0:14:27,000
GG: I want to make the world a better place.

330
0:14:28.086,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Applause)

331
0:14:35.508,000 --> 0:14:36,000
PM: And you're doing that

332
0:14:37.366,000 --> 0:14:39,000
even though your recovery has to remain

333
0:14:39.56,000 --> 0:14:4,000
front and center for both of you.

334
0:14:41.462,000 --> 0:14:43,000
You are people who have done service

335
0:14:43.74,000 --> 0:14:46,000
to your country and you are continuing to do that

336
0:14:47.442,000 --> 0:14:5,000
with a new initiative, a new purpose.

337
0:14:50.461,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And Gabby, what's on the agenda now?

338
0:14:53.868,000 --> 0:14:56,000
GG: Americans for Responsible Solutions.

339
0:14:57.223,000 --> 0:15:01,000
MK: That's our political action committee,

340
0:15:01.362,000 --> 0:15:04,000
where we are trying to get members of Congress

341
0:15:04.759,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country,

342
0:15:08.11,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and to try to

343
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
pass some reasonable legislation.

344
0:15:11.21,000 --> 0:15:19,000
GG: Yes. Yes. (Applause)

345
0:15:19.213,000 --> 0:15:21,000
MK: You know, this affected us very personally,

346
0:15:21.69,000 --> 0:15:23,000
but it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved.

347
0:15:24.412,000 --> 0:15:27,000
It was really the 20 murdered first graders

348
0:15:28.24,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and kindergartners in Newtown, Connecticut,

349
0:15:31.178,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and the response that we saw afterwards

350
0:15:33.732,000 --> 0:15:36,000
where -- well, look what's happened so far.

351
0:15:37.157,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So far the national response has been

352
0:15:39.182,000 --> 0:15:4,000
pretty much to do nothing.

353
0:15:40.51,000 --> 0:15:41,000
We're trying to change that.

354
0:15:42.322,000 --> 0:15:43,000
PM: There have been 11 mass shootings

355
0:15:43.814,000 --> 0:15:44,000
since Newtown,

356
0:15:44.972,000 --> 0:15:47,000
a school a week in the first two months of last year.

357
0:15:48.186,000 --> 0:15:49,000
What are you doing that's different

358
0:15:49.91,000 --> 0:15:51,000
than other efforts to balance

359
0:15:52.14,000 --> 0:15:54,000
rights for gun ownership and responsibilities?

360
0:15:54.962,000 --> 0:15:56,000
MK: We're gun owners, we support gun rights.

361
0:15:57.304,000 --> 0:15:59,000
At the same time, we've got to do everything we can

362
0:15:59.546,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to keep guns out of the hands of criminals

363
0:16:02.083,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and the dangerously mentally ill.

364
0:16:03.976,000 --> 0:16:05,000
It's not too difficult to do that.

365
0:16:06.494,000 --> 0:16:07,000
This issue, like many others,

366
0:16:08.17,000 --> 0:16:11,000
has become very polarizing and political,

367
0:16:12.159,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and we're trying to bring some balance

368
0:16:14.46,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to the debate in Washington.

369
0:16:15.924,000 --> 0:16:17,000
PM: Thank you both for that effort.

370
0:16:17.962,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And not surprisingly for this woman of courage

371
0:16:21.196,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and of a sense of adventure,

372
0:16:22.992,000 --> 0:16:24,000
you just keep challenging yourself,

373
0:16:25.351,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and the sky seems to be the limit.

374
0:16:27.154,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I have to share this video

375
0:16:28.898,000 --> 0:16:3,000
of your most recent adventure.

376
0:16:31.446,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Take a look at Gabby.

377
0:16:34.38,000 --> 0:16:37,000
MK: This is a couple months ago.

378
0:16:41.879,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Video) MK: You okay? You did great. GG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you.

379
0:16:44.375,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Good stuff. Gorgeous. Oh, thank you.

380
0:16:50.563,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Mountains. Gorgeous mountains.

381
0:16:59.477,000 --> 0:17:,000
(Applause)

382
0:17:01.071,000 --> 0:17:03,000
MK: Let me just say

383
0:17:03.913,000 --> 0:17:05,000
one of the guys that Gabby jumped with

384
0:17:05.948,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that day was a Navy SEAL

385
0:17:08.018,000 --> 0:17:1,000
who she met in Afghanistan

386
0:17:10.286,000 --> 0:17:11,000
who was injured in combat,

387
0:17:11.835,000 --> 0:17:12,000
had a really rough time.

388
0:17:13.327,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Gabby visited him

389
0:17:14.861,000 --> 0:17:15,000
when he was at Bethesda

390
0:17:16.539,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and went through a really tough period.

391
0:17:18.94,000 --> 0:17:19,000
He started doing better.

392
0:17:20.447,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Months later, Gabby was shot in the head,

393
0:17:22.697,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and then he supported her

394
0:17:23.971,000 --> 0:17:25,000
while she was in the hospital in Houston.

395
0:17:25.973,000 --> 0:17:27,000
So they have a very, very nice connection.

396
0:17:28.178,000 --> 0:17:29,000
GG: Yes.

397
0:17:29.42,000 --> 0:17:3,000
PM: What a wonderful moment.

398
0:17:30.576,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Because this is the TED stage,

399
0:17:32.533,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Gabby, I know you worked very hard

400
0:17:35.956,000 --> 0:17:38,000
to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave

401
0:17:39.27,000 --> 0:17:4,000
with this audience.

402
0:17:40.84,000 --> 0:17:43,000
GG: Thank you.

403
0:17:46.732,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Hello, everyone.

404
0:17:48.95,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Thank you for inviting us here today.

405
0:17:53.25,000 --> 0:17:55,000
It's been a long, hard haul,

406
0:17:55.38,000 --> 0:17:58,000
but I'm getting better.

407
0:17:58.521,000 --> 0:17:59,000
I'm working hard,

408
0:18:00.43,000 --> 0:18:03,000
lots of therapy -- speech therapy,

409
0:18:03.901,000 --> 0:18:06,000
physical therapy, and yoga too.

410
0:18:07.166,000 --> 0:18:09,000
But my spirit is strong as ever.

411
0:18:09.68,000 --> 0:18:13,000
I'm still fighting to make the world a better place,

412
0:18:13.88,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and you can too.

413
0:18:16.832,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Get involved with your community.

414
0:18:20.319,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Be a leader. Set an example.

415
0:18:23.941,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Be passionate. Be courageous.

416
0:18:26.998,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Be your best. Thank you very much.

417
0:18:30.62,000 --> 0:18:32,000
(Applause)

418
0:18:33.435,000 --> 0:18:37,000
MK: Thank you. GG: Thank you.

419
0:18:37.455,000 --> 0:18:39,000
(Applause)

420
0:18:39.806,000 --> 0:18:42,000
MK: Thank you everybody. GG: Bye bye. (Applause)

Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:13.643,000 --> 0:00:14,000
All right, so let's take

3
0:00:14.782,000 --> 0:00:16,000
four subjects that obviously go together:

4
0:00:17.122,000 --> 0:00:21,000
big data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks.

5
0:00:21.851,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Right?

6
0:00:22.681,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, the issue about tattoos is that,

7
0:00:26.1,000 --> 0:00:3,000
without a word, tattoos really do shout.

8
0:00:30.305,000 --> 0:00:34,000
[Beautiful]

9
0:00:34.365,000 --> 0:00:35,000
[Intriguing]

10
0:00:36.263,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So you don't have to say a lot.

11
0:00:39.578,000 --> 0:00:42,000
[Allegiance]

12
0:00:43.246,000 --> 0:00:47,000
[Very intimate]

13
0:00:47.648,000 --> 0:00:49,000
[Serious mistakes]

14
0:00:50.273,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:54.437,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And tattoos tell you a lot of stories.

16
0:00:58.218,000 --> 0:00:59,000
If I can ask an indiscreet question,

17
0:00:59.963,000 --> 0:01:02,000
how many of you have tattoos?

18
0:01:03.439,000 --> 0:01:04,000
A few, but not most.

19
0:01:04.946,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn,

20
0:01:07.733,000 --> 0:01:09,000
cell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor,

21
0:01:10.631,000 --> 0:01:12,000
all these things you deal with every day

22
0:01:13.391,000 --> 0:01:15,000
turn out to be electronic tattoos?

23
0:01:15.751,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And what if they provide as much information

24
0:01:17.373,000 --> 0:01:21,000
about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would?

25
0:01:22.35,000 --> 0:01:24,000
What's ended up happening over the past few decades

26
0:01:24.536,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state

27
0:01:27.642,000 --> 0:01:29,000
or as a great celebrity

28
0:01:30.321,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is now being applied to you every day by all these people

29
0:01:33.042,000 --> 0:01:35,000
who are Tweeting, blogging, following you,

30
0:01:36.029,000 --> 0:01:4,000
watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself.

31
0:01:40.349,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And electronic tattoos also shout.

32
0:01:44.763,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And as you're thinking of the consequences of that,

33
0:01:47.107,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things,

34
0:01:50.043,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because it's not just the electronic tattoos,

35
0:01:52.822,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it's facial recognition that's getting really good.

36
0:01:56.894,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names,

37
0:02:00.692,000 --> 0:02:04,000
although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter)

38
0:02:04.749,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this,

39
0:02:07.758,000 --> 0:02:11,000
take a picture, say, of this guy right here,

40
0:02:11.766,000 --> 0:02:14,000
get the name, and download all the records

41
0:02:15.43,000 --> 0:02:18,000
before you utter a word or speak to somebody,

42
0:02:19.049,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because everybody turns out to be

43
0:02:20.425,000 --> 0:02:23,000
absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.

44
0:02:24.026,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And so there's companies like face.com that now have

45
0:02:26.518,000 --> 0:02:29,000
about 18 billion faces online.

46
0:02:30.302,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Here's what happened to this company.

47
0:02:31.891,000 --> 0:02:33,000
[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...]

48
0:02:34.554,000 --> 0:02:36,000
There are other companies that will place a camera

49
0:02:37.207,000 --> 0:02:39,000
like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook —

50
0:02:39.63,000 --> 0:02:41,000
they take your picture, they tie it to the social media,

51
0:02:41.942,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they figure out you really like to wear black dresses,

52
0:02:44.069,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so maybe the person in the store comes up and says,

53
0:02:46.505,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"Hey, we've got five black dresses

54
0:02:48.805,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that would just look great on you."

55
0:02:52.038,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So what if Andy was wrong?

56
0:02:54.158,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Here's Andy's theory.

57
0:02:55.428,000 --> 0:02:56,000
[In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.]

58
0:02:57.272,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What if we flip this?

59
0:02:58.378,000 --> 0:03:02,000
What if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes? (Laughter)

60
0:03:03.059,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Well, then, because of electronic tattoos,

61
0:03:06.075,000 --> 0:03:1,000
maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality,

62
0:03:10.736,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because these tattoos will live

63
0:03:12.314,000 --> 0:03:14,000
far longer than our bodies will.

64
0:03:15.091,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And if that's true, then what we want to do

65
0:03:16.982,000 --> 0:03:19,000
is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks

66
0:03:20.391,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and one lesson from a Latin American.

67
0:03:23.7,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Why the Greeks?

68
0:03:25.523,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Well, the Greeks thought about what happens

69
0:03:27.38,000 --> 0:03:31,000
when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time.

70
0:03:32.338,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So lesson number one: Sisyphus.

71
0:03:35.018,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Remember? He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time

72
0:03:38.044,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to roll this rock up, it would roll back down,

73
0:03:40.427,000 --> 0:03:41,000
roll back up, roll back down.

74
0:03:42.4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's a little like your reputation.

75
0:03:44.803,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Once you get that electronic tattoo,

76
0:03:46.238,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time,

77
0:03:49.166,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so as you go through this stuff,

78
0:03:51.474,000 --> 0:03:54,000
just be careful what you post.

79
0:03:54.559,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Myth number two: Orpheus, wonderful guy,

80
0:03:57.938,000 --> 0:04:,000
charming to be around, great partier, great singer,

81
0:04:01.666,000 --> 0:04:04,000
loses his beloved, charms his way into the underworld,

82
0:04:04.883,000 --> 0:04:06,000
only person to charm his way into the underworld,

83
0:04:07.49,000 --> 0:04:09,000
charms the gods of the underworld,

84
0:04:09.835,000 --> 0:04:11,000
they release his beauty on the condition

85
0:04:12.73,000 --> 0:04:15,000
he never look at her until they're out.

86
0:04:15.842,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So he's walking out and walking out and walking out

87
0:04:17.681,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever.

88
0:04:21.939,000 --> 0:04:23,000
With all this data out here, it might be a good idea

89
0:04:24.773,000 --> 0:04:29,000
not to look too far into the past of those you love.

90
0:04:30.521,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Lesson number three: Atalanta.

91
0:04:33.362,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody.

92
0:04:37.811,000 --> 0:04:39,000
If you won, she would marry you.

93
0:04:40.221,000 --> 0:04:42,000
If you lost, you died.

94
0:04:43.146,000 --> 0:04:45,000
How did Hippomenes beat her?

95
0:04:45.49,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples,

96
0:04:47.416,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

97
0:04:50.034,000 --> 0:04:52,000
She'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

98
0:04:52.038,000 --> 0:04:56,000
She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race.

99
0:04:56.284,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples

100
0:04:59.514,000 --> 0:05:01,000
come and reach you and you want to post about them

101
0:05:02.086,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or tweet about them or send a late-night message.

102
0:05:05.922,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And then, of course, there's Narcissus.

103
0:05:09.17,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus.

104
0:05:12.717,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:15.013,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But as you're thinking about Narcissus,

106
0:05:17.581,000 --> 0:05:21,000
just don't fall in love with your own reflection.

107
0:05:21.661,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Last lesson, from a Latin American:

108
0:05:23.452,000 --> 0:05:25,000
This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges.

109
0:05:26.213,000 --> 0:05:27,000
When he was threatened by the thugs

110
0:05:27.402,000 --> 0:05:29,000
of the Argentine military junta,

111
0:05:30.035,000 --> 0:05:32,000
he came back and said, "Oh, come on,

112
0:05:32.288,000 --> 0:05:35,000
how else can you threaten, other than with death?"

113
0:05:35.733,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The interesting thing, the original thing,

114
0:05:38.853,000 --> 0:05:41,000
would be to threaten somebody with immortality.

115
0:05:42.045,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And that, of course, is what we are all

116
0:05:43.505,000 --> 0:05:47,000
now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos.

117
0:05:47.681,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Thank you.

118
0:05:48.766,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

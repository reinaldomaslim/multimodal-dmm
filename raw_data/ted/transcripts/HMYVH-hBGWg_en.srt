1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Information technology grows in an exponential manner.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's not linear. And our intuition is linear.

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
we made linear predictions where that animal would be,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But the pace of exponential growth

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is really what describes information technologies.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And it's not just computation.

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
If I take 30 steps linearly -- one, two, three, four, five --

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I get to 30.

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
If I take 30 steps exponentially -- two, four, eight, 16 --

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I get to a billion.

14
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It makes a huge difference.

15
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And that really describes information technology.

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
When I was a student at MIT,

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we all shared one computer that took up a whole building.

18
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper,

19
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a million times smaller,

20
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a thousand times more powerful.

21
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
That's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar

22
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that we've actually experienced since I was a student.

23
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And we're going to do it again in the next 25 years.

24
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Information technology progresses

25
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
through a series of S-curves

26
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
where each one is a different paradigm.

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So people say, "What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end?"

28
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Which will happen around 2020.

29
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We'll then go to the next paradigm.

30
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to bring exponential growth to computing.

32
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The exponential growth of computing started

33
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
decades before Gordon Moore was even born.

34
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And it doesn't just apply to computation.

35
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's really any technology where we can measure

36
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the underlying information properties.

37
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Here we have 49 famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph.

38
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase,

39
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because this represents trillions-fold increase

40
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
since the 1890 census.

41
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes,

42
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall;

43
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum.

44
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes,

45
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing.

46
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We went to the fourth paradigm, transistors,

47
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and finally integrated circuits.

48
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm;

49
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits.

50
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But what's even more amazing, really, than this

51
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
fantastic scale of progress,

52
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is that -- look at how predictable this is.

53
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I mean this went through thick and thin,

54
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
through war and peace, through boom times and recessions.

55
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression.

56
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now.

57
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
At least the exponential growth of information technology capability

58
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
will continue unabated.

59
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And I just updated these graphs.

60
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Because I had them through 2002 in my book, "The Singularity is Near."

61
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So we updated them,

62
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so I could present it here, to 2007.

63
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous?

64
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression."

65
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I was a little nervous

66
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because maybe the data wouldn't be right,

67
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but I've done this now for 30 years,

68
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and it has stayed on this exponential progression.

69
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968.

70
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You can buy half a billion today,

71
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and they are actually better, because they are faster.

72
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But look at how predictable this is.

73
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data.

74
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years.

75
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And the cost of a transistor cycle,

76
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
which is a measure of the price performance of electronics,

77
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
comes down about every year.

78
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
That's a 50 percent deflation rate.

79
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And it's also true of other examples,

80
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
like DNA data or brain data.

81
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But we more than make up for that.

82
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We actually ship more than twice as much

83
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of every form of information technology.

84
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We've had 18 percent growth in constant dollars

85
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in every form of information technology for the last half-century,

86
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year.

87
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
This is a completely different example.

88
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This is not Moore's Law.

89
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The amount of DNA data

90
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we've sequenced has doubled every year.

91
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The cost has come down by half every year.

92
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And this has been a smooth progression

93
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
since the beginning of the genome project.

94
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And halfway through the project, skeptics said,

95
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
"Well, this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project

96
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and you've finished one percent of the project."

97
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But that was really right on schedule.

98
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Because if you double one percent seven more times,

99
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which is exactly what happened,

100
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time.

101
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Communication technologies:

102
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
50 different ways to measure this,

103
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet.

104
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But this has progressed at an exponential pace.

105
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This is deeply democratizing.

106
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I wrote, over 20 years ago in "The Age of Intelligent Machines,"

107
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
when the Soviet Union was going strong, that it would be swept away

108
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
by this growth of decentralized communication.

109
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century

110
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to do things like simulate regions of the human brain.

111
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But where will we get the software?

112
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Some critics say, "Oh, well software is stuck in the mud."

113
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But we are learning more and more about the human brain.

114
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.

115
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year.

116
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And we're showing that we can actually turn this data

117
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
into working models and simulations of brain regions.

118
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
There is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled,

119
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
simulated and tested:

120
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the auditory cortex, regions of the visual cortex;

121
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
cerebellum, where we do our skill formation;

122
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
slices of the cerebral cortex, where we do our rational thinking.

123
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And all of this has fueled

124
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
an increase, very smooth and predictable, of productivity.

125
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We've gone from 30 dollars to 130 dollars

126
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor,

127
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
fueled by this information technology.

128
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And we're all concerned about energy and the environment.

129
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Well this is a logarithmic graph.

130
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This represents a smooth doubling,

131
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
every two years, of the amount of solar energy we're creating,

132
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology,

133
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
a form of information technology, to solar panels.

134
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And we're only eight doublings away

135
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs.

136
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need.

137
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us.

138
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
When I was a student it was across campus, now it's in our pockets.

139
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
What used to take up a building now fits in our pockets.

140
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
What now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years.

141
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And we will begin to actually deeply influence

142
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
our health and our intelligence,

143
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as we get closer and closer to this technology.

144
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Based on that we are announcing, here at TED,

145
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in true TED tradition, Singularity University.

146
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's a new university

147
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that's founded by Peter Diamandis, who is here in the audience,

148
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and myself.

149
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's backed by NASA and Google,

150
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and other leaders in the high-tech and science community.

151
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And our goal was to assemble the leaders,

152
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
both teachers and students,

153
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in these exponentially growing information technologies,

154
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and their application.

155
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But Larry Page made an impassioned speech

156
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
at our organizing meeting,

157
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
saying we should devote this study

158
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity.

159
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And if we did that, then Google would back this.

160
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And so that's what we've done.

161
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The last third of the nine-week intensive summer session

162
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
will be devoted to a group project to address

163
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
some major challenge of humanity.

164
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Like for example, applying the Internet,

165
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
which is now ubiquitous, in the rural areas of China or in Africa,

166
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to bringing health information

167
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to developing areas of the world.

168
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And these projects will continue past these sessions,

169
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
using collaborative interactive communication.

170
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
All the intellectual property that is created and taught

171
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
will be online and available,

172
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and developed online in a collaborative fashion.

173
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Here is our founding meeting.

174
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But this is being announced today.

175
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley,

176
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
at the NASA Ames research center.

177
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
There are different programs for graduate students,

178
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
for executives at different companies.

179
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The first six tracks here -- artificial intelligence,

180
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
advanced computing technologies, biotechnology, nanotechnology --

181
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
are the different core areas of information technology.

182
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Then we are going to apply them to the other areas,

183
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
like energy, ecology,

184
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
policy law and ethics, entrepreneurship,

185
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so that people can bring these new technologies to the world.

186
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten

187
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
from both the intellectual leaders, the high-tech leaders,

188
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
particularly Google and NASA.

189
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is an exciting new venture.

190
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much.

191
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Applause)

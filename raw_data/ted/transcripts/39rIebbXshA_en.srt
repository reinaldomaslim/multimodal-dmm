1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Jó napot, pacák" Which, as somebody here must surely know,

2
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
means "What's up, guys?" in Magyar,

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that peculiar non-Indo-European language spoken by Hungarians

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for which, given the fact that cognitive diversity is

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet,

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago.

7
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But there it is: "Jó napot, pacák"

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I said somebody here must surely know, because

9
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
despite the fact that there aren't that many Hungarians to begin with,

10
0:00:49.664,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and the further fact that, so far as I know, there's not a drop

11
0:00:52.664,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of Hungarian blood in my veins, at every critical juncture of my life

12
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
there has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me.

13
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I even have dreams that take place in landscapes

14
0:01:02.64,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I recognize as the landscapes of Hungarian films,

15
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
especially the early movies of Miklos Jancso.

16
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So, how do I explain this mysterious affinity?

17
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Maybe it's because my native state of South Carolina,

18
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which is not much smaller than present-day Hungary,

19
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
once imagined a future for itself as an independent country.

20
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And as a consequence of that presumption,

21
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army,

22
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
an experience that has befallen many a Hungarian town and village

23
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
throughout its long and troubled history.

24
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Or maybe it's because when I was a teenager back in the '50s,

25
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
my uncle Henry -- having denounced the Ku Klux Klan

26
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard,

27
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
living under death threat -- took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety

28
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and went back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone.

29
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That was a very Hungarian thing to do,

30
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as anyone will attest who remembers 1956.

31
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And of course, from time to time Hungarians

32
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
have invented their own equivalent of the Klan.

33
0:02:06.593,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Well, it seems to me that this Hungarian presence in my life

34
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is difficult to account for, but ultimately I ascribe it to an admiration

35
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
for people with a complex moral awareness,

36
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado.

37
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's not a typical mindset for most Americans,

38
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but it is perforce typical of virtually all Hungarians.

39
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So, "Jó napot, pacák!"

40
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I went back to South Carolina after some 15 years amid the alien corn

41
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
at the tail end of the 1960s,

42
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with the reckless condescension of that era

43
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
thinking I would save my people.

44
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving.

45
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before

46
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina,

47
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
a Methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called Wofford College.

48
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I knew nothing about Wofford

49
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and even less about Methodism,

50
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but I was reassured on the first day that I taught at Wofford College

51
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to find, among the auditors in my classroom,

52
0:03:14.45,000 --> 0:03:2,000
a 90-year-old Hungarian, surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged European women

53
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
who seemed to function as an entourage of Rhinemaidens.

54
0:03:23.974,000 --> 0:03:25,000
His name was Sandor Teszler.

55
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
He was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead

56
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and whose grandchildren lived far away.

57
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In appearance, he resembled Mahatma Gandhi,

58
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
minus the loincloth, plus orthopedic boots.

59
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
He had been born in 1903 in the provinces

60
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire,

61
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in what later would become Yugoslavia.

62
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
He was ostracized as a child, not because he was a Jew --

63
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
his parents weren't very religious anyhow --

64
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but because he had been born with two club feet,

65
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
a condition which, in those days, required institutionalization

66
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and 11.

67
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
He went to the commercial business high school as a young man

68
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in Budapest, and there he was as smart as he was modest

69
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and he enjoyed a considerable success. And after graduation

70
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
when he went into textile engineering, the success continued.

71
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
He built one plant after another.

72
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
He married and had two sons. He had friends in high places who

73
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
assured him that he was of great value to the economy.

74
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Once, as he had left instructions to have done,

75
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants.

76
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks --

77
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
it was a hosiery mill, and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock

78
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and was shoveling in mountains of socks.

79
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Mr. Teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said,

80
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"But why do you steal from me? If you need money you have only to ask."

81
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The night watchman, seeing how things were going and waxing indignant,

82
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
said, "Well, we're going to call the police, aren't we?"

83
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But Mr. Teszler answered, "No, that will not be necessary.

84
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
He will not steal from us again."

85
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Well, maybe he was too trusting, because he stayed where he was

86
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria

87
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest.

88
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets

89
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family.

90
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And then one day, it happened: he and his family were arrested

91
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and they were taken to a death house on the Danube.

92
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In those early days of the Final Solution, it was handcrafted brutality;

93
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river.

94
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But none who entered that death house had ever come out alive.

95
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film --

96
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the Gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief

97
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
who had stolen socks from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill.

98
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It was a brutal beating. And midway through that brutality,

99
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
one of Mr. Teszler's sons, Andrew, looked up and said,

100
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"Is it time to take the capsule now, Papa?"

101
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And the Gauleiter, who afterwards vanishes from this story,

102
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
leaned down and whispered into Mr. Teszler's ear,

103
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"No, do not take the capsule. Help is on the way."

104
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And then resumed the beating.

105
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But help was on the way, and shortly afterwards

106
0:06:19.593,000 --> 0:06:21,000
a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy.

107
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They were spirited to safety. They were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens

108
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers

109
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for the duration of the War, surviving burnings and bombings

110
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and, at the end of the War, arrest by the Soviets.

111
0:06:35.735,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Probably, Mr. Teszler had gotten some money into Swiss bank accounts

112
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because he managed to take his family first to Great Britain,

113
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
then to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South.

114
0:06:47.593,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Which, as chance would have it, was Spartanburg, South Carolina,

115
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the location of Wofford College.

116
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And there, Mr. Teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success,

117
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
especially after he invented the process

118
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit.

119
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And then in the late 1950s, in the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Education,

120
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
when the Klan was resurgent all over the South,

121
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Mr. Teszler said, "I have heard this talk before."

122
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And he called his top assistant to him and asked,

123
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
"Where would you say, in this region, racism is most virulent?"

124
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"Well, I don't rightly know, Mr. Teszler. I reckon that would be Kings Mountain."

125
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain

126
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and announce we are going to build a major plant there."

127
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The man did as he was told, and shortly afterwards,

128
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Mr. Teszler received a visit from the white mayor of Kings Mountain.

129
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now, you should know that at that time,

130
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated.

131
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The white mayor visited Mr. Teszler and said,

132
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"Mr. Teszler, I trust youre going to be hiring a lot of white workers."

133
0:07:57.783,000 --> 0:08:,000
Mr. Teszler told him, "You bring me the best workers that you can find,

134
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and if they are good enough, I will hire them."

135
0:08:03.593,000 --> 0:08:07,000
He also received a visit from the leader of the black community,

136
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
a minister, who said, "Mr. Teszler, I sure hope you're going to

137
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
hire some black workers for this new plant of yours."

138
0:08:12.878,000 --> 0:08:15,000
He got the same answer: "You bring the best workers that you can find,

139
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and if they are good enough, I will hire them."

140
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
As it happens, the black minister did his job better than the white mayor,

141
0:08:22.807,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but that's neither here or there.

142
0:08:23.807,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Mr. Teszler hired 16 men: eight white, eight black.

143
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They were to be his seed group, his future foremen.

144
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He had installed the heavy equipment for his new process

145
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain,

146
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and for two months these 16 men would live and work together,

147
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
mastering the new process.

148
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
He gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility

149
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and he asked if there were any questions.

150
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
There was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet,

151
0:08:48.783,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said,

152
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
"Well, yeah. Weve looked at this place and there's only one place to sleep,

153
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
there's only one place to eat, there's only one bathroom,

154
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
there's only one water fountain. Is this plant going to be integrated or what?"

155
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Mr. Teszler said, "You are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region

156
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and this is how we do business. Do you have any other questions?"

157
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"No, I reckon I don't."

158
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And two months later when the main plant opened

159
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and hundreds of new workers, white and black,

160
0:09:21.473,000 --> 0:09:23,000
poured in to see the facility for the first time,

161
0:09:23.831,000 --> 0:09:28,000
they were met by the 16 foremen, white and black, standing shoulder to shoulder.

162
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
They toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions, and

163
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
inevitably the same question arose:

164
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
"Is this plant integrated or what?"

165
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And one of the white foremen stepped forward and said,

166
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
"You are being paid twice the wages of any other workers

167
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in this industry in this region and this is how we do business.

168
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Do you have any other questions?"

169
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And there were none. In one fell swoop,

170
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Mr. Teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the South.

171
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
It was an achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi,

172
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint.

173
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
In his eighties, Mr. Teszler, having retired from the textile industry,

174
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
adopted Wofford College,

175
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
auditing courses every semester,

176
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved,

177
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
becoming affectionately known as "Opi" -- which is Magyar for grandfather --

178
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
by all and sundry. Before I got there, the library of the college

179
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
had been named for Mr. Teszler, and after I arrived in 1993,

180
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the faculty decided to honor itself by naming Mr. Teszler Professor of the College --

181
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
partly because at that point he had already taken

182
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
all of the courses in the catalog, but mainly because

183
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us.

184
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
To me, it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit

185
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
of this little Methodist college in upstate South Carolina

186
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
was a Holocaust survivor from Central Europe.

187
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Wise he was, indeed, but he also had a wonderful sense of humor.

188
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And once for an interdisciplinary class,

189
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I was screening the opening segment of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal."

190
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
As the medieval knight Antonius Block returns from the wild goose chase

191
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of the Crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of Sweden,

192
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
only to find the specter of death waiting for him,

193
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Mr. Teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students. And

194
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight

195
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in a ghastly embrace, I heard Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice:

196
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"Uh oh," he said, "This doesn't look so good." (Laughter)

197
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But it was music that was his greatest passion, especially opera.

198
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And on the first occasion that I visited his house, he gave me

199
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to.

200
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And I delighted him by rejecting "Cavalleria Rusticana"

201
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in favor of Bela Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle."

202
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
I love Bartok's music, as did Mr. Teszler,

203
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and he had virtually every recording of Bartok's music ever issued.

204
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And it was at his house that I heard for the first time

205
0:12:06.974,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Bartok's Third Piano Concerto and learned from

206
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Mr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville, North Carolina

207
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in the last year of the composer's life.

208
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
He was dying of leukemia and he knew it,

209
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and he dedicated this concerto to his wife,

210
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Dita, who was herself a concert pianist.

211
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And into the slow, second movement, marked "adagio religioso,"

212
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard

213
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring;

214
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part.

215
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And clearly this composition is his final statement to her --

216
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
it was first performed after his death --

217
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and through her to the world.

218
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And just as clearly, it is saying, "It's okay. It was all so beautiful.

219
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Whenever you hear this, I will be there."

220
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It was only after Mr. Teszler's death that I learned

221
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale, New York

222
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
was paid for by Sandor Teszler. "Jó napot, Bela!"

223
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Not long before Mr. Teszlers own death at the age of 97,

224
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
he heard me hold forth on human iniquity.

225
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I delivered a lecture in which I described history

226
0:13:28.735,000 --> 0:13:31,000
as, on the whole, a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality,

227
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said,

228
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
"You know, Doctor, human beings are fundamentally good."

229
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And I made a vow to myself, then and there,

230
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise

231
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
had reached that conclusion,

232
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow.

233
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And now he's dead, so I'm stuck with my vow.

234
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
"Jó napot, Sandor!"

235
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I thought my skein of Hungarian mentors had come to an end,

236
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but almost immediately I met Francis Robicsek, a Hungarian doctor --

237
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina, then in his late seventies --

238
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
who had been a pioneer in open-heart surgery,

239
0:14:20.497,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and, tinkering away in his garage behind his house,

240
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures.

241
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
He's also a prodigious art collector, beginning as an intern in Budapest

242
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
by collecting 16th- and 17th-century Dutch art and Hungarian painting,

243
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and when he came to this country moving on to Spanish colonial art,

244
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics.

245
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
He's the author of seven books, six of them on Mayan ceramics.

246
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It was he who broke the Mayan codex, enabling scholars to relate

247
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
the pictographs on Mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script.

248
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
On the occasion of my first visit, we toured his house

249
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and we saw hundreds of works of museum quality,

250
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and then we paused in front of a closed door and Dr. Robicsek said,

251
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
with obvious pride, "Now for the piece De resistance."

252
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And he opened the door and we walked into a

253
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
windowless 20-by-20-foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling, and

254
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
crammed on every shelf his collection of Mayan ceramics.

255
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Now, I know absolutely nothing about Mayan ceramics,

256
0:15:24.807,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but I wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so I said,

257
0:15:27.807,000 --> 0:15:3,000
"But Dr. Robicsek, this is absolutely dazzling."

258
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
"Yes," he said. "That is what the Louvre said.

259
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece,

260
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but it was not a good one." (Laughter)

261
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Well, it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek

262
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to lecture at Wofford College on -- what else?

263
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
-- Leonardo da Vinci. And further, I should invite him to meet

264
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
my oldest trustee, who had majored in French history at Yale

265
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
some 70-odd years before and, at 89, still ruled the world's

266
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand.

267
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
His name is Roger Milliken. And Mr. Milliken agreed,

268
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and Dr. Robicsek agreed. And Dr. Robicsek visited

269
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success.

270
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And afterwards we convened at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek

271
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
on one hand, Mr. Milliken on the other.

272
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And it was only at that moment, as we were sitting down to dinner,

273
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that I recognized the enormity of the risk I had created,

274
0:16:27.069,000 --> 0:16:3,000
because to bring these two titans, these two masters of the universe

275
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
together -- it was like introducing Mothra to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo.

276
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
If they didn't like each other, we could all get trampled to death.

277
0:16:38.473,000 --> 0:16:4,000
But they did, they did like each other.

278
0:16:40.473,000 --> 0:16:42,000
They got along famously until the very end of the meal,

279
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and then they got into a furious argument.

280
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And what they were arguing about was this:

281
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
whether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first. (Laughter)

282
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Mr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed.

283
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
I was still trying to take in the notion that these titans,

284
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
these masters of the universe, in their spare time watch Harry Potter movies,

285
0:17:05.021,000 --> 0:17:08,000
when Mr. Milliken thought he would win the argument by saying,

286
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
"You just think it's so good because you didn't read the book."

287
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair, but quickly gathered his wits,

288
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
leaned forward and said, "Well, that is true, but I'll bet you went

289
0:17:18.545,000 --> 0:17:22,000
to the movie with a grandchild." "Well, yes, I did," conceded Mr. Milliken.

290
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
"Aha!" said Dr. Robicsek. "I went to the movie all by myself." (Laughter) (Applause)

291
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And I realized, in this moment of revelation,

292
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that what these two men were revealing was the secret

293
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
of their extraordinary success, each in his own right.

294
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity,

295
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
that irrepressible desire to know, no matter what the subject,

296
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
no matter what the cost,

297
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
even at a time when the keepers of the Doomsday Clock

298
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
are willing to bet even money that the human race won't be around

299
0:17:56.45,000 --> 0:18:,000
to imagine anything in the year 2100, a scant 93 years from now.

300
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
"Live each day as if it is your last," said Mahatma Gandhi.

301
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
"Learn as if you'll live forever."

302
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
This is what I'm passionate about. It is precisely this.

303
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
It is this inextinguishable, undaunted appetite for learning and experience,

304
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
no matter how risible, no matter how esoteric,

305
0:18:23.545,000 --> 0:18:25,000
no matter how seditious it might seem.

306
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
This defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians --

307
0:18:32.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Robicsek, Teszler and Bartok -- as it does my own.

308
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
As it does, I suspect, that of everybody here.

309
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
To which I need only add, "Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves."

310
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
This is our task; we know it will be hard.

311
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:58,000
"Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves. Jó napot, pacák!" (Applause)

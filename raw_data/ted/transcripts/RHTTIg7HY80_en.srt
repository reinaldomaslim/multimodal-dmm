1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And that's not a joke, we really do.

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp

5
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a few years ago because they make sound.

6
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp

7
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that's found off the coast of California.

8
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,

9
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.

10
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,

11
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.

12
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises,

13
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,

14
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,

15
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.

16
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,

17
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.

18
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties:

19
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
there are spearers and smashers.

20
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.

21
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.

22
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,

23
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species --

24
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
recorded at 1,000 frames a second,

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
played back at 15 frames per second.

26
0:01:54,000 --> 0:02:,000
And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,

27
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
exploding upward to actually just catch

28
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.

29
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod,

30
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and these guys open up snails for a living.

31
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.

32
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So, I'll play it one more time.

34
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.

35
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.

36
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,

37
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or it can smash with the heel.

38
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.

39
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so the first question that came to mind was,

40
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
well, how fast does this limb move?

41
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.

42
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And I immediately came upon a problem.

43
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Every single high-speed video system in the biology department

44
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:59,000
at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.

45
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We simply couldn't capture it on video.

46
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.

47
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department,

48
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:12,000
looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.

49
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And so we struck up a deal.

50
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system

51
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that could capture these movements,

52
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
you guys can film us collecting the data."

53
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter)

54
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology --

55
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it just came out about a year ago --

56
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.

57
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And low light is a critical issue with filming animals,

58
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter)

59
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here,

60
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.

61
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.

62
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And the snail's wired to a stick,

63
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:55,000
so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah.

64
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.

66
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

67
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second,

68
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.

69
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast

70
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.

71
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards --

72
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
just a spectacular movement.

73
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,

74
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and we measured how fast the limb was moving

75
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to get back to that original question.

76
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And we were in for our first surprise.

77
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving

78
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second

79
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
all the way up to 23 meters per second.

80
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And for those of you who prefer miles per hour,

81
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.

82
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point

83
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
on the extreme animal movement spectrum.

84
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike

85
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of any animal system. So our first surprise.

86
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Applause)

87
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So that was really cool and very unexpected.

88
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?

89
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And actually, this work was done in the 1960s

90
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.

91
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use

92
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
what's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism."

93
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And what this basically consists of is a large muscle

94
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that takes a good long time to contract,

95
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and a latch that prevents anything from moving.

96
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.

97
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up --

98
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.

99
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And that's basically what's called a "power amplification system."

100
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract,

101
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and a very short time for the limb to fly out.

102
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.

103
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.

104
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.

105
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And if any of you ever have a chance,

106
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
backstage of the National Museum of Natural History

107
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what --

108
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

109
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
this is serious business for me.

110
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,

112
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
whether it's a spearer or a smasher,

113
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure

114
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:21,000
right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.

115
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.

116
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's a very beautiful structure.

117
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas

118
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:34,000
suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.

119
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.

120
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show

121
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:45,000
is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.

122
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism

123
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in order to generate the amount of force that we observe,

124
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.

125
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So we thought, OK, this must be a spring --

126
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the saddle could very well be a spring.

127
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
And we went back to those high-speed videos again,

128
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.

129
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And I'll just do that one more time.

130
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And then if you take a look at the video --

131
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:13,000
it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow.

132
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it

133
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.

134
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So, we've had very solid evidence showing

135
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,

136
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and does, in fact, function as a spring.

137
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a "hyperbolic paraboloid surface,"

138
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
or an "anticlastic surface."

139
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And this is very well known to engineers and architects,

140
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because it's a very strong surface in compression.

141
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It has curves in two directions,

142
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,

143
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces

144
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:5,000
over the surface of this type of shape.

145
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.

146
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,

147
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because it requires very little material

148
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to build this type of surface, and it's very strong.

149
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So if you're going to build a thin gold structure,

150
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.

151
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects

152
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.

153
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built

154
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that's 87 and a half feet spanwise.

155
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.

156
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's --

157
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure

158
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.

159
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And all of these are the same principles that apply

160
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.

161
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot

162
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
of extra material requirements for building it.

163
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So, very interesting parallels between the biological

164
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out --

165
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:,000
the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first

166
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.

167
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:06,000
That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.

168
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So the next and final question was, well, how much force

169
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:13,000
does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?

170
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And so I wired up what's called a load cell.

171
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
A load cell measures forces, and this is actually

172
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.

173
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change

174
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in.

175
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So these animals are wonderfully aggressive,

176
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do

177
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell,

178
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and they'd smash away at it.

179
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And so this is just a regular video of the animal

180
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
just smashing the heck out of this load cell.

181
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And we were able to get some force measurements out.

182
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And again, we were in for a surprise.

183
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking,

184
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.

185
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.

186
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So these are actually some old data

187
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:01,000
where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,

188
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds

189
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
generated by an animal about this big.

190
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell

191
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating

192
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
well over 200 pounds of force.

193
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And again, I think this will be a world record.

194
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I have to do a little bit more background reading,

195
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced

196
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:27,000
by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces.

197
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring

198
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.

199
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But that was not the end of the story.

200
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Now, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work.

201
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And I got all these force measurements,

202
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and then I went and looked at the force output of the system.

203
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis

204
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.

205
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And that was what really got me puzzled.

206
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.

207
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later,

208
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and I didn't know what that was.

209
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,

210
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but not half a millisecond later.

211
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Again, going back to those high-speed videos,

212
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:17,000
there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.

213
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier.

214
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel,

215
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.

216
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,

217
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:33,000
on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.

218
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.

219
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Audience: Wow.

220
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there

221
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.

222
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And what that is, is cavitation.

223
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon

224
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
which occurs when you have areas of water

225
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
moving at extremely different speeds.

226
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,

227
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
which results in the water literally vaporizing.

228
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat,

229
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and it's a very destructive process.

230
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation

231
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,

232
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
because it destroys boat propellers.

233
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
People have been struggling for years to try and design

234
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:28,000
a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate

235
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it,

236
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:32,000
just like these pictures show.

237
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further,

238
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.

239
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give

240
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,

241
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
because I could never have done this in a million years --

242
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.

243
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:02,000
You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,

244
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.

245
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So really, just an amazing image,

246
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:13,000
slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.

247
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And again, we can see it in slightly different form there,

248
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.

249
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:25,000
In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.

250
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:

251
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually

252
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually

253
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the collapse of the cavitation bubble.

254
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And these animals may very well be making use of

255
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,

256
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be

257
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.

258
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.

259
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So, one question I often get after this talk --

260
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?

261
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Because obviously, if it's breaking snails,

262
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.

263
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,

264
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away

265
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
their heel all the way to the flesh.

266
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod

267
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is that you have to molt. And every three months or so

268
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:25,000
these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.

269
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem.

270
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.

271
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:37,000
(Laughter)

272
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.

273
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Laughter)

274
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring --

275
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:49,000
has actually been well known to biologists for a long time,

276
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:53,000
not as a spring but as a visual signal.

277
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot

278
0:14:55,000 --> 0:15:01,000
in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.

279
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins

280
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:1,000
of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.

281
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And I think one explanation for this could be

282
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
going back to the molting phenomenon.

283
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So these animals go into a molting period where they're

284
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft.

285
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.

286
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period

287
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:33,000
when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,

288
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.

289
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,

290
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:44,000
they just signal. They wave their legs around.

291
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.

292
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It's a well-established fact of these animals

293
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.

294
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots

295
0:15:56,000 --> 0:16:,000
in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information

296
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:03,000
about their ability to strike, or their strike force,

297
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and something about the time period in the molting cycle.

298
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure

299
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:14,000
right in the middle of their spring.

300
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators,

301
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.

302
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,

303
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:29,000
which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time,

304
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.

305
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Applause)

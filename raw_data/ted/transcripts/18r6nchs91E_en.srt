0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Video: Narrator: An event seen from one point of view

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
gives one impression.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
what's going on.

6
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?

7
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about

8
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the power of, and importance of, independent media

9
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
than I could say in an hour.

10
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So I thought that it will be good to start with it.

11
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And also start with a little bit of statistics.

12
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:12,000
According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet

13
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
lives in the societies without independent press.

14
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet

15
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
does not really know what is going on in their countries.

16
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The information they get gets filtered through somebody

17
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:34,000
who either twists that information, or colors that information,

18
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
does something with it.

19
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So they're deprived of understanding their reality.

20
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:46,000
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.

21
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies

22
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.

23
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.

24
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Enjoy it while it lasts.

25
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags,

26
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but they can also lose press freedom,

27
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.

28
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But that's totally another and separate topic.

29
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I can go back to my story.

30
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991.

31
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:35,000
At that time I was running B92, the only independent,

32
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.

33
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only

34
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:49,000
independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment,

35
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where government really wants to make your life miserable.

36
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And there are different ways.

37
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Yeah, it was the usual cocktail:

38
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice,

39
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control,

40
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:06,000
so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.

41
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But what they really do, which is very powerful,

42
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing

43
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
if they don't like independent media companies --

44
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you know, they threaten your advertisers.

45
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually,

46
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come --

47
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
no matter how much does it make sense for them --

48
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
do not want to come and advertise.

49
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And you have a problem making ends meet.

50
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem,

51
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which was, you know, survival below one side,

52
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but what was really painful for me was,

53
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.

54
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,

55
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in a slow-motion downfall.

56
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And we all had all of that on tapes.

57
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We had the ability to understand what was going on.

58
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We were actually recording history.

59
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later;

60
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes

61
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to keep archives of that history.

62
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.

63
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:27,000
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.

64
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It was still 1991.

65
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
He was running a media systems organization

66
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.

67
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And what did I know at that time about media systems?

68
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I would think media systems were organizations,

69
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which means they should help you.

70
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:

71
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the small one and the big one.

72
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The small one was, I just wanted him

73
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to help us get those damn tapes,

74
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.

75
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.

76
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Because I thought, I still maintain,

77
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that serious and independent media companies are great business.

78
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company

79
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.

80
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest

81
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
media company in the country.

82
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time

83
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:28,000
was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.

84
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:32,000
To make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office,

85
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
great suit and tie.

86
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation

87
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult

88
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the war will be.

89
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.

90
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,

91
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke --

92
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music

93
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:06,000
of Michael Jackson?

94
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That was really the only question he had.

95
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:15,000
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself

96
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because I thought there must be an institution in the world

97
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that is providing loans to media companies.

98
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's so obvious, straight in your face,

99
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and somebody must have thought of it.

100
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Somebody must have started something like that.

101
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.

102
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time;

103
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you could not just Google in '91.

104
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So I thought that that's actually my problem.

105
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now we go from here, fast forward to 1995.

106
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I have -- I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros,

107
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:58,000
trying for the third time to convince him that

108
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:01,000
his foundation should invest in something that should

109
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
operate like a media bank.

110
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And basically what I was saying is very simple.

111
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.

112
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.

113
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.

114
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's business anywhere.

115
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.

116
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.

117
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.

118
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
At the end of the meeting he says,

119
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:39,000
look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;

120
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.

121
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:49,000
See that it will not work.

122
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.

123
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

124
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I knew two things after that meeting.

125
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:,000
First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.

126
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.

127
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.

128
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But it's one thing to have a concept;

129
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.

130
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.

131
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.

132
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here;

133
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.

134
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
You know, you find somebody who is respectable

135
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and has a lot of money.

136
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
You give them more money; they repay you that over a time.

137
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You collect interest and do nothing in between.

138
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So I thought, why don't we get into that business?

139
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

140
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So here we are having our first client, brilliant.

141
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
First independent newspaper in Slovakia.

142
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The government cutting them off

143
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
from all the printing facilities in Bratislava.

144
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So here's the daily newspaper

145
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.

146
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.

147
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
That means that they have no sports;

148
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
they have no latest news; circulation goes down.

149
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way

150
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
how to economically strangle a daily newspaper.

151
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They come to us with a request for a loan.

152
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
They want to -- the only way for them to survive

153
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is to get a printing press.

154
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And we said, that's fine; let's meet;

155
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.

156
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We start the meeting.

157
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,

158
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
so it's much bigger.

159
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.

160
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But however you put it, you know, the numbers

161
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:45,000
do not make any sense.

162
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And that's the best they could do.

163
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We were the best that they could do.

164
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So that is how we understood what our method is.

165
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's not a bank. We had to actually

166
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:57,000
go into these companies and earn our return

167
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:,000
by fixing them -- by establishing management systems,

168
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business

169
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:08,000
on one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.

170
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Just quickly on the results.

171
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Over these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing,

172
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
average interest rate five percent to six percent.

173
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Lately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.

174
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world.

175
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And here is the most stunning number.

176
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Return rate -- the one that Soros was so worried about -- 97 percent.

177
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:47,000
97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.

178
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:48,000
What do we typically finance?

179
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We finance anything that a media company would need,

180
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:56,000
from printing presses to transmitters.

181
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:01,000
What is most important is we do it

182
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
either in form of loans, equities, lease --

183
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.

184
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But what is most important here is, who do we finance?

185
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We believe that in the last 10 years companies

186
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that we've financed are actually the best media companies

187
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
in the developing world.

188
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:22,000
That is a "Who is Who" list.

189
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And I could spend hours talking about them,

190
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:28,000
because they're all kind of heroes.

191
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,

192
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and depending on time I may give you two examples

193
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:35,000
who we work with.

194
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,

195
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and moved to Russia.

196
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.

197
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.

198
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
In the south of Russia there's a guy called

199
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running

200
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
an independent newspaper there.

201
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:54,000
The city was closed until early '90s

202
0:11:54,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.

203
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there.

204
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
After two years working with us, he becomes

205
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:13,000
the most respected newspaper in that small place.

206
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Governor comes to him one day,

207
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:17,000
actually invites him to come to his office.

208
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
He goes and sees the governor. The governor says,

209
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,

210
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.

211
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And I want to offer you a deal.

212
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,

213
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
because I have elections --

214
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:4,000
there are elections coming up in nine months.

215
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I will not run, but it's very important for me

216
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who is going to succeed me.

217
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.

218
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I have no interest in being in media business.

219
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
How much would that cost?

220
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."

221
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The governor says, "We will close you."

222
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
Boris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."

223
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Six months later the newspaper was closed.

224
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich

225
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:11,000
take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,

226
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.

227
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So what the governor got was an empty shell.

228
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,

229
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and if you are a banker for independent media.

230
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So it sounds like a great story.

231
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center.

232
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.

233
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But there is a second angle to that.

234
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
The second angle, like in this clip.

235
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
If you take the camera above, you start thinking

236
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:47,000
about these numbers again.

237
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:54,000
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.

238
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That is not too much, is it?

239
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's actually just a drop in the sea.

240
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:,000
Because when you think about the importance,

241
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
some of the issues that we were talking about last night --

242
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
this last session we had about Africa and his

243
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:1,000
hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.

244
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:16,000
All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night --

245
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,

246
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
giving voice to unheard, to poor --

247
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
it's why independent media is in business.

248
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And it's why it was invented.

249
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So from that perspective, what we did is just really

250
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.

251
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Now ours is just one story.

252
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories

253
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
of nonprofits doing spectacular work.

254
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Here is where the problem is,

255
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.

256
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
And it's called fundraising.

257
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Imagine that this third of this room is filled

258
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
with people who represent different foundations.

259
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,

260
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
doing very important work.

261
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Now imagine that every second person over here

262
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.

263
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Now that is how difficult it is to match people

264
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
from this side of the room

265
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
with people of that side of the room.

266
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed

267
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to reform, to totally rethink fundraising.

268
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:41,000
You know, instead of people running in this dark,

269
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:44,000
trying to find their own match, who will be willing,

270
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
who has the same goals.

271
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Instead of all of that we thought there is --

272
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
something new needs to be invented.

273
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,

274
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:56,000
press freedom bonds.

275
0:15:56,000 --> 0:16:03,000
If there are investors willing to finance

276
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:05,000
U.S. government budget deficit,

277
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance

278
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
press freedom deficit?

279
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them,

280
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:16,000
probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.

281
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.

282
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:22,000
But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them,

283
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
find enough investors that this can be considered a success,

284
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
there's nothing stopping the next organization

285
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to start to issue bonds next spring.

286
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And those can be environmental bonds.

287
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his

288
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
electricity in Bangladesh bonds.

289
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And before you know it, any social cause

290
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
can be actually financed in this way.

291
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.

292
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:57,000
But let's take the idea further.

293
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's,

294
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.

295
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:05,000
But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.

296
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:07,000
You can bring it to Asia.

297
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:11,000
You can, once you have all of those different points,

298
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:13,000
you can make it easy for investors.

299
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Put all of those bonds at one place

300
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and they sit down and click.

301
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Once you have more than 10 of them

302
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:22,000
you have to develop some kind of a matrix.

303
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:23,000
What do investors get?

304
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:26,000
On one side financial, on the other side social.

305
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,

306
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Morningstar type.

307
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:38,000
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.

308
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.

309
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Now take it to the last step.

310
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Once you have all of that put together,

311
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:53,000
there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have

312
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:55,000
a marketplace for all of that,

313
0:17:55,000 --> 0:18:,000
where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.

314
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And in that way you organize the financing

315
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:05,000
so there are no dark rooms, no blind people

316
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:07,000
running around to find each other.

317
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:11.9,000 --> 0:00:19,000
pleasure to be here cross free let's

2
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:22,000
start by getting a sense from you of how

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you think of this thing that's happening

4
0:00:22.65,000 --> 0:00:26,000
now you've covered so many disasters

5
0:00:24.119,000 --> 0:00:3,000
over the years how do you rate and think

6
0:00:27.06,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of this one well I think this is a more

7
0:00:31.109,000 --> 0:00:37,000
dramatic more global and more unusual

8
0:00:34.13,000 --> 0:00:41,000
than anything we have seen in a long

9
0:00:37.71,000 --> 0:00:43,000
long time because first you have the

10
0:00:41.489,000 --> 0:00:46,000
healthcare crisis a pandemic that is

11
0:00:43.89,000 --> 0:00:49,000
spread across the world and with unknown

12
0:00:46.92,000 --> 0:00:52,000
lethality and unknown consequences and

13
0:00:50.28,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that is raging as we speak through the

14
0:00:53.46,000 --> 0:00:59,000
world but then has come an economic

15
0:00:57.32,000 --> 0:01:01,000
reality which has become more and more

16
0:00:59.94,000 --> 0:01:03,000
acute which we were just hearing about I

17
0:01:01.949,000 --> 0:01:07,000
think it's not right to call this a

18
0:01:04.32,000 --> 0:01:09,000
recession or even to talk about a Great

19
0:01:08.13,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Depression this is sort of a great

20
0:01:10.08,000 --> 0:01:14,000
paralysis because for the first time

21
0:01:12.45,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that I can think of in recorded human

22
0:01:14.85,000 --> 0:01:19,000
history you have had a literal

23
0:01:17.299,000 --> 0:01:21,000
standstill of the major economies of the

24
0:01:20.46,000 --> 0:01:23,000
world large parts of the major economies

25
0:01:22.2,000 --> 0:01:26,000
of the world which have literally just

26
0:01:24.18,000 --> 0:01:29,000
stopped functioning the basic principle

27
0:01:27.15,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of economic exchange is not happening

28
0:01:29.189,000 --> 0:01:32,000
because human beings are not in

29
0:01:31.17,000 --> 0:01:35,000
proximity with one another and therefore

30
0:01:33.06,000 --> 0:01:38,000
cannot engage in that so you are seeing

31
0:01:35.729,000 --> 0:01:4,000
a simple paralysis of that which is much

32
0:01:38.7,000 --> 0:01:43,000
deeper I think at least in the short

33
0:01:40.77,000 --> 0:01:45,000
term then even the Great Depression then

34
0:01:43.77,000 --> 0:01:47,000
you get the result of what this does in

35
0:01:46.29,000 --> 0:01:49,000
poor countries because so far we have

36
0:01:48.27,000 --> 0:01:52,000
just talked about what is happening in

37
0:01:49.89,000 --> 0:01:53,000
rich countries and now you get to the

38
0:01:52.47,000 --> 0:01:56,000
India's of the world and there you have

39
0:01:54.6,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the problems I described except these

40
0:01:56.64,000 --> 0:02:02,000
countries or cash poor budgets trained

41
0:02:00.479,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in budget terms have poor health care

42
0:02:02.759,000 --> 0:02:07,000
systems and have a lot of overcrowding I

43
0:02:06.54,000 --> 0:02:12,000
mean think about the slums of a place

44
0:02:08.459,000 --> 0:02:14,000
like Mumbai or Calcutta or Nairobi

45
0:02:12.66,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and then you add to this the geopolitics

46
0:02:15.27,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that is going to come to play as

47
0:02:16.86,000 --> 0:02:21,000
everybody draws in whereas yes everybody

48
0:02:20.43,000 --> 0:02:24,000
becomes more nationalist the most

49
0:02:22.8,000 --> 0:02:26,000
powerful expression of that is of course

50
0:02:25.23,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the European Union which has been the

51
0:02:26.82,000 --> 0:02:3,000
celebration in the pooling of

52
0:02:28.89,000 --> 0:02:34,000
sovereignty and what has happened in

53
0:02:30.99,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Europe is almost all the countries in

54
0:02:35.01,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the so-called visa-free zone the

55
0:02:37.02,000 --> 0:02:41,000
passport-free zone the Schengen area

56
0:02:38.7,000 --> 0:02:43,000
have reimpose borders for the first time

57
0:02:41.97,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in decades and when Italy asked the

58
0:02:44.58,000 --> 0:02:47,000
European Union which fellow European

59
0:02:46.89,000 --> 0:02:5,000
members for help

60
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:54,000
oh the 26 other countries to send them

61
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:58,000
medical supplies and things not one said

62
0:02:54.39,000 --> 0:03:01,000
yes do you have any picture in your mind

63
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
about how you think this will play out I

64
0:03:01.83,000 --> 0:03:05,000
mean if it's a unique situation a lot of

65
0:03:05.04,000 --> 0:03:09,000
people are hoping that it's a relatively

66
0:03:06.69,000 --> 0:03:1,000
short economic shock we beat defeat the

67
0:03:09.15,000 --> 0:03:13,000
virus we somehow managed a careful

68
0:03:11.34,000 --> 0:03:17,000
return to work and life returns to

69
0:03:13.92,000 --> 0:03:18,000
normal is that fantasy thinking I don't

70
0:03:17.94,000 --> 0:03:21,000
think it's fantasy thinking a lot

71
0:03:19.5,000 --> 0:03:23,000
depends on on how short that the the

72
0:03:22.41,000 --> 0:03:26,000
shock is and I do think there's some

73
0:03:24.45,000 --> 0:03:28,000
hopeful signs that we're seeing we can

74
0:03:26.58,000 --> 0:03:31,000
get into that the data has been very

75
0:03:28.77,000 --> 0:03:34,000
very interesting and it's changing fast

76
0:03:31.65,000 --> 0:03:38,000
if it's short I think you could see a

77
0:03:35.49,000 --> 0:03:42,000
return to some degree of normalcy but I

78
0:03:39.57,000 --> 0:03:44,000
think it'll be very hard to just restart

79
0:03:42.63,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the economy because you know what what

80
0:03:45.45,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you realize is that modern economies are

81
0:03:48.03,000 --> 0:03:52,000
like riding a bicycle on steroids you

82
0:03:50.55,000 --> 0:03:54,000
know the old line about riding a bicycle

83
0:03:52.32,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you have to keep moving forward when you

84
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
stop it's not like you can just pick up

85
0:03:57.3,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where you were think about a restaurant

86
0:03:59.88,000 --> 0:04:04,000
your credit lines have collapsed your

87
0:04:02.88,000 --> 0:04:06,000
workers in many cases have you know they

88
0:04:05.79,000 --> 0:04:08,000
have lost their livelihood may have gone

89
0:04:07.77,000 --> 0:04:1,000
back to the place they came from may

90
0:04:09.6,000 --> 0:04:14,000
have found another job but out of

91
0:04:11.07,000 --> 0:04:17,000
desperation public attitudes will not be

92
0:04:14.97,000 --> 0:04:19,000
exactly the same particularly for close

93
0:04:17.459,000 --> 0:04:21,000
contact businesses like restaurants and

94
0:04:20.729,000 --> 0:04:23,000
so you know because you've had a

95
0:04:21.84,000 --> 0:04:25,000
disruption of supply and demand at the

96
0:04:24.479,000 --> 0:04:27,000
same time

97
0:04:25.92,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it's not going to be that easy to

98
0:04:27.54,000 --> 0:04:32,000
restart and that is why the government

99
0:04:30.03,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is correctly getting very involved and I

100
0:04:32.64,000 --> 0:04:36,000
have to say on this front the American

101
0:04:34.5,000 --> 0:04:37,000
government seems to be doing more than

102
0:04:37.02,000 --> 0:04:4,000
most other governments there are a lot

103
0:04:38.34,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of areas where you can say the American

104
0:04:40.38,000 --> 0:04:44,000
government has been has been has

105
0:04:41.82,000 --> 0:04:46,000
performed abysmally but on the economic

106
0:04:44.94,000 --> 0:04:49,000
front with all the partisanship in in

107
0:04:47.64,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Washington it is actually properly in

108
0:04:50.13,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the Federal Reserve as a part of that is

109
0:04:51.93,000 --> 0:04:55,000
properly reacting to the kind of

110
0:04:54.21,000 --> 0:04:59,000
historic nature of this so I think if

111
0:04:56.85,000 --> 0:05:01,000
it's a short shock we might get back to

112
0:04:59.97,000 --> 0:05:02,000
some degree of normal though there will

113
0:05:02.25,000 --> 0:05:06,000
be industries like travel and

114
0:05:03.75,000 --> 0:05:07,000
restaurants and theaters maybe sports

115
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that will have a much longer time

116
0:05:08.49,000 --> 0:05:14,000
timeframe if we get a vaccine when we

117
0:05:11.34,000 --> 0:05:17,000
get a vaccine I tend to on that front be

118
0:05:14.7,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a little bit more historically minded by

119
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this you know if the Spanish flu that

120
0:05:20.67,000 --> 0:05:26,000
killed multiple multiple multiple times

121
0:05:23.79,000 --> 0:05:3,000
as many people in percentage terms as as

122
0:05:27.18,000 --> 0:05:34,000
this one will likely if that didn't kill

123
0:05:30.89,000 --> 0:05:36,000
restaurants and theaters and and sports

124
0:05:34.83,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I'm not sure this well I I think we

125
0:05:36.96,000 --> 0:05:39,000
should we that people are painting a

126
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:42,000
picture of a world where there will

127
0:05:40.53,000 --> 0:05:43,000
never be restaurants and they will never

128
0:05:42.12,000 --> 0:05:46,000
be movie theaters and there will never

129
0:05:43.53,000 --> 0:05:48,000
be you know gatherings of any kind

130
0:05:46.53,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I don't know human beings alike to be in

131
0:05:48.81,000 --> 0:05:55,000
contact with one another well though I'm

132
0:05:52.92,000 --> 0:05:57,000
sure that the last pandemic in the

133
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Spanish flu killed many businesses and

134
0:05:58.85,000 --> 0:06:02,000
eventually they came back in DIF it's

135
0:06:01.11,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it's it's it's almost hard to separate I

136
0:06:03.84,000 --> 0:06:07,000
mean what's clear is there's gonna be

137
0:06:05.01,000 --> 0:06:11,000
just massive amounts of tragedy massive

138
0:06:08.69,000 --> 0:06:13,000
numbers of people who may have seen

139
0:06:11.49,000 --> 0:06:14,000
their life savings evaporate if they

140
0:06:14.01,000 --> 0:06:17,000
even ever hadn't you know maybe

141
0:06:15.18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
struggling on the breadline right right

142
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
now and and yes some kind of life will

143
0:06:20.58,000 --> 0:06:23,000
be come back we I let's let's let's talk

144
0:06:22.65,000 --> 0:06:25,000
let me just say let me just say one

145
0:06:24.51,000 --> 0:06:27,000
thing or one thing about what you said

146
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Chris because it's so important I think

147
0:06:28.17,000 --> 0:06:33,000
so many of the people who are who we

148
0:06:31.11,000 --> 0:06:37,000
deal with or live in a digital economy

149
0:06:33.54,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in which they can work from home their

150
0:06:37.5,000 --> 0:06:4,000
jobs in large part can can

151
0:06:39.569,000 --> 0:06:44,000
continue in some way or the other okay

152
0:06:41.339,000 --> 0:06:45,000
maybe you lose some business but you

153
0:06:44.61,000 --> 0:06:48,000
know there is a much greater degree of

154
0:06:46.289,000 --> 0:06:5,000
stability but for the vast majority of

155
0:06:49.229,000 --> 0:06:52,000
people who are losing their jobs they're

156
0:06:50.969,000 --> 0:06:55,000
losing their jobs because they're what

157
0:06:52.979,000 --> 0:06:57,000
can't be digitized and I think it's it's

158
0:06:56.429,000 --> 0:07:01,000
important to recognize this is creating

159
0:06:58.559,000 --> 0:07:03,000
its own kind of new inequality an

160
0:07:01.469,000 --> 0:07:06,000
equality between the digital economy and

161
0:07:03.99,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the and the the material economy between

162
0:07:06.509,000 --> 0:07:12,000
knowledge workers and non wallet workers

163
0:07:08.759,000 --> 0:07:15,000
which maps on rather Eunos tragically in

164
0:07:12.569,000 --> 0:07:17,000
similar ways to the old inequalities in

165
0:07:15.869,000 --> 0:07:19,000
which people with again with who had

166
0:07:18.089,000 --> 0:07:21,000
knowledge workers did well and people

167
0:07:19.919,000 --> 0:07:27,000
who were working with their hands did

168
0:07:21.869,000 --> 0:07:3,000
not yeah absolutely and it's it's I mean

169
0:07:28.619,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the only thing only piece of hope I can

170
0:07:30.99,000 --> 0:07:34,000
see from that is that so many people

171
0:07:33.209,000 --> 0:07:36,000
have developed this newfound

172
0:07:35.039,000 --> 0:07:39,000
appreciation for the amazingness of the

173
0:07:37.11,000 --> 0:07:43,000
work of people they didn't spend enough

174
0:07:39.36,000 --> 0:07:44,000
time thinking about you you see you know

175
0:07:43.619,000 --> 0:07:48,000
people talking with great gratitude

176
0:07:44.999,000 --> 0:07:51,000
about their delivery man or the woman

177
0:07:49.499,000 --> 0:07:53,000
who who you know that for their once a

178
0:07:52.379,000 --> 0:07:55,000
week visit to the grocery store if they

179
0:07:53.999,000 --> 0:07:58,000
could manage that or and so forth and

180
0:07:56.129,000 --> 0:08:,000
these people are heroes as a works on

181
0:07:59.159,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the front line question is it's almost

182
0:08:00.509,000 --> 0:08:03,000
like is there any chance juice any

183
0:08:01.86,000 --> 0:08:05,000
chance that that kind of attitude will

184
0:08:04.259,000 --> 0:08:11,000
survive this that will hold on to that

185
0:08:05.939,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and somehow reframe the priorities in

186
0:08:11.849,000 --> 0:08:15,000
our economy the people who we think

187
0:08:13.619,000 --> 0:08:18,000
should be compensated more perhaps and

188
0:08:16.769,000 --> 0:08:2,000
just how we all think of each other is

189
0:08:19.169,000 --> 0:08:22,000
much more interconnected than we know or

190
0:08:21.419,000 --> 0:08:24,000
do we just forget about this after a

191
0:08:22.949,000 --> 0:08:26,000
month of things kind of going back to

192
0:08:25.139,000 --> 0:08:29,000
normal I hope we do and I think some of

193
0:08:27.839,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that depends on people like you and me

194
0:08:29.729,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you know who do have a role in shaping

195
0:08:31.789,000 --> 0:08:36,000
public dialogue in public memory not to

196
0:08:35.25,000 --> 0:08:4,000
make sure that it doesn't get forgotten

197
0:08:37.099,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and that we do remember that you know

198
0:08:40.5,000 --> 0:08:43,000
we're all in this together you know I

199
0:08:42.779,000 --> 0:08:45,000
often think about that when you when

200
0:08:44.43,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you're dealing with people in countries

201
0:08:46.589,000 --> 0:08:5,000
like the United States who are poor who

202
0:08:48.3,000 --> 0:08:52,000
don't vote who don't write op-eds you

203
0:08:50.97,000 --> 0:08:52,000
know how do you make sure that that

204
0:08:52.38,000 --> 0:08:55,000
perspective

205
0:08:53.13,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and that voice is remembered the

206
0:08:55.92,000 --> 0:08:59,000
unfortunately the structural reality is

207
0:08:57.84,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that you know the the digital economy

208
0:09:00.03,000 --> 0:09:04,000
will do even better out of this recovery

209
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
because people will learn that they can

210
0:09:04.76,000 --> 0:09:08,000
you know buy groceries online when they

211
0:09:07.32,000 --> 0:09:1,000
might have not you know wanted to do

212
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that before hand and the little

213
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
mom-and-pop store on the street corner

214
0:09:13.68,000 --> 0:09:16,000
might might lose more business as a

215
0:09:15.63,000 --> 0:09:18,000
result of it so it's it's all the more

216
0:09:17.46,000 --> 0:09:21,000
reason to try to remind people that

217
0:09:19.59,000 --> 0:09:24,000
we're all in this together so right now

218
0:09:22.41,000 --> 0:09:28,000
every country on the planet has this

219
0:09:24.95,000 --> 0:09:31,000
horrible dilemma as to how aggressively

220
0:09:28.47,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you shut things down and and then how if

221
0:09:32.64,000 --> 0:09:37,000
at all how to bring things back give us

222
0:09:35.46,000 --> 0:09:39,000
your sense for read on which countries

223
0:09:37.83,000 --> 0:09:43,000
have done a good job of managing that

224
0:09:40.38,000 --> 0:09:46,000
dilemma and and which really haven't so

225
0:09:43.83,000 --> 0:09:48,000
far I think it's actually pretty easy to

226
0:09:46.71,000 --> 0:09:5,000
tell or right now the data is we have

227
0:09:49.44,000 --> 0:09:54,000
enough information that we can say that

228
0:09:51.39,000 --> 0:09:56,000
quite definitively you know obviously

229
0:09:54.72,000 --> 0:09:58,000
there may be second waves and third

230
0:09:56.46,000 --> 0:10:,000
waves but so far it is not the case that

231
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
dictatorships have done this better than

232
0:10:01.29,000 --> 0:10:05,000
democracies that is not the dividing

233
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
line the dividing line is places that

234
0:10:05.76,000 --> 0:10:11,000
have effective government that have

235
0:10:07.98,000 --> 0:10:13,000
depended on experts and acted early so

236
0:10:12.18,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that the key the key countries that have

237
0:10:14.55,000 --> 0:10:19,000
done well have been the ones in East

238
0:10:15.96,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Asia and that's China which actually

239
0:10:19.62,000 --> 0:10:24,000
comes across in many ways worse than

240
0:10:22.62,000 --> 0:10:27,000
some of the others but because it was a

241
0:10:24.99,000 --> 0:10:29,000
very slow start it hid the data it lied

242
0:10:27.87,000 --> 0:10:31,000
about it but then when it got finally

243
0:10:30.36,000 --> 0:10:34,000
realized it was serious they they

244
0:10:32.49,000 --> 0:10:36,000
handled it very well but the countries

245
0:10:34.86,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that really come across well are

246
0:10:37.46,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Singapore South Korea Taiwan Hong Kong

247
0:10:41.73,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and what they did in South Korea is

248
0:10:44.76,000 --> 0:10:49,000
really probably the model country is

249
0:10:46.47,000 --> 0:10:51,000
they acted very early they developed

250
0:10:49.92,000 --> 0:10:53,000
their own test the minute the the DNA

251
0:10:51.99,000 --> 0:10:56,000
was sequence was published and then they

252
0:10:54.66,000 --> 0:10:58,000
went out and did mass testing mass

253
0:10:57.12,000 --> 0:11:,000
testing and contact tracing because the

254
0:10:58.95,000 --> 0:11:02,000
most important thing you need to

255
0:11:00.54,000 --> 0:11:05,000
understand is how many people have this

256
0:11:03.18,000 --> 0:11:06,000
disease so that you can understand where

257
0:11:05.91,000 --> 0:11:08,000
what parts of

258
0:11:06.78,000 --> 0:11:1,000
economy what whom to isolate him not to

259
0:11:09.09,000 --> 0:11:12,000
isolate things like that so you know

260
0:11:11.13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because without that you're really

261
0:11:12.54,000 --> 0:11:17,000
flying blind and what South Korea was

262
0:11:15.78,000 --> 0:11:19,000
able to do was really do the the most

263
0:11:17.73,000 --> 0:11:21,000
sophisticated kind of testing which is

264
0:11:19.8,000 --> 0:11:23,000
random sampling so you know me because

265
0:11:21.99,000 --> 0:11:25,000
what we're doing just think about how we

266
0:11:23.94,000 --> 0:11:27,000
are arriving at something like our

267
0:11:26.19,000 --> 0:11:31,000
fatality rate how many people died we

268
0:11:28.47,000 --> 0:11:33,000
only know the people who test for kovat

269
0:11:31.71,000 --> 0:11:35,000
want the base to the people who fall

270
0:11:33.75,000 --> 0:11:37,000
sick are sick enough that they go to a

271
0:11:36.06,000 --> 0:11:4,000
hospital or a clinic and the hospital

272
0:11:38.07,000 --> 0:11:42,000
clinic says okay your symptoms are close

273
0:11:40.5,000 --> 0:11:44,000
enough to what we think

274
0:11:42.54,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Kove it is and we'll we'll test you for

275
0:11:44.97,000 --> 0:11:48,000
it and those are the people we test

276
0:11:47.54,000 --> 0:11:5,000
which of course means there are lots of

277
0:11:49.62,000 --> 0:11:52,000
me we now know lots of people who have

278
0:11:51.12,000 --> 0:11:55,000
mild symptoms who get over it think it's

279
0:11:53.34,000 --> 0:11:56,000
a code all those people don't get

280
0:11:55.29,000 --> 0:12:,000
counted the South Koreans did all of

281
0:11:56.88,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that they have achieved the most in some

282
0:12:00.72,000 --> 0:12:05,000
ways the most impressive results in in

283
0:12:03.3,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the world without a national lockdown

284
0:12:05.88,000 --> 0:12:08,000
without shelter in place without

285
0:12:07.53,000 --> 0:12:11,000
quarantines they have occasionally

286
0:12:09.6,000 --> 0:12:13,000
selectively done it for a specific you

287
0:12:11.76,000 --> 0:12:15,000
know with with a bar bars in one area or

288
0:12:14.4,000 --> 0:12:17,000
things like that but that's really I

289
0:12:16.71,000 --> 0:12:19,000
think the world should look at that

290
0:12:18.18,000 --> 0:12:22,000
example because they have achieved it

291
0:12:19.89,000 --> 0:12:24,000
without shutting down the economy it's

292
0:12:22.77,000 --> 0:12:28,000
almost like the the watchword for a

293
0:12:25.53,000 --> 0:12:31,000
future pandemic is can you avoid it

294
0:12:29.37,000 --> 0:12:33,000
getting out of control and only a few

295
0:12:31.53,000 --> 0:12:34,000
countries have done that when you can

296
0:12:33.63,000 --> 0:12:36,000
still be in this containment mode of

297
0:12:35.49,000 --> 0:12:39,000
basically being able to track every

298
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
known case that is completely different

299
0:12:39.87,000 --> 0:12:43,000
from the mode of it's out of control we

300
0:12:42.87,000 --> 0:12:45,000
can't possibly track down everyone so we

301
0:12:44.64,000 --> 0:12:48,000
just have to shut everything down and

302
0:12:46.38,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that's when the massive economic damage

303
0:12:48.72,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and so forth kicks in so just it almost

304
0:12:54.06,000 --> 0:13:,000
still in some ways this crisis plays to

305
0:12:58.92,000 --> 0:13:02,000
America's weaknesses rather than to its

306
0:13:00.96,000 --> 0:13:04,000
strengths the United States has many

307
0:13:03.57,000 --> 0:13:09,000
strengths but it is a chaotic

308
0:13:05.85,000 --> 0:13:13,000
disorganized messy noisy country right

309
0:13:10.35,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and it slow to stir to action but once

310
0:13:14.34,000 --> 0:13:18,000
it stirs to action you know over time it

311
0:13:16.92,000 --> 0:13:2,000
accomplishes a lot this is the sort of

312
0:13:18.96,000 --> 0:13:21,000
this is Churchill's famous line

313
0:13:21.03,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the United States is you can count on

314
0:13:22.86,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the United States to do the right thing

315
0:13:25.14,000 --> 0:13:3,000
after it has exhausted every other

316
0:13:27.36,000 --> 0:13:32,000
alternative so what this well you know

317
0:13:30.63,000 --> 0:13:34,000
unfortunately for exactly the reason you

318
0:13:32.88,000 --> 0:13:36,000
say this is a crisis where early action

319
0:13:35.58,000 --> 0:13:38,000
helps enormously you know because it

320
0:13:37.41,000 --> 0:13:41,000
because of the nature of exponential

321
0:13:38.88,000 --> 0:13:42,000
growth if you catch it early it makes a

322
0:13:41.61,000 --> 0:13:46,000
big difference unfortunately the United

323
0:13:43.41,000 --> 0:13:48,000
States did not do that are there any

324
0:13:47.25,000 --> 0:13:52,000
countries in Europe I mean many

325
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
countries in Europe also kind of bunched

326
0:13:53.19,000 --> 0:13:56,000
what what happened certainly when you

327
0:13:54.63,000 --> 0:13:57,000
compare that what happened in some Asian

328
0:13:56.52,000 --> 0:14:01,000
countries are there any other impressed

329
0:13:58.11,000 --> 0:14:04,000
you yes Germany is Germany is actually

330
0:14:01.76,000 --> 0:14:06,000
close to South Korea in how well it is

331
0:14:04.8,000 --> 0:14:1,000
handled it started a little bit later

332
0:14:06.95,000 --> 0:14:11,000
has all has put in place children you

333
0:14:10.92,000 --> 0:14:14,000
know stay stay at home policies and

334
0:14:12.9,000 --> 0:14:17,000
social distancing partly because I think

335
0:14:15.72,000 --> 0:14:19,000
it it got a slightly slower start

336
0:14:18.5,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Denmark has done very well as doing

337
0:14:20.7,000 --> 0:14:24,000
random testing and as a result you're

338
0:14:23.07,000 --> 0:14:29,000
seeing the Danes are beginning to open

339
0:14:25.23,000 --> 0:14:31,000
up the economy I think that Iceland is

340
0:14:29.1,000 --> 0:14:33,000
doing is doing well again trying to do

341
0:14:31.41,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the Ted you know what you notice about

342
0:14:33.42,000 --> 0:14:37,000
all these are places where the

343
0:14:35.31,000 --> 0:14:4,000
government is respected its well funded

344
0:14:37.95,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the bureaucracies get good people those

345
0:14:40.77,000 --> 0:14:46,000
people are able to exercise a lot of you

346
0:14:43.53,000 --> 0:14:49,000
know power and and discretion mmm

347
0:14:47.04,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Whitney so I'm we're seeing a lot of

348
0:14:50.339,000 --> 0:14:56,000
questions online hi there for read about

349
0:14:52.2,000 --> 0:14:58,000
the negative impacts on the economy and

350
0:14:56.88,000 --> 0:14:59,000
our lifestyle which are things that

351
0:14:58.29,000 --> 0:15:01,000
we've been hearing often but can you

352
0:15:00.24,000 --> 0:15:03,000
speak to some of the the positive things

353
0:15:02.28,000 --> 0:15:05,000
you see coming out of business it

354
0:15:03.39,000 --> 0:15:07,000
relates to work opportunities that our

355
0:15:05.67,000 --> 0:15:09,000
economy the lifestyle the way that we

356
0:15:07.53,000 --> 0:15:11,000
have been doing things what do you see

357
0:15:09.9,000 --> 0:15:14,000
as positive outcomes of this disruption

358
0:15:12.29,000 --> 0:15:16,000
well let's let's not minimize the

359
0:15:14.94,000 --> 0:15:17,000
negative because I think that probably a

360
0:15:16.44,000 --> 0:15:2,000
lot of people there who are feeling pain

361
0:15:18.24,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and who are experiencing massive

362
0:15:20.79,000 --> 0:15:24,000
dislocations in their lives and I think

363
0:15:22.95,000 --> 0:15:26,000
it's important to recognize that it's

364
0:15:25.35,000 --> 0:15:29,000
important for the government to help to

365
0:15:27.6,000 --> 0:15:31,000
treat this as a kind of disaster relief

366
0:15:29.55,000 --> 0:15:33,000
program not as a traditional stimulus

367
0:15:32.19,000 --> 0:15:34,000
you know this is a case where frankly

368
0:15:34.23,000 --> 0:15:36,000
the government

369
0:15:34.93,000 --> 0:15:37,000
force these businesses for

370
0:15:36.91,000 --> 0:15:41,000
understandable reasons but force these

371
0:15:38.769,000 --> 0:15:43,000
businesses not to operate or force these

372
0:15:41.98,000 --> 0:15:44,000
people not to go to work and it is

373
0:15:43.99,000 --> 0:15:47,000
incumbent on the government to provide

374
0:15:45.759,000 --> 0:15:49,000
assistance now what are the

375
0:15:48.399,000 --> 0:15:52,000
opportunities unfortunately they're

376
0:15:50.68,000 --> 0:15:53,000
mostly in the digital realm right I mean

377
0:15:52.449,000 --> 0:15:56,000
you're going to you're going to see a

378
0:15:53.86,000 --> 0:15:57,000
lot your people are finding ways to be

379
0:15:56.649,000 --> 0:15:59,000
able to do things digitally that they

380
0:15:58.569,000 --> 0:16:02,000
didn't you know where they were

381
0:15:59.98,000 --> 0:16:04,000
previously doing it in other ways

382
0:16:03.3,000 --> 0:16:07,000
meetings you know everything can be done

383
0:16:05.709,000 --> 0:16:09,000
you you're you're going to find ways to

384
0:16:07.449,000 --> 0:16:12,000
be more productive than you had to do

385
0:16:10.679,000 --> 0:16:14,000
look I mean one one piece of this I

386
0:16:13.3,000 --> 0:16:17,000
think about is maybe we all travel too

387
0:16:15.129,000 --> 0:16:19,000
much maybe there are ways to achieve to

388
0:16:17.499,000 --> 0:16:21,000
do a lot of meetings without having to

389
0:16:19.569,000 --> 0:16:24,000
do the con you know so many of us go

390
0:16:22.36,000 --> 0:16:28,000
travel a lot it's probably bad for the

391
0:16:24.85,000 --> 0:16:3,000
environment it's not great for your your

392
0:16:28.779,000 --> 0:16:33,000
family life and so maybe there is a kind

393
0:16:31.42,000 --> 0:16:35,000
of an ability to just step back and say

394
0:16:34.36,000 --> 0:16:38,000
you know that we could have a different

395
0:16:36.369,000 --> 0:16:41,000
kind of life we could have we could

396
0:16:39.189,000 --> 0:16:45,000
achieve a certain amount in other ways

397
0:16:42.209,000 --> 0:16:46,000
but I but I do want to stress you know

398
0:16:45.309,000 --> 0:16:49,000
this is this is very tough on a lot of

399
0:16:47.11,000 --> 0:16:53,000
people and it's and unfortunately I

400
0:16:50.11,000 --> 0:16:55,000
think the part we are going to find more

401
0:16:53.649,000 --> 0:16:57,000
difficult than people are imagining is

402
0:16:55.509,000 --> 0:16:59,000
that restart button you know you're not

403
0:16:58.48,000 --> 0:17:03,000
going to just push a button and get the

404
0:17:00.279,000 --> 0:17:05,000
economy going again for if you think

405
0:17:03.49,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that the Indian government got it right

406
0:17:05.699,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in in what they did because the dilemma

407
0:17:08.709,000 --> 0:17:12,000
for them is different from elsewhere

408
0:17:10.87,000 --> 0:17:15,000
you've got the virus coming but you also

409
0:17:13.51,000 --> 0:17:21,000
have your economy is powered by people

410
0:17:16.12,000 --> 0:17:23,000
who who make no money and and and as as

411
0:17:21.88,000 --> 0:17:26,000
we heard earlier the potential hardship

412
0:17:23.89,000 --> 0:17:28,000
that some of them face is is this a case

413
0:17:26.98,000 --> 0:17:31,000
where the Cure literally might be worse

414
0:17:29.649,000 --> 0:17:34,000
than the disease you know it's a very

415
0:17:32.95,000 --> 0:17:35,000
tough question and it's a very tough

416
0:17:34.87,000 --> 0:17:38,000
challenge I would have hated hated to

417
0:17:36.94,000 --> 0:17:41,000
have been in Prime Minister Modi's shoes

418
0:17:39.419,000 --> 0:17:45,000
clearly what was animating that decision

419
0:17:42.159,000 --> 0:17:48,000
was this India was an early enough stage

420
0:17:45.549,000 --> 0:17:49,000
that if you acted quickly

421
0:17:48.43,000 --> 0:17:53,000
again because of this exponential growth

422
0:17:50.44,000 --> 0:17:55,000
you could achieve something significant

423
0:17:53.47,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and most importantly India has one of

424
0:17:56.38,000 --> 0:18:01,000
the lowest beds per capita in the world

425
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
you know it has a it has a very

426
0:18:01.42,000 --> 0:18:05,000
two-tiered healthcare system for the

427
0:18:03.91,000 --> 0:18:08,000
rich it's it's one class but

428
0:18:06.36,000 --> 0:18:11,000
particularly in rural India it's it's

429
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
really quite inadequate and so there was

430
0:18:11.89,000 --> 0:18:15,000
an under than knew that if this got out

431
0:18:13.93,000 --> 0:18:18,000
of control it was going to crash the

432
0:18:16.24,000 --> 0:18:2,000
healthcare system in a very big way so

433
0:18:19.24,000 --> 0:18:22,000
they made the decision they did as often

434
0:18:21.07,000 --> 0:18:24,000
with Prime Minister Modi he takes

435
0:18:22.42,000 --> 0:18:27,000
decisions but then takes them you know

436
0:18:24.61,000 --> 0:18:29,000
there's a kind of weird impulsiveness so

437
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:33,000
he gave the country you know one point

438
0:18:30.07,000 --> 0:18:36,000
four billion people four hours from 8:00

439
0:18:33.07,000 --> 0:18:37,000
p.m. to midnight to prepare and this is

440
0:18:36.1,000 --> 0:18:39,000
a country in which here fifty to sixty

441
0:18:37.45,000 --> 0:18:41,000
million migrant workers who are working

442
0:18:39.73,000 --> 0:18:43,000
in cities but live hours and hours away

443
0:18:41.74,000 --> 0:18:45,000
this is a country in which is you say

444
0:18:44.14,000 --> 0:18:48,000
most businesses conducted face to face

445
0:18:46.21,000 --> 0:18:5,000
it seems like you could have done you

446
0:18:49.09,000 --> 0:18:52,000
could have given people I would have

447
0:18:50.62,000 --> 0:18:55,000
said you know give them five days or

448
0:18:52.72,000 --> 0:18:57,000
three days to prepare for this but at

449
0:18:55.69,000 --> 0:18:59,000
the end of the day I think I understand

450
0:18:58.24,000 --> 0:19:02,000
the the decision Prime Minister Modi

451
0:19:00.46,000 --> 0:19:05,000
made it is an attempt to say look we're

452
0:19:02.8,000 --> 0:19:07,000
going to suppress this as much as we can

453
0:19:05.49,000 --> 0:19:1,000
keep the numbers very low and then when

454
0:19:08.5,000 --> 0:19:13,000
we open up we have the opportunity to do

455
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
some of this testing and tracing I hope

456
0:19:13.54,000 --> 0:19:17,000
they're using these three weeks to

457
0:19:15.37,000 --> 0:19:19,000
really ramp up mass testing because if

458
0:19:18.04,000 --> 0:19:21,000
you're not you know this is what the

459
0:19:19.6,000 --> 0:19:22,000
United States did with the we'd put the

460
0:19:21.31,000 --> 0:19:25,000
ban on China which was the right thing

461
0:19:22.93,000 --> 0:19:26,000
to do ban on travel from China but then

462
0:19:25.42,000 --> 0:19:29,000
we didn't take advantage of those three

463
0:19:27.22,000 --> 0:19:33,000
weeks to do anything what's your

464
0:19:29.83,000 --> 0:19:33,000
diagnosis of why the US didn't do that

465
0:19:35.1,000 --> 0:19:4,000
it's easy to blame Trump and clearly

466
0:19:38.28,000 --> 0:19:42,000
displayed to Trump's weaknesses

467
0:19:40.57,000 --> 0:19:44,000
he doesn't believe in experts he doesn't

468
0:19:42.4,000 --> 0:19:46,000
believe in science he's impulsive all

469
0:19:45.49,000 --> 0:19:49,000
all he cares about is the stock market

470
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and he worried that this would in some

471
0:19:49.63,000 --> 0:19:53,000
way interfere with it with its rise he

472
0:19:51.64,000 --> 0:19:56,000
doesn't like bad news he pushes it away

473
0:19:54.45,000 --> 0:20:01,000
but you know it's worth noting that he

474
0:19:57.58,000 --> 0:20:03,000
even dr. Anthony Fauci gave in

475
0:20:02.179,000 --> 0:20:05,000
views in which he said this is not

476
0:20:03.619,000 --> 0:20:07,000
really likely to be a concern for the

477
0:20:05.6,000 --> 0:20:09,000
United States so I think the way I would

478
0:20:08.36,000 --> 0:20:12,000
describe it is I think what happened is

479
0:20:10.34,000 --> 0:20:14,000
initially people looked at what happened

480
0:20:12.529,000 --> 0:20:15,000
in China and they thought because of

481
0:20:14.96,000 --> 0:20:17,000
what the Chinese had done it would stay

482
0:20:16.46,000 --> 0:20:21,000
contained in China with a little bit of

483
0:20:18.799,000 --> 0:20:22,000
leakage what they didn't realize was

484
0:20:21.499,000 --> 0:20:24,000
maybe that the Chinese had allowed

485
0:20:22.85,000 --> 0:20:25,000
international more international travel

486
0:20:24.799,000 --> 0:20:28,000
or they had locked down on domestic

487
0:20:26.69,000 --> 0:20:32,000
travel and so they were sort of

488
0:20:29.6,000 --> 0:20:34,000
under-reacting a little bit to what what

489
0:20:33.019,000 --> 0:20:38,000
was the real nature of the problem when

490
0:20:35.36,000 --> 0:20:4,000
it then came to Italy Italy was the

491
0:20:38.049,000 --> 0:20:43,000
pivotal moment I think when it explodes

492
0:20:41.059,000 --> 0:20:45,000
in Italy and that's when everyone starts

493
0:20:43.309,000 --> 0:20:46,000
panicking and you could even argue that

494
0:20:45.259,000 --> 0:20:48,000
maybe there was a slight overreaction

495
0:20:46.73,000 --> 0:20:49,000
and that's why you started seeing models

496
0:20:48.649,000 --> 0:20:51,000
that said two to three million people

497
0:20:50.119,000 --> 0:20:55,000
would die because people started using

498
0:20:52.49,000 --> 0:20:58,000
the Italian data which i think is very

499
0:20:55.389,000 --> 0:20:59,000
it's very complicated because Italians

500
0:20:58.549,000 --> 0:21:01,000
are the over your second oldest

501
0:21:00.23,000 --> 0:21:04,000
population in the world very high

502
0:21:01.94,000 --> 0:21:05,000
incidence of smoking very close

503
0:21:04.279,000 --> 0:21:1,000
intermingling into intergenerational

504
0:21:05.95,000 --> 0:21:12,000
living and it may not be representative

505
0:21:10.46,000 --> 0:21:18,000
but but I think that's what happened

506
0:21:13.21,000 --> 0:21:22,000
free talk about just that the partisan

507
0:21:18.83,000 --> 0:21:25,000
divide in so many countries and how you

508
0:21:22.669,000 --> 0:21:27,000
see this virus impacting that I mean

509
0:21:26.179,000 --> 0:21:3,000
yourself you know you work from CNN it's

510
0:21:28.009,000 --> 0:21:33,000
regarded on the right as as hopelessly

511
0:21:30.94,000 --> 0:21:34,000
liberal you've been criticized by people

512
0:21:33.259,000 --> 0:21:37,000
on the right you just criticized Trump

513
0:21:35.389,000 --> 0:21:4,000
right now and so you're right in the

514
0:21:38.179,000 --> 0:21:46,000
middle of this constant firestorm of of

515
0:21:41.23,000 --> 0:21:48,000
you know partisan battering is there and

516
0:21:46.61,000 --> 0:21:5,000
yet you you also spoke about some key

517
0:21:49.129,000 --> 0:21:52,000
things that the administration may have

518
0:21:51.169,000 --> 0:21:55,000
got right here in terms of or at least

519
0:21:52.789,000 --> 0:21:57,000
in partnership of Congress got right in

520
0:21:55.789,000 --> 0:21:59,000
terms of the stimulus that socially been

521
0:21:57.919,000 --> 0:22:02,000
greater than in other countries do you

522
0:22:00.769,000 --> 0:22:05,000
see coming away from the actual policy

523
0:22:03.139,000 --> 0:22:08,000
bit for a minute but just us talking

524
0:22:06.649,000 --> 0:22:08,000
with each other talking with people

525
0:22:08.179,000 --> 0:22:13,000
around the country and around the world

526
0:22:09.499,000 --> 0:22:14,000
is there any way that this moment

527
0:22:13.73,000 --> 0:22:16,000
somehow

528
0:22:15.03,000 --> 0:22:18,000
you since the partisan design divider is

529
0:22:16.95,000 --> 0:22:2,000
actually just ramping it up to ever more

530
0:22:18.69,000 --> 0:22:23,000
intense levels of the people who are

531
0:22:21.57,000 --> 0:22:25,000
disgusted by Trump and what he's done

532
0:22:24,000 --> 0:22:29,000
are probably more disgust and angry now

533
0:22:26.1,000 --> 0:22:31,000
than they have ever been and maybe the

534
0:22:29.76,000 --> 0:22:32,000
people who disgust her the people who

535
0:22:31.32,000 --> 0:22:34,000
are disgusted at Trump feel more

536
0:22:33.33,000 --> 0:22:36,000
strongly than ever is that is that is

537
0:22:35.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
there any end to this or are we just in

538
0:22:36.9,000 --> 0:22:4,000
for I don't know in the US for example

539
0:22:39.21,000 --> 0:22:43,000
the bloodiest election of all time and

540
0:22:41.82,000 --> 0:22:45,000
and and just in a possibly painful

541
0:22:43.74,000 --> 0:22:48,000
aftermath can there be any kind of path

542
0:22:46.29,000 --> 0:22:53,000
to both national unity and then you know

543
0:22:49.49,000 --> 0:22:55,000
international connection out of this I

544
0:22:54.05,000 --> 0:22:59,000
must go on behalf of a friend many

545
0:22:56.31,000 --> 0:23:01,000
friends you know I wish I could give you

546
0:22:59.88,000 --> 0:23:02,000
much solace but it's been striking

547
0:23:02.13,000 --> 0:23:06,000
hasn't it that if you go to if you look

548
0:23:03.84,000 --> 0:23:08,000
at this last month and a half what is

549
0:23:06.54,000 --> 0:23:1,000
most striking is how little Donald

550
0:23:09,000 --> 0:23:14,000
Trump's approval ratings have moved so

551
0:23:11.25,000 --> 0:23:15,000
if you look at you know other periods

552
0:23:14.07,000 --> 0:23:17,000
and what these kind of national crises

553
0:23:16.17,000 --> 0:23:21,000
what tends to happen is the president's

554
0:23:17.97,000 --> 0:23:22,000
approval ratings go way up you know a

555
0:23:21.39,000 --> 0:23:26,000
george HW bush after the fall of the

556
0:23:23.91,000 --> 0:23:28,000
berlin wall George W Bush after 9/11

557
0:23:26.54,000 --> 0:23:3,000
even Jimmy Carter the first months of

558
0:23:29.79,000 --> 0:23:32,000
the hostage crisis when the Iranians

559
0:23:31.47,000 --> 0:23:34,000
took American hostages his numbers went

560
0:23:33.78,000 --> 0:23:37,000
up because there's a rally around the

561
0:23:35.22,000 --> 0:23:4,000
flag it did happen for Trump for

562
0:23:38.25,000 --> 0:23:42,000
something like ten days and he's now

563
0:23:40.53,000 --> 0:23:44,000
back to approval rating such a roughly

564
0:23:42.75,000 --> 0:23:46,000
the same as where they were before so in

565
0:23:44.76,000 --> 0:23:48,000
other words what is striking about

566
0:23:47.28,000 --> 0:23:52,000
Donald Trump's approval ratings as a

567
0:23:49.65,000 --> 0:23:53,000
symbol for the partisan divide is how

568
0:23:52.41,000 --> 0:23:55,000
little they have moved one way or the

569
0:23:54.03,000 --> 0:23:57,000
other so it's that his supporters

570
0:23:55.89,000 --> 0:23:59,000
support him no matter what it's his

571
0:23:57.81,000 --> 0:24:03,000
opponents dislike him no matter what and

572
0:24:00.81,000 --> 0:24:05,000
you're right it's very hard to to bridge

573
0:24:04.29,000 --> 0:24:08,000
those divides look I try very hard to

574
0:24:06.33,000 --> 0:24:1,000
approach things from an analytic rather

575
0:24:08.37,000 --> 0:24:12,000
than a kind of polemical or partisan

576
0:24:10.86,000 --> 0:24:13,000
perspective so as you say when if the

577
0:24:13.32,000 --> 0:24:16,000
administration does something right I

578
0:24:14.61,000 --> 0:24:18,000
try to give them credit for it I I will

579
0:24:17.1,000 --> 0:24:2,000
point out I get pilloried on both sides

580
0:24:18.75,000 --> 0:24:24,000
by the way the the right doesn't you

581
0:24:21,000 --> 0:24:26,000
know doesn't accept the that the credit

582
0:24:25.23,000 --> 0:24:28,000
and the Left accuses me of being a

583
0:24:26.58,000 --> 0:24:31,000
traitor but my view is I'm

584
0:24:28.65,000 --> 0:24:33,000
I'm a journalist I I'm trying to be oh

585
0:24:31.64,000 --> 0:24:35,000
not objective no one is objective I'm

586
0:24:34.32,000 --> 0:24:37,000
trying to be analytic and that's my job

587
0:24:36.42,000 --> 0:24:4,000
so for example I'll give you one example

588
0:24:37.74,000 --> 0:24:41,000
I've been looking a lot at the testing

589
0:24:40.77,000 --> 0:24:44,000
data and it does appear that we have

590
0:24:42.54,000 --> 0:24:47,000
very bad data that we really need to get

591
0:24:44.97,000 --> 0:24:49,000
much better testing data and that the

592
0:24:47.58,000 --> 0:24:52,000
initial new data that we are getting

593
0:24:50.94,000 --> 0:24:53,000
that that on the basis of the more the

594
0:24:52.77,000 --> 0:24:56,000
more and more data we're getting it is

595
0:24:54.09,000 --> 0:24:59,000
it does look like the fatality rates are

596
0:24:56.82,000 --> 0:25:,000
much lower than we thought in other

597
0:24:59.46,000 --> 0:25:03,000
words that this disease might not be as

598
0:25:01.5,000 --> 0:25:05,000
fatal and what I find is when I talk to

599
0:25:04.11,000 --> 0:25:08,000
people everyone's trying to figure out

600
0:25:05.7,000 --> 0:25:09,000
in their heads does that mean that this

601
0:25:08.55,000 --> 0:25:11,000
is good for Trump is this bad for Trump

602
0:25:10.32,000 --> 0:25:14,000
is this what do you know where should I

603
0:25:12.24,000 --> 0:25:16,000
position myself on this and my feeling

604
0:25:14.55,000 --> 0:25:19,000
is this is just a you know a factual

605
0:25:17.22,000 --> 0:25:21,000
matter and more importantly we need to

606
0:25:19.86,000 --> 0:25:22,000
have the best data we need to know what

607
0:25:21.45,000 --> 0:25:25,000
the actual fatality rate is whatever

608
0:25:23.52,000 --> 0:25:27,000
then you know be mistakes people made in

609
0:25:25.53,000 --> 0:25:28,000
the past whatever the model said but

610
0:25:27.63,000 --> 0:25:3,000
it's very difficult to even take

611
0:25:29.07,000 --> 0:25:33,000
something like data and completely

612
0:25:31.29,000 --> 0:25:35,000
unhinge it from the partisan context in

613
0:25:33.9,000 --> 0:25:36,000
which everything is now viewed and that

614
0:25:36.18,000 --> 0:25:39,000
is part of a much larger discussion

615
0:25:37.89,000 --> 0:25:42,000
about how we have entered a realm of

616
0:25:39.74,000 --> 0:25:46,000
really a tribal identity politics where

617
0:25:42.96,000 --> 0:25:49,000
are our political views reflect us

618
0:25:47.66,000 --> 0:25:51,000
something very deep about our identity

619
0:25:50.25,000 --> 0:25:53,000
and therefore very hard to change

620
0:25:52.05,000 --> 0:25:55,000
they reflect who we are

621
0:25:53.55,000 --> 0:25:56,000
socioeconomically they reflect who we

622
0:25:55.47,000 --> 0:25:59,000
are culturally they reflect who we are

623
0:25:57.45,000 --> 0:26:03,000
in terms of our friends circle where we

624
0:25:59.67,000 --> 0:26:06,000
live so it's as you know mere data is

625
0:26:04.41,000 --> 0:26:08,000
not going to change that to take any

626
0:26:06.75,000 --> 0:26:11,000
solace from the fact that scientists are

627
0:26:09.36,000 --> 0:26:13,000
gaining in credibility and is it

628
0:26:12.45,000 --> 0:26:15,000
possible to imagine that in the in the

629
0:26:14.25,000 --> 0:26:19,000
coming years that people will actually

630
0:26:16.23,000 --> 0:26:2,000
pay more attention when scientists tell

631
0:26:19.62,000 --> 0:26:23,000
us that there's something big about

632
0:26:21.06,000 --> 0:26:26,000
coming we ought to pay attention to it I

633
0:26:24.08,000 --> 0:26:28,000
would hope so I mean I hope it makes us

634
0:26:26.79,000 --> 0:26:31,000
realize that in general we are you know

635
0:26:28.62,000 --> 0:26:34,000
I remember Michael Gove the British

636
0:26:31.91,000 --> 0:26:36,000
Minister one of Boris Johnson's

637
0:26:34.76,000 --> 0:26:39,000
associates saying during the brexit

638
0:26:37.44,000 --> 0:26:41,000
campaign the British public has had

639
0:26:39.96,000 --> 0:26:41,000
enough with experts and I remember

640
0:26:42.12,000 --> 0:26:44,000
thinking

641
0:26:42.57,000 --> 0:26:47,000
the time you know when Michael Gove gets

642
0:26:44.73,000 --> 0:26:49,000
ill I'm assuming he goes to a doctor it

643
0:26:47.7,000 --> 0:26:51,000
doesn't consult you know you know some

644
0:26:50.37,000 --> 0:26:54,000
guru or some or some that something like

645
0:26:52.41,000 --> 0:26:56,000
that he goes to somebody who's trained

646
0:26:54.66,000 --> 0:26:58,000
and has expertise in the field and those

647
0:26:56.64,000 --> 0:27:,000
are to evaluate data and I think what

648
0:26:59.61,000 --> 0:27:02,000
we're realizing here isn't that

649
0:27:00.9,000 --> 0:27:03,000
situations like this with all the

650
0:27:02.85,000 --> 0:27:06,000
caveats and with all the complications

651
0:27:04.59,000 --> 0:27:08,000
you need experts you need to rely on

652
0:27:06.99,000 --> 0:27:11,000
them and as you say criseyde what I hope

653
0:27:09.39,000 --> 0:27:11,000
is that it develop

654
0:27:12.57,000 --> 0:27:16,000
we have a slight live you know that it

655
0:27:14.52,000 --> 0:27:18,000
translates that if you believe the

656
0:27:16.8,000 --> 0:27:2,000
science and you and you trust the

657
0:27:18.6,000 --> 0:27:23,000
scientists and you think the data is

658
0:27:21.3,000 --> 0:27:26,000
getting better on this issue well maybe

659
0:27:24.12,000 --> 0:27:28,000
when they talk about climate change we

660
0:27:26.7,000 --> 0:27:29,000
should also be keeping in mind that the

661
0:27:28.8,000 --> 0:27:32,000
same thing is true and again that the

662
0:27:30.48,000 --> 0:27:34,000
data has been proving and reproving and

663
0:27:32.91,000 --> 0:27:34,000
confirming what they've been saying for

664
0:27:34.74,000 --> 0:27:38,000
twenty years now

665
0:27:35.7,000 --> 0:27:4,000
indeed let's wrap up with another

666
0:27:39.18,000 --> 0:27:43,000
question from from Whitney and our

667
0:27:40.95,000 --> 0:27:43,000
online audience sure the audience is

668
0:27:43.32,000 --> 0:27:46,000
very interested in what you're sharing

669
0:27:44.73,000 --> 0:27:47,000
here for read and there's one question

670
0:27:46.44,000 --> 0:27:49,000
that's really I'm simple which is just

671
0:27:48.24,000 --> 0:27:52,000
how do you see this changing I can't

672
0:27:50.19,000 --> 0:27:55,000
hear you

673
0:27:52.56,000 --> 0:27:56,000
I let me I should keep going Whitney

674
0:27:55.29,000 --> 0:27:59,000
because I can hear you and I will be the

675
0:27:56.88,000 --> 0:28:,000
translation here that strain that sounds

676
0:27:59.64,000 --> 0:28:02,000
perfect a little workaround yeah the

677
0:28:01.5,000 --> 0:28:03,000
question is just simply how do you see

678
0:28:02.85,000 --> 0:28:05,000
this changing the balance of power

679
0:28:04.14,000 --> 0:28:08,000
globally so the question was how do you

680
0:28:06.69,000 --> 0:28:13,000
see this changing the balance of power

681
0:28:08.4,000 --> 0:28:16,000
globally I think again if so much

682
0:28:14.31,000 --> 0:28:19,000
depends on how short this this process

683
0:28:17.37,000 --> 0:28:2,000
is and what it does but I'll tell you

684
0:28:19.59,000 --> 0:28:22,000
one of the first things that I've been

685
0:28:21.21,000 --> 0:28:25,000
seeing when I've talked to people all

686
0:28:23.28,000 --> 0:28:28,000
around the world when you read newspaper

687
0:28:25.8,000 --> 0:28:31,000
accounts of what is happening everyone

688
0:28:28.65,000 --> 0:28:33,000
has been stunned at the degree of chaos

689
0:28:31.89,000 --> 0:28:35,000
in the United States and the degree or

690
0:28:34.38,000 --> 0:28:38,000
you know the degree to which the health

691
0:28:36.03,000 --> 0:28:41,000
care system has proven to be inadequate

692
0:28:39.3,000 --> 0:28:42,000
we don't even know how many beds we have

693
0:28:41.25,000 --> 0:28:46,000
we don't know how many ventilators we

694
0:28:43.02,000 --> 0:28:49,000
have and that is I think it's a serious

695
0:28:46.56,000 --> 0:28:51,000
blow to America's image because people

696
0:28:49.94,000 --> 0:28:54,000
would think that the United States might

697
0:28:52.32,000 --> 0:28:56,000
not be you know the most beneficent

698
0:28:55.35,000 --> 0:28:58,000
power it may not

699
0:28:56.34,000 --> 0:28:59,000
you know it may do things that they

700
0:28:58.5,000 --> 0:29:01,000
would regard as crazy like invade Iraq

701
0:29:00.33,000 --> 0:29:04,000
but they always thought the American

702
0:29:01.83,000 --> 0:29:05,000
economy was the best the American

703
0:29:04.529,000 --> 0:29:07,000
technology was the best and so most

704
0:29:06.75,000 --> 0:29:09,000
people assumed American healthcare would

705
0:29:08.46,000 --> 0:29:12,000
be would be great I think what they saw

706
0:29:10.35,000 --> 0:29:14,000
was the crazy quilt patchwork of the

707
0:29:12.809,000 --> 0:29:18,000
American healthcare system with federal

708
0:29:15.09,000 --> 0:29:2,000
state local authorities competing if you

709
0:29:19.2,000 --> 0:29:22,000
know people don't even have the right

710
0:29:20.34,000 --> 0:29:24,000
data so that piece of American soft

711
0:29:23.159,000 --> 0:29:29,000
power if you will the example of

712
0:29:25.23,000 --> 0:29:31,000
American power has taken a beating the

713
0:29:29.58,000 --> 0:29:33,000
second and perhaps more important issue

714
0:29:31.289,000 --> 0:29:35,000
is that it's not so much what it does to

715
0:29:33.6,000 --> 0:29:39,000
American power it's what it does to the

716
0:29:35.37,000 --> 0:29:43,000
idea of common interests and and common

717
0:29:39.919,000 --> 0:29:44,000
objectives and common common policies so

718
0:29:44.13,000 --> 0:29:47,000
what has happened as I mentioned is

719
0:29:45.51,000 --> 0:29:48,000
everyone has retreated and it is

720
0:29:47.49,000 --> 0:29:51,000
pursuing things from their narrow

721
0:29:49.26,000 --> 0:29:54,000
self-interest whether it's the Italians

722
0:29:52.02,000 --> 0:29:57,000
the Germans the Chinese the South

723
0:29:54.87,000 --> 0:29:58,000
Koreans and of course the Americans it

724
0:29:57.149,000 --> 0:30:,000
is the biggest the greatest damage to

725
0:29:59.76,000 --> 0:30:02,000
the system is done by the Americans

726
0:30:01.14,000 --> 0:30:05,000
because we have traditionally been the

727
0:30:03.24,000 --> 0:30:07,000
world's leaders the organizers and

728
0:30:05.22,000 --> 0:30:08,000
things like that so but everywhere you

729
0:30:07.679,000 --> 0:30:1,000
are seeing a fraying of that

730
0:30:09.059,000 --> 0:30:13,000
international order a fraying of that

731
0:30:11.01,000 --> 0:30:15,000
sense of cooperation a fraying of the

732
0:30:13.919,000 --> 0:30:16,000
idea that there are common objectives

733
0:30:15.659,000 --> 0:30:19,000
the scientists to be and to be give them

734
0:30:17.82,000 --> 0:30:2,000
credit are working together the

735
0:30:19.86,000 --> 0:30:22,000
scientists have been sharing information

736
0:30:21.51,000 --> 0:30:24,000
American scientists Chinese scientists

737
0:30:23.58,000 --> 0:30:27,000
and you hear this everywhere European

738
0:30:25.02,000 --> 0:30:3,000
scientists if only the politicians could

739
0:30:27.72,000 --> 0:30:32,000
mirror the scientists to me this there's

740
0:30:30.659,000 --> 0:30:36,000
a kind of tragic irony here which is

741
0:30:33.02,000 --> 0:30:39,000
this is a global this is a classically

742
0:30:37.559,000 --> 0:30:42,000
global challenge right we are all in it

743
0:30:39.809,000 --> 0:30:43,000
together we face a common foe and we

744
0:30:42.63,000 --> 0:30:46,000
face and this is almost biblical in its

745
0:30:44.73,000 --> 0:30:49,000
nature we you know this is this would be

746
0:30:46.799,000 --> 0:30:51,000
the time to unite because this is a

747
0:30:50.34,000 --> 0:30:54,000
virus that does not discriminate on the

748
0:30:52.74,000 --> 0:30:55,000
basis of national boundaries on the

749
0:30:54.419,000 --> 0:30:58,000
basis of skin color on the basis of

750
0:30:56.279,000 --> 0:31:,000
wealth we're all in it together and

751
0:30:59.1,000 --> 0:31:03,000
therefore if we pool our resources and

752
0:31:01.169,000 --> 0:31:05,000
we would try to get a vaccine try to get

753
0:31:03.419,000 --> 0:31:08,000
a cure try to time the openings and

754
0:31:06.03,000 --> 0:31:1,000
closings the quarantines the reopening

755
0:31:08.73,000 --> 0:31:11,000
zuv travel all

756
0:31:10.169,000 --> 0:31:15,000
that would have happened much more

757
0:31:11.879,000 --> 0:31:16,000
effectively it would be a win-win-win if

758
0:31:15.179,000 --> 0:31:19,000
we could see that this is a global

759
0:31:17.73,000 --> 0:31:22,000
challenge been there for it would it

760
0:31:19.95,000 --> 0:31:24,000
would it necessitates a great global

761
0:31:23.07,000 --> 0:31:28,000
response but at that the same time

762
0:31:25.83,000 --> 0:31:29,000
because of the nature of this challenge

763
0:31:28.259,000 --> 0:31:32,000
because it involves our health our

764
0:31:30.779,000 --> 0:31:34,000
security perhaps we've become very

765
0:31:33.179,000 --> 0:31:37,000
narrow-minded and and drawn in I'm

766
0:31:35.46,000 --> 0:31:4,000
hoping that after the initial shock goes

767
0:31:38.07,000 --> 0:31:43,000
away people will realize that you know

768
0:31:41.369,000 --> 0:31:45,000
there really are such enormous benefits

769
0:31:43.799,000 --> 0:31:48,000
here to cooperating to doing this

770
0:31:46.32,000 --> 0:31:51,000
together to working with other countries

771
0:31:49.009,000 --> 0:31:54,000
and that at the end of the day what

772
0:31:51.45,000 --> 0:31:57,000
we're all looking for is health safety

773
0:31:54.779,000 --> 0:31:59,000
security so you know I'm an optimist so

774
0:31:58.379,000 --> 0:32:02,000
I do hope that at some point it we

775
0:32:00.269,000 --> 0:32:04,000
awakened this sense that you know and

776
0:32:03.059,000 --> 0:32:06,000
you think about the United States we've

777
0:32:04.32,000 --> 0:32:08,000
spent seven hundred billion dollars on

778
0:32:06.119,000 --> 0:32:1,000
defense every year and we don't have

779
0:32:08.7,000 --> 0:32:11,000
enough face masks for our health care

780
0:32:10.379,000 --> 0:32:14,000
workers we don't have enough ventilators

781
0:32:12.539,000 --> 0:32:16,000
for a critically ill yeah somewhere

782
0:32:14.73,000 --> 0:32:19,000
somewhere in there we have got to

783
0:32:16.739,000 --> 0:32:21,000
rethink our priorities well indeed

784
0:32:20.159,000 --> 0:32:25,000
in some ways it's very simple it's about

785
0:32:21.989,000 --> 0:32:25,000
math it's about science it's about a

786
0:32:25.35,000 --> 0:32:29,000
common enemy when you have a common

787
0:32:26.759,000 --> 0:32:31,000
enemy you kind of have to unite against

788
0:32:29.399,000 --> 0:32:34,000
it and I still the optimist in me is

789
0:32:32.239,000 --> 0:32:36,000
holding on to that possibility as well

790
0:32:34.619,000 --> 0:32:38,000
that eventually we'll all come around to

791
0:32:36.779,000 --> 0:32:39,000
that free thank you so much for the work

792
0:32:39.299,000 --> 0:32:41,000
you're doing for spending this time here

793
0:32:40.59,000 --> 0:32:45,000
now I do think the world needs more

794
0:32:42.029,000 --> 0:32:48,000
analytical journalists Whitney you got

795
0:32:45.84,000 --> 0:32:49,000
anything else as we wrap up here no I

796
0:32:48.119,000 --> 0:32:52,000
think if you can hear me now on the the

797
0:32:50.429,000 --> 0:32:53,000
audience has been just very the

798
0:32:52.83,000 --> 0:32:54,000
responding very positively in really

799
0:32:53.94,000 --> 0:32:56,000
receptive to what you've been saying so

800
0:32:55.23,000 --> 0:32:59,000
thank you so much for you for joining us

801
0:32:57.09,000 --> 0:33:02,000
today thank you but it really is my

802
0:32:59.82,000 --> 0:33:02,000
pleasure thank you for you take care

1
0:00:14.183,000 --> 0:00:17,000
A cold January day of 2005,

2
0:00:18.063,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I took one of my most important drives of my life.

3
0:00:23.117,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I was on this road in upstate New York,

4
0:00:28.021,000 --> 0:00:3,000
trying to find this old factory.

5
0:00:31.601,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The day before, I received a flyer in the mail

6
0:00:34.965,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that said, "Fully equipped yogurt plant for sale."

7
0:00:39.315,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I threw it in the garbage can.

8
0:00:42.038,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And 20 minutes later, I picked it up and called the number.

9
0:00:47.351,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The plant was 85 years old,

10
0:00:50.012,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and it was closing.

11
0:00:52.073,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So I decided to go see it.

12
0:00:55.97,000 --> 0:00:56,000
At this time,

13
0:00:57.22,000 --> 0:01:,000
I wasn't sure where this road or my life was going.

14
0:01:02.307,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I owned a small cheese shop

15
0:01:04.535,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but really hated business.

16
0:01:08.576,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But the hills and the roads and the smells are all familiar.

17
0:01:14.425,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I grew up in Turkey, in a similar environment,

18
0:01:18.271,000 --> 0:01:19,000
near the Kurdish mountains.

19
0:01:20.613,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My family made cheese and yogurt;

20
0:01:22.585,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I grew up listening to shepherd's stories.

21
0:01:25.882,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We didn't have much,

22
0:01:27.744,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but we had the moon and the stars, simple food, each other.

23
0:01:33.101,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Eventually, I came to America.

24
0:01:35.724,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I didn't even know New York had farms.

25
0:01:39.081,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I made it to upstate, and I never left.

26
0:01:43.121,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Now I'm lost.

27
0:01:46.641,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I passed the road sign that said "Dead end."

28
0:01:51.506,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Then soon after,

29
0:01:53.308,000 --> 0:01:54,000
there it was:

30
0:01:54.777,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the factory.

31
0:01:58.642,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The smell hit me first.

32
0:02:01.118,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It was a like a milk container left out in the sun.

33
0:02:05.228,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The walls were so thick,

34
0:02:08.061,000 --> 0:02:11,000
paints were peeling, there were cracks everywhere.

35
0:02:13.161,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The factory was so old, the owners thought it was worthless.

36
0:02:18.209,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I thought they left a zero off,

37
0:02:21.295,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I couldn't believe the price.

38
0:02:25.569,000 --> 0:02:26,000
As I entered in,

39
0:02:28.331,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I stopped noticing things.

40
0:02:32.125,000 --> 0:02:34,000
All I could see were the people.

41
0:02:35.897,000 --> 0:02:36,000
There were 55 of them.

42
0:02:38.976,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Just quiet.

43
0:02:40.738,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Their only job was to break the plant apart

44
0:02:44.683,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and close it forever.

45
0:02:47.875,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I was met with a guy named Rich,

46
0:02:51.044,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the production manager.

47
0:02:53.256,000 --> 0:02:55,000
He offered to take me around, show me around.

48
0:02:56.339,000 --> 0:02:57,000
He didn't say much,

49
0:02:57.53,000 --> 0:03:,000
but around every corner, he would point out some stories.

50
0:03:02.268,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Rich worked there for 20 years.

51
0:03:04.371,000 --> 0:03:06,000
His father made yogurt before him,

52
0:03:06.609,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and his grandfather made cream cheese before that.

53
0:03:10.855,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You could tell that Rich felt guilty

54
0:03:15.792,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that this factory was closing on his watch.

55
0:03:23.768,000 --> 0:03:25,000
What hit me the hardest at that time

56
0:03:27.442,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was that this wasn't just an old factory.

57
0:03:31.173,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This was a time machine.

58
0:03:33.836,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is where people built lives, they left for wars,

59
0:03:38.432,000 --> 0:03:4,000
they bragged about home runs and report cards.

60
0:03:42.091,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But now, it was closing.

61
0:03:45.064,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And the company wasn't just giving up on yogurt,

62
0:03:49.445,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it was giving up on them.

63
0:03:52.191,000 --> 0:03:53,000
As if they were not good enough.

64
0:03:56.567,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I was shocked how these people were behaving.

65
0:04:01.177,000 --> 0:04:03,000
There was no anger, there were no tears.

66
0:04:05.059,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Just silence.

67
0:04:06.522,000 --> 0:04:08,000
With grace, they were closing this factory.

68
0:04:13.212,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I was so angry

69
0:04:16.308,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that the CEO was far away,

70
0:04:20.522,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in a tower or somewhere,

71
0:04:22.84,000 --> 0:04:24,000
looking at the spreadsheets

72
0:04:25.069,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and closing the factory.

73
0:04:28.06,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Spreadsheets are lazy.

74
0:04:30.716,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They don't tell you about people, they don't tell you about communities.

75
0:04:34.541,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But unfortunately,

76
0:04:36.176,000 --> 0:04:39,000
this is how too many business decisions are made today.

77
0:04:44.659,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I was never the same person after what I saw.

78
0:04:48.318,000 --> 0:04:52,000
On my way back home, I called Mario, my lawyer.

79
0:04:54.454,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I called Mario, I said, "Mario, I want to buy this place."

80
0:04:59.51,000 --> 0:05:,000
Mario said,

81
0:05:00.963,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Hamdi, one of the largest food companies in the world is closing this place,

82
0:05:06.567,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and they're getting out of the yogurt business.

83
0:05:09.011,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Who the hell are you to make it work?"

84
0:05:12.432,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I said, "You're right."

85
0:05:14.559,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But the next day, I called him again,

86
0:05:16.411,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and I said, "Mario, really, I really want to buy this place."

87
0:05:19.577,000 --> 0:05:2,000
He said, "Hamdi, you have no money.

88
0:05:21.3,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:22.347,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You haven't even paid me in six months."

90
0:05:24.284,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:25.315,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Which was true.

92
0:05:26.498,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:28.268,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But I got a loan, another loan.

94
0:05:30.831,000 --> 0:05:34,000
By August 2005, I had the keys for this factory.

95
0:05:36.093,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The first thing I did was to hire four of the original 55 people.

96
0:05:40.215,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I had Maria, the office manager.

97
0:05:42.374,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I had Frank, the wastewater guy.

98
0:05:45.04,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I had Mike, the maintenance guy.

99
0:05:48.141,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And Rich, who showed me the plant, the production guy.

100
0:05:51.855,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And we had our first board meeting.

101
0:05:55.173,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Mike says, "Hamdi, what are we going to do now?"

102
0:05:58.133,000 --> 0:06:,000
They look at me as if I have the magic answer.

103
0:06:01.593,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So I said, "Mike,

104
0:06:03.974,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we're going to go to Ace Hardware store,

105
0:06:07.268,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and we're going to get some paints.

106
0:06:09.649,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And we're going to paint the walls outside."

107
0:06:13.217,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Mike wasn't impressed.

108
0:06:14.404,000 --> 0:06:15,000
He looked at me.

109
0:06:16.138,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He said, "Hamdi, that's fine, we’ll do that,

110
0:06:18.733,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but tell me you have more ideas than that."

111
0:06:20.779,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:23.419,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I said, "I do.

113
0:06:25.49,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We'll paint the walls white."

114
0:06:27.109,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:28.657,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Honest to God, that was the only idea I had.

116
0:06:30.919,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:34.133,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But we painted those walls that summer.

118
0:06:39.318,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I sometimes wonder

119
0:06:41.714,000 --> 0:06:44,000
what they would have said to me if I told them,

120
0:06:45.112,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"See these walls we're painting?

121
0:06:47.938,000 --> 0:06:48,000
In two years,

122
0:06:49.716,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we're going to launch a yogurt here

123
0:06:51.489,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that Americans have never seen and never tasted before.

124
0:06:54.382,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It will be delicious, it will be natural.

125
0:06:56.557,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we're going to call it 'Chobani' -- it means 'shepherd' in Turkish."

126
0:07:02.446,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And if I said,

127
0:07:04.446,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"We are going to hire all of the 55 employees back,

128
0:07:08.049,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or most of them back.

129
0:07:09.255,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And then 100 more after, and then 100 more after,

130
0:07:11.618,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and then 1,000 more after that."

131
0:07:13.245,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But if I told them, "You see that town over there?

132
0:07:16.038,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Every person we hire, 10 more local jobs will be created.

133
0:07:19.681,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The town will come back to life, the trucks will be all over the roads.

134
0:07:23.22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And the first money we make,

135
0:07:24.776,000 --> 0:07:27,000
we're going to build one of the best Little League baseball fields

136
0:07:28.463,000 --> 0:07:29,000
for our children.

137
0:07:30.323,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And five years after that,

138
0:07:32.082,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we're going to be the number one Greek yogurt brand in the country."

139
0:07:36.096,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Would they have believed me?

140
0:07:38.556,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Of course not.

141
0:07:41.104,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But that's exactly what happened.

142
0:07:43.673,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Applause)

143
0:07:50.085,000 --> 0:07:52,000
In painting those walls,

144
0:07:52.989,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we got to know each other.

145
0:07:55.442,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We believed in each other.

146
0:07:57.633,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And we figured it out together.

147
0:08:03.353,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Five years, me and all my colleagues, we never left the factory.

148
0:08:08.909,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We worked day and night, through the holidays,

149
0:08:12.776,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to fix that plant.

150
0:08:15.601,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The best part of Chobani for me is this:

151
0:08:18.958,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the same exact people who were given up on

152
0:08:22.53,000 --> 0:08:26,000
were the ones who built it back 100 times better than before.

153
0:08:28.389,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And they all have a financial stake in the company today.

154
0:08:32.579,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:38.491,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And all this time, I kept wondering --

156
0:08:40.913,000 --> 0:08:43,000
you see, I'm not a businessman, I don't come from that tradition --

157
0:08:44.174,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I just kept wondering: What is this all about?

158
0:08:49.287,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Corporate America says it's about profits.

159
0:08:52.222,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Mainstream business says it's about money.

160
0:08:54.604,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The CEO playbook says it's about shareholders.

161
0:08:57.514,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And so much is sacrificed for it -- it's factories, communities, jobs.

162
0:09:03.093,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But not by CEOs.

163
0:09:05.956,000 --> 0:09:07,000
CEOs have their employees suffer for them.

164
0:09:09.011,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But yet, the CEOs's pay goes up and up and up.

165
0:09:12.979,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And so many people are left behind.

166
0:09:17.227,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I'm here to tell you:

167
0:09:19.202,000 --> 0:09:2,000
no more.

168
0:09:20.83,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It's not right, it's never been right.

169
0:09:24.648,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's time to admit

170
0:09:26.795,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that the playbook that guided businesses and CEOs for the last 40 years

171
0:09:31.045,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is broken.

172
0:09:32.625,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Applause)

173
0:09:37.027,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It tells you everything about business

174
0:09:39.987,000 --> 0:09:42,000
except how to be a noble leader.

175
0:09:44.757,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We need a new playbook.

176
0:09:47.015,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We need a new playbook that sees people again.

177
0:09:50.95,000 --> 0:09:53,000
That sees above and beyond profits.

178
0:09:55.54,000 --> 0:10:,000
In the movies, they have a name for people who take a different path

179
0:10:00.603,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to do things right.

180
0:10:02.627,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They call them "antiheroes."

181
0:10:04.966,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I think we need the same idea in business.

182
0:10:07.8,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We need anti-CEOs, and we need an anti-CEO playbook.

183
0:10:11.403,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So let me tell you about what this anti-CEO playbook is all about.

184
0:10:16.712,000 --> 0:10:18,000
An anti-CEO playbook is about gratitude.

185
0:10:20.541,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Today's business book says:

186
0:10:22.517,000 --> 0:10:25,000
business exists to maximize profit for the shareholders.

187
0:10:27.929,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I think that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my life.

188
0:10:30.732,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

189
0:10:31.761,000 --> 0:10:35,000
In reality, business should take care of their employees first.

190
0:10:36.752,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Applause)

191
0:10:41.971,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You know, a few years ago,

192
0:10:43.256,000 --> 0:10:47,000
when we announced that we are giving shares to all our 2,000 employees,

193
0:10:47.622,000 --> 0:10:51,000
some people said it's PR, some said it's a gift.

194
0:10:52.23,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I said, it's not a gift.

195
0:10:55.341,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I watched it, I've been part of it.

196
0:10:57.896,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They earned it with their talent and with their hard work,

197
0:11:00.637,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and I don't see any other way.

198
0:11:03.315,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The new way of business --

199
0:11:05.331,000 --> 0:11:07,000
it's your employees you take care of first.

200
0:11:08.692,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Not the profits.

201
0:11:12.144,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The new anti-CEO playbook is about community.

202
0:11:17.359,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Today, the businesses that have it all

203
0:11:20.309,000 --> 0:11:24,000
ask communities, "What kind of tax breaks and incentives can you give me?"

204
0:11:26.132,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The reality is, businesses should go to the struggling communities

205
0:11:30.649,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and ask, "How can I help you?"

206
0:11:34.176,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Applause)

207
0:11:37.962,000 --> 0:11:39,000
When we wanted to build our second yogurt plant,

208
0:11:40.985,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Idaho was on nobody's radar screen.

209
0:11:43.784,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It was too rural, too far away, didn't have much incentives.

210
0:11:47.974,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So I went there.

211
0:11:50.014,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I met with the local people, I met with the farmers.

212
0:11:53.463,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We shook hands, we broke bread.

213
0:11:55.748,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I said, "I want to build it right here."

214
0:11:58.472,000 --> 0:12:,000
I don't need to see financial studies.

215
0:12:01.732,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And the result --

216
0:12:05.236,000 --> 0:12:06,000
its community is thriving.

217
0:12:07.204,000 --> 0:12:09,000
There's new schools that open every year.

218
0:12:10.101,000 --> 0:12:12,000
New food companies are coming up every year.

219
0:12:14.053,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And they told me,

220
0:12:15.228,000 --> 0:12:17,000
"You're not going to find any trained workers here."

221
0:12:17.704,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I said, "It's OK, we'll teach them."

222
0:12:19.641,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We partnered with the local community college,

223
0:12:22.919,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and while we were building the plant,

224
0:12:24.737,000 --> 0:12:27,000
we trained hundreds of hundreds of people for advanced manufacturing.

225
0:12:28.371,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And today, our factory is one of the largest yogurt plants in the world.

226
0:12:33.54,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

227
0:12:36.476,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The new way of business --

228
0:12:39.148,000 --> 0:12:4,000
communities.

229
0:12:40.515,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Go search for communities that you can be part of.

230
0:12:43.307,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Ask for permission.

231
0:12:45.338,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And be with them, open the walls and succeed together.

232
0:12:52.985,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The anti-CEO playbook is about responsibility.

233
0:12:57.033,000 --> 0:13:,000
Today's playbook says, the businesses should stay out of politics.

234
0:13:00.652,000 --> 0:13:01,000
The reality is

235
0:13:01.922,000 --> 0:13:04,000
businesses, as citizens, must take a side.

236
0:13:06.728,000 --> 0:13:1,000
When we were growing in New York and looking for more people to hire,

237
0:13:10.901,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I remembered that in Utica, an hour away,

238
0:13:15.917,000 --> 0:13:18,000
there were refugees from Southeast Asia and Africa,

239
0:13:19.71,000 --> 0:13:21,000
who were looking for a place to work.

240
0:13:23.518,000 --> 0:13:25,000
"They don't speak English," someone told me.

241
0:13:25.614,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I said, "I don't really, either. Let's get translators."

242
0:13:28.308,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Laughter)

243
0:13:31.327,000 --> 0:13:32,000
"They don't have transportation."

244
0:13:33.014,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I said, "Let's get buses, it's not a rocket science."

245
0:13:36.506,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Today,

246
0:13:39.339,000 --> 0:13:41,000
in one of America's rural areas,

247
0:13:42.22,000 --> 0:13:45,000
30 percent of the Chobani workforce are immigrants and refugees.

248
0:13:45.559,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Applause) (Cheers)

249
0:13:51.343,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And it changed us for better.

250
0:13:55.188,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The new way of business --

251
0:13:57.188,000 --> 0:14:01,000
it's business, not government, in the best position to make a change

252
0:14:01.546,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in today's world:

253
0:14:02.736,000 --> 0:14:05,000
in gun violence, in climate change,

254
0:14:06.014,000 --> 0:14:09,000
in income inequality, in refugees, in race.

255
0:14:09.741,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It's business that must take a side.

256
0:14:12.653,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Applause)

257
0:14:16.614,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And lastly, an anti-CEO playbook is about accountability.

258
0:14:23.546,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Today's playbook says, the CEO reports to the corporate boards.

259
0:14:28.181,000 --> 0:14:31,000
In my opinion, CEO reports to consumer.

260
0:14:32.401,000 --> 0:14:33,000
In the first few years of Chobani,

261
0:14:34.204,000 --> 0:14:37,000
the 1-800 number on the cup was my personal number.

262
0:14:38.052,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Laughter)

263
0:14:39.1,000 --> 0:14:42,000
When somebody called and wrote, I responded personally.

264
0:14:42.649,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Sometimes I made changes based on what I heard,

265
0:14:47.427,000 --> 0:14:49,000
because consumer is in power.

266
0:14:50.795,000 --> 0:14:52,000
That's the reason the business exists.

267
0:14:55.35,000 --> 0:15:,000
It's you -- every single one of you is in power to make changes today.

268
0:15:01.165,000 --> 0:15:03,000
If you don't like the brand and the companies,

269
0:15:03.347,000 --> 0:15:04,000
what they are doing with their business,

270
0:15:05.331,000 --> 0:15:06,000
you can throw them into the garbage can.

271
0:15:07.307,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And if you see the ones that are doing it right,

272
0:15:09.575,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you can reward them.

273
0:15:12.083,000 --> 0:15:15,000
In the end, this is all in our responsibility.

274
0:15:15.956,000 --> 0:15:16,000
The new way of business --

275
0:15:17.289,000 --> 0:15:2,000
it's the consumer we report to, not to the corporate boards.

276
0:15:21.019,000 --> 0:15:22,000
You see,

277
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
if you are right with your people,

278
0:15:27.276,000 --> 0:15:29,000
if you are right with your community,

279
0:15:29.983,000 --> 0:15:31,000
if you are right with your product,

280
0:15:32.634,000 --> 0:15:34,000
you will be more profitable,

281
0:15:34.967,000 --> 0:15:36,000
you will be more innovative,

282
0:15:37.023,000 --> 0:15:39,000
you will have more passionate people working for you

283
0:15:39.555,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and a community that supports you.

284
0:15:41.561,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And that's what the anti-CEO playbook is all about.

285
0:15:47.355,000 --> 0:15:5,000
The treasure that I found in that factory --

286
0:15:55.22,000 --> 0:15:57,000
dignity of work,

287
0:15:57.552,000 --> 0:15:58,000
strength of character,

288
0:15:59.476,000 --> 0:16:,000
human spirit --

289
0:16:01.212,000 --> 0:16:03,000
is what we need to unleash all across the world.

290
0:16:07.088,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Brothers and sisters,

291
0:16:09.874,000 --> 0:16:13,000
there are people and places all around the world

292
0:16:16.232,000 --> 0:16:17,000
left out and left behind.

293
0:16:19.193,000 --> 0:16:21,000
But their spirit is still strong.

294
0:16:24.49,000 --> 0:16:25,000
They just want another chance,

295
0:16:26.444,000 --> 0:16:29,000
they want someone to give them a chance again,

296
0:16:29.895,000 --> 0:16:32,000
not to just build it back, but build it better than before.

297
0:16:34.52,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And this is the difference between return on investment

298
0:16:39.362,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and return on kindness.

299
0:16:42.717,000 --> 0:16:46,000
This is the difference between profit

300
0:16:46.789,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and true wealth.

301
0:16:50.701,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And if it can happen

302
0:16:53.034,000 --> 0:16:56,000
in a small town in upstate New York and Idaho,

303
0:16:56.546,000 --> 0:17:,000
it can happen in every city and town and village across the world.

304
0:17:02.395,000 --> 0:17:04,000
This is not the time to build walls,

305
0:17:04.847,000 --> 0:17:06,000
this is a time to start painting the walls.

306
0:17:07.776,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I leave the colors all up to you.

307
0:17:09.625,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Thank you so much.

308
0:17:10.849,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Applause)

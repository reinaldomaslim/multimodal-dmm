1
0:00:12.863,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am so excited to be here.

2
0:00:15.876,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Everything in America is so much bigger than in Europe.

3
0:00:18.704,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Look at me -- I am huge!

4
0:00:20.7,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:22.385,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's fantastic!

6
0:00:23.559,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And TED Talks -- TED Talks are where everybody has great ideas.

7
0:00:26.863,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So the question is: Where do those great ideas come from?

8
0:00:30.284,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Well, it's a little bit of debate,

9
0:00:32.654,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but it's generally reckoned that the average person --

10
0:00:35.216,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that's me --

11
0:00:36.398,000 --> 0:00:38,000
has about 50,000 thoughts a day.

12
0:00:38.956,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Which is a lot,

13
0:00:40.138,000 --> 0:00:42,000
until you realize that 95 percent of them

14
0:00:42.988,000 --> 0:00:44,000
are the same ones you had the day before.

15
0:00:45.639,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:48.647,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?

17
0:00:51.279,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I think things like,

18
0:00:52.508,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"Oh! I know -- I must clean the floor.

19
0:00:55.617,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Oh! I forgot to walk the dog."

20
0:00:57.373,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My most popular:

21
0:00:58.679,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"Don't eat that cookie."

22
0:01:00.609,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:02.792,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So, 95 percent repetition.

24
0:01:06.567,000 --> 0:01:1,000
That leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day

25
0:01:10.908,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to actually think something new.

26
0:01:14.731,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And some of my new thoughts are useless.

27
0:01:16.697,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The other day I was watching some sports on television,

28
0:01:19.35,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I was trying to decide why I just don't engage with it.

29
0:01:23.1,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Some of it I find curious.

30
0:01:24.387,000 --> 0:01:25,000
This is odd.

31
0:01:25.983,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:28.362,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Do you think it would be worth being that flexible

33
0:01:30.789,000 --> 0:01:32,000
just to be able to see your heel at that angle?

34
0:01:33.065,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:37.511,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And here's the thing:

36
0:01:38.993,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I'm never going to be able to relate to that,

37
0:01:41.163,000 --> 0:01:43,000
because I'm never going to be able to do it, OK?

38
0:01:43.467,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Well, not twice, anyway.

39
0:01:45.309,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:49.133,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But I'll tell you the truth.

41
0:01:50.491,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The truth is I have never been any good at sport, OK?

42
0:01:53.318,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I've reached that wonderful age when all my friends say,

43
0:01:56.019,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Oh, I wish I was as fit as I was when I was 18."

44
0:01:59.245,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I always feel rather smug then.

45
0:02:01.41,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:05.051,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I'm exactly as fit as I was when I --

47
0:02:07.294,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:09.643,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Applause)

49
0:02:12.215,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I couldn't run then. I'm certainly not going to do it now.

50
0:02:15.053,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:16.1,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So then I had my new idea:

52
0:02:17.681,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Why not engage people like me in sport?

53
0:02:20.783,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I think what the world needs now

54
0:02:22.575,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is the Olympics for people with zero athletic ability.

55
0:02:26.521,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:28.761,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Oh, it would be so much more fun.

57
0:02:30.428,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We'd have three basic rules, OK?

58
0:02:32.062,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Obviously no drugs; no corruption, no skills.

59
0:02:35.163,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:36.227,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It would be --

61
0:02:37.404,000 --> 0:02:39,000
No, it's a terrible idea.

62
0:02:39.886,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And I also know why I don't engage with sport when I watch it on television.

63
0:02:44.062,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's because probably 97 percent of it is about men running

64
0:02:48.673,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and men kicking things,

65
0:02:50.223,000 --> 0:02:52,000
men trying to look neatly packaged in Lycra.

66
0:02:53.141,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There is --

67
0:02:54.324,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

68
0:02:56.406,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Not always successfully.

69
0:02:57.608,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There is --

70
0:02:58.784,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

71
0:02:59.84,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There is so little female sport on television,

72
0:03:04.097,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that a young woman watching might be forgiven for thinking,

73
0:03:07.002,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and how can I put this nicely,

74
0:03:08.583,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that the male member is the very lever you need

75
0:03:11.204,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to get yourself off the couch and onto a sports ground.

76
0:03:14.833,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:17.841,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The inequalities in sport are breathtaking.

78
0:03:21.83,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So this is what happens to me:

79
0:03:23.291,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I have a brand new idea,

80
0:03:24.475,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and immediately I come back to an old one.

81
0:03:27.217,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The fact is, there is not now,

82
0:03:29.329,000 --> 0:03:32,000
nor has there ever been in the whole of history,

83
0:03:32.776,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a single country in the world where women have equality with men.

84
0:03:38.666,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Not one.

85
0:03:39.86,000 --> 0:03:4,000
196 countries,

86
0:03:41.571,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it hasn't happened in the whole of evolution.

87
0:03:43.901,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So, here is a picture of evolution.

88
0:03:45.895,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

89
0:03:51.817,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We women are not even in it!

90
0:03:53.849,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

91
0:03:58.928,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's a wonder men have been able to evolve quite so brilliantly.

92
0:04:02.682,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So --

93
0:04:03.864,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:04.897,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It bugs me, and I know I should do something about it.

95
0:04:08.647,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But I'm busy, OK?

96
0:04:10.259,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I have a full-on career,

97
0:04:11.455,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I've got three kids, I've got an elderly mom.

98
0:04:13.619,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In fact, if I'm honest with you,

99
0:04:15.21,000 --> 0:04:16,000
one of the reasons I came out here

100
0:04:16.877,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is because TED Talks said I could have 15 minutes to myself,

101
0:04:19.751,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and I never have that much time --

102
0:04:21.516,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:23.909,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Applause)

104
0:04:29.466,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So I'm busy.

105
0:04:30.64,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And anyway, I already had a go at changing the world.

106
0:04:33.201,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Here's the thing, OK?

107
0:04:34.383,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Everybody has inside themselves what I call an "activation button."

108
0:04:37.563,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's the button that gets pressed when you think,

109
0:04:39.973,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"I must do something about this."

110
0:04:41.801,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.

111
0:04:44.047,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Maybe you face some kind of inequality,

112
0:04:45.977,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or you've come across an injustice of some kind,

113
0:04:48.277,000 --> 0:04:49,000
sometimes an illness strikes,

114
0:04:49.842,000 --> 0:04:51,000
or you're born in some way disadvantaged,

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
or perhaps underprivileged.

116
0:04:54.101,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I was born gay, OK?

117
0:04:56.03,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I've always known,

118
0:04:57.314,000 --> 0:05:,000
I don't think my family were the least bit surprised.

119
0:05:00.835,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Here is a picture of me aged four.

120
0:05:04.25,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I look cute,

121
0:05:05.425,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but inside I genuinely believed that I looked like Clint Eastwood.

122
0:05:08.6,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:15.907,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So my activation button was pressed when I had my kids --

124
0:05:18.889,000 --> 0:05:22,000
three wonderful kids, born to my then-partner.

125
0:05:22.919,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now here's the thing: I work on television in Britain.

126
0:05:25.474,000 --> 0:05:27,000
By the time they were born, I was already hosting my own shows

127
0:05:28.439,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and working in the public eye.

128
0:05:29.895,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I love what I do,

129
0:05:31.07,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but I love my kids more.

130
0:05:33.714,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And I didn't want them to grow up with a secret.

131
0:05:36.975,000 --> 0:05:39,000
1994, when my son, my youngest was born,

132
0:05:40.484,000 --> 0:05:42,000
there was not, as far as I was aware,

133
0:05:42.58,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a single out, gay woman in British public life.

134
0:05:47.622,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I don't think secrets are a good thing.

135
0:05:49.55,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I think they are a cancer of the soul.

136
0:05:51.517,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So I decided to come out.

137
0:05:54.108,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Everybody warned me that I would never work again,

138
0:05:56.506,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but I decided it was absolutely worth the risk.

139
0:06:00.578,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Well, it was hell.

140
0:06:02.598,000 --> 0:06:06,000
In Britain, we have a particularly vicious section of the right-wing press,

141
0:06:07.188,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and they went nuts.

142
0:06:08.775,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And their hatred stirred up the less stable elements of society,

143
0:06:13.23,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and we got death threats --

144
0:06:14.884,000 --> 0:06:16,000
enough death threats that I had to take the kids into hiding,

145
0:06:17.818,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and we had to have police protection.

146
0:06:20.766,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And I promise you there were many moments in the still of the night

147
0:06:25.144,000 --> 0:06:28,000
when I was terrified by what I had done.

148
0:06:28.913,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Eventually the dust settled.

149
0:06:30.481,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Against all expectation I carried on working,

150
0:06:33.832,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and my kids were and continue to be absolutely fantastic.

151
0:06:36.524,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I remember when my son was six, he had a friend over to play.

152
0:06:39.461,000 --> 0:06:41,000
They were in the next room; I could hear them chatting.

153
0:06:42.078,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The friend said to my son, "What's it like having two mums?"

154
0:06:44.935,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I was a little anxious to hear, so I leant in to hear and my son said,

155
0:06:48.253,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"It's fantastic, because if one of them's sick,

156
0:06:50.499,000 --> 0:06:52,000
you've still got another one to cook for you."

157
0:06:52.687,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

158
0:06:57.422,000 --> 0:07:,000
So my activation button for gay equality was pressed,

159
0:07:01.242,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and along with many, many others,

160
0:07:03.47,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I campaigned for years for gay rights,

161
0:07:05.915,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and in particular, the right to marry the person that I love.

162
0:07:09.106,000 --> 0:07:11,000
In the end, we succeeded.

163
0:07:11.21,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And in 2014, on the day that the law was changed,

164
0:07:14.85,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I married my wife, who I love very much, indeed.

165
0:07:18.02,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Applause)

166
0:07:22.265,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We didn't do it in a quiet way -- we did it on the stage

167
0:07:24.948,000 --> 0:07:25,000
at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

168
0:07:27.212,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It was a great event.

169
0:07:28.391,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The hall seats two-and-a-half thousand people.

170
0:07:30.567,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We invited 150 family and friends, then I let it be known to the public:

171
0:07:34.164,000 --> 0:07:37,000
anybody who wanted to come and celebrate, please come and join us.

172
0:07:37.401,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It would be free to anybody who wanted to come.

173
0:07:39.65,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Two-and-half thousand people turned up.

174
0:07:41.796,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Applause)

175
0:07:46.192,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Every kind of person you can imagine:

176
0:07:48.02,000 --> 0:07:5,000
gays, straights, rabbis, nuns, married people,

177
0:07:50.644,000 --> 0:07:52,000
black, white -- the whole of humanity was there.

178
0:07:53.223,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And I remember standing on that stage thinking, "How fantastic.

179
0:07:57.31,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Job done.

180
0:07:58.58,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Love triumphs.

181
0:07:59.967,000 --> 0:08:,000
Law changed."

182
0:08:01.403,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And I --

183
0:08:02.585,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Applause)

184
0:08:05.961,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I genuinely thought my activation days were over, OK?

185
0:08:08.672,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So every year in that same hall,

186
0:08:11.109,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I host a fantastic concert to celebrate International Women's Day.

187
0:08:15.805,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We gather the world's only all-female orchestra,

188
0:08:19.003,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we play fantastic music by forgotten or overlooked women composers,

189
0:08:22.816,000 --> 0:08:23,000
we have amazing conductors --

190
0:08:24.252,000 --> 0:08:26,000
it's Marin Alsop there from Baltimore conducting,

191
0:08:26.57,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Petula Clark singing --

192
0:08:27.756,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and I give a lecture on women's history.

193
0:08:31.02,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I love to gather inspirational stories from the past and pass them on.

194
0:08:34.869,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Too often, I think history's what I call the Mount Rushmore model.

195
0:08:38.717,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It looks majestic, but the women have been entirely left out of it.

196
0:08:43.663,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And I was giving a talk in 2015 about the suffragettes --

197
0:08:47.118,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I'm sure you know those magnificent women who fought so hard

198
0:08:50.797,000 --> 0:08:53,000
for the right for women in Britain to vote.

199
0:08:53.931,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And their slogan was: "Deeds, not words."

200
0:08:57.29,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And boy, they succeeded,

201
0:08:58.564,000 --> 0:09:,000
because women did indeed get the vote in 1928.

202
0:09:01.468,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So I'm giving this talk about this,

203
0:09:03.246,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and as I'm talking, what I realized is:

204
0:09:05.866,000 --> 0:09:07,000
this was not a history lecture I was giving;

205
0:09:08.202,000 --> 0:09:1,000
this was not something where the job was done.

206
0:09:11.099,000 --> 0:09:14,000
This was something where there was so much left to do.

207
0:09:14.37,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Nowhere in the world, for example,

208
0:09:16.35,000 --> 0:09:19,000
do women have equal representation in positions of power.

209
0:09:20.291,000 --> 0:09:23,000
OK, let's take a very quick look at the top 100 companies

210
0:09:23.553,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in the London Stock Exchange in 2016.

211
0:09:26.244,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Top 100 companies: How many women running them?

212
0:09:30.191,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Seven. OK. Seven. That's all right, I suppose.

213
0:09:32.651,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Until you realize that 17 are run by men called "John."

214
0:09:37.436,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

215
0:09:49.321,000 --> 0:09:52,000
There are more men called John running FTSE 100 companies --

216
0:09:53.269,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

217
0:09:55.183,000 --> 0:09:56,000
than there are women.

218
0:09:57.25,000 --> 0:09:59,000
There are 14 run by men called "Dave."

219
0:09:59.494,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

220
0:10:03.06,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now, I'm sure Dave and John are doing a bang-up job.

221
0:10:05.7,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter)

222
0:10:07.012,000 --> 0:10:08,000
OK. Why does it matter?

223
0:10:08.886,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Well, it's that pesky business of the gender pay gap.

224
0:10:13.209,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men.

225
0:10:17.146,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And that is never going to change

226
0:10:19.102,000 --> 0:10:22,000
unless we have more women at the top in the boardroom.

227
0:10:22.749,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We have plenty of laws;

228
0:10:24.159,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the Equal Pay Act in Britain was passed in 1975.

229
0:10:28.563,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Nevertheless, there are still many, many women

230
0:10:31.144,000 --> 0:10:34,000
who, from early November until the end of the year,

231
0:10:34.205,000 --> 0:10:36,000
by comparison to their male colleagues,

232
0:10:36.416,000 --> 0:10:38,000
are effectively working for free.

233
0:10:39.64,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In fact, the World Economic Forum estimates

234
0:10:42.112,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that women will finally get equal pay in ...

235
0:10:44.938,000 --> 0:10:45,000
2133!

236
0:10:47.901,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Yay!

237
0:10:49.577,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

238
0:10:55.206,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That's a terrible figure.

239
0:10:56.672,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And here's the thing:

240
0:10:57.916,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the day before I came out to give my talk,

241
0:11:00.032,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the World Economic Forum revised it.

242
0:11:01.808,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So that's good, because that's a terrible -- 2133.

243
0:11:04.192,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Do you know what they revised it to?

244
0:11:05.941,000 --> 0:11:06,000
2186.

245
0:11:07.155,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Laughter)

246
0:11:09.434,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Yeah, another 53 years, OK?

247
0:11:12.365,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We are not going to get equal pay

248
0:11:14.744,000 --> 0:11:17,000
in my grandchildren's grandchildren's lives

249
0:11:17.921,000 --> 0:11:18,000
under the current system.

250
0:11:19.327,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And I have waited long enough.

251
0:11:22.208,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I've waited long enough in my own business.

252
0:11:24.296,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In 2016 I became the very first woman on British television

253
0:11:28.334,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to host a prime-time panel show.

254
0:11:30.97,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Isn't that great? Wonderful, I'm thrilled.

255
0:11:33.03,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But --

256
0:11:34.205,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

257
0:11:36.693,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But 2016! The first!

258
0:11:38.873,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Television's been around for 80 years!

259
0:11:40.859,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter)

260
0:11:41.895,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It may be television's not so important,

261
0:11:43.867,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?

262
0:11:45.834,000 --> 0:11:49,000
2016, the UN were looking for a brand new ambassador

263
0:11:49.861,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to represent women's empowerment and gender equality,

264
0:11:52.676,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and who did they choose?

265
0:11:54.522,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Wonder Woman.

266
0:11:56.311,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK?

267
0:11:59.646,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Laughter)

268
0:12:01.181,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Because no woman was up to the job.

269
0:12:05.718,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The representation of women in positions of power is shockingly low.

270
0:12:10.306,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's true in Congress, and it's certainly true in the British Parliament.

271
0:12:13.807,000 --> 0:12:17,000
In 2015, the number of men elected to the Parliament that year

272
0:12:18.222,000 --> 0:12:2,000
was greater than the total number of women

273
0:12:21.127,000 --> 0:12:24,000
who have ever been members of Parliament.

274
0:12:24.231,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And why does it matter?

275
0:12:25.414,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Here's the thing: if they're not at the table --

276
0:12:27.701,000 --> 0:12:3,000
literally, in Britain, at that table helping to make the laws --

277
0:12:30.821,000 --> 0:12:34,000
do not be surprised if the female perspective is overlooked.

278
0:12:35.416,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's a great role model for young people to see a woman in charge.

279
0:12:38.772,000 --> 0:12:41,000
In 2016, Britain got its second female Prime Minister;

280
0:12:41.885,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Theresa May came to power.

281
0:12:43.548,000 --> 0:12:45,000
The day she came to power she was challenged:

282
0:12:45.776,000 --> 0:12:46,000
just do one thing.

283
0:12:46.994,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Do one thing in the first 100 days that you're in office

284
0:12:50.006,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to try and improve lives for women in Britain.

285
0:12:52.971,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And what did she do? Nothing.

286
0:12:55.134,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Nothing.

287
0:12:56.317,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Because she's much too busy cleaning up the mess the boys made.

288
0:13:00.492,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Even having a female leader,

289
0:13:02.389,000 --> 0:13:04,000
they always find something better to do

290
0:13:05.407,000 --> 0:13:08,000
than to sort out the pesky issue of inequality.

291
0:13:08.718,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So I keep talking about equality like it matters. Does it?

292
0:13:11.584,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Well, let's take a very quick look at the STEM industries, OK?

293
0:13:14.905,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

294
0:13:17.496,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Pretty much important in every single aspect of our daily lives.

295
0:13:22.137,000 --> 0:13:28,000
There is the thickest and most incredibly well-documented glass ceiling

296
0:13:28.465,000 --> 0:13:29,000
in the STEM industries.

297
0:13:30.504,000 --> 0:13:31,000
What if the cure for cancer

298
0:13:32.512,000 --> 0:13:33,000
or the answer the global warming

299
0:13:34.137,000 --> 0:13:38,000
lies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress?

300
0:13:39.721,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So I thought all these things,

301
0:13:42.577,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words."

302
0:13:47.968,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And I spoke to my wonderful friend,

303
0:13:49.963,000 --> 0:13:51,000
brilliant journalist Catherine Mayer in Britain,

304
0:13:52.714,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and we rather foolishly --

305
0:13:54.188,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and I suspect there was wine involved --

306
0:13:57.414,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Laughter)

307
0:13:59.192,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We decided to found a brand new political party.

308
0:14:02.861,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Because here's the critical thing:

309
0:14:04.511,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the one place women and men are absolutely equal is at the ballot box.

310
0:14:09.804,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We had no idea what we were doing,

311
0:14:11.449,000 --> 0:14:14,000
we didn't know how complicated it was to start a political party.

312
0:14:14.571,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I thought, "It can't be that difficult, men have been doing it for years."

313
0:14:18.13,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Laughter)

314
0:14:20.311,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So we started by calling it "The Women's Equality Party."

315
0:14:26.143,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And straightaway people said to me,

316
0:14:27.868,000 --> 0:14:28,000
"Why did you call it that?"

317
0:14:29.84,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I said, "I don't know, I just thought we'd be clear."

318
0:14:32.946,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Laughter)

319
0:14:39.878,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I didn't want what we were doing to be a secret, you know? I just --

320
0:14:43.331,000 --> 0:14:44,000
(Laughter)

321
0:14:44.648,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Some people said, "You can't call it that! It's much too feminist!"

322
0:14:47.898,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Ooh! Scary word! Ahh!

323
0:14:50.149,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I can't tell you how many times I've heard somebody say,

324
0:14:53.28,000 --> 0:14:55,000
"I'm not a feminist, but ..."

325
0:14:55.829,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And I always think if there's a "but" in the sentence,

326
0:14:58.464,000 --> 0:14:59,000
it can't all be roses in the garden.

327
0:15:00.611,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And then I started getting asked the hilarious question,

328
0:15:03.285,000 --> 0:15:04,000
"Are you all going to burn your bras?"

329
0:15:05.966,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Yes! Because bras are famously made of flammable material.

330
0:15:09.605,000 --> 0:15:1,000
(Laughter)

331
0:15:12.032,000 --> 0:15:14,000
That's why all women spark when they walk.

332
0:15:14.874,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Laughter)

333
0:15:19.738,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Here's quick history sidebar for you:

334
0:15:23.062,000 --> 0:15:25,000
no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.

335
0:15:25.621,000 --> 0:15:26,000
It's a story made up by a journalist.

336
0:15:27.467,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank goodness journalism has improved since then.

337
0:15:30.116,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So --

338
0:15:31.295,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Laughter)

339
0:15:33.018,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview,

340
0:15:35.96,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and straightaway, the emails started coming.

341
0:15:38.086,000 --> 0:15:4,000
First hundreds, then thousands and thousands,

342
0:15:40.353,000 --> 0:15:43,000
from every age group: from the very young to women in their '90s,

343
0:15:44.177,000 --> 0:15:45,000
to hundreds of wonderful men.

344
0:15:45.583,000 --> 0:15:47,000
People wrote and said, "Please, can I help?

345
0:15:47.619,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Please, can I visit you at party headquarters?"

346
0:15:49.859,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We didn't have a headquarters -- we didn't have a party!

347
0:15:52.551,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We didn't have anything.

348
0:15:53.773,000 --> 0:15:56,000
All we had was a wonderful, tight group of fabulous friends

349
0:15:57.696,000 --> 0:16:01,000
trying to answer emails pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.

350
0:16:03.091,000 --> 0:16:04,000
We were all busy.

351
0:16:04.266,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Many of us had careers, many of us had children,

352
0:16:06.576,000 --> 0:16:08,000
but we did what women do, and we shared the work.

353
0:16:09.335,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And almost instantly, we agreed on certain fundamental things.

354
0:16:12.797,000 --> 0:16:15,000
First thing: we want to be the only political party in the world

355
0:16:16.313,000 --> 0:16:18,000
whose main aim was to no longer need to exist.

356
0:16:19.042,000 --> 0:16:2,000
That's a fantastic idea.

357
0:16:20.871,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning.

358
0:16:24.725,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We wanted people from the left, from the right, from the middle,

359
0:16:27.846,000 --> 0:16:28,000
every age group.

360
0:16:29.022,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Because the whole point was to work with a simple agenda:

361
0:16:31.861,000 --> 0:16:34,000
let's get equality in every aspect of our lives,

362
0:16:35.104,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and when we're finished,

363
0:16:36.284,000 --> 0:16:38,000
let's go home and get the other chores done.

364
0:16:38.543,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Laughter)

365
0:16:39.649,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And we wanted to change how politics is conducted.

366
0:16:42.08,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I don't know if you have this,

367
0:16:43.587,000 --> 0:16:45,000
but in Britain we have two major political parties.

368
0:16:46.048,000 --> 0:16:47,000
They're the dinosaurs of politics.

369
0:16:47.72,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And how they speak to each other is shameful and poisonous.

370
0:16:51.735,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I'm sure you've never had that kind of name-calling --

371
0:16:54.377,000 --> 0:16:55,000
(Laughter)

372
0:16:56.546,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And lying here.

373
0:16:59.067,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Wouldn't it be great if just one politician said,

374
0:17:01.46,000 --> 0:17:02,000
"Do you know, my opponent has a point.

375
0:17:03.379,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Let's see if we can't work together and get the job done."

376
0:17:06.802,000 --> 0:17:1,000
(Applause)

377
0:17:13.163,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And let's get more women into politics, OK?

378
0:17:15.6,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Let's immediately get more women into politics

379
0:17:17.798,000 --> 0:17:2,000
by being the only political party to offer free childcare to our candidates,

380
0:17:21.508,000 --> 0:17:23,000
so they can get out of the house and start campaigning.

381
0:17:24.205,000 --> 0:17:26,000
(Applause)

382
0:17:27.596,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Within 10 months,

383
0:17:30.046,000 --> 0:17:33,000
we had more than 70 branches of our party across the UK.

384
0:17:34.018,000 --> 0:17:37,000
We stood candidates for election in London, Scotland and Wales

385
0:17:37.201,000 --> 0:17:38,000
in May 2016.

386
0:17:38.789,000 --> 0:17:41,000
One in 20 people voted for our candidate for London Mayor.

387
0:17:42.358,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And when the men in the race saw how many votes we were attracting,

388
0:17:47.575,000 --> 0:17:48,000
wonder of wonders,

389
0:17:48.773,000 --> 0:17:52,000
they began to talk about the need to tackle gender equality.

390
0:17:53.127,000 --> 0:17:56,000
(Applause)

391
0:17:59.588,000 --> 0:18:01,000
You know, I've been promised change since I was a child.

392
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
It was always coming:

393
0:18:03.341,000 --> 0:18:05,000
women were going to stand shoulder to shoulder with men.

394
0:18:06.063,000 --> 0:18:08,000
All I got were empty promises and disappointment --

395
0:18:08.57,000 --> 0:18:11,000
enough disappointment to found a political party.

396
0:18:11.964,000 --> 0:18:14,000
But here is my new idea for today -- this is my five percent, OK?

397
0:18:15.094,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And this one is really good.

398
0:18:16.717,000 --> 0:18:18,000
The fact is, this is not enough.

399
0:18:19.487,000 --> 0:18:24,000
It is not enough to found one political party for equality in a single country.

400
0:18:24.573,000 --> 0:18:28,000
What we need is a seismic change in the global political landscape.

401
0:18:29.144,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And the wonderful thing about the model we have created

402
0:18:31.862,000 --> 0:18:32,000
is that it would work anywhere.

403
0:18:33.761,000 --> 0:18:34,000
It would work in America,

404
0:18:35.445,000 --> 0:18:37,000
it would work in Australia, it would work in India.

405
0:18:37.863,000 --> 0:18:39,000
It's like we've made the perfect recipe: anybody can cook it,

406
0:18:40.794,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and it's good for everybody.

407
0:18:42.214,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And we want to give it away.

408
0:18:43.861,000 --> 0:18:45,000
If you want to know what we did, we're giving it away.

409
0:18:46.603,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Can you imagine if we could mobilize millions of women across the world

410
0:18:52.241,000 --> 0:18:55,000
to say, "That's enough!" to the traditional battles of politics?

411
0:18:55.583,000 --> 0:18:58,000
To say, "Stop the bickering, let's get the work done."

412
0:18:58.641,000 --> 0:19:01,000
We could literally change the world.

413
0:19:01.972,000 --> 0:19:02,000
And I want that.

414
0:19:03.413,000 --> 0:19:06,000
(Applause)

415
0:19:08.707,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I want ...

416
0:19:10.104,000 --> 0:19:11,000
(Applause)

417
0:19:12.044,000 --> 0:19:14,000
I want that for our daughters,

418
0:19:14.538,000 --> 0:19:15,000
and I want it for our sons.

419
0:19:16.065,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Because the fact is: equality is better for everyone.

420
0:19:20.481,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Come on people, let's activate! Let's change the world!

421
0:19:23.436,000 --> 0:19:25,000
I know we can do it, and it wants doing!

422
0:19:26.316,000 --> 0:19:3,000
(Applause)

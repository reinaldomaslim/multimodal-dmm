1
0:00:12.454,000 --> 0:00:18,000
On June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33

2
0:00:18.966,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in a balmy winter afternoon in São Paulo, Brazil,

3
0:00:23.106,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a typical South American winter afternoon,

4
0:00:26.632,000 --> 0:00:28,000
this kid, this young man that you see celebrating here

5
0:00:29.612,000 --> 0:00:3,000
like he had scored a goal,

6
0:00:31.131,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Juliano Pinto, 29 years old, accomplished a magnificent deed.

7
0:00:38.102,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Despite being paralyzed

8
0:00:40.182,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and not having any sensation from mid-chest to the tip of his toes

9
0:00:45.163,000 --> 0:00:49,000
as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother

10
0:00:49.693,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair,

11
0:00:57.187,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Juliano rose to the occasion, and on this day did something

12
0:01:02.217,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that pretty much everybody that saw him in the six years deemed impossible.

13
0:01:09.062,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick

14
0:01:14.394,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of the 2014 Brazilian World Soccer Cup here

15
0:01:20.41,000 --> 0:01:21,000
just by thinking.

16
0:01:22.82,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He could not move his body,

17
0:01:24.697,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball.

18
0:01:29.584,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He was an athlete before the lesion. He's a para-athlete right now.

19
0:01:32.838,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He's going to be in the Paralympic Games, I hope, in a couple years.

20
0:01:36.3,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But what the spinal cord lesion did not rob from Juliano

21
0:01:40.882,000 --> 0:01:43,000
was his ability to dream.

22
0:01:43.883,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And dream he did that afternoon, for a stadium of about 75,000 people

23
0:01:49.933,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and an audience of close to a billion watching on TV.

24
0:01:54.424,000 --> 0:02:,000
And that kick crowned, basically, 30 years of basic research

25
0:02:00.725,000 --> 0:02:02,000
studying how the brain,

26
0:02:02.972,000 --> 0:02:05,000
how this amazing universe that we have between our ears

27
0:02:06.699,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that is only comparable to universe that we have above our head

28
0:02:10.795,000 --> 0:02:12,000
because it has about 100 billion elements

29
0:02:13.561,000 --> 0:02:15,000
talking to each other through electrical brainstorms,

30
0:02:16.263,000 --> 0:02:21,000
what Juliano accomplished took 30 years to imagine in laboratories

31
0:02:21.504,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and about 15 years to plan.

32
0:02:24.107,000 --> 0:02:28,000
When John Chapin and I, 15 years ago, proposed in a paper

33
0:02:28.606,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface,

34
0:02:33.788,000 --> 0:02:35,000
meaning connecting a brain to devices

35
0:02:36.745,000 --> 0:02:39,000
so that animals and humans could just move these devices,

36
0:02:40.289,000 --> 0:02:41,000
no matter how far they are from their own bodies,

37
0:02:42.14,000 --> 0:02:44,000
just by imagining what they want to do,

38
0:02:44.726,000 --> 0:02:48,000
our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help,

39
0:02:49.313,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of the psychiatry variety.

40
0:02:52.01,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And despite that, a Scot and a Brazilian persevered,

41
0:02:57.456,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because that's how we were raised in our respective countries,

42
0:03:02.471,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and for 12, 15 years,

43
0:03:04.607,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible.

44
0:03:08.996,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And a brain-machine interface is not rocket science,

45
0:03:11.445,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it's just brain research.

46
0:03:13.171,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's nothing but using sensors

47
0:03:16.418,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing

48
0:03:19.965,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to generate the motor commands

49
0:03:21.971,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord,

50
0:03:24.184,000 --> 0:03:26,000
so we projected sensors that can read

51
0:03:26.847,000 --> 0:03:29,000
hundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously,

52
0:03:30.362,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and extract from these electrical signals

53
0:03:33.408,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the motor planning that the brain is generating

54
0:03:36.293,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to actually make us move into space.

55
0:03:39.256,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And by doing that, we converted these signals into digital commands

56
0:03:42.942,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that any mechanical, electronic, or even a virtual device can understand

57
0:03:47.934,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so that the subject can imagine what he, she or it wants to make move,

58
0:03:54.49,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and the device obeys that brain command.

59
0:03:57.941,000 --> 0:04:,000
By sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors,

60
0:04:01.845,000 --> 0:04:02,000
as you are going to see in a moment,

61
0:04:03.63,000 --> 0:04:06,000
we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm

62
0:04:07.099,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that that voluntary motor will was being enacted, no matter where --

63
0:04:11.054,000 --> 0:04:16,000
next to the subject, next door, or across the planet.

64
0:04:16.429,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And as this message gave feedback back to the brain,

65
0:04:19.67,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the brain realized its goal: to make us move.

66
0:04:23.888,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago,

67
0:04:27.346,000 --> 0:04:29,000
where a monkey, without moving its body,

68
0:04:29.673,000 --> 0:04:33,000
learned to control the movements of an avatar arm,

69
0:04:33.777,000 --> 0:04:35,000
a virtual arm that doesn't exist.

70
0:04:35.823,000 --> 0:04:38,000
What you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey

71
0:04:39.025,000 --> 0:04:43,000
as it explores three different visually identical spheres

72
0:04:43.429,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in virtual space.

73
0:04:45.088,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And to get a reward, a drop of orange juice that monkeys love,

74
0:04:49.13,000 --> 0:04:52,000
this animal has to detect, select one of these objects

75
0:04:52.942,000 --> 0:04:53,000
by touching,

76
0:04:54.703,000 --> 0:04:55,000
not by seeing it, by touching it,

77
0:04:56.355,000 --> 0:04:59,000
because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects,

78
0:04:59.4,000 --> 0:05:02,000
an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal

79
0:05:02.483,000 --> 0:05:06,000
describing the fine texture of the surface of this object,

80
0:05:06.876,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so the animal can judge what is the correct object that he has to grab,

81
0:05:10.774,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and if he does that, he gets a reward without moving a muscle.

82
0:05:16.018,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The perfect Brazilian lunch:

83
0:05:18.498,000 --> 0:05:21,000
not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice.

84
0:05:22.213,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So as we saw this happening,

85
0:05:25.017,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published 15 years ago.

86
0:05:29.962,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We reenacted this paper.

87
0:05:31.991,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We got it out of the drawers,

88
0:05:33.96,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed

89
0:05:37.887,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to actually use the brain-machine interface to regain mobility.

90
0:05:42.19,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The idea was that if you suffered --

91
0:05:44.368,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and that can happen to any one of us.

92
0:05:46.641,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Let me tell you, it's very sudden.

93
0:05:48.653,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's a millisecond of a collision,

94
0:05:50.378,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a car accident that transforms your life completely.

95
0:05:53.84,000 --> 0:05:55,000
If you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord,

96
0:05:56.697,000 --> 0:05:59,000
you cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles.

97
0:06:00.08,000 --> 0:06:04,000
However, your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head.

98
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Paraplegic, quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night.

99
0:06:08.245,000 --> 0:06:1,000
They have that inside their head.

100
0:06:10.397,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The problem is how to get that code out of it

101
0:06:13.738,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and make the movement be created again.

102
0:06:16.662,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So what we proposed was, let's create a new body.

103
0:06:19.883,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Let's create a robotic vest.

104
0:06:21.619,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking,

105
0:06:26.462,000 --> 0:06:3,000
because he was wearing the first brain-controlled robotic vest

106
0:06:30.781,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that can be used by paraplegic, quadriplegic patients to move

107
0:06:34.06,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and to regain feedback.

108
0:06:35.871,000 --> 0:06:37,000
That was the original idea, 15 years ago.

109
0:06:38.768,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What I'm going to show you is how 156 people from 25 countries

110
0:06:44.242,000 --> 0:06:46,000
all over the five continents of this beautiful Earth,

111
0:06:47.011,000 --> 0:06:5,000
dropped their lives, dropped their patents,

112
0:06:50.029,000 --> 0:06:54,000
dropped their dogs, wives, kids, school, jobs,

113
0:06:54.139,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and congregated to come to Brazil for 18 months to actually get this done.

114
0:06:59.656,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Because a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup,

115
0:07:03.531,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful

116
0:07:07.183,000 --> 0:07:08,000
in the opening ceremony

117
0:07:08.881,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer

118
0:07:12.621,000 --> 0:07:14,000
until we met the Germans, of course.

119
0:07:14.827,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

120
0:07:16.22,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But that's a different talk,

121
0:07:18.055,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that.

122
0:07:22.095,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But what Brazil wanted to do is to showcase

123
0:07:24.169,000 --> 0:07:25,000
a completely different country,

124
0:07:25.894,000 --> 0:07:27,000
a country that values science and technology,

125
0:07:28.782,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and can give a gift to millions, 25 million people around the world

126
0:07:32.665,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury.

127
0:07:35.5,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Well, we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed,

128
0:07:39.104,000 --> 0:07:42,000
well, let's have the kickoff of the 2014 World Cup

129
0:07:42.472,000 --> 0:07:44,000
be given by a Brazilian paraplegic

130
0:07:44.844,000 --> 0:07:48,000
using a brain-controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball

131
0:07:49.734,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and to feel the contact of the ball.

132
0:07:52.01,000 --> 0:07:54,000
They looked at us, thought that we were completely nuts,

133
0:07:54.624,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and said, "Okay, let's try."

134
0:07:57.48,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We had 18 months to do everything from zero, from scratch.

135
0:08:01.72,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,

136
0:08:04.956,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we had nothing done.

137
0:08:06.173,000 --> 0:08:08,000
These people came all together

138
0:08:08.509,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and in 18 months, we got eight patients in a routine of training

139
0:08:12.757,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and basically built from nothing this guy,

140
0:08:16.855,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1.

141
0:08:21.315,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The first brain-controlled exoskeleton to be built

142
0:08:24.74,000 --> 0:08:28,000
was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever,

143
0:08:28.896,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Alberto Santos Dumont,

144
0:08:30.869,000 --> 0:08:35,000
who, on October 19, 1901, created and flew himself

145
0:08:36.672,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see.

146
0:08:43.899,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Sorry, my American friends,

147
0:08:45.918,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I live in North Carolina,

148
0:08:47.228,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but it was two years before the Wright Brothers flew

149
0:08:52.11,000 --> 0:08:54,000
on the coast of North Carolina.

150
0:08:54.274,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Applause)

151
0:08:57.339,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Flight control is Brazilian. (Laughter)

152
0:09:02.117,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So we went together with these guys

153
0:09:05.117,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and we basically put this exoskeleton together,

154
0:09:08.018,000 --> 0:09:11,000
15 degrees of freedom, hydraulic machine

155
0:09:11.99,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that can be commanded by brain signals

156
0:09:14.707,000 --> 0:09:18,000
recorded by a non-invasive technology called electroencephalography

157
0:09:18.925,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements

158
0:09:22.114,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and send his commands to the controls, the motors,

159
0:09:26.065,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and get it done.

160
0:09:27.867,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin

161
0:09:30.73,000 --> 0:09:34,000
invented by Gordon Cheng, one of my greatest friends, in Munich,

162
0:09:34.814,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground

163
0:09:39.4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to be delivered back to the patient through a vest, a shirt.

164
0:09:43.94,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It is a smart shirt with micro-vibrating elements

165
0:09:46.91,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient's brain

166
0:09:51.733,000 --> 0:09:54,000
by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him,

167
0:09:55.204,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but it is he who is walking again.

168
0:09:58.454,000 --> 0:10:,000
So we got this going, and what you'll see here

169
0:10:01.313,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is the first time one of our patients, Bruno, actually walked.

170
0:10:06.003,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything,

171
0:10:08.881,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet

172
0:10:12.178,000 --> 0:10:15,000
because Bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs to be performed,

173
0:10:16.098,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the computer is going to analyze it, Bruno is going to certify it,

174
0:10:19.306,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and when it is certified,

175
0:10:21.115,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the device starts moving under the command of Bruno's brain.

176
0:10:24.642,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And he just got it right, and now he starts walking.

177
0:10:29.217,000 --> 0:10:31,000
After nine years without being able to move,

178
0:10:32.003,000 --> 0:10:34,000
he is walking by himself.

179
0:10:34.673,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And more than that --

180
0:10:36.275,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Applause) --

181
0:10:39.503,000 --> 0:10:4,000
more than just walking,

182
0:10:41.29,000 --> 0:10:43,000
he is feeling the ground,

183
0:10:43.608,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and if the speed of the exo goes up,

184
0:10:45.651,000 --> 0:10:49,000
he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos,

185
0:10:50.102,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident.

186
0:10:54.293,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That's why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno's head.

187
0:10:57.757,000 --> 0:11:,000
So he walks, and at the end of the walk -- I am running out of time already --

188
0:11:01.456,000 --> 0:11:03,000
he says, "You know, guys,

189
0:11:04.18,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married,

190
0:11:06.811,000 --> 0:11:08,000
because I wanted to walk to the priest

191
0:11:09.316,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and see my bride and actually be there by myself.

192
0:11:13.09,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Of course, he will have it whenever he wants.

193
0:11:16.482,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup, and couldn't,

194
0:11:20.564,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because for some mysterious reason, FIFA cut its broadcast in half.

195
0:11:25.618,000 --> 0:11:32,000
What you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick

196
0:11:33.291,000 --> 0:11:35,000
a few minutes before we went to the pitch

197
0:11:35.588,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd,

198
0:11:38.499,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation.

199
0:11:41.88,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Basically, the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go.

200
0:11:46.768,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback,

201
0:11:49.843,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball,

202
0:11:52.861,000 --> 0:11:55,000
you are going to see two streams of green and yellow light

203
0:11:55.964,000 --> 0:11:57,000
coming from the helmet and going to the legs,

204
0:11:58.641,000 --> 0:12:02,000
representing the mental commands that were taken by the exo

205
0:12:02.742,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to actually make that happen.

206
0:12:04.641,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And in basically 13 seconds,

207
0:12:07.336,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Juliano actually did.

208
0:12:09.419,000 --> 0:12:1,000
You can see the commands.

209
0:12:11.135,000 --> 0:12:15,000
He gets ready, the ball is set, and he kicks.

210
0:12:15.475,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And the most amazing thing is,

211
0:12:17.353,000 --> 0:12:2,000
10 seconds after he did that, and looked at us on the pitch,

212
0:12:20.585,000 --> 0:12:22,000
he told us, celebrating as you saw,

213
0:12:22.862,000 --> 0:12:23,000
"I felt the ball."

214
0:12:25.562,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And that's priceless.

215
0:12:27.759,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Applause)

216
0:12:29.631,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So where is this going to go?

217
0:12:31.131,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I have two minutes to tell you

218
0:12:33.066,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that it's going to the limits of your imagination.

219
0:12:36.316,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Brain-actuating technology is here.

220
0:12:38.495,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This is the latest: We just published this a year ago,

221
0:12:41.049,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the first brain-to-brain interface

222
0:12:43.282,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that allows two animals to exchange mental messages

223
0:12:46.909,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment

224
0:12:50.485,000 --> 0:12:55,000
can send a mental SMS, a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,

225
0:12:56.042,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to the second animal,

226
0:12:57.648,000 --> 0:13:,000
and the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform

227
0:13:01.525,000 --> 0:13:05,000
without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message,

228
0:13:05.983,000 --> 0:13:08,000
because the message came from the first animal's brain.

229
0:13:09.279,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So this is the first demo.

230
0:13:11.649,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I'm going to be very quick because I want to show you the latest.

231
0:13:15.603,000 --> 0:13:2,000
But what you see here is the first rat getting informed

232
0:13:21.192,000 --> 0:13:23,000
by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage

233
0:13:24.125,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward.

234
0:13:27.865,000 --> 0:13:28,000
He goes there and does it.

235
0:13:29.658,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And the same time, he is sending a mental message

236
0:13:31.984,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to the second rat that didn't see any light,

237
0:13:35.007,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and the second rat, in 70 percent of the times

238
0:13:37.368,000 --> 0:13:41,000
is going to press the left lever and get a reward

239
0:13:41.581,000 --> 0:13:45,000
without ever experiencing the light in the retina.

240
0:13:45.716,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Well, we took this to a little higher limit

241
0:13:49.85,000 --> 0:13:53,000
by getting monkeys to collaborate mentally in a brain net,

242
0:13:54.582,000 --> 0:13:56,000
basically to donate their brain activity

243
0:13:56.772,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before,

244
0:14:00.29,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains,

245
0:14:05.058,000 --> 0:14:09,000
synchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move.

246
0:14:09.316,000 --> 0:14:11,000
One monkey is controlling the x dimension,

247
0:14:12.116,000 --> 0:14:14,000
the other monkey is controlling the y dimension.

248
0:14:14.996,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there

249
0:14:19.176,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and you ask one monkey to control x and y,

250
0:14:22.983,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the other monkey to control y and z,

251
0:14:25.654,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and the third one to control x and z,

252
0:14:28.532,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and you make them all play the game together,

253
0:14:30.648,000 --> 0:14:35,000
moving the arm in 3D into a target to get the famous Brazilian orange juice.

254
0:14:36.602,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And they actually do.

255
0:14:38.987,000 --> 0:14:42,000
The black dot is the average of all these brains working

256
0:14:43.161,000 --> 0:14:45,000
in parallel, in real time.

257
0:14:46.019,000 --> 0:14:49,000
That is the definition of a biological computer,

258
0:14:49.105,000 --> 0:14:53,000
interacting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal.

259
0:14:53.647,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Where is this going?

260
0:14:55.536,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We have no idea.

261
0:14:58.121,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We're just scientists.

262
0:14:59.921,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Laughter)

263
0:15:01.218,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We are paid to be children,

264
0:15:03.774,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there.

265
0:15:07.764,000 --> 0:15:08,000
But one thing I know:

266
0:15:09.45,000 --> 0:15:11,000
One day, in a few decades,

267
0:15:11.635,000 --> 0:15:14,000
when our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking,

268
0:15:15.157,000 --> 0:15:19,000
or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see,

269
0:15:19.475,000 --> 0:15:21,000
or somebody speaks because of a brain-to-brain bypass,

270
0:15:22.403,000 --> 0:15:28,000
some of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon

271
0:15:28.73,000 --> 0:15:31,000
in a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick.

272
0:15:32.502,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Thank you.

273
0:15:34.498,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Applause)

274
0:15:43.962,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Thank you.

275
0:15:59.44,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Bruno Giussani: Miguel, thank you for sticking to your time.

276
0:16:03.004,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I actually would have given you a couple more minutes,

277
0:16:05.529,000 --> 0:16:08,000
because there are a couple of points we want to develop, and, of course,

278
0:16:08.913,000 --> 0:16:11,000
clearly it seems that we need connected brains to figure out where this is going.

279
0:16:12.81,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So let's connect all this together.

280
0:16:14.712,000 --> 0:16:15,000
So if I'm understanding correctly,

281
0:16:16.381,000 --> 0:16:18,000
one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal

282
0:16:18.88,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and the other monkey is reacting to that signal

283
0:16:21.146,000 --> 0:16:25,000
just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse.

284
0:16:25.631,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Miguel Nicolelis: No, it's a little different.

285
0:16:27.855,000 --> 0:16:29,000
No monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys.

286
0:16:30.746,000 --> 0:16:32,000
They are getting a visual feedback in 2D,

287
0:16:33.682,000 --> 0:16:35,000
but the task they have to accomplish is 3D.

288
0:16:36.355,000 --> 0:16:38,000
They have to move an arm in three dimensions.

289
0:16:38.954,000 --> 0:16:41,000
But each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen

290
0:16:42.356,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that the monkey controls.

291
0:16:44.132,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And to get that thing done,

292
0:16:47.15,000 --> 0:16:49,000
you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains,

293
0:16:49.964,000 --> 0:16:5,000
but the ideal is three.

294
0:16:51.735,000 --> 0:16:54,000
So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down,

295
0:16:55.351,000 --> 0:16:57,000
the other two monkeys enhance their performance

296
0:16:57.962,000 --> 0:16:58,000
to get the guy to come back,

297
0:16:59.944,000 --> 0:17:01,000
so this adjusts dynamically,

298
0:17:02.05,000 --> 0:17:06,000
but the global synchrony remains the same.

299
0:17:06.399,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Now, if you flip without telling the monkey

300
0:17:09.023,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the dimensions that each brain has to control,

301
0:17:11.321,000 --> 0:17:13,000
like this guy is controlling x and y,

302
0:17:13.62,000 --> 0:17:15,000
but he should be controlling now y and z,

303
0:17:16.035,000 --> 0:17:2,000
instantaneously, that animal's brain forgets about the old dimensions

304
0:17:20.818,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions.

305
0:17:23.336,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So what I need to say is that no Turing machine,

306
0:17:26.623,000 --> 0:17:3,000
no computer can predict what a brain net will do.

307
0:17:30.825,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So we will absorb technology as part of us.

308
0:17:33.206,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Technology will never absorb us.

309
0:17:35.815,000 --> 0:17:37,000
It's simply impossible.

310
0:17:38.456,000 --> 0:17:41,000
BG: How many times have you tested this?

311
0:17:41.506,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And how many times have you succeeded versus failed?

312
0:17:44.051,000 --> 0:17:46,000
MN: Oh, tens of times.

313
0:17:46.327,000 --> 0:17:48,000
With the three monkeys? Oh, several times.

314
0:17:48.565,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times.

315
0:17:53.185,000 --> 0:17:55,000
And I forgot to mention, because of time,

316
0:17:55.786,000 --> 0:17:58,000
that just three weeks ago, a European group

317
0:17:59.547,000 --> 0:18:04,000
just demonstrated the first man-to-man brain-to-brain connection.

318
0:18:04.637,000 --> 0:18:05,000
BG: And how does that play?

319
0:18:06.157,000 --> 0:18:1,000
MN: There was one bit of information -- big ideas start in a humble way --

320
0:18:10.739,000 --> 0:18:16,000
but basically the brain activity of one subject

321
0:18:17.102,000 --> 0:18:21,000
was transmitted to a second object, all non-invasive technology.

322
0:18:21.308,000 --> 0:18:25,000
So the first subject got a message, like our rats, a visual message,

323
0:18:25.552,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and transmitted it to the second subject.

324
0:18:28.106,000 --> 0:18:32,000
The second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex,

325
0:18:32.588,000 --> 0:18:35,000
or a different pulse, two different pulses.

326
0:18:36.094,000 --> 0:18:38,000
In one pulse, the subject saw something.

327
0:18:38.799,000 --> 0:18:4,000
On the other pulse, he saw something different.

328
0:18:40.935,000 --> 0:18:41,000
And he was able to verbally indicate

329
0:18:42.918,000 --> 0:18:45,000
what was the message the first subject was sending

330
0:18:45.958,000 --> 0:18:47,000
through the Internet across continents.

331
0:18:48.853,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Moderator: Wow. Okay, that's where we are going.

332
0:18:51.372,000 --> 0:18:53,000
That's the next TED Talk at the next conference.

333
0:18:53.689,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Miguel Nicolelis, thank you. MN: Thank you, Bruno. Thank you.

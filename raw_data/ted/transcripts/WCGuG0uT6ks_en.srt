1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I have a studio in Berlin --

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
let me cue on here --

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which is down there in this snow, just last weekend.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In the studio we do a lot of experiments.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I have occasional meetings with scientists.

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We have an annual gathering of people,

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and that is called Life in Space.

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Life in Space is really not necessarily about

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
how we do things, but why we do things.

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Do you mind looking, with me, at that little cross in the center there?

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So just keep looking. Don't mind me.

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
So you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment.

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
When the circle goes away you will have another color, the complementary color.

16
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back.

17
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality

18
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by overlapping what I say and what you say --

19
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
think of a movie.

20
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Since two years now, with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin,

21
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I've been working on these films

22
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
where we produce the film together.

23
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.

24
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative.

25
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But nevertheless, what the potential is --

26
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and just keep looking there --

27
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
what the potential is, obviously,

28
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is to kind of move the border of who is the author,

29
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and who is the receiver.

30
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Who is the consumer, if you want,

31
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and who has responsibility for what one sees?

32
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I think there is a socializing dimension

33
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in, kind of, moving that border.

34
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Who decides what reality is?

35
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is the Tate Modern in London.

36
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The show was, in a sense, about that.

37
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.

38
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.

39
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And my idea was to make the space tangible.

40
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
With such a big space, the problem is

41
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
obviously that there is a discrepancy

42
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
between what your body can embrace,

43
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and what the space, in that sense, is.

44
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements,

45
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
if you want -- some fog -- I could make the space tangible.

46
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And what happens is that people, they start to see themselves in this space.

47
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So look at this. Look at the girl.

48
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Of course they have to look through a bloody camera

49
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in a museum. Right? That's how museums are working today.

50
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But look at her face there,

51
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
as she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror.

52
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Oh! That was my foot there!"

53
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.

54
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And in that whole idea,

55
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?

56
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
How do we reconfigure it?

57
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
How do we know that being in a space makes a difference?

58
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Do you see when I said in the beginning, it's about

59
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
why, rather than how?

60
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The why meant really,

61
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"What consequences does it have when I take a step?"

62
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"What does it matter?"

63
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"

64
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take

65
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
filter into a sense of responsibility?"

66
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Is art about that?

67
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I would say yes. It is obviously about

68
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better,

69
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or even worse, if you ask me.

70
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It's obviously also about taking responsibility,

71
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river

72
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo,

73
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
among other places.

74
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The green dye is not environmentally dangerous,

75
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but it obviously looks really rather frightening.

76
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful,

77
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas,

78
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in these different places of the world.

79
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
The "Green river," as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition,

80
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it was really about showing people,

81
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in this city, as they walk by,

82
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that space has dimensions. A space has time.

83
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the water flows through the city with time.

84
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The water has an ability to make

85
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the city negotiable, tangible.

86
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference

87
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
whether you do something or not.

88
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.

89
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And if I vote it makes a difference.

90
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
If I take a stand, it makes a difference."

91
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This whole idea of a city not being a picture is,

92
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I think, something that art, in a sense,

93
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
always was working with.

94
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship

95
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
between what it means to be in a picture,

96
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference?

97
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The difference between thinking and doing.

98
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.

99
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Iceland, lower right corner, my favorite place.

100
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
These kinds of experiments, they filter into architectural models.

101
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
These are ongoing experiments.

102
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One is an experiment I did for BMW,

103
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
an attempt to make a car.

104
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It's made out of ice.

105
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top,

106
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.

107
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
A sort of a run track, or a walk track,

108
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
on the top of a museum in Denmark,

109
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which is made of colored glass, going all around.

110
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So the movement with your legs

111
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
will change the color of your horizon.

112
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London,

113
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
with the Serpentine Gallery:

114
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
a kind of a temporal pavilion where

115
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
moving was the only way you could see the pavilion.

116
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This summer, in New York:

117
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
there is one thing about falling water which is very much about

118
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the time it takes for water to fall.

119
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's quite simple and fundamental.

120
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.

121
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And as you come to a new valley,

122
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.

123
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
If you stand still, the landscape

124
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.

125
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.

126
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.

127
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The big mountains far away, they move less.

128
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The small mountains in the foreground, they move more.

129
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And if you stop again, you wonder,

130
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"Is that a one-hour valley?

131
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Or is that a three-hour hike, or is that a whole day I'm looking at?"

132
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If you have a waterfall in there,

133
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall

134
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly."

135
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And you go, "My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall."

136
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
If a waterfall is falling faster,

137
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by --

138
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere.

139
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And your body somehow knows that.

140
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space.

141
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Of course being an iconic city like New York,

142
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that has had an interest in somehow

143
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
playing around with the sense of space, you could say that New York

144
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
wants to seem as big as possible.

145
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Adding a measurement

146
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to that is interesting:

147
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the falling water suddenly gives you a sense

148
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of, "Oh, Brooklyn is exactly this much --

149
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case

150
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the lower East River is this big."

151
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities.

152
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension.

153
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And why would we want to do that?

154
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Because I think it makes a difference

155
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
whether you have a body

156
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that feels a part of a space,

157
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture.

158
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And "Ha-ha, there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter?"

159
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Is there a sense of consequences?

160
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So if I have a sense of the space,

161
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
if I feel that the space is tangible,

162
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
if I feel there is time,

163
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
if there is a dimension I could call time,

164
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I also feel that I can change the space.

165
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And suddenly it makes a difference

166
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in terms of making space accessible.

167
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
One could say this is about

168
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
community, collectivity.

169
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's about being together.

170
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
How do we create public space?

171
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What does the word "public" mean today anyway?

172
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So, asked in that way,

173
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I think it raises great things about

174
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
parliamentary ideas, democracy, public space,

175
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
being together, being individual.

176
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
How do we create

177
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
an idea which is both tolerant to individuality,

178
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and also to collectivity,

179
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
without polarizing the two

180
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
into two different opposites?

181
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Of course the political agendas in the world

182
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
has been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other

183
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
into different, very normative ideas.

184
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I would claim that art and culture,

185
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting

186
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in the times we're living in now,

187
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
have proven that one can

188
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
create a kind of a space

189
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
which is both sensitive to individuality

190
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and to collectivity.

191
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's very much about this causality, consequences.

192
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's very much about the way we link

193
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
thinking and doing.

194
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So what is between thinking and doing?

195
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And right in-between thinking and doing,

196
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
I would say, there is experience.

197
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And experience is not just

198
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.

199
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Experience is about responsibility.

200
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Having an experience is taking part in the world.

201
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility.

202
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So art, in that sense,

203
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I think holds an incredible relevance

204
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in the world in which we're moving into,

205
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
particularly right now.

206
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
That's all I have. Thank you very much.

207
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.826,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Puzzles

2
0:00:14.642,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and magic.

3
0:00:16.941,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I work in what most people think

4
0:00:19.085,000 --> 0:00:21,000
are two distinct fields,

5
0:00:21.523,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but I believe they are the same.

6
0:00:24.594,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I am both a magician and

7
0:00:26.57,000 --> 0:00:29,000
a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor,

8
0:00:30.406,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which basically means I've taken

9
0:00:31.77,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the world's two nerdiest hobbies

10
0:00:33.392,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and combined them into one career.

11
0:00:36.32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same

12
0:00:39.443,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because they both key into one of

13
0:00:41.379,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the most important human drives:

14
0:00:44.03,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the urge to solve.

15
0:00:46.116,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Human beings are wired to solve,

16
0:00:49.249,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to make order out of chaos.

17
0:00:52.253,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's certainly true for me.

18
0:00:53.76,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I've been solving my whole life.

19
0:00:55.599,000 --> 0:00:59,000
High school consisted of epic Scrabble matches in the cafeteria

20
0:00:59.903,000 --> 0:01:,000
and not really talking to girls,

21
0:01:01.612,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and then at about that time

22
0:01:03.435,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I started learning magic tricks

23
0:01:05.13,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and definitely not talking to girls.

24
0:01:07.597,000 --> 0:01:09,000
There's nothing like starting a conversation with,

25
0:01:09.644,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth

26
0:01:12.2,000 --> 0:01:15,000
20 points in Scrabble?"

27
0:01:15.224,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But back then, I noticed an intersection

28
0:01:18.011,000 --> 0:01:2,000
between puzzles and illusion.

29
0:01:20.736,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When you do the crossword puzzle

30
0:01:22.682,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or when you watch a magic show,

31
0:01:24.628,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you become a solver,

32
0:01:26.88,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos,

33
0:01:30.658,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the chaos of, say, a black-and-white puzzle grid,

34
0:01:33.898,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles,

35
0:01:36.042,000 --> 0:01:38,000
or a shuffled pack of playing cards.

36
0:01:38.85,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And today, as a cruciverbalist —

37
0:01:41.864,000 --> 0:01:42,000
23 points —

38
0:01:43.45,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and an illusion designer, I create that chaos.

39
0:01:47.207,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I test your ability to solve.

40
0:01:50.552,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now, it turns out research tells us

41
0:01:52.962,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.

42
0:01:56.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
From birth, we are wired to solve.

43
0:02:00.695,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospital

44
0:02:04.532,000 --> 0:02:06,000
were shown patterns, patterns like this:

45
0:02:07.22,000 --> 0:02:1,000
circle, cross, circle, cross.

46
0:02:10.831,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And then the pattern was changed: triangle, square.

47
0:02:15.15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And by tracking an infant's gaze,

48
0:02:17.806,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we know that newborns as young as a day old

49
0:02:21.11,000 --> 0:02:23,000
can notice and respond to disruptions in order.

50
0:02:23.722,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's remarkable.

51
0:02:25.14,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So from infancy through old age,

52
0:02:27.738,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the urge to solve unites us all,

53
0:02:30.11,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and I even found this photo on Instagram

54
0:02:32.75,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle

55
0:02:35.904,000 --> 0:02:37,000
with her morning coffee.

56
0:02:38.13,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Like.

57
0:02:39.801,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:43.669,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, solving exists across all cultures.

59
0:02:48.21,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The American invention is the crossword puzzle,

60
0:02:51.154,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and this year we are celebrating

61
0:02:52.553,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle,

62
0:02:55.226,000 --> 0:02:57,000
first published in The New York World.

63
0:02:57.733,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well.

64
0:03:00.372,000 --> 0:03:02,000
China gives us tangrams,

65
0:03:02.382,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which would test solvers' abilities

66
0:03:04.427,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to form shapes from the jumbled pieces.

67
0:03:07.567,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Chaos. Order.

68
0:03:10.57,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Order.

69
0:03:12.628,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And order.

70
0:03:15.823,000 --> 0:03:17,000
That one's my favorite, let's hear it again.

71
0:03:18.393,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Okay.

72
0:03:20.064,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And how about this puzzle

73
0:03:21.84,000 --> 0:03:23,000
invented in 18th-century England:

74
0:03:24.279,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the jigsaw puzzle.

75
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Is this not making order out of chaos?

76
0:03:30.144,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So as you can see,

77
0:03:31.613,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we are always solving.

78
0:03:33.392,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We are always trying to decode our world.

79
0:03:37.354,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's an eternal quest.

80
0:03:38.884,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about

81
0:03:41.528,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in "Don Quixote,"

82
0:03:42.979,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which by the way is the root of the word "quixotry,"

83
0:03:44.981,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time,

84
0:03:46.804,000 --> 0:03:47,000
365 points.

85
0:03:48.66,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But anyway, "Don Quixote" is an important book.

86
0:03:51.877,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You guys have read "Don Quixote," yes?

87
0:03:53.914,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I'm seeing some heads nod.

88
0:03:55.42,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Come on guys, really?

89
0:03:56.702,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Who's read "Don Quixote?" Let's do this. Raise your hands if you've read "Don Quixote."

90
0:03:59.239,000 --> 0:04:,000
There we go. Smart audience.

91
0:04:00.349,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Who's read "Don Quixote?" Get them up.

92
0:04:02.063,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Okay, good, because I need somebody smart here

93
0:04:06.276,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because now I'm going to demonstrate

94
0:04:07.478,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with the help of one of you

95
0:04:09.35,000 --> 0:04:12,000
just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is,

96
0:04:12.686,000 --> 0:04:14,000
just how wired to solve all of you really are,

97
0:04:15.185,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so I'm going to come into the audience

98
0:04:16.627,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and find somebody to help me.

99
0:04:19.625,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Let's see.

100
0:04:21.747,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Everybody's looking away all of a sudden.

101
0:04:25.639,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Can I? Would you? What is your name? Gwen.

102
0:04:29.556,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'm not a mind reader, I can see your name tag.

103
0:04:31.997,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Come with me, Gwen. Everyone give her a round of applause, make her feel welcome.

104
0:04:36.31,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Gwen, after you.

105
0:04:37.982,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

106
0:04:39.864,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Are you so excited?

107
0:04:43.275,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Did you know that your name is worth

108
0:04:44.73,000 --> 0:04:45,000
eight points in Scrabble?

109
0:04:46.328,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Okay, stand right here, Gwen, right here.

110
0:04:50.615,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now, Gwen, before we begin,

111
0:04:53.117,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle,

112
0:04:55.726,000 --> 0:04:56,000
which is here in this envelope,

113
0:04:57.263,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and I will not go near it. Okay?

114
0:04:58.883,000 --> 0:05:,000
And over here we have a drawing of some farm animals.

115
0:05:00.891,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You can see we have an owl, we have a horse,

116
0:05:02.251,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep,

117
0:05:04.48,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and then here, Gwen, we have

118
0:05:05.69,000 --> 0:05:07,000
some fancy art store markers,

119
0:05:08.11,000 --> 0:05:1,000
colors like, can you see that word right there?

120
0:05:10.45,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Gwen: Cobalt. David Kwong: Cobalt, yes. Cobalt.

121
0:05:12.789,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But we have a silver, a red, an emerald,

122
0:05:15.407,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and an amber marker,

123
0:05:16.865,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and Gwen, you are going to color this drawing

124
0:05:19.13,000 --> 0:05:2,000
just like you were five years old,

125
0:05:20.607,000 --> 0:05:21,000
one marker at a time.

126
0:05:21.715,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's going to be a lot of fun.

127
0:05:23.234,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But I'm going to go over here.

128
0:05:24.255,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I don't want to see what you're doing.

129
0:05:26.342,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Okay, so don't start yet.

130
0:05:27.412,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes.

131
0:05:28.839,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now Gwen, are you ready?

132
0:05:30.717,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Pick up just one marker, pick up just one marker,

133
0:05:34.227,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and why don't you color in the horse for me?

134
0:05:35.612,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Color in the horse — big, big, big scribbles,

135
0:05:39.165,000 --> 0:05:41,000
broad strokes, don't worry about staying in the lines.

136
0:05:42.123,000 --> 0:05:43,000
All right. Great.

137
0:05:43.399,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And why don't you take that marker and recap it

138
0:05:44.975,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and place it on the table for me.

139
0:05:46.905,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Okay, and pick up another marker out of the cup

140
0:05:50.125,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and take off the cap

141
0:05:52.575,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey.

142
0:05:54.641,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Big scribbles.

143
0:05:57.709,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Okay, cool, and re-cap that marker

144
0:05:59.943,000 --> 0:06:,000
and place it on the table.

145
0:06:01.445,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And pick up another marker for me

146
0:06:03.723,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and take off the cap. Isn't this fun?

147
0:06:06.186,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And color in the owl for me.

148
0:06:07.513,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Color in the owl.

149
0:06:10.564,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Okay, and recap that marker

150
0:06:13.05,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and pick up another marker out of the cup

151
0:06:14.838,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.

152
0:06:18.414,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Good, good, good, good, good.

153
0:06:19.838,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Big, big, big strokes. Good, good.

154
0:06:20.931,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Pick up another marker out of the cup

155
0:06:23.196,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and color in the ox for me. Color in the ox.

156
0:06:26.693,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Okay, good.

157
0:06:27.956,000 --> 0:06:29,000
A lot of color on that, and recap, and place it on the table,

158
0:06:30.406,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and pick up another marker out of the cup.

159
0:06:33.11,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Oh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around.

160
0:06:35.849,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Did I forget? Oh, I forgot my purple marker.

161
0:06:41.109,000 --> 0:06:42,000
This is still going to work, though.

162
0:06:42.452,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I think this is still going to work, mostly.

163
0:06:44.735,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.

164
0:06:47.888,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet,

165
0:06:50.84,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but I am going to write down your choices

166
0:06:53.231,000 --> 0:06:55,000
so that everybody can see

167
0:06:55.39,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the choices that you made.

168
0:06:56.663,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Okay, great. So we have a cobalt horse,

169
0:07:05.046,000 --> 0:07:1,000
amber owl,

170
0:07:10.452,000 --> 0:07:14,000
a silver ox,

171
0:07:15.233,000 --> 0:07:18,000
yes, okay, a red donkey,

172
0:07:18.675,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and what was the emerald color? A rooster.

173
0:07:22.05,000 --> 0:07:26,000
An emerald rooster. Okay.

174
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now for the moment of truth, Gwen,

175
0:07:28.286,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we're going to take a look in that envelope.

176
0:07:29.971,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Why don't you open it up and remove

177
0:07:31.886,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the one piece of paper from inside

178
0:07:33.178,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and hand it to me,

179
0:07:34.207,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and we will see if it matches your choices.

180
0:07:38.91,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Yes, I think it does.

181
0:07:40.345,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey,

182
0:07:41.909,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we have an amber owl, we have an emerald rooster, a silver ox,

183
0:07:44.206,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep,

184
0:07:46.217,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but that's a pretty amazing coincidence, don't you think?

185
0:07:48.932,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Gwen, well done. That's beautiful. (Applause)

186
0:07:53.113,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I'll take that back from you.

187
0:07:54.88,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?

188
0:07:58.744,000 --> 0:08:,000
How is this possible? Well, could it be

189
0:08:01.561,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve

190
0:08:05.823,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that she decoded hidden messages?

191
0:08:08.669,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Well this is the puzzle I present to you.

192
0:08:10.716,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Could there be order

193
0:08:12.696,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in the chaos that I created?

194
0:08:15.7,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Let's take a closer look.

195
0:08:17.44,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?

196
0:08:21.451,000 --> 0:08:26,000
What image did it ultimately become? A cobalt horse.

197
0:08:27.208,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The plot thickens.

198
0:08:28.985,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And then we played a game of tangrams

199
0:08:31.19,000 --> 0:08:35,000
with an emerald rooster.

200
0:08:36.18,000 --> 0:08:38,000
That one's my favorite.

201
0:08:38.378,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And then we had an experiment with a silver ox.

202
0:08:44.633,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee

203
0:08:47.333,000 --> 0:08:5,000
out of an amber owl.

204
0:08:51.162,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Thank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.

205
0:08:52.841,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Oh, and there's one more, there's one more.

206
0:08:54.806,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.

207
0:08:58.234,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Ladies and gentlemen, could you raise your hands

208
0:08:59.864,000 --> 0:09:01,000
for me if you've read "Don Quixote?"

209
0:09:02.284,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Who's read "Don Quixote?" (Laughter)

210
0:09:05.179,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.

211
0:09:06.955,000 --> 0:09:07,000
There's more.

212
0:09:08.45,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Gwen, I was so confident

213
0:09:11.209,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that you were going to make these choices

214
0:09:13.133,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that I made another prediction,

215
0:09:15.771,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and I put it in an even more indelible place,

216
0:09:19.101,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and it's right here.

217
0:09:21.519,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

218
0:09:22.801,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we have today's New York Times.

219
0:09:26.379,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The date is March 18th, 2014.

220
0:09:30.204,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Many of you in the first couple of rows

221
0:09:32.05,000 --> 0:09:34,000
have it underneath your seats as well.

222
0:09:34.17,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Really dig. We hid them under there.

223
0:09:36.38,000 --> 0:09:37,000
See if you can fish out the newspaper

224
0:09:37.921,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and open up to the arts section

225
0:09:40.319,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and you will find the crossword puzzle,

226
0:09:43.782,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and the crossword puzzle today

227
0:09:45.345,000 --> 0:09:47,000
was written by yours truly.

228
0:09:47.404,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You can see my name above the grid.

229
0:09:48.47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.

230
0:09:51.003,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And I will also put it up on the screen.

231
0:09:55.196,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now let's take a look

232
0:09:57.078,000 --> 0:10:,000
at another piece of the puzzle.

233
0:10:00.385,000 --> 0:10:03,000
If you look at the first clue for 1-across,

234
0:10:03.603,000 --> 0:10:06,000
it starts with the letter C, for corrupt,

235
0:10:06.899,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and just below that we have an O, for outfielder,

236
0:10:09.825,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down,

237
0:10:12.771,000 --> 0:10:14,000
you get cobalt horse,

238
0:10:15.572,000 --> 0:10:18,000
amber owl, silver ox,

239
0:10:19.06,000 --> 0:10:22,000
red donkey, and emerald rooster.

240
0:10:22.558,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Applause)

241
0:10:24.164,000 --> 0:10:29,000
That's pretty cool, right?

242
0:10:29.735,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's The New York Times.

243
0:10:31.446,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

244
0:10:33.022,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Oh, Gwen,

245
0:10:34.544,000 --> 0:10:36,000
do you recall how I forgot my purple marker,

246
0:10:37.148,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and you were unable to color the sheep?

247
0:10:40.195,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Well, if you keep reading

248
0:10:41.648,000 --> 0:10:42,000
starting with 25-down,

249
0:10:43.279,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it says,

250
0:10:44.185,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"Oh, by the way,

251
0:10:45.958,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the sheep can be left blank."

252
0:10:50.27,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

253
0:10:54.706,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing,

254
0:10:56.28,000 --> 0:10:57,000
there's one more thing,

255
0:10:57.483,000 --> 0:10:59,000
there's one final piece of the puzzle.

256
0:11:00.322,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Gwen, I am so grateful for your choices

257
0:11:04.641,000 --> 0:11:05,000
because if we take a look

258
0:11:06.632,000 --> 0:11:08,000
at the first letters of your combinations,

259
0:11:08.863,000 --> 0:11:11,000
we get "C-H-A-O-S" for chaos

260
0:11:11.875,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and "O-R-D-E-R" for order.

261
0:11:14.698,000 --> 0:11:15,000
That's chaos and order.

262
0:11:16.228,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We've all made order out of chaos.

263
0:11:17.904,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So ladies and gentlemen, the next time

264
0:11:19.907,000 --> 0:11:2,000
you find yourself with a puzzle,

265
0:11:21.459,000 --> 0:11:24,000
whether it's in your life or in your work,

266
0:11:24.501,000 --> 0:11:25,000
or maybe it's at the Sunday morning

267
0:11:25.682,000 --> 0:11:27,000
breakfast table with The New York Times,

268
0:11:28.09,000 --> 0:11:31,000
remember, you are all wired to solve.

269
0:11:31.932,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Thank you.

270
0:11:33.524,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.823,000 --> 0:00:13,000
There we were,

2
0:00:15.354,000 --> 0:00:18,000
souls and bodies packed into a Texas church

3
0:00:19.428,000 --> 0:00:21,000
on the last night of our lives.

4
0:00:22.856,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Packed into a room just like this,

5
0:00:25.542,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric,

6
0:00:31.287,000 --> 0:00:33,000
with an organ to my left and a choir at my back

7
0:00:33.982,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them.

8
0:00:37.502,000 --> 0:00:39,000
A room like this, nonetheless.

9
0:00:41.356,000 --> 0:00:43,000
With the same great feelings of suspense,

10
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the same deep hopes for salvation,

11
0:00:48.743,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the same sweat in the palms

12
0:00:50.403,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the same people in the back not paying attention.

13
0:00:53.918,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:56.77,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This was December 31, 1999,

15
0:01:01.033,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the night of the Second Coming of Christ,

16
0:01:04.222,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and the end of the world as I knew it.

17
0:01:08.022,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I had turned 12 that year

18
0:01:09.672,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and had reached the age of accountability.

19
0:01:12.742,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And once I stopped complaining

20
0:01:14.566,000 --> 0:01:16,000
about how unfair it was that Jesus would return

21
0:01:17.041,000 --> 0:01:2,000
as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done,

22
0:01:20.554,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.

23
0:01:24.448,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So I went to church as often as I could.

24
0:01:26.415,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise,

25
0:01:31.271,000 --> 0:01:34,000
trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me

26
0:01:34.385,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and decided to come back early.

27
0:01:36.813,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And just in case he did,

28
0:01:38.988,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I built a backup plan,

29
0:01:41.277,000 --> 0:01:44,000
by reading the "Left Behind" books that were all the rage at the time.

30
0:01:45.651,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I found in their pages

31
0:01:47.139,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight,

32
0:01:49.904,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I had another shot.

33
0:01:51.958,000 --> 0:01:54,000
All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast,

34
0:01:55.808,000 --> 0:01:58,000
fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.

35
0:01:58.944,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It would be hard --

36
0:02:00.155,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:03.348,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but I knew I could do it.

38
0:02:04.93,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:06.457,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But planning time was over now.

40
0:02:08.269,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It was 11:50pm.

41
0:02:10.109,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We had 10 minutes left,

42
0:02:11.295,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar

43
0:02:14.313,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck.

44
0:02:19.808,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So every faction of the congregation

45
0:02:21.842,000 --> 0:02:22,000
took its place.

46
0:02:23.169,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The choir stayed in the choir stand,

47
0:02:24.939,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the deacons and their wives --

48
0:02:26.436,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them --

49
0:02:28.963,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:30.273,000 --> 0:02:32,000
took first position in front of the altar.

51
0:02:32.504,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You see, in America,

52
0:02:34.824,000 --> 0:02:37,000
even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.

53
0:02:37.909,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:40.263,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Applause)

55
0:02:45.187,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie

56
0:02:47.6,000 --> 0:02:48,000
were the elderly --

57
0:02:49.553,000 --> 0:02:53,000
these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns

58
0:02:54.465,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in the cotton fields of East Texas,

59
0:02:57.137,000 --> 0:03:,000
and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown,

60
0:03:00.877,000 --> 0:03:01,000
just like the clay of East Texas,

61
0:03:03.119,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become

62
0:03:05.628,000 --> 0:03:06,000
outside of East Texas

63
0:03:06.803,000 --> 0:03:07,000
had sometimes been bent and broken

64
0:03:08.47,000 --> 0:03:09,000
even further than their backs.

65
0:03:09.993,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.

66
0:03:14.742,000 --> 0:03:16,000
They had waited their whole lives for this moment,

67
0:03:17.104,000 --> 0:03:2,000
just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world,

68
0:03:21.9,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show

69
0:03:24.921,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock.

70
0:03:28.242,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And as she made her way to the altar,

71
0:03:30.215,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I snuck right in behind her,

72
0:03:32.334,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because I knew for sure

73
0:03:34.332,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that my grandmother was going to heaven.

74
0:03:37.126,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer,

75
0:03:42.282,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I might go right on with her.

76
0:03:44.976,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So I held on

77
0:03:46.802,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I closed my eyes

78
0:03:49.07,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to listen,

79
0:03:50.678,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to wait.

80
0:03:52.314,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And the prayers got louder.

81
0:03:54.428,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer

82
0:03:56.893,000 --> 0:03:57,000
went up higher even still.

83
0:03:58.725,000 --> 0:04:,000
And the organ rolled on in to add the dirge.

84
0:04:01.15,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And the heat came on to add to the sweat.

85
0:04:03.66,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And my hand gripped firmer,

86
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so I wouldn't be the one left in the field.

87
0:04:07.037,000 --> 0:04:08,000
My eyes clenched tighter

88
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff.

89
0:04:11.256,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And then a voice rang out above us:

90
0:04:14.269,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"Amen."

91
0:04:17.474,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It was over.

92
0:04:20.044,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I looked at the clock.

93
0:04:22.643,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It was after midnight.

94
0:04:25.081,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I looked at the elder believers

95
0:04:27.697,000 --> 0:04:28,000
whose savior had not come,

96
0:04:30.205,000 --> 0:04:32,000
who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment,

97
0:04:33.046,000 --> 0:04:35,000
who had believed too much and for too long

98
0:04:35.972,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to start doubting now.

99
0:04:39.029,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But I was upset on their behalf.

100
0:04:42.65,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They had been duped,

101
0:04:44.363,000 --> 0:04:45,000
hoodwinked, bamboozled,

102
0:04:45.896,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and I had gone right along with them.

103
0:04:48.659,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I had prayed their prayers,

104
0:04:50.054,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I had yielded not to temptation as best I could.

105
0:04:53.024,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I had dipped my head not once, but twice

106
0:04:56.074,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in that snot-inducing baptism pool.

107
0:04:58.463,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I had believed.

108
0:05:01.355,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now what?

109
0:05:03.706,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I got home just in time to turn on the television

110
0:05:06.845,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium

111
0:05:09.313,000 --> 0:05:1,000
as it rolled in around the world.

112
0:05:11.475,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It struck me that it would have been strange anyway,

113
0:05:15.865,000 --> 0:05:17,000
for Jesus to come back again and again

114
0:05:18.269,000 --> 0:05:19,000
based on the different time zones.

115
0:05:19.929,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:27.037,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And this made me feel even more ridiculous --

117
0:05:30.354,000 --> 0:05:31,000
hurt, really.

118
0:05:33.076,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But there on that night, I did not stop believing.

119
0:05:37.197,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I just believed a new thing:

120
0:05:39.487,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that it was possible not to believe.

121
0:05:42.894,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It was possible the answers I had were wrong,

122
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that the questions themselves were wrong.

123
0:05:47.701,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude,

124
0:05:51.772,000 --> 0:05:53,000
there was, running right down to its foundation,

125
0:05:55.168,000 --> 0:05:56,000
a spring of doubt,

126
0:05:57.691,000 --> 0:05:58,000
a spring that promised rivers.

127
0:06:00.357,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I can trace the whole drama of my life

128
0:06:03.514,000 --> 0:06:04,000
back to that night in that church

129
0:06:05.164,000 --> 0:06:07,000
when my savior did not come for me;

130
0:06:08.069,000 --> 0:06:1,000
when the thing I believed most certainly

131
0:06:11.328,000 --> 0:06:12,000
turned out to be, if not a lie,

132
0:06:13.841,000 --> 0:06:14,000
then not quite the truth.

133
0:06:16.355,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way,

134
0:06:20.937,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I'm convinced that you are here

135
0:06:23.346,000 --> 0:06:26,000
because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done

136
0:06:27.278,000 --> 0:06:29,000
since the dawn of this new century,

137
0:06:30.014,000 --> 0:06:32,000
since my mother left and my father stayed away

138
0:06:32.484,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and my Lord refused to come.

139
0:06:34.867,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I held out my hand,

140
0:06:36.378,000 --> 0:06:38,000
reaching for something to believe in.

141
0:06:40.587,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,

142
0:06:44.318,000 --> 0:06:46,000
with the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas

143
0:06:46.856,000 --> 0:06:49,000
was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known,

144
0:06:50.569,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen.

145
0:06:54.542,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But when I found myself back home one winter break,

146
0:06:59.133,000 --> 0:07:01,000
with my face planted in the floor,

147
0:07:02.268,000 --> 0:07:04,000
my hands tied behind my back

148
0:07:05.538,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and a burglar's gun pressed to my head,

149
0:07:07.536,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.

150
0:07:12.181,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers

151
0:07:15.317,000 --> 0:07:17,000
as an intern in 2008.

152
0:07:19.048,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:23.739,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So hopeful --

154
0:07:25.078,000 --> 0:07:28,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:28.364,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that I called home to inform my family

156
0:07:30.407,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that we'd never be poor again.

157
0:07:31.981,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:34.767,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But as I witnessed this temple of finance

159
0:07:36.825,000 --> 0:07:37,000
come crashing down before my eyes,

160
0:07:38.664,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.

161
0:07:42.599,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer,

162
0:07:48.476,000 --> 0:07:5,000
who had heard a voice call out from Illinois,

163
0:07:50.725,000 --> 0:07:52,000
saying, "It's been a long time coming,

164
0:07:53.621,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but in this election, change has come to America."

165
0:07:58.549,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But as the Congress ground to a halt

166
0:08:00.315,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and the country ripped at the seams

167
0:08:02.057,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke,

168
0:08:04.514,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I knew that even the political second coming

169
0:08:07.845,000 --> 0:08:08,000
could not save me.

170
0:08:09.856,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream,

171
0:08:14.34,000 --> 0:08:16,000
praying to the gods of my time

172
0:08:17.261,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of success,

173
0:08:18.834,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and money,

174
0:08:20.358,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and power.

175
0:08:22.211,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But over and over again,

176
0:08:24.619,000 --> 0:08:27,000
midnight struck, and I opened my eyes

177
0:08:27.686,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to see that all of these gods were dead.

178
0:08:31.447,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And from that graveyard,

179
0:08:32.852,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I began the search once more,

180
0:08:34.321,000 --> 0:08:35,000
not because I was brave,

181
0:08:35.615,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but because I knew that I would either believe

182
0:08:39.044,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or I would die.

183
0:08:40.963,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca,

184
0:08:44.409,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Harvard Business School --

185
0:08:45.779,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:48.307,000 --> 0:08:51,000
this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation

187
0:08:52.216,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that it claimed to offer.

188
0:08:53.47,000 --> 0:08:55,000
No, I knew there'd be more work to do.

189
0:08:56.981,000 --> 0:09:,000
The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party,

190
0:09:02.138,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter,

191
0:09:06.457,000 --> 0:09:08,000
when three friends and I asked a question

192
0:09:08.517,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that young folks searching for something real have asked

193
0:09:11.191,000 --> 0:09:12,000
for a very long time:

194
0:09:12.982,000 --> 0:09:13,000
"What if we took a road trip?"

195
0:09:14.68,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

196
0:09:18.299,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there,

197
0:09:20.753,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but we knew we had to do it.

198
0:09:23.108,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Because all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote,

199
0:09:26.148,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere,"

200
0:09:30.991,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and go find out what everybody was doing

201
0:09:33.068,000 --> 0:09:34,000
all over the country.

202
0:09:35.242,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So even though there were other voices who said

203
0:09:37.543,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that the risk was too great and the proof too thin,

204
0:09:40.02,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we went on anyhow.

205
0:09:42.354,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013,

206
0:09:48.358,000 --> 0:09:51,000
through the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit,

207
0:09:51.822,000 --> 0:09:52,000
through the swamps of New Orleans,

208
0:09:53.469,000 --> 0:09:55,000
where we found and worked with men and women

209
0:09:56.095,000 --> 0:09:57,000
who were building small businesses

210
0:09:57.804,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that made purpose their bottom line.

211
0:10:01.962,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And having been trained at the West Point of capitalism,

212
0:10:04.672,000 --> 0:10:06,000
this struck us as a revolutionary idea.

213
0:10:06.8,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:07.84,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And this idea spread,

215
0:10:10.412,000 --> 0:10:13,000
growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America,

216
0:10:14.82,000 --> 0:10:17,000
a movement that landed me here on this stage today.

217
0:10:19.62,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation

218
0:10:23.821,000 --> 0:10:25,000
for purpose, for meaning.

219
0:10:27.317,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs

220
0:10:30.039,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in the nooks and crannies of America

221
0:10:31.971,000 --> 0:10:33,000
who were creating jobs and changing lives

222
0:10:34.448,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and who needed a little help.

223
0:10:37.082,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But if I'm being honest, it also spread

224
0:10:40.392,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because I fought to spread it.

225
0:10:43.204,000 --> 0:10:45,000
There was no length to which I would not go

226
0:10:45.471,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to preach this gospel,

227
0:10:46.651,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to get more people to believe

228
0:10:49.511,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that we could bind the wounds of a broken country,

229
0:10:51.934,000 --> 0:10:53,000
one social business at a time.

230
0:10:55.116,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But it was this journey of evangelism

231
0:10:59.239,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that led me to the rather different gospel

232
0:11:02.136,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that I've come to share with you today.

233
0:11:05.867,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It began one evening almost a year ago

234
0:11:10.199,000 --> 0:11:13,000
at the Museum of Natural History in New York City,

235
0:11:14.371,000 --> 0:11:16,000
at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.

236
0:11:18.341,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Under a full-size replica of a whale,

237
0:11:21.573,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I sat with the titans of our time

238
0:11:23.948,000 --> 0:11:25,000
as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.

239
0:11:27.727,000 --> 0:11:28,000
There was pride in a room

240
0:11:29.035,000 --> 0:11:31,000
where net worth and assets under management

241
0:11:31.938,000 --> 0:11:33,000
surpassed half a trillion dollars.

242
0:11:35.196,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We looked over all that we had made,

243
0:11:37.863,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and it was good.

244
0:11:39.927,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

245
0:11:42.868,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But it just so happened,

246
0:11:44.959,000 --> 0:11:45,000
two days later,

247
0:11:46.61,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I had to travel up the road to Harlem,

248
0:11:49.455,000 --> 0:11:51,000
where I found myself sitting in an urban farm

249
0:11:51.918,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that had once been a vacant lot,

250
0:11:54.416,000 --> 0:11:56,000
listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids

251
0:11:57.34,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that showed up there every day.

252
0:11:59.944,000 --> 0:12:02,000
All of them lived below the poverty line.

253
0:12:04.075,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack

254
0:12:07.519,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.

255
0:12:10.432,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Some of them came to Tony's program,

256
0:12:13.704,000 --> 0:12:14,000
called Harlem Grown,

257
0:12:15.677,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to get the only meal they had each day.

258
0:12:19.465,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension,

259
0:12:24.954,000 --> 0:12:26,000
after 20 years as a cab driver.

260
0:12:28.232,000 --> 0:12:3,000
He told me that he didn't give himself a salary,

261
0:12:31.342,000 --> 0:12:34,000
because despite success, the program struggled for resources.

262
0:12:35.993,000 --> 0:12:37,000
He told me that he would take any help

263
0:12:38.665,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that he could get.

264
0:12:40.49,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I was there as that help.

265
0:12:44.863,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears

266
0:12:49.838,000 --> 0:12:5,000
welling up in my eyes.

267
0:12:52.509,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I felt the weight of revelation

268
0:12:55.187,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that I could sit in one room on one night,

269
0:12:59.206,000 --> 0:13:03,000
where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars,

270
0:13:04.187,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and another room, two days later,

271
0:13:06.82,000 --> 0:13:08,000
just 50 blocks up the road,

272
0:13:09.971,000 --> 0:13:11,000
where a man was going without a salary

273
0:13:12.897,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to get a child her only meal of the day.

274
0:13:16.887,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And it wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry,

275
0:13:20.441,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids,

276
0:13:23.276,000 --> 0:13:24,000
it wasn't rage toward the one percent

277
0:13:25.136,000 --> 0:13:27,000
or pity toward the 99.

278
0:13:27.787,000 --> 0:13:3,000
No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized

279
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that I was the dialysis

280
0:13:34.623,000 --> 0:13:37,000
for a country that needed a kidney transplant.

281
0:13:38.647,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I realized that my story stood in for all those

282
0:13:42.34,000 --> 0:13:44,000
who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps,

283
0:13:45.206,000 --> 0:13:47,000
even if they didn't have any boots;

284
0:13:48.182,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that my organization stood in

285
0:13:49.879,000 --> 0:13:52,000
for all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem

286
0:13:53.653,000 --> 0:13:54,000
or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;

287
0:13:55.622,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that my voice stood in for all those voices

288
0:14:01.098,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated.

289
0:14:07.273,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And the shame of that,

290
0:14:09.721,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that shame washed over me

291
0:14:11.132,000 --> 0:14:13,000
like the shame of sitting in front of the television,

292
0:14:14.898,000 --> 0:14:16,000
watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium

293
0:14:17.421,000 --> 0:14:18,000
again

294
0:14:18.653,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and again

295
0:14:20.257,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and again.

296
0:14:21.796,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I had been duped,

297
0:14:24.084,000 --> 0:14:25,000
hoodwinked,

298
0:14:25.696,000 --> 0:14:26,000
bamboozled.

299
0:14:27.403,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But this time, the false savior was me.

300
0:14:31.6,000 --> 0:14:34,000
You see, I've come a long way from that altar

301
0:14:35.326,000 --> 0:14:37,000
on the night I thought the world would end,

302
0:14:38.371,000 --> 0:14:4,000
from a world where people spoke in tongues

303
0:14:41.107,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and saw suffering as a necessary act of God

304
0:14:44.222,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and took a text to be infallible truth.

305
0:14:46.314,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Yes, I've come so far

306
0:14:48.607,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that I'm right back where I started.

307
0:14:52.103,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Because it simply is not true to say

308
0:14:54.342,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that we live in an age of disbelief --

309
0:14:56.247,000 --> 0:15:,000
no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before.

310
0:15:01.409,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown

311
0:15:04.276,000 --> 0:15:05,000
or Tony Robbins.

312
0:15:06.003,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker

313
0:15:08.127,000 --> 0:15:09,000
or the Harvard Business Review.

314
0:15:10.146,000 --> 0:15:11,000
We may believe most deeply

315
0:15:12.15,000 --> 0:15:14,000
when we worship right here at the church of TED,

316
0:15:15.347,000 --> 0:15:17,000
but we desperately want to believe,

317
0:15:17.552,000 --> 0:15:18,000
we need to believe.

318
0:15:20.001,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders

319
0:15:22.21,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that promise to solve all our problems.

320
0:15:24.426,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god,

321
0:15:28.53,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we take the text of technological progress

322
0:15:31.54,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to be infallible truth.

323
0:15:34.034,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And we hardly realize the human price we pay

324
0:15:38.412,000 --> 0:15:4,000
when we fail to question one brick,

325
0:15:41.692,000 --> 0:15:43,000
because we fear it might shake our whole foundation.

326
0:15:45.677,000 --> 0:15:46,000
But if you are disturbed

327
0:15:48.08,000 --> 0:15:51,000
by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept,

328
0:15:51.777,000 --> 0:15:53,000
then it must be questioning time.

329
0:15:55.987,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation

330
0:16:00.058,000 --> 0:16:01,000
or a triple bottom line.

331
0:16:02.38,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact.

332
0:16:07.125,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.

333
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:15,000
The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing,

334
0:16:15.737,000 --> 0:16:16,000
it asks that you believe a new thing:

335
0:16:18.2,000 --> 0:16:2,000
that it is possible not to believe.

336
0:16:21.512,000 --> 0:16:23,000
It is possible the answers we have are wrong,

337
0:16:23.706,000 --> 0:16:25,000
it is possible the questions themselves are wrong.

338
0:16:26.313,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we,

339
0:16:30.619,000 --> 0:16:32,000
on this stage, in this room,

340
0:16:33.178,000 --> 0:16:34,000
are wrong.

341
0:16:34.779,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Because it raises the question, "Why?"

342
0:16:37.789,000 --> 0:16:4,000
With all the power that we hold in our hands,

343
0:16:40.988,000 --> 0:16:43,000
why are people still suffering so bad?

344
0:16:45.209,000 --> 0:16:49,000
This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization,

345
0:16:49.788,000 --> 0:16:5,000
MBAs Across America,

346
0:16:51.078,000 --> 0:16:52,000
out of business.

347
0:16:52.73,000 --> 0:16:54,000
We have shed our staff and closed our doors

348
0:16:55.246,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and we will share our model freely

349
0:16:57.298,000 --> 0:16:59,000
with anyone who sees their power to do this work

350
0:17:00.208,000 --> 0:17:01,000
without waiting for our permission.

351
0:17:02.434,000 --> 0:17:04,000
This doubt compels me

352
0:17:05.236,000 --> 0:17:06,000
to renounce the role of savior

353
0:17:07.033,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that some have placed on me,

354
0:17:08.901,000 --> 0:17:11,000
because our time is too short and our odds are too long

355
0:17:12.02,000 --> 0:17:13,000
to wait for second comings,

356
0:17:13.824,000 --> 0:17:16,000
when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.

357
0:17:18.305,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And this doubt, it fuels me,

358
0:17:20.737,000 --> 0:17:21,000
it gives me hope

359
0:17:22.606,000 --> 0:17:24,000
that when our troubles overwhelm us,

360
0:17:25.76,000 --> 0:17:29,000
when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise,

361
0:17:30.528,000 --> 0:17:33,000
when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds,

362
0:17:34.286,000 --> 0:17:36,000
it will not be our blind faith --

363
0:17:37.423,000 --> 0:17:39,000
no, it will be our humble doubt

364
0:17:40.73,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives

365
0:17:44.065,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and of our world

366
0:17:45.87,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and lets us raise our voice to whisper

367
0:17:48.833,000 --> 0:17:49,000
or to shout

368
0:17:50.437,000 --> 0:17:51,000
or to say simply,

369
0:17:52.176,000 --> 0:17:53,000
very simply,

370
0:17:53.706,000 --> 0:17:55,000
"There must be another way."

371
0:17:57.011,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Thank you.

372
0:17:58.186,000 --> 0:18:18,000
(Applause)

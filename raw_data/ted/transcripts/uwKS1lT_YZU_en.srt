1
0:00:13.428,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Recently,

2
0:00:15.284,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've been declaring to anyone who would listen

3
0:00:19.107,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that I am a dangerous woman.

4
0:00:22.491,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Applause)

5
0:00:26.22,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, declaring that boldly like this

6
0:00:28.888,000 --> 0:00:31,000
still feels a bit dangerous,

7
0:00:32.269,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but it also feels right.

8
0:00:35.352,000 --> 0:00:36,000
At this time in my life,

9
0:00:37.197,000 --> 0:00:39,000
about to be 77,

10
0:00:39.842,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I have --

11
0:00:41.027,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Applause)

12
0:00:42.06,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I love when you're applauded for your age --

13
0:00:44.135,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:45.184,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but I'll take it.

15
0:00:46.366,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Applause)

16
0:00:50.931,000 --> 0:00:55,000
About to be 77, I realize that I have nothing left to prove,

17
0:00:56.064,000 --> 0:00:57,000
less to lose,

18
0:00:57.608,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I'm more impatient about everything.

19
0:01:01.992,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The true, slow pace towards equality,

20
0:01:05.972,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the rise in sexism, racism,

21
0:01:08.678,000 --> 0:01:1,000
violence against women and girls ...

22
0:01:11.623,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I'm angry, too,

23
0:01:13.95,000 --> 0:01:16,000
at the climate deniers who are stealing the future

24
0:01:17.425,000 --> 0:01:19,000
from our children and grandchildren.

25
0:01:21.035,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Friends, we are living in dangerous times.

26
0:01:25.553,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And such times call for all of us to be more dangerous.

27
0:01:31.202,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, what do I mean by this?

28
0:01:33.432,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I don't mean being feared.

29
0:01:35.233,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's not that kind of dangerous.

30
0:01:37.678,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But I do mean being more fearless.

31
0:01:42.397,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I mean speaking the truth

32
0:01:44.76,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when silence is a lot safer.

33
0:01:47.617,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I mean speaking up in rooms for those who aren't present,

34
0:01:51.771,000 --> 0:01:53,000
especially those rooms where decisions are made

35
0:01:54.385,000 --> 0:01:56,000
about our lives and our bodies.

36
0:01:57.359,000 --> 0:02:,000
We need to be in those rooms,

37
0:02:01.288,000 --> 0:02:04,000
showing up for one another,

38
0:02:04.571,000 --> 0:02:06,000
challenging the cultural construct

39
0:02:07.323,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that encourages us, especially women and girls,

40
0:02:10.884,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to compete, compare,

41
0:02:14.214,000 --> 0:02:15,000
criticize.

42
0:02:16.365,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We have to end this.

43
0:02:19.547,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And speaking out

44
0:02:21.001,000 --> 0:02:23,000
against the policies and the politics

45
0:02:23.168,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that divide us and diminish our collective power

46
0:02:27.382,000 --> 0:02:3,000
as a global community of women,

47
0:02:31.198,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and the men and the allies

48
0:02:33.288,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who stand with us.

49
0:02:35.637,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Becoming dangerous also means embracing whatever risks are necessary

50
0:02:40.703,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to create a world where women and girls are safe

51
0:02:44.671,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in their homes and at work,

52
0:02:47.171,000 --> 0:02:49,000
where all voices are represented

53
0:02:49.879,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and respected,

54
0:02:51.604,000 --> 0:02:53,000
all votes counted,

55
0:02:54.386,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the planet protected.

56
0:02:57.363,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And this is all possible.

57
0:02:59.969,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Because we're ready for this.

58
0:03:02.525,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We're better prepared than any generation ever before us,

59
0:03:06.811,000 --> 0:03:08,000
better resourced, better connected.

60
0:03:08.932,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In many parts of the world, we're living longer than ever.

61
0:03:12.93,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Women over 65 are among the fastest-growing populations on earth,

62
0:03:19.446,000 --> 0:03:22,000
with the potential for becoming the most powerful, too.

63
0:03:24.021,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now --

64
0:03:25.238,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Applause)

65
0:03:28.006,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What a change this represents.

66
0:03:31.03,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Postmenopausal women like me, not that long ago,

67
0:03:35.759,000 --> 0:03:36,000
were considered useless

68
0:03:37.564,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or crazy.

69
0:03:39.872,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We were valued for caregiving and grandmothering --

70
0:03:43.193,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I really love that part.

71
0:03:46.662,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But we were pushed aside

72
0:03:48.09,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and expected to retire to our rocking chairs.

73
0:03:52.59,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Women on the dangerous side of 60

74
0:03:55.567,000 --> 0:03:56,000
are not retiring.

75
0:03:57.418,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We are rewiring --

76
0:04:00.106,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Applause)

77
0:04:04.595,000 --> 0:04:08,000
taking all that we know and have done -- and that is a lot --

78
0:04:09.298,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to redefine what age looks like,

79
0:04:12.175,000 --> 0:04:14,000
can do, can accomplish.

80
0:04:15.756,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But becoming dangerous isn't about becoming a certain age,

81
0:04:19.827,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because at each end of the age spectrum,

82
0:04:22.295,000 --> 0:04:25,000
brave women and girls are stepping up,

83
0:04:25.638,000 --> 0:04:28,000
taking the risk to create change.

84
0:04:30.584,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I became a risk-taker early in my life's journey.

85
0:04:34.145,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I had to,

86
0:04:35.471,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or have my life defined by the limitations

87
0:04:38.72,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for a girl growing up in the rural South,

88
0:04:41.592,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with no money, no connections,

89
0:04:44.072,000 --> 0:04:46,000
no influence.

90
0:04:46.748,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But what wasn't limited

91
0:04:48.921,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was my curiosity about the world beyond my small town,

92
0:04:52.955,000 --> 0:04:56,000
beyond the small minds of a still-segregated South,

93
0:04:57.229,000 --> 0:04:59,000
a world that I glimpsed in the newsreels

94
0:04:59.867,000 --> 0:05:01,000
at the one movie theater in town,

95
0:05:02.845,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and a world that got a lot closer to me

96
0:05:05.323,000 --> 0:05:1,000
when I met Miss Shirley Rountree, my eighth-grade English teacher.

97
0:05:12.171,000 --> 0:05:14,000
From the minute she walked into the classroom,

98
0:05:14.406,000 --> 0:05:15,000
her high heels clicking,

99
0:05:16.374,000 --> 0:05:18,000
she was a woman in charge,

100
0:05:18.96,000 --> 0:05:2,000
with perfect hair, signature red lips,

101
0:05:21.645,000 --> 0:05:23,000
colorfully coordinated, head to toe.

102
0:05:23.827,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I wanted to be her.

103
0:05:27.381,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Gratefully, she became my first mentor and helped me become me.

104
0:05:34.811,000 --> 0:05:37,000
With her support, I got a scholarship to college --

105
0:05:38.058,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the first in my family --

106
0:05:39.942,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and landed at a big state university,

107
0:05:42.425,000 --> 0:05:46,000
right in the middle of two great social justice movements:

108
0:05:47.298,000 --> 0:05:49,000
civil rights for African Americans

109
0:05:49.973,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and equal rights for women.

110
0:05:52.858,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I joined both with enthusiasm,

111
0:05:56.505,000 --> 0:05:59,000
only to discover that my newfound activism

112
0:06:00.382,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and my fermenting feminism

113
0:06:03.394,000 --> 0:06:09,000
would often be in direct conflict with my deeply embedded need to please

114
0:06:10.467,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and be popular.

115
0:06:12.617,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In my first job as a college teacher, I broke the rules,

116
0:06:16.442,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and I encouraged students to join me in the protest marches.

117
0:06:20.241,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And when I found out that my male colleague

118
0:06:22.664,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with the same experience and education

119
0:06:25.846,000 --> 0:06:27,000
was being paid more than me,

120
0:06:28.358,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I mounted a personal protest.

121
0:06:31.688,000 --> 0:06:33,000
When my raise was denied,

122
0:06:34.045,000 --> 0:06:38,000
with the excuse that he had a family to support,

123
0:06:38.096,000 --> 0:06:41,000
so did I as a single mom.

124
0:06:41.861,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But I dropped my protest to keep my job.

125
0:06:46.508,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Today, millions of women are making this compromise,

126
0:06:49.983,000 --> 0:06:52,000
staying in their jobs without equal pay

127
0:06:53.835,000 --> 0:06:54,000
for equal work.

128
0:06:56.709,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And as one of the first women on television in the '70s,

129
0:07:00.443,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I was warned that focusing on women's stories

130
0:07:03.245,000 --> 0:07:04,000
would limit my career opportunities,

131
0:07:05.228,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and maybe it did.

132
0:07:07.055,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But I got to produce and host breakthrough programming for women,

133
0:07:12.598,000 --> 0:07:13,000
while at the same time,

134
0:07:14.565,000 --> 0:07:15,000
remaining silent

135
0:07:16.533,000 --> 0:07:18,000
about sexual harassment

136
0:07:19.403,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and listening to consultants who were hired to advise me

137
0:07:23.314,000 --> 0:07:24,000
about my appearance.

138
0:07:25.07,000 --> 0:07:26,000
"Become a blonde."

139
0:07:26.907,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I did.

140
0:07:28.092,000 --> 0:07:29,000
"Lower your voice."

141
0:07:29.718,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I tried.

142
0:07:30.97,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"Lower your necklines."

143
0:07:32.958,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I didn't.

144
0:07:34.187,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:35.392,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But I did wear those ugly anchor suits

146
0:07:38.588,000 --> 0:07:42,000
with those scarves that look something like men's ties.

147
0:07:43.864,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And later, in the power positions in media,

148
0:07:46.47,000 --> 0:07:48,000
often as the first or only woman,

149
0:07:48.945,000 --> 0:07:51,000
aware of being judged through that gender lens,

150
0:07:52.757,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I struggled from time to time

151
0:07:55.321,000 --> 0:08:,000
to find the right balance between being a leader for women

152
0:08:00.532,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and not being entirely defined as a woman leader.

153
0:08:06.523,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But today, I'm proud to be known as a woman leader.

154
0:08:11.055,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:17.407,000 --> 0:08:21,000
As an activist, advocate, feminist

156
0:08:21.819,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and as a newly declared dangerous woman,

157
0:08:26.749,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'm caring less what others say

158
0:08:29.989,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and saying more clearly what I think and feel.

159
0:08:34.178,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And let me be clear:

160
0:08:36.355,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I acknowledge my privilege in being able to do that,

161
0:08:41.5,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to speak my truth.

162
0:08:47.379,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And to stand here today

163
0:08:49.067,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with this opportunity

164
0:08:51.249,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to talk to you about women and power --

165
0:08:54.683,000 --> 0:08:58,000
note I did not say "empowered."

166
0:08:58.832,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I don't think we're waiting to be empowered.

167
0:09:01.973,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I think we have power.

168
0:09:04.211,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

169
0:09:08.317,000 --> 0:09:14,000
What we need are more opportunities to claim it, to use it,

170
0:09:14.822,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to share it.

171
0:09:16.123,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And yes, I know --

172
0:09:17.757,000 --> 0:09:2,000
there are women with power who don't use it well or wisely

173
0:09:21.309,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and who don't share it.

174
0:09:24.372,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I've heard, as I'm sure you have,

175
0:09:26.804,000 --> 0:09:27,000
those stories that begin with,

176
0:09:28.691,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"The worst boss I ever had was a woman ... "

177
0:09:32.278,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And we could all name women leaders who have not made us proud.

178
0:09:36.928,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But we can change all of that

179
0:09:40.192,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with a simple but brilliant idea

180
0:09:43.811,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that I first heard from a risk-taking, dangerous congresswoman from New York

181
0:09:49.099,000 --> 0:09:5,000
named Bella Abzug.

182
0:09:51.7,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Bella said, "In the 21st century,

183
0:09:55.017,000 --> 0:09:58,000
women will change the nature of power

184
0:09:58.868,000 --> 0:10:02,000
rather than power changing the nature of women."

185
0:10:04.175,000 --> 0:10:05,000
From the moment I heard that --

186
0:10:06.118,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Applause)

187
0:10:07.898,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I thought, "This is our call to action.

188
0:10:10.973,000 --> 0:10:12,000
This is our biggest opportunity."

189
0:10:14.871,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And as a journalist and an activist,

190
0:10:16.816,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I've seen this idea in action,

191
0:10:20.051,000 --> 0:10:25,000
documenting the stories of women on both sides in long-term conflicts,

192
0:10:25.311,000 --> 0:10:28,000
coming together and defying the official power

193
0:10:29.311,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to form alliances and find their own ways to ending violence in their communities.

194
0:10:36.921,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And as an activist, I've traveled to places

195
0:10:39.809,000 --> 0:10:42,000
where it's dangerous to be born a woman,

196
0:10:43.512,000 --> 0:10:45,000
like eastern Congo,

197
0:10:45.589,000 --> 0:10:49,000
where a war is being waged on the bodies of women.

198
0:10:50.528,000 --> 0:10:54,000
There, at a healing and leadership center called City of Joy,

199
0:10:54.788,000 --> 0:10:59,000
brave Congolese women are transforming pain into power

200
0:11:00.209,000 --> 0:11:03,000
by training survivors of sexual assault

201
0:11:03.873,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to return to their villages as leaders.

202
0:11:07.868,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And at recent climate summits,

203
0:11:10.028,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I've observed women climate leaders working behinds the scenes,

204
0:11:14.175,000 --> 0:11:16,000
out of the public spotlight,

205
0:11:16.331,000 --> 0:11:2,000
making sure that the negotiations toward global climate agreement

206
0:11:21.252,000 --> 0:11:23,000
continue to move forward.

207
0:11:23.474,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So as we move forward in our lives and work

208
0:11:26.431,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and we have more power and influence,

209
0:11:28.878,000 --> 0:11:3,000
let's change the nature of power

210
0:11:31.399,000 --> 0:11:36,000
by dismantling some of the barriers that remain for those who follow

211
0:11:36.935,000 --> 0:11:38,000
by advocating and agitating

212
0:11:39.299,000 --> 0:11:43,000
for fairer and truer and more equal representation

213
0:11:43.778,000 --> 0:11:46,000
in every room and at every table.

214
0:11:48.22,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Now, be warned:

215
0:11:50.447,000 --> 0:11:52,000
if you advocate for a woman

216
0:11:52.915,000 --> 0:11:55,000
for an open position or promotion,

217
0:11:55.966,000 --> 0:11:57,000
you could be challenged with,

218
0:11:58.463,000 --> 0:12:,000
"You're playing the women's card"

219
0:12:01.479,000 --> 0:12:03,000
or "the race card"

220
0:12:03.943,000 --> 0:12:05,000
if advocating for a woman of color.

221
0:12:07.419,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I've had this experience, as I'm sure you have.

222
0:12:11.2,000 --> 0:12:15,000
"Are you running an affirmative action program here at PBS?"

223
0:12:15.754,000 --> 0:12:18,000
asked one of my board members when, as a new president,

224
0:12:19.34,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I announced my first hires as five qualified women.

225
0:12:23.975,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Now, my affirmative action had been

226
0:12:26.527,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to ask that the search firm bring me a candidate list

227
0:12:30.422,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that included the names of women and people of color

228
0:12:33.455,000 --> 0:12:35,000
who just happened to be, in my judgment,

229
0:12:36.179,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the best candidates for the position as well.

230
0:12:41.632,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I say, dangerous women

231
0:12:44.218,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and our allies:

232
0:12:46.274,000 --> 0:12:49,000
it's time to play the women's card,

233
0:12:49.782,000 --> 0:12:5,000
play the race card,

234
0:12:50.965,000 --> 0:12:51,000
play all our cards.

235
0:12:52.806,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Applause)

236
0:13:00.552,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Not to win the power game,

237
0:13:03.926,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but to lead to better outcomes

238
0:13:06.625,000 --> 0:13:07,000
for everyone.

239
0:13:08.596,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And it's time, too,

240
0:13:10.218,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to discard that scarcity theory,

241
0:13:13.467,000 --> 0:13:14,000
the one that says,

242
0:13:14.891,000 --> 0:13:17,000
there's only room for one of us at the top,

243
0:13:18.213,000 --> 0:13:2,000
so protect your turf,

244
0:13:20.973,000 --> 0:13:22,000
don't make friends or allies.

245
0:13:24.519,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Changing the nature of power

246
0:13:26.536,000 --> 0:13:29,000
transforms "protect your turf" into "share your turf,"

247
0:13:30.269,000 --> 0:13:31,000
it encourages coalitions,

248
0:13:31.961,000 --> 0:13:32,000
it builds alliances,

249
0:13:33.563,000 --> 0:13:36,000
it strengthens and sustains friendships.

250
0:13:37.948,000 --> 0:13:42,000
My women friends are my source of renewable energy.

251
0:13:43.982,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

252
0:13:49.064,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So are my mentors, my champions,

253
0:13:52.364,000 --> 0:13:54,000
my supporters, my sponsors,

254
0:13:55.044,000 --> 0:14:,000
and all of the ways that we can and do show up for each other.

255
0:14:01.4,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We can become our sources of renewable power

256
0:14:08.018,000 --> 0:14:09,000
for each other.

257
0:14:10.168,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And along the way,

258
0:14:12.66,000 --> 0:14:14,000
we need to take better care of ourselves,

259
0:14:14.784,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and here, I am not the best role model.

260
0:14:18.019,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I don't meditate.

261
0:14:19.837,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I don't exercise regularly.

262
0:14:22.996,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But I do live aerobically.

263
0:14:26.715,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Laughter)

264
0:14:30.225,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Applause)

265
0:14:34.776,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Because I believe we can't be dangerous

266
0:14:39.017,000 --> 0:14:4,000
from the sidelines,

267
0:14:41.239,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and there's just too much to be done.

268
0:14:46.121,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So let's use all our power.

269
0:14:47.961,000 --> 0:14:48,000
How about the power of money?

270
0:14:50.334,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Let's allocate more of our philanthropic dollars,

271
0:14:54.342,000 --> 0:14:55,000
our campaign donations,

272
0:14:56.171,000 --> 0:14:58,000
our investment funds,

273
0:14:58.257,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to increase economic and political equity.

274
0:15:02.872,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And let's leverage the power of media and technology

275
0:15:06.383,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that we have in our hands, quite literally,

276
0:15:10.037,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to elevate each other's stories and ideas;

277
0:15:15.504,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to practice civility;

278
0:15:17.641,000 --> 0:15:18,000
to seek the truth,

279
0:15:19.988,000 --> 0:15:2,000
which is diminishing

280
0:15:21.805,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and is threatening free and open societies.

281
0:15:26.535,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Yes, we have all that we need to move our communities forward.

282
0:15:34.257,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And the best thing we have,

283
0:15:36.848,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and what we must remember,

284
0:15:39.164,000 --> 0:15:41,000
is to be there for each other.

285
0:15:42.196,000 --> 0:15:44,000
We will move forward together,

286
0:15:45.064,000 --> 0:15:48,000
willing now to take more risk,

287
0:15:48.116,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to be more fearless,

288
0:15:50.689,000 --> 0:15:52,000
to speak up, speak out

289
0:15:53.679,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and show up

290
0:15:55.473,000 --> 0:15:56,000
for one another.

291
0:15:57.782,000 --> 0:15:59,000
George Bernard Shaw once wrote

292
0:16:00.249,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that he believed in his opinion that his life belonged to the community,

293
0:16:05.758,000 --> 0:16:08,000
that the harder he worked, the more he lived

294
0:16:08.88,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and that he wanted to be thoroughly used up when he died.

295
0:16:13.509,000 --> 0:16:14,000
He went on to write,

296
0:16:15.224,000 --> 0:16:18,000
"Life is no brief candle to me

297
0:16:18.828,000 --> 0:16:2,000
but a splendid torch

298
0:16:21.046,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that I have got hold of for a moment

299
0:16:23.855,000 --> 0:16:26,000
before passing to future generations."

300
0:16:28.532,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I, too, do not view my life as a brief candle,

301
0:16:33.026,000 --> 0:16:35,000
although I am burning it at both ends.

302
0:16:35.805,000 --> 0:16:36,000
(Laughter)

303
0:16:37.154,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And I do want it, and me,

304
0:16:40.493,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to be thoroughly used up when I die.

305
0:16:46.231,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But at this point in my life's journey,

306
0:16:49.967,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I am not passing my torch.

307
0:16:53.247,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I am holding it higher than ever,

308
0:16:57.556,000 --> 0:16:59,000
boldly, brilliantly,

309
0:17:00.981,000 --> 0:17:05,000
inviting you to join me in its dangerous light.

310
0:17:07.71,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Thank you.

311
0:17:08.9,000 --> 0:17:1,000
(Applause)

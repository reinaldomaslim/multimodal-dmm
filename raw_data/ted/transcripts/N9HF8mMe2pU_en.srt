1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to share with you something my father taught me:

2
0:00:17.141,000 --> 0:00:19,000
no condition is permanent.

3
0:00:21.103,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's a lesson he shared with me again and again,

4
0:00:24.011,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I learned it to be true the hard way.

5
0:00:28.41,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Here I am in my fourth-grade class.

6
0:00:31.351,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is my yearbook picture taken in my class in school

7
0:00:35.109,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in Monrovia, Liberia.

8
0:00:37.334,000 --> 0:00:41,000
My parents migrated from India to West Africa in the 1970s,

9
0:00:41.759,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I had the privilege of growing up there.

10
0:00:45.592,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I was nine years old,

11
0:00:46.766,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I loved kicking around a soccer ball,

12
0:00:48.552,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I was a total math and science geek.

13
0:00:50.823,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was living the kind of life that, really, any child would dream of.

14
0:00:57.1,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But no condition is permanent.

15
0:01:00.166,000 --> 0:01:02,000
On Christmas Eve in 1989,

16
0:01:03.113,000 --> 0:01:05,000
civil war erupted in Liberia.

17
0:01:06.902,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The war started in the rural countryside,

18
0:01:08.88,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and within months, rebel armies had marched towards our hometown.

19
0:01:12.611,000 --> 0:01:13,000
My school shut down,

20
0:01:14.305,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and when the rebel armies captured the only international airport,

21
0:01:17.801,000 --> 0:01:19,000
people started panicking and fleeing.

22
0:01:21.57,000 --> 0:01:24,000
My mom came knocking one morning and said, "Raj, pack your things --

23
0:01:24.952,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we have to go."

24
0:01:26.815,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We were rushed to the center of town,

25
0:01:29.068,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and there on a tarmac, we were split into two lines.

26
0:01:34.453,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I stood with my family in one line,

27
0:01:36.97,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch

28
0:01:39.394,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of a rescue plane.

29
0:01:41.194,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And there on a bench, I was sitting with my heart racing.

30
0:01:44.105,000 --> 0:01:46,000
As I looked out the open hatch,

31
0:01:46.548,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I saw hundreds of Liberians in another line,

32
0:01:49.411,000 --> 0:01:5,000
children strapped to their backs.

33
0:01:52.334,000 --> 0:01:54,000
When they tried to jump in with us,

34
0:01:55.204,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I watched soldiers restrain them.

35
0:01:58.511,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They were not allowed to flee.

36
0:02:00.997,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We were the lucky ones.

37
0:02:03.165,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We lost what we had,

38
0:02:04.945,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but we resettled in America,

39
0:02:07.381,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and as immigrants, we benefitted from the community of supporters

40
0:02:10.536,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that rallied around us.

41
0:02:13.752,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They took my family into their home,

42
0:02:15.579,000 --> 0:02:16,000
they mentored me.

43
0:02:17.916,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And they helped my dad start a clothing shop.

44
0:02:20.083,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I'd visit my father on weekends as a teenager

45
0:02:22.476,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to help him sell sneakers and jeans.

46
0:02:24.954,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And every time business would get bad,

47
0:02:27.311,000 --> 0:02:29,000
he'd remind me of that mantra:

48
0:02:29.818,000 --> 0:02:3,000
no condition is permanent.

49
0:02:32.613,000 --> 0:02:36,000
That mantra and my parents' persistence and that community of supporters

50
0:02:37.066,000 --> 0:02:39,000
made it possible for me to go through college

51
0:02:39.415,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and eventually to medical school.

52
0:02:42.185,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,

53
0:02:45.857,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but because of them,

54
0:02:47.149,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I had a chance to pursue my dream to become a doctor.

55
0:02:50.866,000 --> 0:02:52,000
My condition had changed.

56
0:02:54.609,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It had been 15 years since I escaped that airfield,

57
0:02:57.27,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but the memory of those two lines had not escaped my mind.

58
0:03:00.063,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I was a medical student in my mid-20s,

59
0:03:02.607,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I wanted to go back

60
0:03:03.865,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to see if I could serve the people we'd left behind.

61
0:03:07.605,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But when I got back,

62
0:03:08.779,000 --> 0:03:09,000
what I found was utter destruction.

63
0:03:10.63,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The war had left us with just 51 doctors

64
0:03:12.775,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to serve a country of four million people.

65
0:03:15.237,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It would be like the city of San Francisco having just 10 doctors.

66
0:03:19.229,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So if you got sick in the city where those few doctors remain,

67
0:03:22.328,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you might stand a chance.

68
0:03:23.801,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But if you got sick in the remote, rural rainforest communities,

69
0:03:27.691,000 --> 0:03:29,000
where you could be days from the nearest clinic --

70
0:03:30.08,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I was seeing my patients die from conditions no one should die from,

71
0:03:33.845,000 --> 0:03:35,000
all because they were getting to me too late.

72
0:03:36.012,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Imagine you have a two-year-old who wakes up one morning with a fever,

73
0:03:39.458,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and you realize she could have malaria,

74
0:03:41.886,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and you know the only way to get her the medicine she needs

75
0:03:44.911,000 --> 0:03:45,000
would be to take her to the riverbed,

76
0:03:46.788,000 --> 0:03:48,000
get in a canoe, paddle to the other side

77
0:03:48.887,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and then walk for up to two days through the forest

78
0:03:51.526,000 --> 0:03:52,000
just to reach the nearest clinic.

79
0:03:53.977,000 --> 0:03:56,000
One billion people live in the world's most remote communities,

80
0:03:57.12,000 --> 0:04:,000
and despite the advances we've made in modern medicine and technology,

81
0:04:00.789,000 --> 0:04:02,000
our innovations are not reaching the last mile.

82
0:04:03.512,000 --> 0:04:04,000
These communities have been left behind,

83
0:04:05.497,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because they've been thought too hard to reach

84
0:04:07.72,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and too difficult to serve.

85
0:04:10.102,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Illness is universal;

86
0:04:11.813,000 --> 0:04:13,000
access to care is not.

87
0:04:14.042,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.

88
0:04:16.628,000 --> 0:04:2,000
No one should die because they live too far from a doctor or clinic.

89
0:04:20.91,000 --> 0:04:22,000
No condition should be permanent.

90
0:04:25.181,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And help in this case didn't come from the outside,

91
0:04:27.848,000 --> 0:04:28,000
it actually came from within.

92
0:04:29.525,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It came from the communities themselves.

93
0:04:31.998,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Meet Musu.

94
0:04:33.381,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Way out in rural Liberia,

95
0:04:34.79,000 --> 0:04:38,000
where most girls have not had a chance to finish primary school,

96
0:04:38.983,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Musu had been persistent.

97
0:04:41.913,000 --> 0:04:43,000
At the age of 18, she completed high school,

98
0:04:44.258,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and she came back to her community.

99
0:04:46.558,000 --> 0:04:48,000
She saw that none of the children were getting treatment

100
0:04:49.254,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for the diseases they needed treatment for --

101
0:04:51.405,000 --> 0:04:53,000
deadly diseases, like malaria and pneumonia.

102
0:04:53.749,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So she signed up to be a volunteer.

103
0:04:57.659,000 --> 0:05:,000
There are millions of volunteers like Musu in rural parts around our world,

104
0:05:01.324,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we got to thinking --

105
0:05:03.121,000 --> 0:05:06,000
community members like Musu could actually help us solve a puzzle.

106
0:05:07.923,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Our health care system is structured in such a way

107
0:05:10.624,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that the work of diagnosing disease and prescribing medicines

108
0:05:14.356,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is limited to a team of nurses and doctors like me.

109
0:05:18.238,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But nurses and doctors are concentrated in cities,

110
0:05:20.907,000 --> 0:05:23,000
so rural communities like Musu's have been left behind.

111
0:05:24.722,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So we started asking some questions:

112
0:05:26.501,000 --> 0:05:28,000
What if we could reorganize the medical care system?

113
0:05:29.058,000 --> 0:05:31,000
What if we could have community members like Musu

114
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
be a part or even be the center of our medical team?

115
0:05:35.301,000 --> 0:05:38,000
What if Musu could help us bring health care from clinics in cities

116
0:05:39.25,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to the doorsteps of her neighbors?

117
0:05:42.961,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Musu was 48 when I met her.

118
0:05:45.836,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And despite her amazing talent and grit,

119
0:05:48.913,000 --> 0:05:51,000
she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.

120
0:05:53.283,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So what if technology could support her?

121
0:05:56.204,000 --> 0:06:,000
What if we could invest in her with real training,

122
0:06:00.522,000 --> 0:06:02,000
equip her with real medicines,

123
0:06:03.648,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and have her have a real job?

124
0:06:08.224,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Well, in 2007, I was trying to answer these questions,

125
0:06:12.712,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and my wife and I were getting married that year.

126
0:06:15.92,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We asked our relatives to forgo the wedding registry gifts

127
0:06:20.437,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and instead donate some money

128
0:06:22.011,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so we could have some start-up money to launch a nonprofit.

129
0:06:25.938,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I promise you, I'm a lot more romantic than that.

130
0:06:28.399,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

131
0:06:29.983,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We ended up raising $6,000,

132
0:06:32.4,000 --> 0:06:34,000
teamed up with some Liberians and Americans

133
0:06:34.552,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and launched a nonprofit called Last Mile Health.

134
0:06:37.314,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Our goal is to bring a health worker within reach of everyone, everywhere.

135
0:06:42.241,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We designed a three-step process --

136
0:06:44.199,000 --> 0:06:45,000
train, equip and pay --

137
0:06:45.687,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to invest more deeply in volunteers like Musu

138
0:06:49.068,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to become paraprofessionals,

139
0:06:50.691,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to become community health workers.

140
0:06:52.889,000 --> 0:06:56,000
First we trained Musu to prevent, diagnose and treat

141
0:06:57.47,000 --> 0:07:,000
the top 10 diseases afflicting families in her village.

142
0:07:01.723,000 --> 0:07:04,000
A nurse supervisor visited her every month to coach her.

143
0:07:05.703,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We equipped her with modern medical technology,

144
0:07:08.268,000 --> 0:07:11,000
like this $1 malaria rapid test,

145
0:07:11.662,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and put it in a backpack full of medicines like this

146
0:07:15.415,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to treat infections like pneumonia,

147
0:07:18.41,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and crucially,

148
0:07:20.001,000 --> 0:07:24,000
a smartphone, to help her track and report on epidemics.

149
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Last, we recognized the dignity in Musu's work.

150
0:07:28.281,000 --> 0:07:3,000
With the Liberian government, we created a contract,

151
0:07:30.738,000 --> 0:07:31,000
paid her

152
0:07:32.048,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and gave her the chance to have a real job.

153
0:07:34.165,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And she's amazing.

154
0:07:35.358,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Musu has learned over 30 medical skills,

155
0:07:38.868,000 --> 0:07:4,000
from screening children for malnutrition,

156
0:07:41.651,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to assessing the cause of a child's cough with a smartphone,

157
0:07:45.148,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to supporting people with HIV

158
0:07:48.293,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and providing follow-up care to patients who've lost their limbs.

159
0:07:53.785,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Working as part of our team,

160
0:07:55.894,000 --> 0:07:56,000
working as paraprofessionals,

161
0:07:57.443,000 --> 0:07:59,000
community health workers can help ensure

162
0:07:59.696,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that a lot of what your family doctor would do

163
0:08:02.017,000 --> 0:08:05,000
reaches the places that most family doctors could never go.

164
0:08:05.861,000 --> 0:08:07,000
One of my favorite things to do is to care for patients

165
0:08:08.826,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with community health workers.

166
0:08:10.299,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So last year I was visiting A.B.,

167
0:08:12.636,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and like Musu, A.B. had had a chance to go to school.

168
0:08:16.299,000 --> 0:08:19,000
He was in middle school, in the eighth grade,

169
0:08:19.4,000 --> 0:08:2,000
when his parents died.

170
0:08:20.69,000 --> 0:08:22,000
He became an orphan and had to drop out.

171
0:08:24.739,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Last year, we hired and trained A.B. as a community health worker.

172
0:08:30.035,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And while he was making door to door house calls,

173
0:08:32.925,000 --> 0:08:34,000
he met this young boy named Prince,

174
0:08:35.172,000 --> 0:08:38,000
whose mother had had trouble breastfeeding him,

175
0:08:38.469,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and by the age of six months, Prince had started to waste away.

176
0:08:41.705,000 --> 0:08:44,000
A.B. had just been taught how to use this color-coded measuring tape

177
0:08:45.338,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that wraps around the upper arm of a child to diagnose malnutrition.

178
0:08:48.908,000 --> 0:08:5,000
A.B. noticed that Prince was in the red zone,

179
0:08:51.323,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which meant he had to be hospitalized.

180
0:08:53.238,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So A.B. took Prince and his mother to the river,

181
0:08:55.904,000 --> 0:08:56,000
got in a canoe

182
0:08:57.095,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and paddled for four hours to get to the hospital.

183
0:08:59.779,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Later, after Prince was discharged,

184
0:09:02.802,000 --> 0:09:06,000
A.B. taught mom how to feed baby a food supplement.

185
0:09:07.683,000 --> 0:09:09,000
A few months ago,

186
0:09:09.746,000 --> 0:09:12,000
A.B. took me to visit Prince, and he's a chubby little guy.

187
0:09:12.986,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:14.141,000 --> 0:09:17,000
He's meeting his milestones, he's pulled himself up to a stand,

189
0:09:17.337,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and is even starting to say a few words.

190
0:09:19.318,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I'm so inspired by these community health workers.

191
0:09:21.841,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I often ask them why they do what they do,

192
0:09:24.153,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and when I asked A.B.,

193
0:09:26.774,000 --> 0:09:29,000
he said, "Doc, since I dropped out of school, this is the first time

194
0:09:30.773,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I'm having a chance to hold a pen to write.

195
0:09:33.856,000 --> 0:09:35,000
My brain is getting fresh."

196
0:09:37.924,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The stories of A.B. and Musu have taught me something fundamental

197
0:09:41.626,000 --> 0:09:42,000
about being human.

198
0:09:44.096,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Our will to serve others

199
0:09:47.249,000 --> 0:09:5,000
can actually help us transform our own conditions.

200
0:09:51.532,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I was so moved by how powerful the will to serve our neighbors can be

201
0:09:55.65,000 --> 0:09:56,000
a few years ago,

202
0:09:57.824,000 --> 0:09:59,000
when we faced a global catastrophe.

203
0:10:00.48,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In December 2013,

204
0:10:02.206,000 --> 0:10:05,000
something happened in the rainforests across the border from us in Guinea.

205
0:10:05.805,000 --> 0:10:09,000
A toddler named Emile fell sick with vomiting, fever and diarrhea.

206
0:10:10.429,000 --> 0:10:12,000
He lived in an area where the roads were sparse

207
0:10:12.762,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and there had been massive shortages of health workers.

208
0:10:16.652,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Emile died,

209
0:10:17.832,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and a few weeks later his sister died,

210
0:10:19.713,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and a few weeks later his mother died.

211
0:10:21.657,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And this disease would spread from one community to another.

212
0:10:24.856,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And it wasn't until three months later

213
0:10:26.905,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that the world recognized this as Ebola.

214
0:10:30.124,000 --> 0:10:32,000
When every minute counted, we had already lost months,

215
0:10:32.846,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and by then the virus had spread like wildfire all across West Africa,

216
0:10:36.323,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and eventually to other parts of the world.

217
0:10:38.373,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Businesses shut down, airlines started canceling routes.

218
0:10:41.695,000 --> 0:10:42,000
At the height of the crisis,

219
0:10:43.135,000 --> 0:10:47,000
when we were told that 1.4 million people could be infected,

220
0:10:47.604,000 --> 0:10:5,000
when we were told that most of them would die,

221
0:10:51.131,000 --> 0:10:53,000
when we had nearly lost all hope,

222
0:10:55.498,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I remember standing with a group of health workers

223
0:10:58.394,000 --> 0:11:,000
in the rainforest where an outbreak had just happened.

224
0:11:01.176,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We were helping train and equip them to put on the masks,

225
0:11:04.189,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the gloves and the gowns that they needed

226
0:11:06.253,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to keep themselves safe from the virus

227
0:11:08.272,000 --> 0:11:1,000
while they were serving their patients.

228
0:11:10.604,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I remember the fear in their eyes.

229
0:11:14.312,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And I remember staying up at night, terrified if I'd made the right call

230
0:11:20.339,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to keep them in the field.

231
0:11:22.577,000 --> 0:11:25,000
When Ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees,

232
0:11:27.316,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Liberia's community health workers didn't surrender to fear.

233
0:11:31.599,000 --> 0:11:33,000
They did what they had always done:

234
0:11:33.951,000 --> 0:11:35,000
they answered the call to serve their neighbors.

235
0:11:37.406,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Community members across Liberia learned the symptoms of Ebola,

236
0:11:41.198,000 --> 0:11:44,000
teamed up with nurses and doctors to go door-to-door to find the sick

237
0:11:44.775,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and get them into care.

238
0:11:46.355,000 --> 0:11:49,000
They tracked thousands of people who had been exposed to the virus

239
0:11:49.789,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and helped break the chain of transmission.

240
0:11:52.236,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Some ten thousand community health workers risked their own lives

241
0:11:55.57,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to help hunt down this virus and stop it in its tracks.

242
0:11:59.347,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Applause)

243
0:12:06.516,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Today, Ebola has come under control in West Africa,

244
0:12:10.05,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and we've learned a few things.

245
0:12:12.169,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We've learned that blind spots in rural health care

246
0:12:14.791,000 --> 0:12:15,000
can lead to hot spots of disease,

247
0:12:16.613,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and that places all of us at greater risk.

248
0:12:19.522,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We've learned that the most efficient emergency system

249
0:12:22.238,000 --> 0:12:24,000
is actually an everyday system,

250
0:12:24.29,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and that system has to reach all communities,

251
0:12:27.04,000 --> 0:12:29,000
including rural communities like Emile's.

252
0:12:30.36,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And most of all,

253
0:12:31.535,000 --> 0:12:34,000
we've learned from the courage of Liberia's community health workers

254
0:12:35.02,000 --> 0:12:38,000
that we as people are not defined by the conditions we face,

255
0:12:38.765,000 --> 0:12:4,000
no matter how hopeless they seem.

256
0:12:41.96,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We're defined by how we respond to them.

257
0:12:46.12,000 --> 0:12:48,000
For the past 15 years,

258
0:12:49.069,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I've seen the power of this idea

259
0:12:51.096,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to transform everyday citizens into community health workers --

260
0:12:55.217,000 --> 0:12:56,000
into everyday heroes.

261
0:12:57.944,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And I've seen it play out everywhere,

262
0:12:59.77,000 --> 0:13:01,000
from the forest communities of West Africa,

263
0:13:01.852,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.

264
0:13:04.799,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It's true,

265
0:13:05.973,000 --> 0:13:08,000
these community health workers aren't doing neurosurgery,

266
0:13:09.046,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but they're making it possible

267
0:13:10.562,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to bring health care within reach of everyone everywhere.

268
0:13:15.465,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So now what?

269
0:13:17.632,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Well, we know that there are still millions of people dying

270
0:13:21.42,000 --> 0:13:22,000
from preventable causes

271
0:13:23.193,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in rural communities around the world.

272
0:13:25.092,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And we know that the great majority of these deaths are happening

273
0:13:28.957,000 --> 0:13:3,000
in these 75 blue-shaded countries.

274
0:13:31.669,000 --> 0:13:32,000
What we also know

275
0:13:32.844,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is that if we trained an army of community health workers

276
0:13:36.311,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills,

277
0:13:40.328,000 --> 0:13:44,000
we could save the lives of nearly 30 million people by 2030.

278
0:13:45.472,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Thirty services could save 30 million lives by 2030.

279
0:13:50.141,000 --> 0:13:51,000
That's not just a blueprint --

280
0:13:51.908,000 --> 0:13:52,000
we're proving this can be done.

281
0:13:53.727,000 --> 0:13:54,000
In Liberia,

282
0:13:54.911,000 --> 0:13:58,000
the Liberian government is training thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu

283
0:13:59.2,000 --> 0:14:,000
after Ebola,

284
0:14:00.382,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to bring health care to every child and family in the country.

285
0:14:03.883,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And we've been honored to work with them,

286
0:14:05.938,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and are now teaming up with a number of organizations

287
0:14:08.47,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that are working across other countries

288
0:14:10.716,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to try to help them do the same thing.

289
0:14:13.825,000 --> 0:14:15,000
If we could help these countries scale,

290
0:14:17.37,000 --> 0:14:18,000
we could save millions of lives,

291
0:14:19.026,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and at the same time,

292
0:14:20.406,000 --> 0:14:21,000
we could create millions of jobs.

293
0:14:23.695,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We simply can't do that, though, without technology.

294
0:14:27.106,000 --> 0:14:3,000
People are worried that technology is going to steal our jobs,

295
0:14:30.218,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but when it comes to community health workers,

296
0:14:32.441,000 --> 0:14:35,000
technology has actually been vital for creating jobs.

297
0:14:35.721,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Without technology -- without this smartphone,

298
0:14:38.161,000 --> 0:14:4,000
without this rapid test --

299
0:14:41.78,000 --> 0:14:45,000
it would have been impossible for us to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.

300
0:14:47.284,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And I think it's time for technology to help us train,

301
0:14:49.99,000 --> 0:14:52,000
to help us train people faster and better than ever before.

302
0:14:54.398,000 --> 0:14:55,000
As a doctor,

303
0:14:55.572,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I use technology to stay up-to-date and keep certified.

304
0:14:59.087,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I use smartphones, I use apps, I use online courses.

305
0:15:01.806,000 --> 0:15:03,000
But when A.B. wants to learn,

306
0:15:04.042,000 --> 0:15:06,000
he's got to jump back in that canoe

307
0:15:06.972,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and get to the training center.

308
0:15:08.636,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And when Musu shows up for training,

309
0:15:11.53,000 --> 0:15:14,000
her instructors are stuck using flip charts and markers.

310
0:15:15.967,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Why shouldn't they have the same access to learn as I do?

311
0:15:22.204,000 --> 0:15:25,000
If we truly want community health workers to master those lifesaving skills

312
0:15:25.856,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and even more,

313
0:15:27.918,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we've got to change this old-school model of education.

314
0:15:32.102,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Tech can truly be a game changer here.

315
0:15:34.024,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I've been in awe of the digital education revolution

316
0:15:37.593,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that the likes of Khan Academy and edX have been leading.

317
0:15:41.861,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And I've been thinking that it's time;

318
0:15:44.378,000 --> 0:15:45,000
it's time for a collision

319
0:15:45.793,000 --> 0:15:47,000
between the digital education revolution

320
0:15:48.128,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and the community health revolution.

321
0:15:51.303,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And so, this brings me to my TED Prize wish.

322
0:15:55.579,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I wish --

323
0:15:57.404,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I wish that you would help us recruit

324
0:15:59.634,000 --> 0:16:02,000
the largest army of community health workers the world has ever known

325
0:16:03.888,000 --> 0:16:05,000
by creating the Community Health Academy,

326
0:16:06.737,000 --> 0:16:09,000
a global platform to train, connect and empower.

327
0:16:10.617,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Applause)

328
0:16:11.808,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Thank you.

329
0:16:12.995,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Applause)

330
0:16:16.621,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Thank you.

331
0:16:19.636,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Here's the idea:

332
0:16:21.204,000 --> 0:16:23,000
we'll create and curate

333
0:16:23.886,000 --> 0:16:26,000
the best in digital education resources.

334
0:16:28.622,000 --> 0:16:32,000
We will bring those to community health workers around the world,

335
0:16:33.281,000 --> 0:16:34,000
including A.B. and Musu.

336
0:16:34.558,000 --> 0:16:36,000
They'll get video lessons on giving kids vaccines

337
0:16:37.384,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and have online courses on spotting the next outbreak,

338
0:16:40.621,000 --> 0:16:41,000
so they're not stuck using flip charts.

339
0:16:42.528,000 --> 0:16:45,000
We'll help these countries accredit these workers,

340
0:16:46.388,000 --> 0:16:5,000
so that they're not stuck remaining an under-recognized, undervalued group,

341
0:16:51.119,000 --> 0:16:53,000
but become a renowned, empowered profession,

342
0:16:53.88,000 --> 0:16:54,000
just like nurses and doctors.

343
0:16:57.226,000 --> 0:17:,000
And we'll create a network of companies and entrepreneurs

344
0:17:00.573,000 --> 0:17:02,000
who've created innovations that can save lives

345
0:17:02.873,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and help them connect to workers like Musu,

346
0:17:05.277,000 --> 0:17:07,000
so she can help better serve her community.

347
0:17:08.779,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And we'll work tirelessly to persuade governments

348
0:17:12.009,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to make community health workers a cornerstone of their health care plans.

349
0:17:17.554,000 --> 0:17:2,000
We plan to test and prototype the academy in Liberia

350
0:17:21.367,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and a few other partner countries,

351
0:17:23.263,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and then we plan to take it global,

352
0:17:25.074,000 --> 0:17:27,000
including to rural North America.

353
0:17:27.923,000 --> 0:17:28,000
With the power of this platform,

354
0:17:29.537,000 --> 0:17:31,000
we believe countries can be more persuaded

355
0:17:32.123,000 --> 0:17:35,000
that a health care revolution really is possible.

356
0:17:36.29,000 --> 0:17:4,000
My dream is that this academy will contribute to the training

357
0:17:40.402,000 --> 0:17:42,000
of hundreds of thousands of community members

358
0:17:42.638,000 --> 0:17:44,000
to help bring health care to their neighbors --

359
0:17:45.561,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the hundreds of millions of them

360
0:17:47.195,000 --> 0:17:49,000
that live in the world's most remote communities,

361
0:17:50.605,000 --> 0:17:52,000
from the forest communities of West Africa,

362
0:17:52.71,000 --> 0:17:54,000
to the fishing villages of rural Alaska;

363
0:17:54.874,000 --> 0:17:58,000
from the hilltops of Appalachia, to the mountains of Afghanistan.

364
0:17:58.96,000 --> 0:18:,000
If this vision is aligned with yours,

365
0:18:01.674,000 --> 0:18:04,000
head to communityhealthacademy.org,

366
0:18:05.56,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and join this revolution.

367
0:18:08.356,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Let us know if you or your organization or someone you know could help us

368
0:18:13.033,000 --> 0:18:16,000
as we try to build this academy over the next year.

369
0:18:17.394,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Now, as I look out into this room,

370
0:18:20.13,000 --> 0:18:22,000
I realize that our journeys are not self-made;

371
0:18:22.86,000 --> 0:18:23,000
they're shaped by others.

372
0:18:24.393,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And there have been so many here that have been part of this cause.

373
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
We're so honored to be part of this community,

374
0:18:31.494,000 --> 0:18:33,000
and a community that's willing to take on a cause

375
0:18:34.201,000 --> 0:18:35,000
as audacious as this one,

376
0:18:35.593,000 --> 0:18:37,000
so I wanted to offer, as I end,

377
0:18:37.692,000 --> 0:18:38,000
a reflection.

378
0:18:39.806,000 --> 0:18:41,000
I think a lot more about what my father taught me.

379
0:18:43.546,000 --> 0:18:45,000
These days, I too have become a dad.

380
0:18:45.771,000 --> 0:18:47,000
I have two sons,

381
0:18:47.811,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and my wife and I just learned that she's pregnant with our third child.

382
0:18:51.823,000 --> 0:18:52,000
(Applause)

383
0:18:52.855,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Thank you.

384
0:18:53.946,000 --> 0:18:54,000
(Applause)

385
0:18:55.876,000 --> 0:18:57,000
I was recently caring for a woman in Liberia

386
0:18:58.728,000 --> 0:19:,000
who, like my wife, was in her third pregnancy.

387
0:19:02.191,000 --> 0:19:03,000
But unlike my wife,

388
0:19:04.778,000 --> 0:19:06,000
had had no prenatal care with her first two babies.

389
0:19:09.369,000 --> 0:19:13,000
She lived in an isolated community in the forest that had gone for 100 years

390
0:19:13.785,000 --> 0:19:14,000
without any health care

391
0:19:16.333,000 --> 0:19:17,000
until ...

392
0:19:17.985,000 --> 0:19:2,000
until last year when a nurse trained her neighbors

393
0:19:21.392,000 --> 0:19:22,000
to become community health workers.

394
0:19:23.127,000 --> 0:19:24,000
So here I was,

395
0:19:24.443,000 --> 0:19:28,000
seeing this patient who was in her second trimester,

396
0:19:28.707,000 --> 0:19:31,000
and I pulled out the ultrasound to check on the baby,

397
0:19:32.003,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and she started telling us stories about her first two kids,

398
0:19:35.566,000 --> 0:19:38,000
and I had the ultrasound probe on her belly,

399
0:19:38.788,000 --> 0:19:4,000
and she just stopped mid-sentence.

400
0:19:43.041,000 --> 0:19:44,000
She turned to me and she said,

401
0:19:44.606,000 --> 0:19:46,000
"Doc, what's that sound?"

402
0:19:49.191,000 --> 0:19:52,000
It was the first time she'd ever heard her baby's heartbeat.

403
0:19:53.931,000 --> 0:19:58,000
And her eyes lit up in the same way my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up

404
0:19:59.015,000 --> 0:20:01,000
when we heard our baby's heartbeat.

405
0:20:03.364,000 --> 0:20:05,000
For all of human history,

406
0:20:05.541,000 --> 0:20:09,000
illness has been universal and access to care has not.

407
0:20:10.097,000 --> 0:20:11,000
But as a wise man once told me:

408
0:20:13.51,000 --> 0:20:15,000
no condition is permanent.

409
0:20:17.311,000 --> 0:20:18,000
It's time.

410
0:20:18.563,000 --> 0:20:2,000
It's time for us to go as far as it takes

411
0:20:20.91,000 --> 0:20:22,000
to change this condition together.

412
0:20:23.514,000 --> 0:20:24,000
Thank you.

413
0:20:24.692,000 --> 0:20:28,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.309,000 --> 0:00:15,000
As a singer-songwriter,

2
0:00:15.412,000 --> 0:00:18,000
people often ask me about my influences or, as I like to call them,

3
0:00:19.151,000 --> 0:00:21,000
my sonic lineages.

4
0:00:21.563,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And I could easily tell you

5
0:00:23.215,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that I was shaped by the jazz and hip hop that I grew up with,

6
0:00:26.659,000 --> 0:00:29,000
by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,

7
0:00:29.994,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or by the 1980s pop on my childhood radio stations.

8
0:00:33.783,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But beyond genre, there is another question:

9
0:00:37.398,000 --> 0:00:41,000
how do the sounds we hear every day influence the music that we make?

10
0:00:42.547,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I believe that everyday soundscape

11
0:00:44.624,000 --> 0:00:47,000
can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting,

12
0:00:48.089,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and to look at this idea a little bit more closely,

13
0:00:50.628,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm going to talk today about three things:

14
0:00:52.773,000 --> 0:00:55,000
nature, language and silence --

15
0:00:55.821,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or rather, the impossibility of true silence.

16
0:00:59.827,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And through this I hope to give you a sense of a world

17
0:01:02.381,000 --> 0:01:05,000
already alive with musical expression,

18
0:01:05.456,000 --> 0:01:08,000
with each of us serving as active participants,

19
0:01:09.461,000 --> 0:01:11,000
whether we know it or not.

20
0:01:12.136,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'm going to start today with nature, but before we do that,

21
0:01:14.978,000 --> 0:01:17,000
let's quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up.

22
0:01:18.602,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Here it is.

23
0:01:20.7,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Singing)

24
0:01:35.91,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Singing ends)

25
0:01:37.571,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

26
0:01:40.201,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Gotcha!

27
0:01:41.376,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That is actually not the sound of an opera singer warming up.

28
0:01:45.161,000 --> 0:01:47,000
That is the sound of a bird

29
0:01:47.684,000 --> 0:01:48,000
slowed down to a pace

30
0:01:49.63,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that the human ear mistakenly recognizes as its own.

31
0:01:54.012,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It was released as part of Peter Szöke's 1987 Hungarian recording

32
0:01:58.84,000 --> 0:02:,000
"The Unknown Music of Birds,"

33
0:02:01.246,000 --> 0:02:04,000
where he records many birds and slows down their pitches

34
0:02:05.141,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to reveal what's underneath.

35
0:02:07.615,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Let's listen to the full-speed recording.

36
0:02:11.65,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Bird singing)

37
0:02:15.638,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now, let's hear the two of them together

38
0:02:17.574,000 --> 0:02:18,000
so your brain can juxtapose them.

39
0:02:20.167,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Bird singing at slow then full speed)

40
0:02:38.338,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Singing ends)

41
0:02:42.063,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's incredible.

42
0:02:43.864,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Perhaps the techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong.

43
0:02:48.88,000 --> 0:02:52,000
As humans, we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers.

44
0:02:54.439,000 --> 0:02:56,000
In Ethiopia, birds are considered an integral part

45
0:02:57.367,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of the origin of music itself.

46
0:03:00.542,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The story goes like this:

47
0:03:03.538,000 --> 0:03:08,000
1,500 years ago, a young man was born in the Empire of Aksum,

48
0:03:08.595,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a major trading center of the ancient world.

49
0:03:11.525,000 --> 0:03:12,000
His name was Yared.

50
0:03:14.402,000 --> 0:03:17,000
When Yared was seven years old his father died,

51
0:03:17.634,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle, who was a priest

52
0:03:21.281,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,

53
0:03:23.6,000 --> 0:03:25,000
one of the oldest churches in the world.

54
0:03:26.892,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, this tradition has an enormous amount of scholarship and learning,

55
0:03:30.377,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and Yared had to study and study and study and study,

56
0:03:33.413,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and one day he was studying under a tree,

57
0:03:36.053,000 --> 0:03:38,000
when three birds came to him.

58
0:03:39.321,000 --> 0:03:42,000
One by one, these birds became his teachers.

59
0:03:42.912,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They taught him music -- scales, in fact.

60
0:03:47.579,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And Yared, eventually recognized as Saint Yared,

61
0:03:50.106,000 --> 0:03:54,000
used these scales to compose five volumes of chants and hymns

62
0:03:54.568,000 --> 0:03:56,000
for worship and celebration.

63
0:03:56.764,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And he used these scales to compose and to create

64
0:04:00.177,000 --> 0:04:02,000
an indigenous musical notation system.

65
0:04:03.645,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And these scales evolved into what is known as kiñit,

66
0:04:07.292,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the unique, pentatonic, five-note, modal system that is very much alive

67
0:04:13.209,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and thriving and still evolving in Ethiopia today.

68
0:04:18.531,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Now, I love this story because it's true at multiple levels.

69
0:04:21.718,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Saint Yared was a real, historical figure,

70
0:04:24.765,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and the natural world can be our musical teacher.

71
0:04:29.057,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And we have so many examples of this:

72
0:04:31.235,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the Pygmies of the Congo tune their instruments

73
0:04:33.482,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to the pitches of the birds in the forest around them.

74
0:04:36.396,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Musician and natural soundscape expert Bernie Krause describes

75
0:04:39.598,000 --> 0:04:42,000
how a healthy environment has animals and insects

76
0:04:42.996,000 --> 0:04:45,000
taking up low, medium and high-frequency bands,

77
0:04:46.448,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in exactly the same way as a symphony does.

78
0:04:50.066,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And countless works of music were inspired by bird and forest song.

79
0:04:54.972,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Yes, the natural world can be our cultural teacher.

80
0:05:00.751,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So let's go now to the uniquely human world of language.

81
0:05:05.083,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees,

82
0:05:08.351,000 --> 0:05:09,000
whether it's Mandarin Chinese,

83
0:05:09.813,000 --> 0:05:12,000
where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable

84
0:05:13.829,000 --> 0:05:14,000
an entirely different meaning,

85
0:05:15.61,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to a language like English,

86
0:05:16.976,000 --> 0:05:18,000
where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence ...

87
0:05:19.37,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Going up in pitch) implies a question?

88
0:05:21.412,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:23.045,000 --> 0:05:24,000
As an Ethiopian-American woman,

90
0:05:24.728,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I grew up around the language of Amharic, Amhariña.

91
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It was my first language, the language of my parents,

92
0:05:29.663,000 --> 0:05:31,000
one of the main languages of Ethiopia.

93
0:05:32.716,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And there are a million reasons to fall in love with this language:

94
0:05:35.934,000 --> 0:05:37,000
its depth of poetics, its double entendres,

95
0:05:38.799,000 --> 0:05:4,000
its wax and gold, its humor,

96
0:05:41.44,000 --> 0:05:44,000
its proverbs that illuminate the wisdom and follies of life.

97
0:05:46.038,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But there's also this melodicism, a musicality built right in.

98
0:05:50.734,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I find this distilled most clearly

99
0:05:52.633,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in what I like to call emphatic language --

100
0:05:55.13,000 --> 0:05:57,000
language that's meant to highlight or underline

101
0:05:57.39,000 --> 0:05:59,000
or that springs from surprise.

102
0:06:00.036,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Take, for example, the word: "indey."

103
0:06:03.204,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now, if there are Ethiopians in the audience,

104
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they're probably chuckling to themselves,

105
0:06:07.361,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because the word means something like "No!"

106
0:06:09.469,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or "How could he?" or "No, he didn't."

107
0:06:11.304,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It kind of depends on the situation.

108
0:06:13.429,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But when I was a kid, this was my very favorite word,

109
0:06:17.304,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and I think it's because it has a pitch.

110
0:06:20.721,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It has a melody.

111
0:06:21.956,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You can almost see the shape as it springs from someone's mouth.

112
0:06:24.981,000 --> 0:06:26,000
"Indey" -- it dips, and then raises again.

113
0:06:28.391,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And as a musician and composer, when I hear that word,

114
0:06:31.504,000 --> 0:06:34,000
something like this is floating through my mind.

115
0:06:35.982,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Music and singing "Indey")

116
0:06:45.832,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Music ends)

117
0:06:48.711,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Or take, for example, the phrase for "It is right" or "It is correct" --

118
0:06:52.726,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu."

119
0:06:54.322,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's an affirmation, an agreement.

120
0:06:56.979,000 --> 0:06:57,000
"Lickih nehu."

121
0:06:58.161,000 --> 0:06:59,000
When I hear that phrase,

122
0:06:59.337,000 --> 0:07:02,000
something like this starts rolling through my mind.

123
0:07:04.031,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Music and singing "Lickih nehu")

124
0:07:11.572,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Music ends)

125
0:07:14.199,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And in both of those cases, what I did was I took the melody

126
0:07:17.04,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and the phrasing of those words and phrases

127
0:07:19.523,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and I turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions.

128
0:07:24.539,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And I like to write bass lines,

129
0:07:26.044,000 --> 0:07:28,000
so they both ended up kind of as bass lines.

130
0:07:29.387,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now, this is based on the work of Jason Moran and others

131
0:07:32.037,000 --> 0:07:35,000
who work intimately with music and language,

132
0:07:35.099,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but it's also something I've had in my head since I was a kid,

133
0:07:38.067,000 --> 0:07:4,000
how musical my parents sounded

134
0:07:40.122,000 --> 0:07:43,000
when they were speaking to each other and to us.

135
0:07:44.07,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It was from them and from Amhariña that I learned

136
0:07:46.468,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that we are awash in musical expression

137
0:07:49.372,000 --> 0:07:51,000
with every word, every sentence that we speak,

138
0:07:52.011,000 --> 0:07:54,000
every word, every sentence that we receive.

139
0:07:54.787,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Perhaps you can hear it in the words I'm speaking even now.

140
0:08:00.237,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Finally, we go to the 1950s United States

141
0:08:02.676,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and the most seminal work of 20th century avant-garde composition:

142
0:08:06.611,000 --> 0:08:08,000
John Cage's "4:33,"

143
0:08:08.759,000 --> 0:08:11,000
written for any instrument or combination of instruments.

144
0:08:12.912,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage

145
0:08:16.495,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with a stopwatch and open the score,

146
0:08:19.709,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which was actually purchased by the Museum of Modern Art --

147
0:08:22.664,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the score, that is.

148
0:08:24.641,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And this score has not a single note written

149
0:08:28.173,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and there is not a single note played

150
0:08:30.671,000 --> 0:08:32,000
for four minutes and 33 seconds.

151
0:08:34.54,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And, at once enraging and enrapturing,

152
0:08:39.254,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Cage shows us that even when there are no strings

153
0:08:42.166,000 --> 0:08:47,000
being plucked by fingers or hands hammering piano keys,

154
0:08:47.238,000 --> 0:08:49,000
still there is music, still there is music,

155
0:08:49.739,000 --> 0:08:51,000
still there is music.

156
0:08:51.825,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And what is this music?

157
0:08:54.903,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It was that sneeze in the back.

158
0:08:57.132,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:58.702,000 --> 0:09:03,000
It is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves:

160
0:09:03.787,000 --> 0:09:07,000
their coughs, their sighs, their rustles, their whispers, their sneezes,

161
0:09:08.08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the room, the wood of the floors and the walls

162
0:09:10.645,000 --> 0:09:12,000
expanding and contracting, creaking and groaning

163
0:09:13.127,000 --> 0:09:14,000
with the heat and the cold,

164
0:09:14.555,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the pipes clanking and contributing.

165
0:09:19.306,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And controversial though it was, and even controversial though it remains,

166
0:09:22.97,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Cage's point is that there is no such thing as true silence.

167
0:09:28.107,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Even in the most silent environments, we still hear and feel the sound

168
0:09:32.636,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of our own heartbeats.

169
0:09:34.646,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The world is alive with musical expression.

170
0:09:38.383,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We are already immersed.

171
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now, I had my own moment of, let's say, remixing John Cage

172
0:09:46.047,000 --> 0:09:47,000
a couple of months ago

173
0:09:47.738,000 --> 0:09:5,000
when I was standing in front of the stove cooking lentils.

174
0:09:50.765,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And it was late one night and it was time to stir,

175
0:09:53.931,000 --> 0:09:54,000
so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,

176
0:09:55.927,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and I placed it onto the kitchen counter next to me,

177
0:09:58.384,000 --> 0:10:,000
and it started to roll back and forth

178
0:10:00.671,000 --> 0:10:02,000
making this sound.

179
0:10:04.765,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Sound of metal lid clanking against a counter)

180
0:10:10.929,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Clanking ends)

181
0:10:13.525,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And it stopped me cold.

182
0:10:15.727,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I thought, "What a weird, cool swing that cooking pan lid has."

183
0:10:22.2,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So when the lentils were ready and eaten,

184
0:10:26.808,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I hightailed it to my backyard studio,

185
0:10:30.326,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and I made this.

186
0:10:33.187,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Music, including the sound of the lid, and singing)

187
0:10:50.271,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Music ends)

188
0:10:52.479,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Now, John Cage wasn't instructing musicians

189
0:10:54.915,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to mine the soundscape for sonic textures to turn into music.

190
0:10:59.06,000 --> 0:11:01,000
He was saying that on its own,

191
0:11:01.937,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the environment is musically generative,

192
0:11:05.422,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that it is generous, that it is fertile,

193
0:11:09.687,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that we are already immersed.

194
0:11:12.765,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Musician, music researcher, surgeon and human hearing expert Charles Limb

195
0:11:18.802,000 --> 0:11:2,000
is a professor at Johns Hopkins University

196
0:11:20.881,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and he studies music and the brain.

197
0:11:24.739,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And he has a theory

198
0:11:27.735,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that it is possible -- it is possible --

199
0:11:30.855,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that the human auditory system actually evolved to hear music,

200
0:11:36.027,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone.

201
0:11:41.733,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And if that's true,

202
0:11:43.532,000 --> 0:11:45,000
it means that we're hard-wired for music,

203
0:11:46.501,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that we can find it anywhere,

204
0:11:48.638,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that there is no such thing as a musical desert,

205
0:11:51.74,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that we are permanently hanging out at the oasis,

206
0:11:55.463,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and that is marvelous.

207
0:11:58.135,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We can add to the soundtrack, but it's already playing.

208
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And it doesn't mean don't study music.

209
0:12:04.138,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Study music, trace your sonic lineages and enjoy that exploration.

210
0:12:09.355,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But there is a kind of sonic lineage to which we all belong.

211
0:12:14.267,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So the next time you are seeking percussion inspiration,

212
0:12:16.914,000 --> 0:12:19,000
look no further than your tires, as they roll over the unusual grooves

213
0:12:20.287,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of the freeway,

214
0:12:22.035,000 --> 0:12:24,000
or the top-right burner of your stove

215
0:12:24.237,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and that strange way that it clicks

216
0:12:25.97,000 --> 0:12:27,000
as it is preparing to light.

217
0:12:28.733,000 --> 0:12:29,000
When seeking melodic inspiration,

218
0:12:30.369,000 --> 0:12:33,000
look no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras

219
0:12:33.885,000 --> 0:12:36,000
or to the natural lilt of emphatic language.

220
0:12:37.137,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We are the audience and we are the composers

221
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and we take from these pieces

222
0:12:41.979,000 --> 0:12:42,000
we are given.

223
0:12:43.154,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We make, we make, we make, we make,

224
0:12:45.046,000 --> 0:12:49,000
knowing that when it comes to nature or language or soundscape,

225
0:12:49.49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
there is no end to the inspiration --

226
0:12:52.511,000 --> 0:12:54,000
if we are listening.

227
0:12:55.421,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Thank you.

228
0:12:56.597,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Applause)

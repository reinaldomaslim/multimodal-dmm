1
0:00:12.671,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Election night 2008

2
0:00:15.612,000 --> 0:00:18,000
was a night that tore me in half.

3
0:00:18.971,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.

4
0:00:23.36,000 --> 0:00:27,000
[One hundred and forty-three] years after the end of slavery,

5
0:00:27.733,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and [43] years after the passage

6
0:00:30.01,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of the Voting Rights Act,

7
0:00:31.75,000 --> 0:00:35,000
an African-American was elected president.

8
0:00:35.79,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Many of us never thought that this was possible

9
0:00:39.537,000 --> 0:00:41,000
until the moment that it happened.

10
0:00:42.309,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And in many ways, it was the climax

11
0:00:45.524,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of the black civil rights movement

12
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in the United States.

13
0:00:49.388,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I was in California that night,

14
0:00:51.237,000 --> 0:00:52,000
which was ground zero at the time

15
0:00:53.123,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for another movement:

16
0:00:54.947,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the marriage equality movement.

17
0:00:57.94,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Gay marriage was on the ballot

18
0:00:59.746,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in the form of Proposition 8,

19
0:01:02.83,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and as the election returns started to come in,

20
0:01:06.535,000 --> 0:01:08,000
it became clear that the right

21
0:01:08.651,000 --> 0:01:1,000
for same sex couples to marry,

22
0:01:11.024,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which had recently been granted by the California courts,

23
0:01:14.076,000 --> 0:01:16,000
was going to be taken away.

24
0:01:16.365,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So on the same night

25
0:01:18.548,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that Barack Obama won his historic presidency,

26
0:01:22.83,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the lesbian and gay community suffered

27
0:01:25.322,000 --> 0:01:28,000
one of our most painful defeats.

28
0:01:28.6,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And then it got even worse.

29
0:01:32.127,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Pretty much immediately,

30
0:01:34.121,000 --> 0:01:36,000
African-Americans started to be blamed

31
0:01:36.567,000 --> 0:01:38,000
for the passage of Proposition 8.

32
0:01:38.899,000 --> 0:01:41,000
This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said

33
0:01:42.496,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that blacks had voted for the measure

34
0:01:44.255,000 --> 0:01:46,000
by something like 70 percent.

35
0:01:46.74,000 --> 0:01:47,000
This turned out not to be true,

36
0:01:48.455,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,

37
0:01:54.029,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and was grabbed on by the media.

38
0:01:57.286,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.

39
0:01:59.972,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I listened to some gay commentator say

40
0:02:02.999,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that the African-American community

41
0:02:05.388,000 --> 0:02:07,000
was notoriously homophobic,

42
0:02:07.403,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and now that civil rights had been achieved for us,

43
0:02:10.677,000 --> 0:02:12,000
we wanted to take away other people's rights.

44
0:02:12.81,000 --> 0:02:14,000
There were even reports of racist epithets

45
0:02:15.617,000 --> 0:02:16,000
being thrown at some of the participants

46
0:02:17.534,000 --> 0:02:18,000
of the gay rights rallies

47
0:02:19.2,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that took place after the election.

48
0:02:21.819,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And on the other side,

49
0:02:23.81,000 --> 0:02:26,000
some African-Americans dismissed or ignored

50
0:02:27.631,000 --> 0:02:3,000
homophobia that was indeed real in our community.

51
0:02:31.15,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And others resented this comparison

52
0:02:33.8,000 --> 0:02:35,000
between gay rights and civil rights,

53
0:02:36.13,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and once again, the sinking feeling

54
0:02:39.675,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that two minority groups

55
0:02:41.694,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of which I'm both a part of

56
0:02:44.144,000 --> 0:02:46,000
were competing with each other

57
0:02:47.086,000 --> 0:02:49,000
instead of supporting each other

58
0:02:49.777,000 --> 0:02:53,000
overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.

59
0:02:54.303,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, I'm a documentary filmmaker,

60
0:02:57.436,000 --> 0:03:,000
so after going through my pissed off stage

61
0:03:00.479,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and yelling at the television and radio,

62
0:03:03.559,000 --> 0:03:05,000
my next instinct was

63
0:03:05.849,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to make a movie.

64
0:03:07.928,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And what guided me in making this film was,

65
0:03:12.28,000 --> 0:03:13,000
how was this happening?

66
0:03:14.078,000 --> 0:03:17,000
How was it that the gay rights movement

67
0:03:17.278,000 --> 0:03:2,000
was being pitted against the civil rights movement?

68
0:03:20.589,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And this wasn't just an abstract question.

69
0:03:23.834,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I'm a beneficiary of both movements,

70
0:03:26.189,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so this was actually personal.

71
0:03:29.273,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But then something else happened

72
0:03:30.868,000 --> 0:03:32,000
after that election in 2008.

73
0:03:33.829,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The march towards gay equality

74
0:03:36.217,000 --> 0:03:38,000
accelerated at a pace

75
0:03:38.266,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that surprised and shocked everyone,

76
0:03:41.288,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,

77
0:03:45.91,000 --> 0:03:48,000
our institutions and our entire country.

78
0:03:48.963,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And so it started to become increasingly clear to me

79
0:03:52.828,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that this pitting of the two movements

80
0:03:54.926,000 --> 0:03:57,000
against each other actually didn't make sense,

81
0:03:58.508,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and that they were in fact

82
0:03:59.74,000 --> 0:04:02,000
much, much more interconnected,

83
0:04:03.061,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and that, in fact, some of the way

84
0:04:05.251,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that the gay rights movement has been able

85
0:04:07.57,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to make such incredible gains so quickly

86
0:04:11.145,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is that it's used some of the same tactics

87
0:04:13.193,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and strategies that were first laid down

88
0:04:16.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
by the civil rights movement.

89
0:04:18.74,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Let's just look at a few of these strategies.

90
0:04:22.493,000 --> 0:04:24,000
First off, it's really interesting to see,

91
0:04:24.772,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to actually visually see, how quick

92
0:04:26.74,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the gay rights movement has made its gains,

93
0:04:28.81,000 --> 0:04:31,000
if you look at a few of the major events

94
0:04:31.996,000 --> 0:04:34,000
on a timeline of both freedom movements.

95
0:04:35.72,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now, there are tons of milestones

96
0:04:39.302,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in the civil rights movement,

97
0:04:40.523,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but the first one we're going to start with

98
0:04:42.416,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.

99
0:04:46.312,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This was a protest campaign

100
0:04:48.9,000 --> 0:04:5,000
against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation

101
0:04:51.845,000 --> 0:04:53,000
on their public transit system,

102
0:04:53.852,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks

103
0:04:56.711,000 --> 0:04:59,000
refused to give up her seat to a white person.

104
0:04:59.839,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The campaign lasted a year,

105
0:05:02.117,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and it galvanized the civil rights movement

106
0:05:04.216,000 --> 0:05:06,000
like nothing had before it.

107
0:05:07.183,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I call this strategy the

108
0:05:10.035,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"I'm tired of your foot on my neck" strategy.

109
0:05:14.962,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So gays and lesbians have been in society

110
0:05:19.303,000 --> 0:05:21,000
since societies began,

111
0:05:21.77,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but up until the mid-20th century,

112
0:05:24.377,000 --> 0:05:28,000
homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.

113
0:05:28.762,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,

114
0:05:32.872,000 --> 0:05:36,000
a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.

115
0:05:37.276,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It's known as Stonewall, in 1969,

116
0:05:40.495,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and it's where a group of LGBT patrons

117
0:05:43.71,000 --> 0:05:45,000
fought back against police beatings

118
0:05:46.392,000 --> 0:05:47,000
at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked

119
0:05:48.348,000 --> 0:05:5,000
three days of rioting.

120
0:05:50.54,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks

121
0:05:53.266,000 --> 0:05:54,000
were at the forefront of this rebellion,

122
0:05:55.197,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and it's a really interesting example

123
0:05:57.466,000 --> 0:06:,000
of the intersection of our struggles against racism,

124
0:06:00.677,000 --> 0:06:04,000
homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.

125
0:06:05.37,000 --> 0:06:08,000
After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups

126
0:06:08.932,000 --> 0:06:1,000
sprang up all over the country,

127
0:06:11.271,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and the modern gay rights movement as we know it took off.

128
0:06:15.891,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So the next moment to look at on the timeline

129
0:06:19.085,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is the 1963 March on Washington.

130
0:06:22.23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This was a seminal event in the civil rights movement

131
0:06:25.365,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and it's where African-Americans called for both

132
0:06:28.113,000 --> 0:06:3,000
civil and economic justice.

133
0:06:31.096,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And it's of course where Martin Luther King

134
0:06:33.275,000 --> 0:06:35,000
delivered his famous "I have a dream" speech,

135
0:06:35.538,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but what's actually less known

136
0:06:37.533,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is that this march was organized

137
0:06:39.868,000 --> 0:06:42,000
by a man named Bayard Rustin.

138
0:06:43.178,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Bayard was an out gay man,

139
0:06:45.901,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and he's considered one of the most brilliant

140
0:06:48.533,000 --> 0:06:5,000
strategists of the civil rights movement.

141
0:06:51.45,000 --> 0:06:53,000
He later in his life became a fierce advocate

142
0:06:54.196,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of LGBT rights as well, and his life

143
0:06:57.073,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is testament to the intersection of the struggles.

144
0:07:02.15,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The March on Washington

145
0:07:03.467,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is one of the high points of the movement,

146
0:07:05.85,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and it's where there was a fervent belief

147
0:07:09.02,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that African-Americans too

148
0:07:11.215,000 --> 0:07:13,000
could be a part of American democracy.

149
0:07:14.02,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I call this strategy the

150
0:07:15.88,000 --> 0:07:2,000
"We are visible and many in numbers" strategy.

151
0:07:20.89,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Some early gay activists were actually

152
0:07:23.353,000 --> 0:07:25,000
directly inspired by the march,

153
0:07:25.433,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and some had taken part.

154
0:07:28.639,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said,

155
0:07:31.66,000 --> 0:07:33,000
"We marched with Martin Luther King,

156
0:07:33.687,000 --> 0:07:35,000
seven of us from the Mattachine Society" --

157
0:07:36.289,000 --> 0:07:38,000
which was an early gay rights organization —

158
0:07:38.74,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"and from that moment on, we had our own dream

159
0:07:42.291,000 --> 0:07:45,000
about a gay rights march of similar proportions."

160
0:07:45.44,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Several years later, a series of marches took place,

161
0:07:49.13,000 --> 0:07:51,000
each one gaining the momentum

162
0:07:51.475,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of the gay freedom struggle.

163
0:07:53.281,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The first one was in 1979,

164
0:07:55.718,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and the second one took place in 1987.

165
0:08:00.267,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The third one was held in 1993.

166
0:08:03.993,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Almost a million people showed up,

167
0:08:07.258,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and people were so energized and excited

168
0:08:10.799,000 --> 0:08:11,000
by what had taken place,

169
0:08:11.899,000 --> 0:08:13,000
they went back to their own communities

170
0:08:14.298,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and started their own political

171
0:08:15.931,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and social organizations,

172
0:08:17.621,000 --> 0:08:2,000
further increasing the visibility of the movement.

173
0:08:21.512,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The day of that march, October 11,

174
0:08:23.429,000 --> 0:08:25,000
was then declared National Coming Out Day,

175
0:08:26.09,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and is still celebrated all over the world.

176
0:08:28.984,000 --> 0:08:3,000
These marches set the groundwork

177
0:08:31.505,000 --> 0:08:33,000
for the historic changes that we see happening

178
0:08:34.225,000 --> 0:08:36,000
today in the United States.

179
0:08:37.073,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And lastly, the "Loving" strategy.

180
0:08:40.614,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The name speaks for itself.

181
0:08:42.79,000 --> 0:08:44,000
In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled

182
0:08:45.603,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in Loving v. Virginia,

183
0:08:47.492,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and invalidated all laws

184
0:08:49.612,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that prohibited interracial marriage.

185
0:08:52.845,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This is considered one of the Supreme Court's

186
0:08:54.76,000 --> 0:08:57,000
landmark civil rights cases.

187
0:08:58.097,000 --> 0:09:,000
In 1996, President Clinton signed

188
0:09:01.01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA,

189
0:09:04.581,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and that made the federal government

190
0:09:06.92,000 --> 0:09:08,000
only have to recognize marriages

191
0:09:09.307,000 --> 0:09:12,000
between a man and a woman.

192
0:09:13.276,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In United States v. Windsor,

193
0:09:15.69,000 --> 0:09:18,000
a 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor

194
0:09:18.837,000 --> 0:09:19,000
sued the federal government

195
0:09:20.8,000 --> 0:09:22,000
when she was forced to pay estate taxes

196
0:09:23.546,000 --> 0:09:24,000
on her deceased wife's property,

197
0:09:25.048,000 --> 0:09:28,000
something that heterosexual couples don't have to do.

198
0:09:28.365,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And as the case wound its way

199
0:09:30.674,000 --> 0:09:31,000
through the lower courts,

200
0:09:32.43,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent.

201
0:09:36.267,000 --> 0:09:38,000
When it got to the Supreme Court in 2013,

202
0:09:38.561,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the Supreme Court agreed,

203
0:09:40.284,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and DOMA was thrown out.

204
0:09:42.737,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It was incredible.

205
0:09:45.131,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But the gay marriage movement

206
0:09:46.778,000 --> 0:09:49,000
has been making gains for years now.

207
0:09:50.365,000 --> 0:09:52,000
To date, 17 states

208
0:09:52.93,000 --> 0:09:54,000
have passed laws allowing marriage equality.

209
0:09:55.509,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's become the de facto battle

210
0:09:58.187,000 --> 0:10:,000
for gay equality,

211
0:10:00.71,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and it seems like daily,

212
0:10:02.36,000 --> 0:10:04,000
laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts,

213
0:10:05.24,000 --> 0:10:07,000
even in places like Texas and Utah,

214
0:10:07.827,000 --> 0:10:1,000
which no one saw coming.

215
0:10:11.145,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So a lot has changed

216
0:10:13.14,000 --> 0:10:15,000
since that night in 2008

217
0:10:15.402,000 --> 0:10:17,000
when I felt torn in half.

218
0:10:17.86,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I did go on to make that film.

219
0:10:20.21,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's a documentary film,

220
0:10:21.887,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and it's called "The New Black,"

221
0:10:23.95,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and it looks at how the African-American community

222
0:10:26.905,000 --> 0:10:28,000
is grappling with the gay rights issue

223
0:10:28.918,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in light of the gay marriage movement

224
0:10:31.364,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and this fight over the meaning of civil rights.

225
0:10:34.925,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And I wanted to capture

226
0:10:36.717,000 --> 0:10:39,000
some of this incredible change that was happening,

227
0:10:39.798,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and as luck or politics would have it,

228
0:10:42.89,000 --> 0:10:44,000
another marriage battle started gearing up,

229
0:10:45.886,000 --> 0:10:46,000
this time in Maryland,

230
0:10:47.51,000 --> 0:10:49,000
where African-Americans make up 30 percent

231
0:10:49.997,000 --> 0:10:5,000
of the electorate.

232
0:10:51.199,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So this tension between gay rights

233
0:10:54.265,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and civil rights started to bubble up once again,

234
0:10:58.229,000 --> 0:11:,000
and I was lucky enough to capture

235
0:11:00.292,000 --> 0:11:03,000
how some people were making the connection

236
0:11:03.702,000 --> 0:11:06,000
between the movements this time.

237
0:11:06.78,000 --> 0:11:08,000
This is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes

238
0:11:09.378,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and Samantha Masters, two characters in the film,

239
0:11:12.632,000 --> 0:11:14,000
as they hit the streets of Baltimore

240
0:11:15.22,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and try to convince potential voters.

241
0:11:17.557,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Video) Samantha Masters: That's what's up, man, this is a righteous man over here.

242
0:11:21.625,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Okay, are you registered to vote?

243
0:11:23.91,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Man: No. Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay. How old are you?

244
0:11:25.09,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Man: 21. KTH: 21? You gotta get registered to vote.

245
0:11:26.901,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We got to get you registered to vote.

246
0:11:28.691,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Man: I ain't voting on no gay shit.

247
0:11:31.007,000 --> 0:11:34,000
SM: Okay, why? What's up? Man: I ain't with that.

248
0:11:34.041,000 --> 0:11:35,000
SM: That's not cool.

249
0:11:35.35,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Man: What made you be gay? SM: So what made you be straight?

250
0:11:40.362,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So what made you be straight?

251
0:11:45.175,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Man 2: You can't answer that question. (Laughter)

252
0:11:49.322,000 --> 0:11:5,000
KSM: I used to not have the same rights as you,

253
0:11:51.05,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but I know that because a black man like yourself

254
0:11:53.304,000 --> 0:11:54,000
stood up for a woman like me,

255
0:11:54.723,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I know that I've got the same opportunities.

256
0:11:56.532,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So you, as a black man, have the opportunity

257
0:11:58.408,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to stand up for somebody else.

258
0:11:59.72,000 --> 0:12:,000
Whether you're gay or not,

259
0:12:00.919,000 --> 0:12:01,000
these are your brothers and sisters out here,

260
0:12:02.4,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and they need you to represent.

261
0:12:03.608,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Man 2: Who is you to tell somebody

262
0:12:05.38,000 --> 0:12:06,000
who they can't have sex with,

263
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:08,000
who they can't be with?

264
0:12:08.325,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They ain't got that power.

265
0:12:10.224,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Nobody has that power to say, you can't marry that young lady.

266
0:12:12.892,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Who has that power? Nobody.

267
0:12:14.696,000 --> 0:12:15,000
SM: But you know what?

268
0:12:15.743,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Our state has put the power in your hands,

269
0:12:17.853,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and so what we need you to do

270
0:12:19.43,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is vote for, you gonna vote for 6.

271
0:12:21.91,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Man 2: I got you.

272
0:12:23.495,000 --> 0:12:24,000
SM: Vote for 6, okay? Man 2: I got you.

273
0:12:25.409,000 --> 0:12:27,000
KSM: All right, do y'all need community service hours?

274
0:12:27.563,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You do? All right, you can always volunteer with us

275
0:12:29.487,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to get community service hours.

276
0:12:30.918,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Y'all want to do that?

277
0:12:32.244,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We feed you. We bring you pizza.

278
0:12:34.982,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

279
0:12:37.672,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Yoruba Richen: Thank you.

280
0:12:40.94,000 --> 0:12:42,000
What's amazing to me about that clip

281
0:12:42.998,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that we just captured as we were filming

282
0:12:46.392,000 --> 0:12:48,000
is, it really shows how Karess

283
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
understands the history of the civil rights movement,

284
0:12:52.328,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but she's not restricted by it.

285
0:12:54.494,000 --> 0:12:56,000
She doesn't just limit it to black people.

286
0:12:56.797,000 --> 0:12:58,000
She sees it as a blueprint

287
0:12:58.857,000 --> 0:13:01,000
for expanding rights to gays and lesbians.

288
0:13:02.461,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Maybe because she's younger, she's like 25,

289
0:13:05.39,000 --> 0:13:07,000
she's able to do this a little bit more easily,

290
0:13:07.648,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but the fact is that Maryland voters

291
0:13:10.787,000 --> 0:13:13,000
did pass that marriage equality amendment,

292
0:13:13.913,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and in fact it was the first time

293
0:13:16.333,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that marriage equality was directly voted on

294
0:13:19.212,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and passed by the voters.

295
0:13:21.581,000 --> 0:13:23,000
African-Americans supported it at a higher level

296
0:13:24.545,000 --> 0:13:25,000
than had ever been recorded.

297
0:13:25.731,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It was a complete turnaround from that night

298
0:13:28.72,000 --> 0:13:32,000
in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.

299
0:13:33.074,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It was, and feels, monumental.

300
0:13:36.874,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We in the LGBT community have gone

301
0:13:40.108,000 --> 0:13:43,000
from being a pathologized and reviled

302
0:13:44.055,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and criminalized group

303
0:13:45.859,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to being seen as part of the great human quest

304
0:13:50.166,000 --> 0:13:52,000
for dignity and equality.

305
0:13:52.89,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We've gone from having to hide our sexuality

306
0:13:56.767,000 --> 0:13:58,000
in order to maintain our jobs and our families

307
0:13:59.381,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to literally getting a place at the table

308
0:14:02.236,000 --> 0:14:03,000
with the president

309
0:14:03.52,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and a shout out at his second inauguration.

310
0:14:06.646,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I just want to read what he said

311
0:14:08.207,000 --> 0:14:09,000
at that inauguration:

312
0:14:10.169,000 --> 0:14:12,000
"We the people declare today

313
0:14:12.489,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that the most evident of truths,

314
0:14:15.525,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that all of us are created equal.

315
0:14:18.579,000 --> 0:14:2,000
It is the star that guides us still,

316
0:14:21.059,000 --> 0:14:23,000
just as it guided our forebears

317
0:14:23.285,000 --> 0:14:24,000
through Seneca Falls

318
0:14:24.799,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and Selma and Stonewall."

319
0:14:29.22,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Now we know that everything is not perfect,

320
0:14:33.057,000 --> 0:14:34,000
especially when you look at what's happening

321
0:14:34.97,000 --> 0:14:36,000
with the LGBT rights issue internationally,

322
0:14:37.953,000 --> 0:14:4,000
but it says something about how far we've come

323
0:14:41.504,000 --> 0:14:44,000
when our president puts the gay freedom struggle

324
0:14:44.908,000 --> 0:14:45,000
in the context of the other great freedom struggles

325
0:14:46.893,000 --> 0:14:48,000
of our time: the women's rights movement

326
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and the civil rights movement.

327
0:14:51.556,000 --> 0:14:53,000
His statement demonstrates not only

328
0:14:53.899,000 --> 0:14:55,000
the interconnectedness of those movements,

329
0:14:56.571,000 --> 0:14:58,000
but how each one borrowed

330
0:14:58.819,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and was inspired by the other.

331
0:15:02.084,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So just as Martin Luther King

332
0:15:04.832,000 --> 0:15:07,000
learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics

333
0:15:07.892,000 --> 0:15:09,000
of civil disobedience and nonviolence,

334
0:15:10.131,000 --> 0:15:13,000
which became a bedrock of the civil rights movement,

335
0:15:13.23,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the gay rights movement saw what worked

336
0:15:16.238,000 --> 0:15:17,000
in the civil rights movement,

337
0:15:17.73,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and they used some of those same strategies

338
0:15:19.959,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and tactics to make gains

339
0:15:21.875,000 --> 0:15:24,000
at an even quicker pace.

340
0:15:24.91,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Maybe one more other reason

341
0:15:26.997,000 --> 0:15:27,000
for the relative quick progress

342
0:15:28.792,000 --> 0:15:3,000
of the gay rights movement.

343
0:15:30.967,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Whereas a lot of us continue to still live

344
0:15:33.847,000 --> 0:15:35,000
in racially segregated spaces,

345
0:15:36.516,000 --> 0:15:38,000
LGBT folks, we are everywhere.

346
0:15:39.326,000 --> 0:15:41,000
We are in urban communities

347
0:15:41.589,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and rural communities,

348
0:15:43.072,000 --> 0:15:45,000
communities of color, immigrant communities,

349
0:15:45.533,000 --> 0:15:48,000
churches and mosques and synagogues.

350
0:15:49.097,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We are your mothers and brothers

351
0:15:52.248,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and sisters and sons.

352
0:15:55.056,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And when someone that you love

353
0:15:57.682,000 --> 0:15:58,000
or a family member comes out,

354
0:15:59.562,000 --> 0:16:03,000
it may be easier to support their quest for equality.

355
0:16:04.066,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And in fact, the gay rights movement

356
0:16:06.245,000 --> 0:16:08,000
asks us to support justice and equality

357
0:16:08.92,000 --> 0:16:1,000
from a space of love.

358
0:16:11.423,000 --> 0:16:13,000
That may be the biggest, greatest gift

359
0:16:13.883,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that the movement has given us.

360
0:16:15.738,000 --> 0:16:2,000
It calls on us to access that which is most universal

361
0:16:20.821,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and most intimate:

362
0:16:22.733,000 --> 0:16:24,000
a love of our brother and our sister

363
0:16:25.47,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and our neighbor.

364
0:16:27.395,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I just want to end with a quote

365
0:16:30.198,000 --> 0:16:32,000
by one of our greatest freedom fighters

366
0:16:32.332,000 --> 0:16:34,000
who's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela

367
0:16:35.1,000 --> 0:16:36,000
of South Africa.

368
0:16:36.403,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Nelson Mandela led South Africa

369
0:16:39.304,000 --> 0:16:42,000
after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid,

370
0:16:42.664,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and out of the ashes of that legalized racial discrimination,

371
0:16:47.399,000 --> 0:16:49,000
he led South Africa to become the first country

372
0:16:50.363,000 --> 0:16:53,000
in the world to ban discrimination

373
0:16:53.472,000 --> 0:16:57,000
based on sexual orientation within its constitution.

374
0:16:57.626,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Mandela said,

375
0:17:00.281,000 --> 0:17:04,000
"For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains,

376
0:17:05.207,000 --> 0:17:07,000
but to live in a way that respects

377
0:17:08.15,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and enhances the freedom of others."

378
0:17:11.399,000 --> 0:17:15,000
So as these movements continue on,

379
0:17:16.077,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and as freedom struggles around the world continue on,

380
0:17:19.038,000 --> 0:17:22,000
let's remember that not only are they interconnected,

381
0:17:22.698,000 --> 0:17:25,000
but they must support and enhance each other

382
0:17:26.589,000 --> 0:17:29,000
for us to be truly victorious.

383
0:17:29.873,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Thank you.

384
0:17:31.848,000 --> 0:17:36,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.24,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I come from Lebanon,

2
0:00:16.14,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I believe that running can change the world.

3
0:00:20.08,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I know what I have just said is simply not obvious.

4
0:00:24.24,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You know, Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed

5
0:00:29.11,000 --> 0:00:31,000
by a long and bloody civil war.

6
0:00:32.1,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Honestly, I don't know why they call it civil war

7
0:00:35.2,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when there is nothing civil about it.

8
0:00:38.18,000 --> 0:00:42,000
With Syria to the north, Israel and Palestine to the south,

9
0:00:43.18,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and our government even up till this moment

10
0:00:46.24,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is still fragmented and unstable.

11
0:00:50.14,000 --> 0:00:55,000
For years, the country has been divided between politics and religion.

12
0:00:57.07,000 --> 0:01:,000
However, for one day a year,

13
0:01:00.1,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we truly stand united,

14
0:01:02.24,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and that's when the marathon takes place.

15
0:01:07.05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I used to be a marathon runner.

16
0:01:10.17,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Long distance running was not only good for my well-being

17
0:01:15.05,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but it helped me meditate and dream big.

18
0:01:19.21,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So the longer distances I ran,

19
0:01:22.07,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the bigger my dreams became.

20
0:01:25.05,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Until one fateful morning,

21
0:01:28.09,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and while training, I was hit by a bus.

22
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I nearly died, was in a coma,

23
0:01:37.24,000 --> 0:01:4,000
stayed at the hospital for two years,

24
0:01:41.03,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again.

25
0:01:47.24,000 --> 0:01:49,000
As soon as I came out of my coma,

26
0:01:50.15,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be,

27
0:01:55.19,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so I decided, if I couldn't run myself,

28
0:01:59.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I wanted to make sure that others could.

29
0:02:04.04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So out of my hospital bed,

30
0:02:06.09,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I asked my husband to start taking notes,

31
0:02:09.09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and a few months later, the marathon was born.

32
0:02:15.24,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident

33
0:02:19.24,000 --> 0:02:21,000
may sound strange,

34
0:02:22.15,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but at that time, even during my most vulnerable condition,

35
0:02:27.13,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I needed to dream big.

36
0:02:29.13,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I needed something to take me out of my pain,

37
0:02:32.12,000 --> 0:02:34,000
an objective to look forward to.

38
0:02:35.18,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I didn't want to pity myself, nor to be pitied,

39
0:02:40.05,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and I thought by organizing such a marathon,

40
0:02:43.17,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'll be able to pay back to my community,

41
0:02:46.17,000 --> 0:02:48,000
build bridges with the outside world,

42
0:02:49.07,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and invite runners to come to Lebanon

43
0:02:51.24,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and run under the umbrella of peace.

44
0:02:56.24,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Organizing a marathon in Lebanon

45
0:02:59.1,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is definitely not like organizing one in New York.

46
0:03:04.18,000 --> 0:03:06,000
How do you introduce the concept of running

47
0:03:07.14,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war?

48
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:14,000
How do you ask those who were once fighting

49
0:03:15.17,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and killing each other

50
0:03:17.17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to come together and run next to each other?

51
0:03:21.15,000 --> 0:03:27,000
More than that, how do you convince people to run a distance of 26.2 miles

52
0:03:28.08,000 --> 0:03:32,000
at a time they were not even familiar with the word "marathon"?

53
0:03:33.14,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So we had to start from scratch.

54
0:03:35.24,000 --> 0:03:38,000
For almost two years, we went all over the country

55
0:03:39.19,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and even visited remote villages.

56
0:03:43.14,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I personally met with people from all walks of life --

57
0:03:47.22,000 --> 0:03:5,000
mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,

58
0:03:50.24,000 --> 0:03:53,000
politicians, militiamen,

59
0:03:54.01,000 --> 0:03:56,000
people from mosques, churches,

60
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the president of the country, even housewives.

61
0:04:01.13,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I learned one thing:

62
0:04:04.07,000 --> 0:04:07,000
When you walk the talk, people believe you.

63
0:04:08.18,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Many were touched by my personal story,

64
0:04:12.18,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and they shared their stories in return.

65
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It was honesty and transparency that brought us together.

66
0:04:21.07,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We spoke one common language to each other,

67
0:04:24.24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and that was from one human to another.

68
0:04:29.19,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Once that trust was built,

69
0:04:32.05,000 --> 0:04:34,000
everybody wanted to be part of the marathon

70
0:04:35.02,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to show the world the true colors of Lebanon and the Lebanese

71
0:04:40.15,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and their desire to live in peace and harmony.

72
0:04:45.15,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In October 2003, over 6,000 runners

73
0:04:50.15,000 --> 0:04:52,000
from 49 different nationalities

74
0:04:53.04,000 --> 0:04:56,000
came to the start line, all determined,

75
0:04:57.02,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and when the gunfire went off,

76
0:04:59.19,000 --> 0:05:03,000
this time it was a signal to run in harmony,

77
0:05:04.19,000 --> 0:05:05,000
for a change.

78
0:05:06.24,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The marathon grew.

79
0:05:08.23,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So did our political problems.

80
0:05:11.24,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But for every disaster we had,

81
0:05:14.17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the marathon found ways to bring people together.

82
0:05:20.11,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In 2005, our prime minister was assassinated,

83
0:05:25.03,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and the country came to a complete standstill,

84
0:05:29.08,000 --> 0:05:33,000
so we organized a five-kilometer United We Run campaign.

85
0:05:33.24,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Over 60,000 people came to the start line,

86
0:05:37.17,000 --> 0:05:41,000
all wearing white T-shirts with no political slogans.

87
0:05:43.12,000 --> 0:05:45,000
That was a turning point for the marathon,

88
0:05:46.1,000 --> 0:05:49,000
where people started looking at it as a platform

89
0:05:50.01,000 --> 0:05:52,000
for peace and unity.

90
0:05:52.19,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Between 2006 up to 2009, our country, Lebanon,

91
0:05:57.24,000 --> 0:05:59,000
went through unstable years,

92
0:06:00.17,000 --> 0:06:03,000
invasions, and more assassinations

93
0:06:03.2,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that brought us close to a civil war.

94
0:06:06.1,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The country was divided again,

95
0:06:08.21,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so much that our parliament resigned,

96
0:06:12.06,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we had no president for a year, and no prime minister.

97
0:06:17.06,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But we did have a marathon.

98
0:06:20.2,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Applause)

99
0:06:27.06,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So through the marathon, we learned that political problems can be overcome.

100
0:06:34.02,000 --> 0:06:38,000
When the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center,

101
0:06:38.24,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we negotiated alternative routes.

102
0:06:42.15,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders.

103
0:06:46.22,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They even hosted juice stations.

104
0:06:49.11,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

105
0:06:51.23,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You know, the marathon has really become one of its kind.

106
0:06:57.01,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It gained credibility

107
0:06:58.22,000 --> 0:07:03,000
from both the Lebanese and the international community.

108
0:07:04.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Last November 2012, over 33,000 runners from 85 different nationalities

109
0:07:10.24,000 --> 0:07:11,000
came to the start line,

110
0:07:12.14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but this time, they challenged a very stormy and rainy weather.

111
0:07:17.18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The streets were flooded, but people didn't want to miss out

112
0:07:21.18,000 --> 0:07:25,000
on the opportunity of being part of such a national day.

113
0:07:27.04,000 --> 0:07:28,000
BMA has expanded.

114
0:07:28.19,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We include everyone: the young, the elderly,

115
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the disabled, the mentally challenged,

116
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the blind, the elite, the amateur runners,

117
0:07:39.03,000 --> 0:07:41,000
even moms with their babies.

118
0:07:41.24,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Themes have included runs for the environment,

119
0:07:45.09,000 --> 0:07:48,000
breast cancer, for the love of Lebanon, for peace,

120
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or just simply to run.

121
0:07:52.03,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The first annual all-women-and-girls race for empowerment,

122
0:07:58.14,000 --> 0:08:,000
which is one of its kind in the region,

123
0:08:00.24,000 --> 0:08:03,000
has just taken place only a few weeks ago,

124
0:08:04.1,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with 4,512 women, including the first lady,

125
0:08:09.21,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and this is only the beginning.

126
0:08:13.23,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Thank you.

127
0:08:15.23,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Applause)

128
0:08:19.12,000 --> 0:08:23,000
BMA has supported charities and volunteers

129
0:08:24.03,000 --> 0:08:27,000
who have helped reshape Lebanon,

130
0:08:27.05,000 --> 0:08:29,000
raising funds for their causes

131
0:08:29.17,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and encouraging others to give.

132
0:08:32.22,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The culture of giving and doing good has become contagious.

133
0:08:37.11,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Stereotypes have been broken.

134
0:08:39.19,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Change-makers and future leaders have been created.

135
0:08:44.13,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I believe these are the building blocks for future peace.

136
0:08:51.04,000 --> 0:08:57,000
BMA has become such a respected event in the region

137
0:08:57.19,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that government officials in the region,

138
0:09:00.13,000 --> 0:09:02,000
like Iraq, Egypt and Syria,

139
0:09:03.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
have asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event.

140
0:09:10.03,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We are now one of the largest running events in the Middle East,

141
0:09:14.12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but most importantly,

142
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:2,000
it is a platform for hope and cooperation

143
0:09:20.24,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in an ever-fragile and unstable part of the world.

144
0:09:26.21,000 --> 0:09:3,000
From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.

145
0:09:32.05,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Applause)

146
0:09:37.24,000 --> 0:09:38,000
After 10 years in Lebanon,

147
0:09:39.23,000 --> 0:09:42,000
from national marathons or from national events

148
0:09:43.15,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to smaller regional races,

149
0:09:45.22,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we've seen that people want to run for a better future.

150
0:09:51.11,000 --> 0:09:56,000
After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.

151
0:09:57.07,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It is more of a marathon.

152
0:09:59.12,000 --> 0:10:,000
Thank you.

153
0:10:00.13,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

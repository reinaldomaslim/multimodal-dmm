2
0:00:15.984,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This is poo,

3
0:00:18.232,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and what I want to do today is share my passion

4
0:00:20.715,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for poo with you,

5
0:00:23.858,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which might be quite difficult,

6
0:00:26.671,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but I think what you might find more fascinating

7
0:00:29.764,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is the way these small animals deal with poo.

8
0:00:32.965,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So this animal here has got a brain

9
0:00:35.317,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things

10
0:00:39.277,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.

11
0:00:43.027,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source,

12
0:00:47.149,000 --> 0:00:49,000
which is dung.

13
0:00:49.283,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So the question is, where do we start this story?

14
0:00:51.862,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And it seems appropriate to start at the end,

15
0:00:54.887,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because this is a waste product that comes out

16
0:00:57.672,000 --> 0:01:,000
of other animals, but it still contains nutrients

17
0:01:01.245,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and there are sufficient nutrients in there

18
0:01:03.202,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for dung beetles basically to make a living,

19
0:01:06.165,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and so dung beetles eat dung, and their larvae

20
0:01:09.1,000 --> 0:01:11,000
are also dung-feeders.

21
0:01:11.255,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They are grown completely in a ball of dung.

22
0:01:14.485,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Within South Africa, we've got about 800 species of dung beetles,

23
0:01:18.28,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in Africa we've got 2,000 species of dung beetles,

24
0:01:21.55,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles.

25
0:01:26.148,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.

26
0:01:31.286,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails

27
0:01:33.958,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and root through the dung itself, you'll never see

28
0:01:36.727,000 --> 0:01:38,000
90 percent of the dung beetle species,

29
0:01:39.018,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because they go directly into the dung,

30
0:01:41.424,000 --> 0:01:43,000
straight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forth

31
0:01:44.036,000 --> 0:01:46,000
between the dung at the soil surface

32
0:01:46.091,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and a nest they make underground.

33
0:01:49.031,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So the question is, how do they deal with this material?

34
0:01:54.276,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.

35
0:01:58.256,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Ten percent of the species actually make a ball,

36
0:02:01.936,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and this ball they roll away from the dung source,

37
0:02:06.098,000 --> 0:02:09,000
usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source,

38
0:02:09.534,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and they have a very particular behavior

39
0:02:12.839,000 --> 0:02:16,000
by which they are able to roll their balls.

40
0:02:17.814,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.

41
0:02:21.407,000 --> 0:02:22,000
You can see it's a male

42
0:02:22.642,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there,

43
0:02:24.883,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there.

44
0:02:29.952,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And then he's about to become a victim

45
0:02:31.864,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of a vicious smash-and-grab. (Laughter)

46
0:02:37.113,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And this is a clear indication

47
0:02:39.811,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that this is a valuable resource.

48
0:02:42.422,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And so valuable resources have to be looked after

49
0:02:46.547,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and guarded in a particular way, and we think

50
0:02:49.866,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the reason they roll the balls away is because of this,

51
0:02:53.168,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because of the competition that is involved

52
0:02:55.578,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in getting hold of that dung.

53
0:02:57.453,000 --> 0:03:,000
So this dung pat was actually -- well, it was a dung pat

54
0:03:00.65,000 --> 0:03:02,000
15 minutes before this photograph was taken,

55
0:03:03.096,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and we think it's the intense competition

56
0:03:06.145,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that makes the beetles so well-adapted

57
0:03:10.025,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to rolling balls of dung.

58
0:03:12.714,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here

59
0:03:14.747,000 --> 0:03:17,000
moving across the African veld.

60
0:03:18.35,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Its head is down. It's walking backwards.

61
0:03:21.698,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction,

62
0:03:27.069,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat.

63
0:03:29.935,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This is Africa. It's hot.

64
0:03:31.923,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So what I want to share with you now

65
0:03:33.63,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues

66
0:03:36.805,000 --> 0:03:4,000
have used to investigate how dung beetles

67
0:03:41.646,000 --> 0:03:43,000
deal with these problems.

68
0:03:43.698,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So watch this beetle,

69
0:03:46.235,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.

70
0:03:50.379,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The first is how it deals with this obstacle

71
0:03:52.941,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance,

72
0:03:55.829,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and then it carries on in exactly the same direction

73
0:03:58.763,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that it took in the first place.

74
0:04:02.453,000 --> 0:04:05,000
A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.

75
0:04:06.219,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So clearly this animal knows where it's going

76
0:04:09.596,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and it knows where it wants to go,

77
0:04:10.935,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and that's a very, very important thing,

78
0:04:12.82,000 --> 0:04:14,000
because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile,

79
0:04:15.235,000 --> 0:04:19,000
you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else,

80
0:04:19.758,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.

81
0:04:22.651,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So we gave them some more tasks to deal with,

82
0:04:27.03,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and what we did here is we turned the world

83
0:04:31.19,000 --> 0:04:34,000
under their feet. And watch its response.

84
0:04:40.547,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So this animal has actually had the whole world

85
0:04:43.343,000 --> 0:04:45,000
turned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.

86
0:04:46.19,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go,

87
0:04:48.662,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and it heads off in that particular direction.

88
0:04:51.63,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So our next question then was,

89
0:04:53.822,000 --> 0:04:54,000
how are they doing this?

90
0:04:55.782,000 --> 0:04:58,000
What are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.

91
0:04:59.231,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball

92
0:05:02.358,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and they'd take a look at the world around them.

93
0:05:04.99,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And what do you think they could be looking at

94
0:05:06.71,000 --> 0:05:07,000
as they climb on top of the ball?

95
0:05:08.386,000 --> 0:05:11,000
What are the obvious cues that this animal could use

96
0:05:11.941,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to direct its movement? And the most obvious one

97
0:05:16.119,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is to look at the sky, and so we thought,

98
0:05:20.338,000 --> 0:05:22,000
now what could they be looking at in the sky?

99
0:05:22.602,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun.

100
0:05:26.711,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So a classic experiment here,

101
0:05:29.665,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in that what we did was we moved the sun.

102
0:05:33.204,000 --> 0:05:35,000
What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board

103
0:05:35.945,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and then move the sun with a mirror

104
0:05:37.915,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to a completely different position.

105
0:05:39.781,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And look at what the beetle does.

106
0:05:41.693,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It does a little double dance,

107
0:05:44.524,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and then it heads back in exactly the same direction

108
0:05:46.803,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it went in the first place.

109
0:05:49.212,000 --> 0:05:52,000
What happens now? So clearly they're looking at the sun.

110
0:05:52.939,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.

111
0:05:56.201,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The thing is the sun is not always available to you,

112
0:05:58.826,000 --> 0:06:02,000
because at sunset it disappears below the horizon.

113
0:06:03.242,000 --> 0:06:05,000
What is happening in the sky here

114
0:06:05.826,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky

115
0:06:09.485,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built.

116
0:06:13.236,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But the sun is at the horizon over here

117
0:06:16.939,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and we know that when the sun is at the horizon,

118
0:06:19.906,000 --> 0:06:2,000
say it's over on this side,

119
0:06:21.45,000 --> 0:06:25,000
there is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky

120
0:06:26.035,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of polarized light that we can't see

121
0:06:28.508,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that the beetles can see.

122
0:06:31.306,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So how do we test that? Well, that's easy.

123
0:06:34.165,000 --> 0:06:36,000
What we do is we get a great big polarization filter,

124
0:06:37.107,000 --> 0:06:41,000
pop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles

125
0:06:41.531,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to the polarization pattern of the sky.

126
0:06:44.181,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The beetle comes out from underneath the filter

127
0:06:48.351,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and it does a right-hand turn,

128
0:06:50.854,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because it comes back under the sky

129
0:06:53.048,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that it was originally orientated to

130
0:06:55.867,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and then reorientates itself back

131
0:06:58.212,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to the direction it was originally going in.

132
0:07:02.134,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So obviously beetles can see polarized light.

133
0:07:07.951,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Okay, so what we've got so far is,

134
0:07:10.708,000 --> 0:07:12,000
what are beetles doing? They're rolling balls.

135
0:07:13.484,000 --> 0:07:16,000
How are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line.

136
0:07:16.499,000 --> 0:07:19,000
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?

137
0:07:20.077,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Well, they're looking at celestial cues in the sky,

138
0:07:22.772,000 --> 0:07:24,000
some of which you and I can't see.

139
0:07:25.016,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But how do they pick up those celestial cues?

140
0:07:26.7,000 --> 0:07:29,000
That was what was of interest to us next.

141
0:07:29.744,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And it was this particular little behavior, the dance,

142
0:07:32.932,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that we thought was important, because look,

143
0:07:35.851,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it takes a pause every now and then,

144
0:07:37.407,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.

145
0:07:41.886,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So what are they doing when they do this dance?

146
0:07:46.123,000 --> 0:07:5,000
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?

147
0:07:50.465,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And in this experiment here, what we did was we forced them

148
0:07:53.961,000 --> 0:07:55,000
into a channel, and you can see he wasn't

149
0:07:56.623,000 --> 0:07:58,000
particularly forced into this particular channel,

150
0:07:59.361,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees

151
0:08:04.659,000 --> 0:08:07,000
until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction

152
0:08:08.395,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that it wanted to go in, in the first place.

153
0:08:10.96,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And let's see what his reaction is

154
0:08:13.761,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as he's headed through 90 degrees here,

155
0:08:16.371,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and now he's going to -- when he ends up down here,

156
0:08:18.475,000 --> 0:08:21,000
he's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.

157
0:08:21.522,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And see what his response is.

158
0:08:23.82,000 --> 0:08:26,000
He does a little dance, he turns around,

159
0:08:27.013,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going.

160
0:08:30.747,000 --> 0:08:32,000
He knows exactly what the problem is,

161
0:08:33.026,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and he knows exactly how to deal with it,

162
0:08:34.621,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and the dance is this transition behavior

163
0:08:37.322,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that allows them to reorientate themselves.

164
0:08:40.131,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So that's the dance, but after spending many years

165
0:08:44.923,000 --> 0:08:47,000
sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days,

166
0:08:48.579,000 --> 0:08:5,000
we noticed that there was another behavior

167
0:08:50.93,000 --> 0:08:52,000
associated with the dance behavior.

168
0:08:53.419,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Every now and then, when they climb on top of the ball,

169
0:08:57.357,000 --> 0:09:,000
they wipe their face.

170
0:09:00.763,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And you see him do it again.

171
0:09:03.726,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now we thought, now what could be going on here?

172
0:09:06.707,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Clearly the ground is very hot, and when the ground is hot,

173
0:09:09.611,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they dance more often, and when they do this particular dance,

174
0:09:12.346,000 --> 0:09:13,000
they wipe the bottom of their face.

175
0:09:14.316,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior.

176
0:09:17.015,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to

177
0:09:19.025,000 --> 0:09:22,000
get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face

178
0:09:22.466,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to cool their head down.

179
0:09:24.882,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So what we did was design a couple of arenas.

180
0:09:29.324,000 --> 0:09:31,000
one was hot, one was cold.

181
0:09:31.423,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We shaded this one. We left that one hot.

182
0:09:33.8,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera.

183
0:09:37.267,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So what you're looking at here is a heat image

184
0:09:41.683,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of the system, and what you can see here emerging

185
0:09:45.604,000 --> 0:09:48,000
from the poo is a cool dung ball.

186
0:09:49.213,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here,

187
0:09:52.492,000 --> 0:09:56,000
dung is cool. (Laughter)

188
0:09:57.472,000 --> 0:10:,000
So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature

189
0:10:00.69,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of the beetle against the background.

190
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.

191
0:10:07.274,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about

192
0:10:09.882,000 --> 0:10:11,000
30 to 35 degrees centigrade,

193
0:10:11.953,000 --> 0:10:13,000
so this is a great big ball of ice cream

194
0:10:14.619,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.

195
0:10:17.746,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because

196
0:10:20.449,000 --> 0:10:22,000
its body temperature is actually relatively low.

197
0:10:23.29,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It's about the same as yours and mine.

198
0:10:26.363,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.

199
0:10:31.327,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment,

200
0:10:35.634,000 --> 0:10:37,000
look at the temperature of the soil.

201
0:10:37.784,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.

202
0:10:41.234,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Watch how often the beetle dances.

203
0:10:44.676,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.

204
0:10:49.218,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow,

205
0:10:52.141,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and the beetle climbs on top of the ball

206
0:10:54.075,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down,

207
0:10:58.714,000 --> 0:11:03,000
we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across.

208
0:11:04.384,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And what we did then was put little boots on these legs,

209
0:11:08.316,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because this was a way to test if the legs

210
0:11:11.278,000 --> 0:11:14,000
were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil.

211
0:11:15.036,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And if you look over here, with boots they climb onto the ball

212
0:11:19.013,000 --> 0:11:23,000
far less often when they had no boots on.

213
0:11:23.204,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So we described these as cool boots.

214
0:11:25.531,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots.

215
0:11:28.453,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able

216
0:11:31.34,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball,

217
0:11:34.989,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and they climbed onto that ball far less often

218
0:11:37.54,000 --> 0:11:38,000
than when they had a hot ball.

219
0:11:39.076,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior

220
0:11:42.05,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that you and I do if we cross the beach,

221
0:11:43.958,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel --

222
0:11:46.676,000 --> 0:11:47,000
"Sorry, I've jumped onto your towel." --

223
0:11:47.899,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel,

224
0:11:50.463,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and that way you don't burn your feet.

225
0:11:52.668,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.

226
0:11:55.469,000 --> 0:11:58,000
However, there's one more story I'd like to share with you,

227
0:11:58.684,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and that's this particular species.

228
0:12:00.256,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It's from a genus called Pachysoma.

229
0:12:03.049,000 --> 0:12:06,000
There are 13 species in the genus, and they have

230
0:12:06.081,000 --> 0:12:12,000
a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting.

231
0:12:12.219,000 --> 0:12:16,000
This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing.

232
0:12:16.879,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Can you spot the difference?

233
0:12:19.569,000 --> 0:12:22,000
They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion.

234
0:12:22.801,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but it's walking forwards,

235
0:12:24.595,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.

236
0:12:28.156,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This is a different species in the same genus

237
0:12:30.61,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but exactly the same foraging behavior.

238
0:12:34.482,000 --> 0:12:36,000
There's one more interesting aspect of this

239
0:12:37.273,000 --> 0:12:41,000
dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating,

240
0:12:41.576,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and that's that it forages and provisions a nest.

241
0:12:46.082,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So watch this individual here, and what he's trying to do

242
0:12:48.773,000 --> 0:12:5,000
is set up a nest.

243
0:12:51.493,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And he doesn't like this first position,

244
0:12:53.202,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but he comes up with a second position,

245
0:12:54.825,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and about 50 minutes later, that nest is finished,

246
0:12:58.682,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and he heads off to forage and provision

247
0:13:02.409,000 --> 0:13:04,000
at a pile of dry dung pellets.

248
0:13:04.763,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And what I want you to notice is the outward path

249
0:13:07.929,000 --> 0:13:11,000
compared to the homeward path, and compare the two.

250
0:13:12.538,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And by and large, you'll see that the homeward path

251
0:13:15.198,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is far more direct than the outward path.

252
0:13:18.029,000 --> 0:13:2,000
On the outward path, he's always on the lookout

253
0:13:20.844,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for a new blob of dung.

254
0:13:23.309,000 --> 0:13:24,000
On the way home, he knows where home is,

255
0:13:24.86,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and he wants to go straight to it.

256
0:13:28.078,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip,

257
0:13:31.653,000 --> 0:13:34,000
as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated

258
0:13:35.043,000 --> 0:13:39,000
back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.

259
0:13:39.348,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And watch, you're going to see

260
0:13:40.29,000 --> 0:13:44,000
another South African crime taking place right now. (Laughter)

261
0:13:44.3,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.

262
0:13:48.914,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So what we're looking at here

263
0:13:52.051,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is a behavior called path integration.

264
0:13:55.379,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And what's taking place is that the beetle

265
0:13:57.996,000 --> 0:14:01,000
has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path

266
0:14:02.299,000 --> 0:14:05,000
looking for food, and then when it finds food,

267
0:14:05.39,000 --> 0:14:09,000
it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.

268
0:14:09.698,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Now there's two ways it could be doing that,

269
0:14:12.723,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and we can test that by displacing the beetle

270
0:14:15.683,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to a new position when it's at the foraging site.

271
0:14:18.38,000 --> 0:14:21,000
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.

272
0:14:21.674,000 --> 0:14:24,000
If it is using something called path integration,

273
0:14:25.089,000 --> 0:14:28,000
it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot,

274
0:14:28.873,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and what it's doing here if it's using path integration

275
0:14:31.297,000 --> 0:14:34,000
is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.

276
0:14:35.168,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.

277
0:14:38.865,000 --> 0:14:41,000
If you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place.

278
0:14:41.993,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So let's see what happens when we put this beetle

279
0:14:44.57,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to the test with a similar experiment.

280
0:14:47.886,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So here's our cunning experimenter.

281
0:14:52.272,000 --> 0:14:54,000
He displaces the beetle,

282
0:14:54.673,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and now we have to see what is going to take place.

283
0:14:59.522,000 --> 0:15:02,000
What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was.

284
0:15:02.616,000 --> 0:15:04,000
The forage has been displaced to a new position.

285
0:15:05.563,000 --> 0:15:07,000
If he's using landmark orientation,

286
0:15:07.922,000 --> 0:15:08,000
he should be able to find the burrow,

287
0:15:09.682,000 --> 0:15:11,000
because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it.

288
0:15:12.405,000 --> 0:15:15,000
If he's using path integration,

289
0:15:15.448,000 --> 0:15:18,000
then it should end up in the wrong spot over here.

290
0:15:19.172,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So let's watch what happens

291
0:15:21.482,000 --> 0:15:24,000
when we put the beetle through the whole test.

292
0:15:24.773,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So there he is there.

293
0:15:26.769,000 --> 0:15:32,000
He's about to head home, and look what happens.

294
0:15:33.029,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Shame.

295
0:15:35.522,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It hasn't a clue.

296
0:15:37.756,000 --> 0:15:39,000
It starts to search for its house in the right distance

297
0:15:40.676,000 --> 0:15:45,000
away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.

298
0:15:46.651,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So we know now that this animal uses path integration

299
0:15:50.869,000 --> 0:15:54,000
to find its way around, and the callous experimenter

300
0:15:54.948,000 --> 0:15:57,000
leads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter)

301
0:15:58.069,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So what we're looking at here are a group of animals

302
0:16:02.124,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass

303
0:16:04.203,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to find their way around,

304
0:16:05.843,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and they have some sort of system

305
0:16:08.368,000 --> 0:16:09,000
for measuring that distance,

306
0:16:10.331,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and we know that these species here actually

307
0:16:13.668,000 --> 0:16:15,000
count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer,

308
0:16:16.349,000 --> 0:16:21,000
a step-counting system, to find their way back home.

309
0:16:21.486,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We don't know yet what dung beetles use.

310
0:16:24.309,000 --> 0:16:26,000
So what have we learned from these animals

311
0:16:26.588,000 --> 0:16:29,000
with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice?

312
0:16:29.589,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Well, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line

313
0:16:33.7,000 --> 0:16:35,000
using celestial cues.

314
0:16:35.845,000 --> 0:16:38,000
We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior

315
0:16:38.973,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and it's also a thermoregulation behavior,

316
0:16:41.387,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and we also know that they use a path integration system

317
0:16:45.585,000 --> 0:16:47,000
for finding their way home.

318
0:16:47.674,000 --> 0:16:51,000
So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance

319
0:16:51.844,000 --> 0:16:53,000
we can actually learn an awful lot from these things

320
0:16:54.613,000 --> 0:16:57,000
doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do.

321
0:16:58.245,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Thank you. (Applause)

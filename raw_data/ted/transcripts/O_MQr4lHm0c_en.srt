1
0:00:12.873,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to start by telling you about an email

2
0:00:15.159,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that I saw in my inbox recently.

3
0:00:17.342,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now, I have a pretty unusual inbox

4
0:00:20.191,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because I'm a therapist

5
0:00:21.651,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I write an advice column called "Dear Therapist,"

6
0:00:25.119,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so you can imagine what's in there.

7
0:00:27.587,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I mean, I've read thousands of very personal letters

8
0:00:31.842,000 --> 0:00:33,000
from strangers all over the world.

9
0:00:34.555,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And these letters range from heartbreak and loss,

10
0:00:36.872,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to spats with parents or siblings.

11
0:00:39.246,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I keep them in a folder on my laptop,

12
0:00:41.671,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I've named it "The Problems of Living."

13
0:00:44.428,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So, I get this email, I get lots of emails just like this,

14
0:00:47.857,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I want to bring you into my world for a second

15
0:00:50.239,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and read you one of these letters.

16
0:00:52.492,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And here's how it goes.

17
0:00:58.698,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"Dear Therapist,

18
0:01:00.499,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I've been married for 10 years

19
0:01:01.96,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and things were good until a couple of years ago.

20
0:01:04.666,000 --> 0:01:06,000
That's when my husband stopped wanting to have sex as much,

21
0:01:07.461,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and now we barely have sex at all."

22
0:01:09.334,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I'm sure you guys were not expecting this.

23
0:01:11.373,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:12.398,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"Well, last night I discovered that for the past few months,

25
0:01:15.661,000 --> 0:01:17,000
he's been secretly having long, late-night phone calls

26
0:01:18.226,000 --> 0:01:19,000
with a woman at his office.

27
0:01:20.016,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I googled her, and she's gorgeous.

28
0:01:22.496,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I can't believe this is happening.

29
0:01:24.314,000 --> 0:01:26,000
My father had an affair with a coworker when I was young

30
0:01:27.012,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and it broke our family apart.

31
0:01:29.139,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Needless to say, I'm devastated.

32
0:01:31.528,000 --> 0:01:32,000
If I stay in this marriage,

33
0:01:32.889,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'll never be able to trust my husband again.

34
0:01:35.024,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But I don't want to put our kids through a divorce,

35
0:01:37.437,000 --> 0:01:38,000
stepmom situation, etc.

36
0:01:39.302,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What should I do?"

37
0:01:42.743,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Well, what do you think she should do?

38
0:01:46.727,000 --> 0:01:47,000
If you got this letter,

39
0:01:47.989,000 --> 0:01:5,000
you might be thinking about how painful infidelity is.

40
0:01:51.802,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Or maybe about how especially painful it is here

41
0:01:54.961,000 --> 0:01:56,000
because of her experience growing up with her father.

42
0:01:58.04,000 --> 0:02:,000
And like me, you'd probably have some empathy for this woman,

43
0:02:00.926,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and you might even have some,

44
0:02:02.362,000 --> 0:02:03,000
how should I put this nicely,

45
0:02:03.83,000 --> 0:02:06,000
let's just call them "not-so-positive" feelings for her husband.

46
0:02:07.108,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now, those are the kinds of things that go through my mind too,

47
0:02:10.088,000 --> 0:02:12,000
when I'm reading these letters in my inbox.

48
0:02:12.12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But I have to be really careful when I respond to these letters

49
0:02:15.223,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because I know that every letter I get is actually just a story

50
0:02:19.222,000 --> 0:02:2,000
written by a specific author.

51
0:02:21.174,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And that another version of this story also exists.

52
0:02:24.246,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It always does.

53
0:02:26.166,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I know this

54
0:02:27.35,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because if I've learned anything as a therapist,

55
0:02:29.626,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it's that we are all unreliable narrators of our own lives.

56
0:02:33.306,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I am.

57
0:02:34.973,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You are.

58
0:02:36.497,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And so is everyone you know.

59
0:02:38.754,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Which I probably shouldn't have told you

60
0:02:40.738,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because now you're not going to believe my TED Talk.

61
0:02:43.246,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Look, I don't mean that we purposely mislead.

62
0:02:45.635,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Most of what people tell me is absolutely true,

63
0:02:48.771,000 --> 0:02:5,000
just from their current points of view.

64
0:02:51.056,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Depending on what they emphasize or minimize,

65
0:02:53.508,000 --> 0:02:54,000
what they leave in, what they leave out,

66
0:02:55.441,000 --> 0:02:57,000
what they see and want me to see,

67
0:02:57.481,000 --> 0:02:59,000
they tell their stories in a particular way.

68
0:03:00.179,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The psychologist Jerome Bruner described this beautifully -- he said,

69
0:03:03.442,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"To tell a story is, inescapably, to take a moral stance."

70
0:03:07.966,000 --> 0:03:09,000
All of us walk around with stories about our lives.

71
0:03:10.625,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Why choices were made, why things went wrong,

72
0:03:13.085,000 --> 0:03:14,000
why we treated someone a certain way --

73
0:03:14.982,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because obviously, they deserved it --

74
0:03:16.999,000 --> 0:03:17,000
why someone treated us a certain way --

75
0:03:18.961,000 --> 0:03:19,000
even though, obviously, we didn't.

76
0:03:20.723,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Stories are the way we make sense of our lives.

77
0:03:23.699,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But what happens when the stories we tell

78
0:03:26.413,000 --> 0:03:29,000
are misleading or incomplete or just wrong?

79
0:03:30.929,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Well, instead of providing clarity,

80
0:03:32.633,000 --> 0:03:33,000
these stories keep us stuck.

81
0:03:34.515,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We assume that our circumstances shape our stories.

82
0:03:38.23,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But what I found time and again in my work

83
0:03:40.287,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is that the exact opposite happens.

84
0:03:42.262,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The way we narrate our lives shapes what they become.

85
0:03:46.989,000 --> 0:03:47,000
That's the danger of our stories,

86
0:03:48.592,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because they can really mess us up,

87
0:03:50.298,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but it's also their power.

88
0:03:51.568,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Because what it means is that if we can change our stories,

89
0:03:54.576,000 --> 0:03:56,000
then we can change our lives.

90
0:03:56.655,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And today, I want to show you how.

91
0:03:59.624,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now, I told you I'm a therapist,

92
0:04:01.481,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and I really am, I'm not being an unreliable narrator.

93
0:04:04.378,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But if I'm, let's say, on an airplane,

94
0:04:06.608,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and someone asks what I do,

95
0:04:08.513,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I usually say I'm an editor.

96
0:04:11.017,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I say that partly because if I say I'm a therapist,

97
0:04:13.613,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I always get some awkward response, like,

98
0:04:16.621,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"Oh, a therapist.

99
0:04:18.32,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Are you going to psychoanalyze me?"

100
0:04:20.492,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And I'm thinking, "A : no,

101
0:04:22.08,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and B: why would I do that here?

102
0:04:24.508,000 --> 0:04:25,000
If I said I was a gynecologist,

103
0:04:26.032,000 --> 0:04:28,000
would you ask if I were about to give you a pelvic exam?"

104
0:04:28.723,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:31.207,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But the main reason I say I'm an editor

106
0:04:33.493,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is because it's true.

107
0:04:35.041,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, it's the job of all therapists to help people edit,

108
0:04:37.746,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but what's interesting about my specific role as Dear Therapist

109
0:04:40.88,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is that when I edit, I'm not just editing for one person.

110
0:04:43.595,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I'm trying to teach a whole group of readers how to edit,

111
0:04:46.293,000 --> 0:04:48,000
using one letter each week as the example.

112
0:04:48.325,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So I'm thinking about things like,

113
0:04:49.992,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"What material is extraneous?"

114
0:04:51.794,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"Is the protagonist moving forward or going in circles,

115
0:04:55.064,000 --> 0:04:58,000
are the supporting characters important or are they a distraction?"

116
0:04:58.231,000 --> 0:05:,000
"Do the plot points reveal a theme?"

117
0:05:00.699,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And what I've noticed

118
0:05:02.278,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is that most people's stories tend to circle around two key themes.

119
0:05:06.302,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The first is freedom,

120
0:05:07.802,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and the second is change.

121
0:05:09.603,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And when I edit,

122
0:05:10.857,000 --> 0:05:12,000
those are the themes that I start with.

123
0:05:12.973,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, let's take a look at freedom for a second.

124
0:05:15.695,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Our stories about freedom go like this:

125
0:05:18.473,000 --> 0:05:19,000
we believe, in general,

126
0:05:20.362,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that we have an enormous amount of freedom.

127
0:05:24.317,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Except when it comes to the problem at hand,

128
0:05:26.421,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in which case, suddenly, we feel like we have none.

129
0:05:28.945,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Many of our stories are about feeling trapped, right?

130
0:05:31.627,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We feel imprisoned by our families, our jobs,

131
0:05:34.126,000 --> 0:05:36,000
our relationships, our pasts.

132
0:05:36.599,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Sometimes, we even imprison ourselves with a narrative of self-flagellation --

133
0:05:40.29,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I know you guys all know these stories.

134
0:05:42.203,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The "everyone's life is better than mine" story,

135
0:05:44.476,000 --> 0:05:45,000
courtesy of social media.

136
0:05:45.746,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The "I'm an impostor" story, the "I'm unlovable" story,

137
0:05:48.342,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the "nothing will ever work out for me" story.

138
0:05:50.564,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The "when I say, 'Hey, Siri, ' and she doesn't answer,

139
0:05:53.125,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that means she hates me" story.

140
0:05:54.666,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I see you, see, I'm not the only one.

141
0:05:57.532,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The woman who wrote me that letter,

142
0:05:59.461,000 --> 0:06:,000
she also feels trapped.

143
0:06:01.373,000 --> 0:06:03,000
If she stays with her husband, she'll never trust him again,

144
0:06:04.246,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but if she leaves, her children will suffer.

145
0:06:07.04,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now, there's a cartoon that I think is a perfect example

146
0:06:09.944,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of what's really going on in these stories.

147
0:06:12.492,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The cartoon shows a prisoner shaking the bars,

148
0:06:14.922,000 --> 0:06:16,000
desperately trying to get out.

149
0:06:16.968,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But on the right and the left, it's open.

150
0:06:19.183,000 --> 0:06:2,000
No bars.

151
0:06:20.968,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The prisoner isn't in jail.

152
0:06:23.977,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That's most of us.

153
0:06:25.176,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We feel completely trapped,

154
0:06:26.803,000 --> 0:06:28,000
stuck in our emotional jail cells.

155
0:06:28.922,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But we don't walk around the bars to freedom

156
0:06:31.065,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because we know there's a catch.

157
0:06:33.223,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Freedom comes with responsibility.

158
0:06:35.802,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And if we take responsibility for our role in the story,

159
0:06:39.675,000 --> 0:06:41,000
we might just have to change.

160
0:06:41.818,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And that's the other common theme that I see in our stories: change.

161
0:06:45.08,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Those stories sound like this:

162
0:06:46.58,000 --> 0:06:48,000
a person says, "I want to change."

163
0:06:48.81,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But what they really mean is,

164
0:06:50.801,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"I want another character in the story to change."

165
0:06:54.476,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Therapists describe this dilemma as:

166
0:06:56.23,000 --> 0:06:58,000
"If the queen had balls, she'd be the king."

167
0:06:58.762,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I mean --

168
0:06:59.945,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Laughter)

169
0:07:00.969,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It makes no sense, right?

170
0:07:03.923,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Why wouldn't we want the protagonist,

171
0:07:05.931,000 --> 0:07:07,000
who's the hero of the story, to change?

172
0:07:08.36,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Well, it might be because change,

173
0:07:10.011,000 --> 0:07:11,000
even really positive change,

174
0:07:11.765,000 --> 0:07:13,000
involves a surprising amount of loss.

175
0:07:14.381,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Loss of the familiar.

176
0:07:16.016,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Even if the familiar is unpleasant or utterly miserable,

177
0:07:19.373,000 --> 0:07:21,000
at least we know the characters and setting and plot,

178
0:07:21.881,000 --> 0:07:23,000
right down to the recurring dialogue in this story.

179
0:07:24.318,000 --> 0:07:25,000
"You never do the laundry!"

180
0:07:25.66,000 --> 0:07:26,000
"I did it last time!"

181
0:07:26.897,000 --> 0:07:27,000
"Oh, yeah? When?"

182
0:07:28.085,000 --> 0:07:29,000
There's something oddly comforting

183
0:07:29.84,000 --> 0:07:31,000
about knowing exactly how the story is going to go

184
0:07:32.214,000 --> 0:07:33,000
every single time.

185
0:07:34.17,000 --> 0:07:37,000
To write a new chapter is to venture into the unknown.

186
0:07:37.71,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's to stare at a blank page.

187
0:07:39.94,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And as any writer will tell you,

188
0:07:41.527,000 --> 0:07:43,000
there's nothing more terrifying than a blank page.

189
0:07:44.476,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But here's the thing.

190
0:07:45.937,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Once we edit our story,

191
0:07:47.984,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the next chapter becomes much easier to write.

192
0:07:51.459,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We talk so much in our culture about getting to know ourselves.

193
0:07:54.777,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But part of getting to know yourself is to unknow yourself.

194
0:07:58.388,000 --> 0:08:01,000
To let go of the one version of the story you've been telling yourself

195
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:03,000
so that you can live your life,

196
0:08:03.85,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and not the story that you've been telling yourself

197
0:08:06.27,000 --> 0:08:07,000
about your life.

198
0:08:07.897,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And that's how we walk around those bars.

199
0:08:11.297,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So I want to go back to the letter from the woman, about the affair.

200
0:08:14.662,000 --> 0:08:16,000
She asked me what she should do.

201
0:08:16.797,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now, I have this word taped up in my office:

202
0:08:19.27,000 --> 0:08:2,000
ultracrepidarianism.

203
0:08:21.278,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The habit of giving advice or opinions outside of one's knowledge or competence.

204
0:08:25.897,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It's a great word, right?

205
0:08:27.199,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You can use it in all different contexts,

206
0:08:29.184,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I'm sure you will be using it after this TED Talk.

207
0:08:31.619,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I use it because it reminds me that as a therapist,

208
0:08:34.554,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I can help people to sort out what they want to do,

209
0:08:36.96,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but I can't make their life choices for them.

210
0:08:39.754,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Only you can write your story,

211
0:08:42.397,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and all you need are some tools.

212
0:08:44.524,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So what I want to do

213
0:08:45.839,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is I want to edit this woman's letter together, right here,

214
0:08:48.656,000 --> 0:08:51,000
as a way to show how we can all revise our stories.

215
0:08:51.998,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I want to start by asking you

216
0:08:54.196,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to think of a story that you're telling yourself right now

217
0:08:57.656,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that might not be serving you well.

218
0:08:59.801,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It might be about a circumstance you're experiencing,

219
0:09:02.889,000 --> 0:09:04,000
it might be about a person in your life,

220
0:09:05.341,000 --> 0:09:06,000
it might even be about yourself.

221
0:09:07.793,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And I want you to look at the supporting characters.

222
0:09:10.749,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Who are the people who are helping you

223
0:09:12.598,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to uphold the wrong version of this story?

224
0:09:16.202,000 --> 0:09:18,000
For instance, if the woman who wrote me that letter

225
0:09:18.639,000 --> 0:09:19,000
told her friends what happened,

226
0:09:20.186,000 --> 0:09:23,000
they would probably offer her what's called "idiot compassion."

227
0:09:23.215,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now, in idiot compassion, we go along with the story,

228
0:09:25.739,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we say, "You're right, that's so unfair,"

229
0:09:28.119,000 --> 0:09:31,000
when a friend tells us that he didn't get the promotion he wanted,

230
0:09:31.254,000 --> 0:09:33,000
even though we know this has happened several times before

231
0:09:34.049,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because he doesn't really put in the effort,

232
0:09:36.121,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and he probably also steals office supplies.

233
0:09:38.212,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Laughter)

234
0:09:39.236,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We say, "Yeah, you're right, he's a jerk,"

235
0:09:41.806,000 --> 0:09:43,000
when a friend tells us that her boyfriend broke up with her,

236
0:09:44.827,000 --> 0:09:46,000
even though we know that there are certain ways

237
0:09:47.057,000 --> 0:09:48,000
she tends to behave in relationships,

238
0:09:48.865,000 --> 0:09:5,000
like the incessant texting or the going through his drawers,

239
0:09:51.715,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that tend to lead to this outcome.

240
0:09:53.429,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We see the problem, it's like,

241
0:09:55.103,000 --> 0:09:57,000
if a fight breaks out in every bar you're going to,

242
0:09:57.532,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it might be you.

243
0:09:58.707,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

244
0:10:00.992,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In order to be good editors, we need to offer wise compassion,

245
0:10:04.715,000 --> 0:10:06,000
not just to our friends, but to ourselves.

246
0:10:07.24,000 --> 0:10:09,000
This is what's called -- I think the technical term might be --

247
0:10:10.217,000 --> 0:10:12,000
"delivering compassionate truth bombs."

248
0:10:13.024,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And these truth bombs are compassionate,

249
0:10:14.977,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because they help us to see what we've left out of the story.

250
0:10:17.88,000 --> 0:10:18,000
The truth is,

251
0:10:19.064,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we don't know if this woman's husband is having an affair,

252
0:10:21.81,000 --> 0:10:23,000
or why their sex life changed two years ago,

253
0:10:24.582,000 --> 0:10:27,000
or what those late-night phone calls are really about.

254
0:10:27.733,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And it might be that because of her history,

255
0:10:29.868,000 --> 0:10:31,000
she's writing a singular story of betrayal,

256
0:10:32.503,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but there's probably something else

257
0:10:34.429,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that she's not willing to let me, in her letter,

258
0:10:37.397,000 --> 0:10:39,000
or maybe even herself, to see.

259
0:10:40.143,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's like that guy who's taking a Rorschach test.

260
0:10:42.476,000 --> 0:10:43,000
You all know what Rorschach tests are?

261
0:10:44.35,000 --> 0:10:46,000
A psychologist shows you some ink blots, they look like that,

262
0:10:47.358,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and asks, "What do you see?"

263
0:10:50.287,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So the guy looks at his ink blot and he says,

264
0:10:52.787,000 --> 0:10:55,000
"Well, I definitely don't see blood."

265
0:10:57.675,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And the examiner says,

266
0:10:59.358,000 --> 0:11:02,000
"Alright, tell me what else you definitely don't see."

267
0:11:03.622,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In writing, this is called point of view.

268
0:11:05.956,000 --> 0:11:07,000
What is the narrator not willing to see?

269
0:11:08.733,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So, I want to read you one more letter.

270
0:11:12.797,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And it goes like this.

271
0:11:16.86,000 --> 0:11:17,000
"Dear Therapist,

272
0:11:19.701,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I need help with my wife.

273
0:11:21.621,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Lately, everything I do irritates her,

274
0:11:23.549,000 --> 0:11:26,000
even small things, like the noise I make when I chew.

275
0:11:27.214,000 --> 0:11:28,000
At breakfast,

276
0:11:28.421,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I noticed that she even tries to secretly put extra milk in my granola

277
0:11:31.755,000 --> 0:11:32,000
so it won't be as crunchy."

278
0:11:33.065,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Laughter)

279
0:11:34.469,000 --> 0:11:38,000
"I feel like she became critical of me after my father died two years ago.

280
0:11:38.604,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I was very close with him,

281
0:11:39.906,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and her father left when she was young,

282
0:11:41.818,000 --> 0:11:43,000
so she couldn't relate to what I was going through.

283
0:11:44.405,000 --> 0:11:46,000
There's a friend at work whose father died a few months ago,

284
0:11:47.262,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and who understands my grief.

285
0:11:48.976,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I wish I could talk to my wife like I talk to my friend,

286
0:11:52.088,000 --> 0:11:54,000
but I feel like she barely tolerates me now.

287
0:11:54.842,000 --> 0:11:55,000
How can I get my wife back?"

288
0:11:57.318,000 --> 0:11:58,000
OK.

289
0:11:58.961,000 --> 0:12:,000
So, what you probably picked up on

290
0:12:01.35,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is that this is the same story I read you earlier,

291
0:12:04.302,000 --> 0:12:06,000
just told from another narrator's point of view.

292
0:12:06.897,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Her story was about a husband who's cheating,

293
0:12:09.318,000 --> 0:12:12,000
his story is about a wife who can't understand his grief.

294
0:12:13.159,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But what's remarkable, is that for all of their differences,

295
0:12:16.501,000 --> 0:12:19,000
what both of these stories are about is a longing for connection.

296
0:12:20.825,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And if we can get out of the first-person narration

297
0:12:23.23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and write the story from another character's perspective,

298
0:12:25.976,000 --> 0:12:27,000
suddenly that other character becomes much more sympathetic,

299
0:12:28.873,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and the plot opens up.

300
0:12:31.342,000 --> 0:12:33,000
That's the hardest step in the editing process,

301
0:12:34.167,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but it's also where change begins.

302
0:12:36.786,000 --> 0:12:39,000
What would happen if you looked at your story

303
0:12:40.35,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and wrote it from another person's point of view?

304
0:12:43.667,000 --> 0:12:46,000
What would you see now from this wider perspective?

305
0:12:47.991,000 --> 0:12:49,000
That's why, when I see people who are depressed,

306
0:12:50.254,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I sometimes say,

307
0:12:51.429,000 --> 0:12:54,000
"You are not the best person to talk to you about you right now,"

308
0:12:54.572,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because depression distorts our stories in a very particular way.

309
0:12:57.67,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It narrows our perspectives.

310
0:12:59.25,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The same is true when we feel lonely or hurt or rejected.

311
0:13:02.607,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We create all kinds of stories,

312
0:13:04.25,000 --> 0:13:05,000
distorted through a very narrow lens

313
0:13:06.053,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that we don't even know we're looking through.

314
0:13:08.68,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And then, we've effectively become our own fake-news broadcasters.

315
0:13:13.482,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I have a confession to make.

316
0:13:15.998,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I wrote the husband's version of the letter I read you.

317
0:13:19.04,000 --> 0:13:2,000
You have no idea how much time I spent

318
0:13:20.889,000 --> 0:13:22,000
debating between granola and pita chips, by the way.

319
0:13:23.35,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I wrote it based on all of the alternative narratives

320
0:13:26.512,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that I've seen over the years,

321
0:13:27.98,000 --> 0:13:3,000
not just in my therapy practice, but also in my column.

322
0:13:31.723,000 --> 0:13:32,000
When it's happened

323
0:13:32.984,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that two people involved in the same situation

324
0:13:35.254,000 --> 0:13:37,000
have written to me, unbeknownst to the other,

325
0:13:37.754,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and I have two versions of the same story

326
0:13:39.77,000 --> 0:13:4,000
sitting in my inbox.

327
0:13:41.546,000 --> 0:13:42,000
That really has happened.

328
0:13:43.901,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I don't know what the other version of this woman's letter is,

329
0:13:46.852,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but I do know this:

330
0:13:48.345,000 --> 0:13:49,000
she has to write it.

331
0:13:50.082,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Because with a courageous edit,

332
0:13:52.151,000 --> 0:13:55,000
she'll write a much more nuanced version of her letter that she wrote to me.

333
0:13:55.977,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Even if her husband is having an affair of any kind --

334
0:13:58.627,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and maybe he is --

335
0:14:00.381,000 --> 0:14:03,000
she doesn't need to know what the plot is yet.

336
0:14:04.096,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Because just by virtue of doing an edit,

337
0:14:07.008,000 --> 0:14:1,000
she'll have so many more possibilities for what the plot can become.

338
0:14:11.277,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Now, sometimes it happens that I see people who are really stuck,

339
0:14:14.856,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and they're really invested in their stuckness.

340
0:14:18.126,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We call them help-rejecting complainers.

341
0:14:20.726,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I'm sure you know people like this.

342
0:14:22.424,000 --> 0:14:25,000
They're the people who, when you try to offer them a suggestion,

343
0:14:25.504,000 --> 0:14:29,000
they reject it with, "Yeah, no, that will never work, because ..."

344
0:14:30.801,000 --> 0:14:33,000
"Yeah, no, that's impossible, because I can't do that."

345
0:14:34.143,000 --> 0:14:38,000
"Yeah, I really want more friends, but people are just so annoying."

346
0:14:38.373,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Laughter)

347
0:14:40.445,000 --> 0:14:41,000
What they're really rejecting

348
0:14:42.246,000 --> 0:14:45,000
is an edit to their story of misery and stuckness.

349
0:14:46.3,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And so, with these people, I usually take a different approach.

350
0:14:49.538,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And what I do is I say something else.

351
0:14:52.221,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I say to them,

352
0:14:54.252,000 --> 0:14:55,000
"We're all going to die."

353
0:14:56.834,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I bet you're really glad I'm not your therapist right now.

354
0:15:00.056,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Because they look back at me

355
0:15:01.429,000 --> 0:15:03,000
the way you're looking back at me right now,

356
0:15:03.524,000 --> 0:15:04,000
with this look of utter confusion.

357
0:15:05.207,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But then I explain that there's a story

358
0:15:07.326,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that gets written about all of us, eventually.

359
0:15:10.127,000 --> 0:15:11,000
It's called an obituary.

360
0:15:12.603,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And I say that instead of being authors of our own unhappiness,

361
0:15:17.04,000 --> 0:15:2,000
we get to shape these stories while we're still alive.

362
0:15:21.016,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We get to be the hero and not the victim in our stories,

363
0:15:23.667,000 --> 0:15:25,000
we get to choose what goes on the page that lives in our minds

364
0:15:26.596,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and shapes our realities.

365
0:15:29.096,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I tell them that life is about deciding which stories to listen to

366
0:15:32.983,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and which ones need an edit.

367
0:15:34.689,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And that it's worth the effort to go through a revision

368
0:15:37.729,000 --> 0:15:4,000
because there's nothing more important to the quality of our lives

369
0:15:40.919,000 --> 0:15:42,000
than the stories we tell ourselves about them.

370
0:15:43.127,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I say that when it comes to the stories of our lives,

371
0:15:46.492,000 --> 0:15:49,000
we should be aiming for our own personal Pulitzer Prize.

372
0:15:50.397,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Now, most of us aren't help-rejecting complainers,

373
0:15:53.29,000 --> 0:15:55,000
or at least we don't believe we are.

374
0:15:55.667,000 --> 0:15:57,000
But it's a role that is so easy to slip into

375
0:15:58.318,000 --> 0:16:01,000
when we feel anxious or angry or vulnerable.

376
0:16:01.553,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So the next time you're struggling with something,

377
0:16:04.14,000 --> 0:16:05,000
remember,

378
0:16:05.593,000 --> 0:16:06,000
we're all going to die.

379
0:16:07.14,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Laughter)

380
0:16:08.593,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And then pull out your editing tools

381
0:16:11.125,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and ask yourself:

382
0:16:12.768,000 --> 0:16:14,000
what do I want my story to be?

383
0:16:16.929,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And then, go write your masterpiece.

384
0:16:20.716,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Thank you.

385
0:16:21.899,000 --> 0:16:23,000
(Applause)

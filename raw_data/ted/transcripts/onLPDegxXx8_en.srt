1
0:00:10.81,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I want to talk to you today a little bit

2
0:00:17.53,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about the predictable irrationality and

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
my interest in irrational behavior is

4
0:00:25.72,000 --> 0:00:3,000
started many years ago in hospital and I

5
0:00:28.3,000 --> 0:00:34,000
was burned very badly

6
0:00:31.529,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and if you spend a lot of time in

7
0:00:34.329,000 --> 0:00:39,000
hospital you'll see a lot of types of

8
0:00:37.27,000 --> 0:00:42,000
irrationalities and the one that

9
0:00:39.87,000 --> 0:00:44,000
particularly bothered me in the burned

10
0:00:42.76,000 --> 0:00:47,000
apartment was the process by which the

11
0:00:45.22,000 --> 0:00:49,000
nurses took the bandage of me now you

12
0:00:48.28,000 --> 0:00:51,000
must have all taken a band-aid off at

13
0:00:50.11,000 --> 0:00:53,000
some point and you must have wondered

14
0:00:51.43,000 --> 0:00:55,000
what's the right approach do you rip it

15
0:00:53.86,000 --> 0:00:57,000
off quickly short duration but high

16
0:00:56.35,000 --> 0:01:,000
intensity or do you take your band-aid

17
0:00:58.54,000 --> 0:01:03,000
off slowly you take a long time but each

18
0:01:00.88,000 --> 0:01:06,000
second is not as painful which one of

19
0:01:03.91,000 --> 0:01:09,000
those is the right approach the nurses

20
0:01:07.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in my department thought that the right

21
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
approach was the ripping wound so they

22
0:01:11.95,000 --> 0:01:13,000
would grab hold and they would rip and

23
0:01:13.6,000 --> 0:01:17,000
they would grab hold then they would rip

24
0:01:14.89,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because I had 70% of my body burned it

25
0:01:17.649,000 --> 0:01:23,000
would take about an hour and as you can

26
0:01:20.799,000 --> 0:01:25,000
imagine I hated that moment of ripping

27
0:01:24.219,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with incredible intensity and I would

28
0:01:26.649,000 --> 0:01:29,000
try to reason with them and say why

29
0:01:28.21,000 --> 0:01:31,000
don't we try something else why don't we

30
0:01:29.92,000 --> 0:01:32,000
take it a little longer maybe two hours

31
0:01:31.929,000 --> 0:01:36,000
instead of an hour and have less of this

32
0:01:33.899,000 --> 0:01:38,000
intensity and the nurse just told me two

33
0:01:37.39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
things and they told me that they had

34
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the right model of the patient that they

35
0:01:42.369,000 --> 0:01:46,000
knew what was the right thing to do to

36
0:01:43.899,000 --> 0:01:47,000
minimize my pain and they also told me

37
0:01:46.479,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that the word patient doesn't mean to

38
0:01:48.039,000 --> 0:01:53,000
make suggestions or interfere or this is

39
0:01:52.09,000 --> 0:01:54,000
not just in Hebrew by the way it's in

40
0:01:53.35,000 --> 0:01:58,000
every language I've had experience with

41
0:01:54.88,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so far and you know there's not much

42
0:01:58.84,000 --> 0:02:01,000
there wasn't much I could do and they

43
0:02:00.759,000 --> 0:02:03,000
kept on doing what what they were doing

44
0:02:02.469,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in about three years later when I left

45
0:02:03.939,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the hospital I started studying at the

46
0:02:06.219,000 --> 0:02:11,000
University and was the most interesting

47
0:02:09.069,000 --> 0:02:14,000
lessons I learned lessons it was that

48
0:02:11.43,000 --> 0:02:15,000
there is an experimental method that if

49
0:02:14.29,000 --> 0:02:17,000
you have a question you can ask a

50
0:02:15.91,000 --> 0:02:19,000
creative replica of this question in

51
0:02:18.13,000 --> 0:02:21,000
some abstract way and you can try to

52
0:02:20.049,000 --> 0:02:22,000
examine this question maybe learn

53
0:02:21.459,000 --> 0:02:24,000
something about the world

54
0:02:22.84,000 --> 0:02:25,000
so that's what I did I was still

55
0:02:25.15,000 --> 0:02:28,000
interested this question of how do you

56
0:02:26.59,000 --> 0:02:31,000
take bandages of burned patient so

57
0:02:28.75,000 --> 0:02:33,000
originally I didn't have much money so I

58
0:02:31.81,000 --> 0:02:36,000
went to a hardware store and I bought a

59
0:02:34.45,000 --> 0:02:38,000
carpenter's vise and I would bring

60
0:02:36.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
people to the lab and I would put their

61
0:02:38.65,000 --> 0:02:44,000
finger in it and I would crunch it a

62
0:02:40.18,000 --> 0:02:46,000
little bit and I would crunch it for

63
0:02:44.65,000 --> 0:02:47,000
long periods and short periods that

64
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
painting went up and when it went down

65
0:02:47.83,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and with breaks and without breaks all

66
0:02:49.959,000 --> 0:02:52,000
kinds of versions of pain and when I

67
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
finished hurting people a little bit I

68
0:02:53.89,000 --> 0:02:56,000
would ask them so how painful was this

69
0:02:55.51,000 --> 0:02:58,000
oh how painful was this so if you had to

70
0:02:57.069,000 --> 0:03:04,000
choose between the last two which one

71
0:02:58.78,000 --> 0:03:08,000
would you choose I kept on doing this

72
0:03:04.81,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for a while and then like all good

73
0:03:09.549,000 --> 0:03:14,000
academic projects I got more funding I

74
0:03:11.769,000 --> 0:03:17,000
moved to sounds electrical shocks

75
0:03:14.59,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I even had a pain suit that I could get

76
0:03:17.799,000 --> 0:03:23,000
people to feel much more pain but at the

77
0:03:22.209,000 --> 0:03:27,000
end of this process what I learned was

78
0:03:24.64,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that the nurses were wrong here were

79
0:03:27.34,000 --> 0:03:3,000
wonderful people with good intentions

80
0:03:29.709,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and plenty of experience and

81
0:03:31.06,000 --> 0:03:35,000
nevertheless they were getting things

82
0:03:32.35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
wrong predictably all the time it turns

83
0:03:35.98,000 --> 0:03:38,000
out that because we don't encode

84
0:03:37.66,000 --> 0:03:41,000
duration in the way that we encode

85
0:03:39.4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
intensity I would have had less pain if

86
0:03:41.89,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the duration would have been longer and

87
0:03:44.2,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the intensity was lower it turns out it

88
0:03:47.38,000 --> 0:03:49,000
would have been better to start with my

89
0:03:48.64,000 --> 0:03:51,000
face which was much more painful and

90
0:03:50.23,000 --> 0:03:53,000
moved toward my legs giving me a trend

91
0:03:52.389,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of improvement over time that would have

92
0:03:54.069,000 --> 0:03:57,000
been also less painful it also turns out

93
0:03:56.47,000 --> 0:03:58,000
who have been good to give me breaks in

94
0:03:57.91,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the middle to kind of recuperate from

95
0:03:59.29,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the pain all of these would have been

96
0:04:00.76,000 --> 0:04:04,000
great things to do and my nurses had no

97
0:04:02.92,000 --> 0:04:05,000
idea and from that point on I started

98
0:04:04.78,000 --> 0:04:06,000
thinking are the nurses the only people

99
0:04:06.549,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in the world who get things wrong in

100
0:04:07.75,000 --> 0:04:11,000
this particular decision or is it more

101
0:04:09.28,000 --> 0:04:13,000
general case and it turns out it's a

102
0:04:12.549,000 --> 0:04:17,000
more general case there's a lot of

103
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
mistakes we do and I want to give you

104
0:04:18.459,000 --> 0:04:22,000
one example of one of these

105
0:04:20.229,000 --> 0:04:24,000
irrationalities and I want to talk to

106
0:04:23.05,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you about cheating and the reason I

107
0:04:24.639,000 --> 0:04:26,000
picked cheating is because it's

108
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:28,000
interesting but also it tells us

109
0:04:27.1,000 --> 0:04:3,000
something I think about the stock market

110
0:04:29.08,000 --> 0:04:34,000
situation we're in

111
0:04:30.36,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so my interest in cheating started when

112
0:04:34.15,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Enron came on the scene exploded all of

113
0:04:36.25,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a sudden

114
0:04:36.7,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I started thinking about what is

115
0:04:38.56,000 --> 0:04:42,000
happening here is it the case that auras

116
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
got a few apples who are capable of

117
0:04:42.97,000 --> 0:04:45,000
doing these things or are we talking

118
0:04:44.2,000 --> 0:04:48,000
about endemic situation that many people

119
0:04:46.36,000 --> 0:04:51,000
are actually capable of behaving this

120
0:04:48.4,000 --> 0:04:53,000
way so like we usually do I decide to do

121
0:04:51.7,000 --> 0:04:55,000
a simple experiment and here's how it

122
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:57,000
went if you were in the experiment I

123
0:04:55.72,000 --> 0:04:59,000
would pass you a sheet of paper with 20

124
0:04:57.97,000 --> 0:05:,000
simple math problems that everybody

125
0:04:59.95,000 --> 0:05:02,000
could solve but I wouldn't give you

126
0:05:01.66,000 --> 0:05:05,000
enough time when the five minutes were

127
0:05:03.79,000 --> 0:05:07,000
over I would say pass me the sheets of

128
0:05:06.01,000 --> 0:05:1,000
paper and I'll pay you $1 per question

129
0:05:08.02,000 --> 0:05:11,000
people did this I would pay people four

130
0:05:10.18,000 --> 0:05:14,000
dollars for their tasks on average

131
0:05:12.01,000 --> 0:05:17,000
people would solve four problems other

132
0:05:14.68,000 --> 0:05:18,000
people I would tempt to cheat I would

133
0:05:17.08,000 --> 0:05:2,000
pass the sheet of paper when the five

134
0:05:19.15,000 --> 0:05:22,000
minutes are over I would say please

135
0:05:20.35,000 --> 0:05:23,000
shred the piece of paper put the little

136
0:05:22.57,000 --> 0:05:25,000
pieces in your pocket on your backpack

137
0:05:24.04,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and tell me how many questions you got

138
0:05:26.23,000 --> 0:05:33,000
correctly people now solve seven

139
0:05:29.35,000 --> 0:05:36,000
questions on average now it wasn't as if

140
0:05:33.76,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there's a few bad apples a few people

141
0:05:36.49,000 --> 0:05:41,000
who did a lot instead what we saw is a

142
0:05:39.19,000 --> 0:05:44,000
lot of people who cheat a little bit now

143
0:05:42.37,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in the economic theory cheating is a

144
0:05:45.07,000 --> 0:05:49,000
very simple cost-benefit analysis you

145
0:05:47.68,000 --> 0:05:5,000
say what's the probability of being

146
0:05:49.24,000 --> 0:05:53,000
caught how much do I stand to gain from

147
0:05:51.43,000 --> 0:05:54,000
cheating and how much punishment would I

148
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
get if I get caught and you weigh these

149
0:05:55.18,000 --> 0:05:57,000
options are to do the simple

150
0:05:56.53,000 --> 0:05:58,000
cost-benefit analysis and you decide

151
0:05:58.12,000 --> 0:06:03,000
whether it's worthwhile to commit the

152
0:05:59.5,000 --> 0:06:05,000
crime or not so we try to test this for

153
0:06:03.64,000 --> 0:06:06,000
some people we varied how much money

154
0:06:05.68,000 --> 0:06:09,000
they could get away with how much money

155
0:06:07.36,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they could steal we paid them ten cents

156
0:06:09.7,000 --> 0:06:15,000
per correct question 50 Cent's $1 $5 $10

157
0:06:13.09,000 --> 0:06:17,000
per correct question you would expect it

158
0:06:15.88,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as the amount of money on the on the

159
0:06:17.74,000 --> 0:06:2,000
table increases people would cheat more

160
0:06:19.54,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but in fact it wasn't the case we got a

161
0:06:21.58,000 --> 0:06:25,000
lot of people cheating by still by a

162
0:06:23.38,000 --> 0:06:27,000
little bit what about the probability of

163
0:06:25.75,000 --> 0:06:28,000
being caught some people shredded half

164
0:06:28.12,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the sheet of paper so there was some

165
0:06:29.35,000 --> 0:06:31,000
evidence left some people shredded the

166
0:06:31.21,000 --> 0:06:34,000
whole sheet of paper

167
0:06:32.29,000 --> 0:06:35,000
some people shredded everything went out

168
0:06:34.63,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of the room and paid themselves on the

169
0:06:36.22,000 --> 0:06:39,000
ball of money that had over a hundred

170
0:06:37.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
dollars you would expect it as the

171
0:06:39.67,000 --> 0:06:42,000
probability of being caught goes down

172
0:06:41.08,000 --> 0:06:45,000
people would cheat more but again this

173
0:06:42.94,000 --> 0:06:46,000
was not the case again a lot of people

174
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
cheated by just by a little bit and then

175
0:06:47.32,000 --> 0:06:51,000
unhhhh sensitive to these economic

176
0:06:48.85,000 --> 0:06:52,000
incentives so we said if people are not

177
0:06:51.67,000 --> 0:06:56,000
sensitive to the economic rationale

178
0:06:53.41,000 --> 0:06:58,000
theory explanations to these forces what

179
0:06:57.19,000 --> 0:07:,000
could be going on and we thought maybe

180
0:06:59.23,000 --> 0:07:03,000
what is happening is that there are two

181
0:07:00.85,000 --> 0:07:03,000
forces at one hand we all want to look

182
0:07:03.34,000 --> 0:07:06,000
at yourself in the mirror and feel good

183
0:07:04.63,000 --> 0:07:07,000
about ourselves so we don't want to

184
0:07:06.34,000 --> 0:07:09,000
cheat and the other hand we can cheat a

185
0:07:08.02,000 --> 0:07:12,000
little bit and still feel good about

186
0:07:09.82,000 --> 0:07:13,000
ourselves so maybe what is happening is

187
0:07:12.31,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that the level of cheating we can't go

188
0:07:14.17,000 --> 0:07:18,000
over but we can still benefit from

189
0:07:16.06,000 --> 0:07:2,000
cheating at a low degree as long as it

190
0:07:19.06,000 --> 0:07:22,000
doesn't change our impressions about

191
0:07:20.5,000 --> 0:07:26,000
ourselves we call this like a personal

192
0:07:22.9,000 --> 0:07:29,000
fudge factor now how would you test a

193
0:07:27.09,000 --> 0:07:31,000
personal fudge factor initially we said

194
0:07:30.13,000 --> 0:07:34,000
what can we do to shrink the fudge

195
0:07:31.84,000 --> 0:07:35,000
factor so we got people to the lab and

196
0:07:34.57,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we said we have two tasks for you today

197
0:07:36.09,000 --> 0:07:4,000
first we asked half the people to recall

198
0:07:38.77,000 --> 0:07:42,000
either 10 books to read in high school

199
0:07:40.96,000 --> 0:07:44,000
or to recall the 10 commandments and

200
0:07:42.94,000 --> 0:07:46,000
then we tempted them with cheating turns

201
0:07:45.58,000 --> 0:07:48,000
out the people who tried to record the

202
0:07:47.68,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Ten Commandments and in our sample

203
0:07:49.12,000 --> 0:07:53,000
nobody could recall the Ten Commandment

204
0:07:51.75,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but those people who try to recall the

205
0:07:54.1,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Ten Commandments given the opportunity

206
0:07:55.75,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to cheat did not cheat at all it wasn't

207
0:07:58.63,000 --> 0:08:,000
that the more religious people the

208
0:07:59.89,000 --> 0:08:01,000
people who remembered more of the

209
0:08:01.06,000 --> 0:08:03,000
commandment cheated less and the less

210
0:08:02.44,000 --> 0:08:04,000
religious people the people who couldn't

211
0:08:03.91,000 --> 0:08:06,000
remember almost any commandment you did

212
0:08:05.35,000 --> 0:08:09,000
more the moment people thought about

213
0:08:07.78,000 --> 0:08:11,000
trying to recall the Ten Commandments

214
0:08:09.97,000 --> 0:08:12,000
they stopped cheating in fact even when

215
0:08:12.19,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we give self-declared

216
0:08:13.3,000 --> 0:08:16,000
atheists the task of swearing on the

217
0:08:15.04,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Bible and we give them a chance to cheat

218
0:08:17.02,000 --> 0:08:23,000
they don't cheat at all now Ten

219
0:08:22.06,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Commandments is something that is hard

220
0:08:23.29,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to bring into the education system so we

221
0:08:25.09,000 --> 0:08:29,000
said why don't we get people to sign the

222
0:08:26.74,000 --> 0:08:3,000
honor code so we got people to sign I

223
0:08:29.17,000 --> 0:08:33,000
understand that this short survey falls

224
0:08:31.39,000 --> 0:08:35,000
under the MIT honor code then this

225
0:08:33.31,000 --> 0:08:37,000
shredded it no cheating whatsoever and

226
0:08:35.919,000 --> 0:08:4,000
this is particularly interesting because

227
0:08:37.66,000 --> 0:08:4,000
MIT doesn't have an honor code

228
0:08:44.11,000 --> 0:08:49,000
so all this was about decreasing the

229
0:08:46.85,000 --> 0:08:51,000
fudge factor what about increasing the

230
0:08:49.73,000 --> 0:08:53,000
fudge factor the first experiment I

231
0:08:52.13,000 --> 0:08:55,000
walked around MIT and I distributed six

232
0:08:54.02,000 --> 0:08:57,000
packs of cokes in their refrigerators

233
0:08:55.97,000 --> 0:08:58,000
these were common refrigerators for the

234
0:08:57.59,000 --> 0:09:,000
undergrads and I came back to measure

235
0:08:59.78,000 --> 0:09:02,000
what we technically called the hatch

236
0:09:01.22,000 --> 0:09:05,000
lifetime of coke how long does it last

237
0:09:03.59,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in the refrigerators and you can expect

238
0:09:05.6,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it doesn't last very long people take it

239
0:09:07.7,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in contrast they took a plate with six

240
0:09:10.58,000 --> 0:09:15,000
$1 bills and I left those plates in the

241
0:09:13.52,000 --> 0:09:17,000
same refrigerators no bill was ever

242
0:09:16.13,000 --> 0:09:2,000
disappeared now this is not a good

243
0:09:17.78,000 --> 0:09:22,000
social science experiment so to do it

244
0:09:20.36,000 --> 0:09:24,000
better I did the same experiment as I

245
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
described you before a third of the

246
0:09:24.89,000 --> 0:09:27,000
people we pass the sheet they gave it

247
0:09:26.45,000 --> 0:09:29,000
back to us a third of the people we

248
0:09:28.31,000 --> 0:09:32,000
passed it they shredded it they came to

249
0:09:30.2,000 --> 0:09:35,000
us and said mr. experimenter I solved X

250
0:09:32.75,000 --> 0:09:36,000
problems give me X dollars a third of

251
0:09:35.27,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the people when they finish reading the

252
0:09:36.83,000 --> 0:09:4,000
piece of paper they came to us and said

253
0:09:39.05,000 --> 0:09:45,000
mr. experimenter I solved X problems

254
0:09:41.74,000 --> 0:09:46,000
give me X tokens we did not pay them

255
0:09:45.86,000 --> 0:09:48,000
with dollars we pay them with something

256
0:09:47.36,000 --> 0:09:5,000
else and then they took this something

257
0:09:49.4,000 --> 0:09:53,000
else they walked 12 feet to the side and

258
0:09:51.32,000 --> 0:09:55,000
exchanged it for dollars think about the

259
0:09:54.2,000 --> 0:09:57,000
following intuition how bad would you

260
0:09:56.3,000 --> 0:10:,000
feel about taking a pencil from work

261
0:09:58.13,000 --> 0:10:02,000
home compared to how bad would you feel

262
0:10:00.62,000 --> 0:10:04,000
about taking ten cents from a petty cash

263
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
box these things feel very differently

264
0:10:04.82,000 --> 0:10:09,000
with being a step removed from cash for

265
0:10:07.73,000 --> 0:10:11,000
a few seconds by being paid by token

266
0:10:09.89,000 --> 0:10:14,000
make a difference our subjects double

267
0:10:12.17,000 --> 0:10:16,000
their cheating I'll tell you what I

268
0:10:14.99,000 --> 0:10:19,000
think about this in the stock market in

269
0:10:16.4,000 --> 0:10:22,000
a minute but this did not solve the big

270
0:10:20.57,000 --> 0:10:24,000
problem I had with anyone yet because in

271
0:10:22.55,000 --> 0:10:26,000
n1 is also a social element people see

272
0:10:25.31,000 --> 0:10:29,000
each other behaving in fact every day

273
0:10:26.96,000 --> 0:10:31,000
when we open the news we see examples of

274
0:10:29.84,000 --> 0:10:33,000
people cheating what does this causes us

275
0:10:32.05,000 --> 0:10:36,000
so we did another experiment we got the

276
0:10:34.49,000 --> 0:10:38,000
big group of students to be in the

277
0:10:36.41,000 --> 0:10:39,000
experiment and we prepaid them so

278
0:10:38.72,000 --> 0:10:41,000
everybody got an envelope with all the

279
0:10:40.31,000 --> 0:10:43,000
money for the experiment and we told

280
0:10:42.14,000 --> 0:10:47,000
them at the end we asked them to pay us

281
0:10:44.12,000 --> 0:10:48,000
back the money they didn't make okay the

282
0:10:47.81,000 --> 0:10:49,000
same thing happens when we give people

283
0:10:49.01,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the opportunity to cheat they cheat that

284
0:10:50.54,000 --> 0:10:54,000
you just buy a little bit all the same

285
0:10:52.43,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but in this experiment we also

286
0:10:54.73,000 --> 0:10:59,000
higher than acting students this acting

287
0:10:57.49,000 --> 0:11:02,000
student stood up after 30 seconds and

288
0:11:00.1,000 --> 0:11:05,000
said I solved everything what do I do

289
0:11:02.889,000 --> 0:11:07,000
now and the experiment is that if you

290
0:11:05.68,000 --> 0:11:09,000
finished everything go home that's it

291
0:11:07.93,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the task is finished so now we had a

292
0:11:09.97,000 --> 0:11:13,000
student an acting student that was a

293
0:11:12.55,000 --> 0:11:16,000
part of the group nobody knew there was

294
0:11:14.32,000 --> 0:11:2,000
though it was an actor and they clearly

295
0:11:17.41,000 --> 0:11:21,000
cheated in a very very serious way what

296
0:11:20.56,000 --> 0:11:23,000
would happen to the other people in the

297
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:29,000
group will they cheat more or will they

298
0:11:24.459,000 --> 0:11:3,000
cheat less here is what happens it turns

299
0:11:29.11,000 --> 0:11:33,000
out it depends on what kind of

300
0:11:30.519,000 --> 0:11:35,000
sweatshirts they are wearing here is the

301
0:11:33.579,000 --> 0:11:37,000
thing we ran this at a Carnegie Mellon

302
0:11:35.74,000 --> 0:11:39,000
in Pittsburgh and the Carnegie meets

303
0:11:38.23,000 --> 0:11:42,000
book that two big universities Carnegie

304
0:11:40.029,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Mellon University of Pittsburgh all of

305
0:11:42.43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the subjects sitting in the experiment

306
0:11:44.11,000 --> 0:11:48,000
were Carnegie Mellon students when the

307
0:11:46.779,000 --> 0:11:5,000
actor was getting up was the Carnegie

308
0:11:48.91,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Mellon student pretty it was actually a

309
0:11:51.519,000 --> 0:11:56,000
con email student but he was a part of

310
0:11:53.649,000 --> 0:11:57,000
their group cheating went up but when he

311
0:11:57.339,000 --> 0:12:02,000
actually had the University of

312
0:11:58.42,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down

313
0:12:05.699,000 --> 0:12:09,000
now this is important because remember

314
0:12:08.079,000 --> 0:12:12,000
when the moment the student stood up it

315
0:12:10.089,000 --> 0:12:13,000
made it clear to everybody that they

316
0:12:12.1,000 --> 0:12:14,000
could get away with cheating because the

317
0:12:13.87,000 --> 0:12:15,000
experimenter said you finished

318
0:12:14.949,000 --> 0:12:17,000
everything go home and they worked with

319
0:12:16.18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the money so it wasn't so much about the

320
0:12:18.31,000 --> 0:12:23,000
probability of being caught again it was

321
0:12:20.709,000 --> 0:12:25,000
about the norms for cheating somebody

322
0:12:24.069,000 --> 0:12:27,000
from our in-group cheats and we see them

323
0:12:26.079,000 --> 0:12:3,000
cheating we feel it's more appropriate

324
0:12:27.639,000 --> 0:12:31,000
as a group to behave this way but if

325
0:12:30.31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
it's somebody from another group these

326
0:12:31.75,000 --> 0:12:34,000
terrible people I mean not terrible in

327
0:12:33.399,000 --> 0:12:36,000
this but somebody we don't want to

328
0:12:35.079,000 --> 0:12:38,000
associate ourselves with from another

329
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:41,000
university another group office and

330
0:12:39.069,000 --> 0:12:42,000
people awareness of honesty goes up a

331
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
little bit like the Ten Commandment

332
0:12:42.61,000 --> 0:12:48,000
experiment and people cheat even even

333
0:12:46.389,000 --> 0:12:52,000
less so what what have we learned from

334
0:12:49.569,000 --> 0:12:54,000
this about cheating we've learned that a

335
0:12:52.54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
lot of people can cheat they cheat just

336
0:12:55.209,000 --> 0:13:,000
by a little bit when we remind people

337
0:12:57.76,000 --> 0:13:02,000
about their morality they cheat less

338
0:13:00.329,000 --> 0:13:06,000
when we get bigger distance from

339
0:13:03.189,000 --> 0:13:08,000
cheating from the object of money for

340
0:13:06.73,000 --> 0:13:09,000
example people cheat more

341
0:13:08.6,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and when we see things of cheating

342
0:13:09.98,000 --> 0:13:13,000
around us particularly it's a part of

343
0:13:11.69,000 --> 0:13:15,000
our in-group cheating goes up now if we

344
0:13:14.69,000 --> 0:13:18,000
think about this in terms of the stock

345
0:13:16.4,000 --> 0:13:2,000
market think about what happens what

346
0:13:18.89,000 --> 0:13:21,000
happens in a situation when you create

347
0:13:20.51,000 --> 0:13:24,000
something where you pay people a lot of

348
0:13:22.7,000 --> 0:13:26,000
money to see reality in a slightly

349
0:13:24.8,000 --> 0:13:28,000
distorted way would they not be able to

350
0:13:27.32,000 --> 0:13:31,000
see it this way of course they would

351
0:13:29.63,000 --> 0:13:32,000
what happens when you do other things

352
0:13:31.46,000 --> 0:13:34,000
like you remove things for money

353
0:13:33.44,000 --> 0:13:36,000
you call them stock of stock option

354
0:13:35.3,000 --> 0:13:39,000
derivatives mortgage-backed securities

355
0:13:37.28,000 --> 0:13:41,000
could it be that with those more distant

356
0:13:39.71,000 --> 0:13:42,000
things it's not a token for one second

357
0:13:42.05,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it's something that these many steps

358
0:13:43.22,000 --> 0:13:47,000
removed for money for much longer time

359
0:13:44.99,000 --> 0:13:48,000
could it be but people would cheat even

360
0:13:47.93,000 --> 0:13:5,000
more and what happened to the social

361
0:13:49.94,000 --> 0:13:53,000
environment when people see other people

362
0:13:51.74,000 --> 0:13:57,000
behave around them I think all of those

363
0:13:54.47,000 --> 0:13:58,000
forces worked in a very bad way in the

364
0:13:57.86,000 --> 0:14:01,000
stock market

365
0:13:58.84,000 --> 0:14:04,000
more generally I want to tell you

366
0:14:01.94,000 --> 0:14:06,000
something about behavior economics we

367
0:14:05.69,000 --> 0:14:09,000
have many intuitions

368
0:14:07.07,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in our life and the point is that many

369
0:14:10.46,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of these intuitions are wrong the

370
0:14:12.65,000 --> 0:14:16,000
question is are we going to test those

371
0:14:14.6,000 --> 0:14:17,000
intuitions we can think about how we're

372
0:14:16.73,000 --> 0:14:19,000
going to test this intuition in our

373
0:14:17.9,000 --> 0:14:21,000
private life in our business life and

374
0:14:19.85,000 --> 0:14:22,000
most particularly when it goes to policy

375
0:14:21.98,000 --> 0:14:24,000
when we think about things like No Child

376
0:14:23.72,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Left Behind when you create new stock

377
0:14:25.91,000 --> 0:14:3,000
markets when you create other policies

378
0:14:28.46,000 --> 0:14:33,000
taxation health care and so on and the

379
0:14:30.92,000 --> 0:14:34,000
difficulty of testing on intuition was

380
0:14:33.47,000 --> 0:14:37,000
was the big lesson I learned when I went

381
0:14:35.48,000 --> 0:14:38,000
back to the nurses to talk to them so I

382
0:14:37.7,000 --> 0:14:4,000
went back to talk to them and tell them

383
0:14:39.08,000 --> 0:14:44,000
what I found out about removing bandages

384
0:14:41.24,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and I learned two interesting things one

385
0:14:44.09,000 --> 0:14:48,000
was that my favorite nurse Ettie

386
0:14:45.92,000 --> 0:14:49,000
told me that I did not take her pain

387
0:14:48.53,000 --> 0:14:51,000
into consideration she said of course

388
0:14:50.78,000 --> 0:14:53,000
you know it was very painful for you but

389
0:14:52.04,000 --> 0:14:55,000
think about me as a nurse taking

390
0:14:54.02,000 --> 0:14:58,000
removing the bandages of somebody I

391
0:14:55.91,000 --> 0:14:59,000
liked and had to do it repeatedly over a

392
0:14:58.07,000 --> 0:15:01,000
long period of time creating so much

393
0:15:00.02,000 --> 0:15:04,000
torture was not something that was good

394
0:15:01.82,000 --> 0:15:05,000
for me too and she said maybe part of

395
0:15:04.1,000 --> 0:15:08,000
the reason what it was it was difficult

396
0:15:06.02,000 --> 0:15:12,000
for her it was actually more interesting

397
0:15:08.78,000 --> 0:15:14,000
than that because she said I did not

398
0:15:12.53,000 --> 0:15:16,000
think that your intuition was right I

399
0:15:14.81,000 --> 0:15:17,000
thought my intuition was correct so if

400
0:15:17.18,000 --> 0:15:19,000
you think about all of your intuition

401
0:15:18.56,000 --> 0:15:2,000
think about it's very hard to believe

402
0:15:20.03,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that your intuition is

403
0:15:21.25,000 --> 0:15:25,000
wrong and she said given the fact that I

404
0:15:23.74,000 --> 0:15:26,000
thought my intuition was right she

405
0:15:26.02,000 --> 0:15:3,000
thought her intuition was right it was

406
0:15:27.52,000 --> 0:15:32,000
very difficult for her to accept doing a

407
0:15:30.58,000 --> 0:15:34,000
difficult experiment to try and check

408
0:15:33.01,000 --> 0:15:37,000
whether she was wrong but the fact this

409
0:15:35.29,000 --> 0:15:39,000
is the situation we're all brawling all

410
0:15:37.6,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the time we have very strong intuitions

411
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:44,000
about all kinds of things our own

412
0:15:41.98,000 --> 0:15:45,000
ability how the economy work how we

413
0:15:44.62,000 --> 0:15:48,000
should pay schoolteachers but unless we

414
0:15:46.96,000 --> 0:15:5,000
start testing those intuitions we're not

415
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
going to do better and just think about

416
0:15:51.13,000 --> 0:15:54,000
how better my life would have been if

417
0:15:53.08,000 --> 0:15:56,000
these nurses would have been willing to

418
0:15:54.55,000 --> 0:15:57,000
check their intuition and how everything

419
0:15:56.53,000 --> 0:15:58,000
would have been better we would just

420
0:15:57.7,000 --> 0:16:01,000
start doing more systematic

421
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
experimentation of our intuitions thank

422
0:16:01.75,000 --> 0:16:03,000
you very much

423
0:16:14.899,000 --> 0:16:16,000
you

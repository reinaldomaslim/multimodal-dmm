1
0:00:25.301,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends

2
0:00:30.523,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in the coming century,

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.

4
0:00:35.159,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But I want to start with my work on romantic love,

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because that's my most recent work.

6
0:00:41.222,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love,

7
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:47,000
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

8
0:00:48.368,000 --> 0:00:5,000
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted;

9
0:00:51.241,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.

10
0:00:55.032,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And so I want to tell you about that first,

11
0:00:57.374,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and then go on into where I think love is going.

12
0:01:01.689,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

13
0:01:03.483,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.

14
0:01:07.538,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I think our ancestors --

15
0:01:09.48,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I think human beings have been wondering about this question

16
0:01:13.402,000 --> 0:01:14,000
since they sat around their campfires

17
0:01:15.202,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or lay and watched the stars a million years ago.

18
0:01:19.928,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was

19
0:01:23.183,000 --> 0:01:28,000
by looking at the last 45 years of the psychological research

20
0:01:28.69,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and as it turns out,

21
0:01:30.021,000 --> 0:01:33,000
there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.

22
0:01:34.568,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The first thing that happens is,

23
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."

24
0:01:40.553,000 --> 0:01:41,000
As a truck driver once said to me,

25
0:01:42.219,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."

26
0:01:46.801,000 --> 0:01:47,000
George Bernard Shaw said it differently.

27
0:01:48.785,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"Love consists of overestimating the differences

28
0:01:51.277,000 --> 0:01:53,000
between one woman and another."

29
0:01:53.309,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And indeed, that's what we do.

30
0:01:55.595,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:58.873,000 --> 0:02:,000
And then you just focus on this person.

32
0:02:01.493,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You can list what you don't like about them,

33
0:02:04.334,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.

34
0:02:07.922,000 --> 0:02:08,000
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."

35
0:02:11.53,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In trying to understand romantic love,

36
0:02:13.715,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I decided I would read poetry from all over the world,

37
0:02:16.716,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I just want to give you one very short poem

38
0:02:19.392,000 --> 0:02:2,000
from eighth-century China,

39
0:02:20.663,000 --> 0:02:22,000
because it's an almost perfect example

40
0:02:22.896,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.

41
0:02:26.824,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody

42
0:02:29.888,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and you walk into a parking lot --

43
0:02:31.55,000 --> 0:02:34,000
their car is different from every other car in the parking lot.

44
0:02:34.954,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Their wine glass at dinner

45
0:02:36.484,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.

46
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.

47
0:02:44.312,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And it goes like this.

48
0:02:45.535,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.

49
0:02:48.423,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.

50
0:02:51.637,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."

51
0:02:55.468,000 --> 0:02:57,000
He became hooked on a sleeping mat,

52
0:02:57.849,000 --> 0:02:59,000
probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain,

53
0:03:00.849,000 --> 0:03:01,000
just like with you and me.

54
0:03:02.294,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning,

55
0:03:05.483,000 --> 0:03:07,000
you focus your attention on them.

56
0:03:07.953,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You aggrandize them.

57
0:03:09.578,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But you have intense energy.

58
0:03:11.363,000 --> 0:03:14,000
As one Polynesian said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."

59
0:03:15.406,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You're up all night. You're walking till dawn.

60
0:03:18.627,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You feel intense elation when things are going well;

61
0:03:21.61,000 --> 0:03:24,000
mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.

62
0:03:25.183,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Real dependence on this person.

63
0:03:27.661,000 --> 0:03:29,000
As one businessman in New York said to me,

64
0:03:30.084,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"Anything she liked, I liked."

65
0:03:32.524,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.

66
0:03:35.793,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You become extremely sexually possessive.

67
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually,

68
0:03:40.755,000 --> 0:03:42,000
you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.

69
0:03:43.649,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But the moment you fall in love,

70
0:03:45.227,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you become extremely sexually possessive of them.

71
0:03:47.547,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I think there's a Darwinian purpose to this.

72
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The whole point of this is to pull two people together

73
0:03:53.657,000 --> 0:03:56,000
strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.

74
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving:

75
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
an intense craving to be with a particular person,

76
0:04:04.446,000 --> 0:04:06,000
not just sexually, but emotionally.

77
0:04:06.693,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It would be nice to go to bed with them,

78
0:04:10.445,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,

79
0:04:14.701,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to tell you that they love you.

80
0:04:17.46,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The other main characteristic is motivation.

81
0:04:22.206,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person.

82
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And last but not least, it is an obsession.

83
0:04:29.174,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Before I put these people in the MRI machine,

84
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I would ask them all kinds of questions.

85
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But my most important question was always the same.

86
0:04:38.189,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"

87
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And indeed, they would say,

88
0:04:44.914,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"All day. All night.

89
0:04:47.095,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I can never stop thinking about him or her."

90
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And then, the very last question --

91
0:04:51.834,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I would always have to work myself up to this question,

92
0:04:54.457,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because I'm not a psychologist.

93
0:04:56.048,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.

94
0:04:59.394,000 --> 0:05:,000
My final question was always the same.

95
0:05:01.323,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I would say, "Would you die for him or her?"

96
0:05:04.465,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"

97
0:05:06.56,000 --> 0:05:08,000
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.

98
0:05:08.695,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I was just staggered by it.

99
0:05:12.634,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So we scanned their brains,

100
0:05:15.244,000 --> 0:05:17,000
looking at a photograph of their sweetheart

101
0:05:17.378,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and looking at a neutral photograph,

102
0:05:19.17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
with a distraction task in between.

103
0:05:21.028,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state

104
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and when it was in a resting state.

105
0:05:28.869,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions.

106
0:05:31.164,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In fact, one of the most important was a brain region

107
0:05:33.846,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.

108
0:05:37.657,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.

109
0:05:40.65,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.

110
0:05:45.293,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions,

111
0:05:48.173,000 --> 0:05:49,000
from very high to very low.

112
0:05:49.903,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But actually, it's a drive.

113
0:05:51.633,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It comes from the motor of the mind,

114
0:05:53.792,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.

115
0:05:57.481,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The kind of part of the mind

116
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate,

117
0:06:01.664,000 --> 0:06:04,000
when you want to win that promotion at work.

118
0:06:05.906,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The motor of the brain.

119
0:06:07.469,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's a drive.

120
0:06:08.697,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.

121
0:06:12.166,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you,

122
0:06:14.673,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and they say, "No, thank you,"

123
0:06:16.134,000 --> 0:06:19,000
you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.

124
0:06:19.675,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But certainly, around the world,

125
0:06:22.892,000 --> 0:06:25,000
people who are rejected in love will kill for it.

126
0:06:27.349,000 --> 0:06:28,000
People live for love.

127
0:06:28.508,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They kill for love.

128
0:06:29.792,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They die for love.

129
0:06:31.277,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They have songs, poems, novels,

130
0:06:34.879,000 --> 0:06:37,000
sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.

131
0:06:38.847,000 --> 0:06:4,000
In over 175 societies,

132
0:06:41.02,000 --> 0:06:45,000
people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.

133
0:06:45.828,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I have come to think

134
0:06:46.875,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth

135
0:06:49.487,000 --> 0:06:51,000
for both great joy and great sorrow.

136
0:06:52.659,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And I've also come to think

137
0:06:54.121,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that it's one of three basically different brain systems

138
0:06:57.628,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that evolved from mating and reproduction.

139
0:07:00.072,000 --> 0:07:03,000
One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.

140
0:07:03.555,000 --> 0:07:06,000
W.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch,"

141
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and indeed, that's what it is.

142
0:07:10.142,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.

143
0:07:13.904,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The second of these three brain systems is romantic love:

144
0:07:16.874,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that elation, obsession of early love.

145
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And the third brain system is attachment:

146
0:07:21.38,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.

147
0:07:25.698,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there,

148
0:07:28.534,000 --> 0:07:3,000
looking for a whole range of partners.

149
0:07:31.113,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.

150
0:07:33.922,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It can be focused on nobody.

151
0:07:35.318,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy

152
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:4,000
on just one individual at a time,

153
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
thereby conserving mating time and energy.

154
0:07:43.856,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And I think that attachment, the third brain system,

155
0:07:46.61,000 --> 0:07:49,000
evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being

156
0:07:50.176,000 --> 0:07:54,000
at least long enough to raise a child together as a team.

157
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So with that preamble,

158
0:07:57.522,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.

159
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
One of the last 10,000 years

160
0:08:06.307,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and the other, certainly of the last 25 years,

161
0:08:11.028,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems:

162
0:08:15.304,000 --> 0:08:18,000
lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.

163
0:08:19.262,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The first is women working, moving into the workforce.

164
0:08:26.333,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I've looked at 130 societies

165
0:08:29.248,000 --> 0:08:31,000
through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.

166
0:08:31.913,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them,

167
0:08:36.669,000 --> 0:08:38,000
women are not only moving into the job market --

168
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:42,000
sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market --

169
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women

170
0:08:46.878,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in terms of economic power, health and education.

171
0:08:50.699,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's very slow.

172
0:08:51.859,000 --> 0:08:54,000
For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.

173
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We all know of them, but nevertheless --

174
0:08:57.337,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."

175
0:09:03.757,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.

176
0:09:06.108,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Women are moving back into the job market.

177
0:09:08.819,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And I say back into the job market, because this is not new.

178
0:09:12.323,000 --> 0:09:15,000
For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa,

179
0:09:16.013,000 --> 0:09:19,000
women commuted to work to gather their vegetables.

180
0:09:19.187,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.

181
0:09:22.871,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The double income family was the standard.

182
0:09:25.783,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And women were regarded as just as economically,

183
0:09:29.237,000 --> 0:09:32,000
socially and sexually powerful as men.

184
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In short, we're really moving forward to the past.

185
0:09:37.223,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Then, women's worst invention was the plow.

186
0:09:42.54,000 --> 0:09:45,000
With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.

187
0:09:46.238,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors,

188
0:09:50.698,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution

189
0:09:54.401,000 --> 0:09:55,000
they're moving back into the job market.

190
0:09:56.368,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago,

191
0:10:01.519,000 --> 0:10:04,000
10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.

192
0:10:04.767,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions

193
0:10:09.362,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in the history of the human animal.

194
0:10:13.666,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And it's going to have an impact.

195
0:10:15.286,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I generally give a whole lecture

196
0:10:16.843,000 --> 0:10:18,000
on the impact of women on the business community.

197
0:10:19.171,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.

198
0:10:22.252,000 --> 0:10:23,000
There's a lot of gender differences;

199
0:10:24.133,000 --> 0:10:26,000
anybody who thinks men and women are alike

200
0:10:26.333,000 --> 0:10:27,000
simply never had a boy and a girl child.

201
0:10:28.299,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike.

202
0:10:31.516,000 --> 0:10:32,000
There's much we have in common,

203
0:10:33.063,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.

204
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,

205
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."

206
0:10:43.128,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But we did not evolve to have the same brain.

207
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain.

208
0:10:49.473,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.

209
0:10:52.624,000 --> 0:10:54,000
One of them is women's verbal ability.

210
0:10:54.755,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Women can talk.

211
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation

212
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:02,000
goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle,

213
0:11:02.402,000 --> 0:11:03,000
when estrogen levels peak.

214
0:11:03.997,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.

215
0:11:08.099,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Women can talk.

216
0:11:09.655,000 --> 0:11:12,000
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.

217
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They held that baby in front of their face,

218
0:11:15.111,000 --> 0:11:18,000
cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.

219
0:11:18.944,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force.

220
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Even in places like India and Japan,

221
0:11:27.261,000 --> 0:11:3,000
where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market,

222
0:11:30.682,000 --> 0:11:31,000
they're moving into journalism.

223
0:11:32.539,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And I think that the television is like the global campfire.

224
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.

225
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producer who calls me,

226
0:11:45.108,000 --> 0:11:47,000
who negotiates what we're going to say,

227
0:11:47.275,000 --> 0:11:48,000
is a woman.

228
0:11:48.354,000 --> 0:11:5,000
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,

229
0:11:51.036,000 --> 0:11:54,000
"To have a great writer is to have another government."

230
0:11:54.682,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.

231
0:12:00.158,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It's one of many, many characteristics that women have

232
0:12:02.855,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that they will bring into the job market.

233
0:12:05.159,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.

234
0:12:09.31,000 --> 0:12:1,000
They're highly imaginative.

235
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.

236
0:12:15.603,000 --> 0:12:17,000
They tend to be web thinkers.

237
0:12:17.747,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected,

238
0:12:20.556,000 --> 0:12:23,000
they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think,

239
0:12:23.754,000 --> 0:12:27,000
put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.

240
0:12:28.481,000 --> 0:12:31,000
They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers,

241
0:12:32.211,000 --> 0:12:33,000
what I call web thinkers.

242
0:12:33.775,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Men tend to -- and these are averages --

243
0:12:35.804,000 --> 0:12:37,000
tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous,

244
0:12:38.487,000 --> 0:12:39,000
focus on what they do,

245
0:12:39.896,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.

246
0:12:46.171,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They're both perfectly good ways of thinking.

247
0:12:48.297,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We need both of them to get ahead.

248
0:12:50.553,000 --> 0:12:53,000
In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.

249
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And there's also many more male idiots in the world.

250
0:12:56.745,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

251
0:12:58.495,000 --> 0:13:01,000
When the male brain works well, it works extremely well.

252
0:13:01.701,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And what I really think that we're doing is,

253
0:13:05.059,000 --> 0:13:07,000
we're moving towards a collaborative society,

254
0:13:07.369,000 --> 0:13:09,000
a society in which the talents of both men and women

255
0:13:10.195,000 --> 0:13:13,000
are becoming understood and valued and employed.

256
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But in fact, women moving into the job market

257
0:13:16.787,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.

258
0:13:22.608,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Foremost, women are starting to express their sexuality.

259
0:13:27.716,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I'm always astonished when people come to me and say,

260
0:13:30.366,000 --> 0:13:32,000
"Why is it that men are so adulterous?"

261
0:13:32.708,000 --> 0:13:34,000
"Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"

262
0:13:35.445,000 --> 0:13:36,000
"Well, men are more adulterous!"

263
0:13:37.04,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"

264
0:13:40.002,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Laughter)

265
0:13:41.43,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And -- basic math!

266
0:13:43.182,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Anyway.

267
0:13:44.38,000 --> 0:13:47,000
In the Western world,

268
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
women start sooner at sex, have more partners,

269
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
express less remorse for the partners that they do,

270
0:13:53.909,000 --> 0:13:55,000
marry later, have fewer children,

271
0:13:56.615,000 --> 0:13:58,000
leave bad marriages in order to get good ones.

272
0:13:59.544,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.

273
0:14:03.547,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression

274
0:14:08.292,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago,

275
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see

276
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:17,000
in hunting and gathering societies today.

277
0:14:17.865,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.

278
0:14:22.42,000 --> 0:14:26,000
They're now saying that the 21st century

279
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage,"

280
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:36,000
or the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."

281
0:14:36.408,000 --> 0:14:39,000
This is a marriage between equals,

282
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
moving forward to a pattern

283
0:14:42.467,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.

284
0:14:46.775,000 --> 0:14:48,000
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.

285
0:14:49.786,000 --> 0:14:53,000
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men

286
0:14:54.036,000 --> 0:14:58,000
would not marry somebody who had every single quality

287
0:14:58.663,000 --> 0:14:59,000
they were looking for in a partner,

288
0:15:00.503,000 --> 0:15:02,000
if they were not in love with that person.

289
0:15:03.29,000 --> 0:15:06,000
People around the world, in a study of 37 societies,

290
0:15:06.833,000 --> 0:15:09,000
want to be in love with the person that they marry.

291
0:15:10.946,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.

292
0:15:20.618,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I even think that marriages might even become more stable

293
0:15:23.436,000 --> 0:15:26,000
because of the second great world trend.

294
0:15:27.214,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The first one being women moving into the job market,

295
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
the second one being the aging world population.

296
0:15:32.874,000 --> 0:15:34,000
They're now saying that in America,

297
0:15:35.325,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.

298
0:15:39.642,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85,

299
0:15:44.545,000 --> 0:15:47,000
as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.

300
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.

301
0:15:51.714,000 --> 0:15:56,000
For one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.

302
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.

303
0:16:01.596,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America,

304
0:16:05.221,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and it's actually beginning to decline.

305
0:16:07.579,000 --> 0:16:08,000
It may decline some more.

306
0:16:12.133,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I would even say that with Viagra,

307
0:16:16.156,000 --> 0:16:19,000
estrogen replacement, hip replacements

308
0:16:19.995,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and the incredibly interesting women

309
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
-- women have never been as interesting as they are now.

310
0:16:25.129,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated,

311
0:16:28.611,000 --> 0:16:29,000
so interesting, so capable.

312
0:16:30.962,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution

313
0:16:36.365,000 --> 0:16:39,000
when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.

314
0:16:41.516,000 --> 0:16:44,000
However, there's always kinds of complications in this.

315
0:16:44.741,000 --> 0:16:48,000
These three brain systems -- lust, romantic love and attachment --

316
0:16:49.482,000 --> 0:16:5,000
don't always go together.

317
0:16:50.86,000 --> 0:16:51,000
They can go together, by the way.

318
0:16:52.583,000 --> 0:16:53,000
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.

319
0:16:54.559,000 --> 0:16:56,000
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.

320
0:16:56.852,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Dopamine's associated with romantic love,

321
0:16:58.972,000 --> 0:17:,000
and you can just fall in love with somebody

322
0:17:01.019,000 --> 0:17:02,000
who you're just having casual sex with.

323
0:17:02.906,000 --> 0:17:05,000
With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin --

324
0:17:06.366,000 --> 0:17:08,000
those are associated with attachment.

325
0:17:08.421,000 --> 0:17:11,000
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody

326
0:17:12.404,000 --> 0:17:13,000
after you've made love to them.

327
0:17:14.277,000 --> 0:17:18,000
But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment,

328
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:21,000
aren't always connected to each other.

329
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:25,000
You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner

330
0:17:25.275,000 --> 0:17:29,000
while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else,

331
0:17:29.391,000 --> 0:17:34,000
while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.

332
0:17:35.312,000 --> 0:17:4,000
In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.

333
0:17:40.714,000 --> 0:17:41,000
In fact, you can lie in bed at night

334
0:17:42.73,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person

335
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:49,000
to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.

336
0:17:49.456,000 --> 0:17:51,000
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head

337
0:17:52.361,000 --> 0:17:55,000
as you are trying to decide what to do.

338
0:17:55.512,000 --> 0:17:56,000
So I don't think, honestly,

339
0:17:57.171,000 --> 0:17:59,000
we're an animal that was built to be happy;

340
0:17:59.21,000 --> 0:18:01,000
we are an animal that was built to reproduce.

341
0:18:01.502,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I think the happiness we find, we make.

342
0:18:04.461,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And I think, however,

343
0:18:07.967,000 --> 0:18:09,000
we can make good relationships with each other.

344
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:13,000
So I want to conclude with two things.

345
0:18:13.129,000 --> 0:18:15,000
I want to conclude with a worry,

346
0:18:15.2,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and with a wonderful story.

347
0:18:19.287,000 --> 0:18:21,000
The worry is about antidepressants.

348
0:18:23.631,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants

349
0:18:28.787,000 --> 0:18:3,000
are written every year in the United States.

350
0:18:32.1,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And these drugs are going generic.

351
0:18:34.689,000 --> 0:18:36,000
They are seeping around the world.

352
0:18:37.743,000 --> 0:18:42,000
I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants,

353
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:46,000
SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13.

354
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:49,000
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.

355
0:18:5,000 --> 0:18:53,000
I've got nothing against people who take them short term,

356
0:18:53.54,000 --> 0:18:55,000
when they're going through something horrible.

357
0:18:55.787,000 --> 0:18:57,000
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.

358
0:18:58.166,000 --> 0:18:59,000
I would recommend it.

359
0:18:59.258,000 --> 0:19:01,000
But more and more people in the United States

360
0:19:01.741,000 --> 0:19:03,000
are taking them long term.

361
0:19:04.149,000 --> 0:19:09,000
And indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.

362
0:19:09.974,000 --> 0:19:13,000
And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.

363
0:19:14.819,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Everybody knows that.

364
0:19:16.944,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.

365
0:19:21.627,000 --> 0:19:24,000
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit,

366
0:19:24.801,000 --> 0:19:25,000
but they kill the sex drive.

367
0:19:27.316,000 --> 0:19:3,000
And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.

368
0:19:31.164,000 --> 0:19:32,000
And when you kill orgasm,

369
0:19:32.379,000 --> 0:19:35,000
you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.

370
0:19:36.712,000 --> 0:19:38,000
The things are connected in the brain.

371
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And when you tamper with one brain system,

372
0:19:41.68,000 --> 0:19:42,000
you're going to tamper with another.

373
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:48,000
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.

374
0:19:49.738,000 --> 0:19:5,000
So now --

375
0:19:50.764,000 --> 0:19:54,000
(Applause)

376
0:19:55,000 --> 0:19:56,000
Thank you.

377
0:19:56.727,000 --> 0:19:57,000
I want to end with a story.

378
0:19:58.839,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And then, just a comment.

379
0:20:01.741,000 --> 0:20:05,000
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.

380
0:20:08.774,000 --> 0:20:11,000
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.

381
0:20:12.925,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese

382
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River

383
0:20:19.024,000 --> 0:20:2,000
are all alike.

384
0:20:20.777,000 --> 0:20:22,000
And about a year ago,

385
0:20:23.11,000 --> 0:20:25,000
an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me

386
0:20:26.119,000 --> 0:20:29,000
and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.

387
0:20:29.795,000 --> 0:20:31,000
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?

388
0:20:32.621,000 --> 0:20:34,000
I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"

389
0:20:35.365,000 --> 0:20:36,000
They said, "Yes."

390
0:20:36.429,000 --> 0:20:39,000
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love

391
0:20:39.476,000 --> 0:20:4,000
with one person rather than another.

392
0:20:41.232,000 --> 0:20:44,000
That's my current project; it will be my next book.

393
0:20:45.262,000 --> 0:20:46,000
There's all kinds of reasons

394
0:20:46.825,000 --> 0:20:48,000
that you fall in love with one person rather than another.

395
0:20:49.602,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Timing is important. Proximity is important.

396
0:20:52.912,000 --> 0:20:53,000
Mystery is important.

397
0:20:54.316,000 --> 0:20:56,000
You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious,

398
0:20:57.069,000 --> 0:20:59,000
in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain,

399
0:20:59.771,000 --> 0:21:01,000
probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.

400
0:21:02.561,000 --> 0:21:03,000
You fall in love with somebody

401
0:21:04.014,000 --> 0:21:06,000
who fits within what I call your "love map,"

402
0:21:06.133,000 --> 0:21:08,000
an unconscious list of traits

403
0:21:08.304,000 --> 0:21:1,000
that you build in childhood as you grow up.

404
0:21:10.642,000 --> 0:21:13,000
And I also think that you gravitate to certain people,

405
0:21:13.708,000 --> 0:21:16,000
actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.

406
0:21:17,000 --> 0:21:19,000
And that's what I'm now contributing to this.

407
0:21:19.311,000 --> 0:21:22,000
But I want to tell you a story, to illustrate.

408
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:25,000
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love.

409
0:21:26.709,000 --> 0:21:29,000
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too,

410
0:21:30.42,000 --> 0:21:31,000
the magic of it.

411
0:21:33,000 --> 0:21:36,000
It's a story that was told to me

412
0:21:36.373,000 --> 0:21:38,000
by somebody who had heard it just from one --

413
0:21:38.858,000 --> 0:21:39,000
probably a true story.

414
0:21:41.508,000 --> 0:21:44,000
It was a graduate student -- I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --

415
0:21:45,000 --> 0:21:46,000
Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.

416
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:49,000
That's where we put our people in the MRI machine.

417
0:21:5,000 --> 0:21:54,000
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student,

418
0:21:54.587,000 --> 0:21:56,000
and she was not in love with him.

419
0:21:58.206,000 --> 0:22:,000
And they were all at a conference in Beijing.

420
0:22:01.485,000 --> 0:22:04,000
And he knew from our work

421
0:22:04.543,000 --> 0:22:08,000
that if you go and do something very novel with somebody,

422
0:22:08.975,000 --> 0:22:1,000
you can drive up the dopamine in the brain,

423
0:22:11,000 --> 0:22:14,000
and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.

424
0:22:14.717,000 --> 0:22:16,000
(Laughter)

425
0:22:16.898,000 --> 0:22:19,000
So he decided he'd put science to work.

426
0:22:21.624,000 --> 0:22:24,000
And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.

427
0:22:25.809,000 --> 0:22:27,000
And sure enough -- I've never been in one,

428
0:22:27.902,000 --> 0:22:29,000
but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks

429
0:22:30.664,000 --> 0:22:32,000
and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting.

430
0:22:33.506,000 --> 0:22:35,000
He figured that this would drive up the dopamine,

431
0:22:35.816,000 --> 0:22:36,000
and she'd fall in love with him.

432
0:22:37.372,000 --> 0:22:41,000
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him

433
0:22:42.37,000 --> 0:22:44,000
and laughing and having a wonderful time.

434
0:22:44.911,000 --> 0:22:47,000
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw,

435
0:22:48.474,000 --> 0:22:51,000
and she throws her hands up and she says,

436
0:22:52.078,000 --> 0:22:54,000
"Wasn't that wonderful?"

437
0:22:54.414,000 --> 0:22:57,000
And, "Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"

438
0:22:57.852,000 --> 0:23:,000
(Laughter)

439
0:23:00.945,000 --> 0:23:06,000
(Applause)

440
0:23:07,000 --> 0:23:08,000
There's magic to love!

441
0:23:08.186,000 --> 0:23:09,000
(Applause)

442
0:23:09.821,000 --> 0:23:12,000
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago,

443
0:23:13.465,000 --> 0:23:15,000
we evolved three basic drives:

444
0:23:15.821,000 --> 0:23:17,000
the sex drive, romantic love

445
0:23:18.364,000 --> 0:23:2,000
and attachment to a long-term partner.

446
0:23:20.728,000 --> 0:23:23,000
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.

447
0:23:24.203,000 --> 0:23:28,000
They're going to survive as long as our species survives

448
0:23:28.63,000 --> 0:23:3,000
on what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."

449
0:23:31.362,000 --> 0:23:32,000
Thank you.

450
0:23:32.392,000 --> 0:23:33,000
Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher!

451
0:23:33.841,000 --> 0:23:34,000
(Applause)

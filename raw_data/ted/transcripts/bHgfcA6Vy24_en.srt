1
0:00:13.458,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When we're young, we're innocently brave,

2
0:00:16.292,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and we fearlessly dream about what our lives might be like.

3
0:00:19.833,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Maybe you wanted to be an astronaut or a rocket scientist.

4
0:00:23.375,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Maybe you dreamed of traveling to every continent.

5
0:00:27.167,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Since I was very young,

6
0:00:28.875,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I dreamed of working for the United Nations

7
0:00:31.083,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in some of the most difficult countries in the world.

8
0:00:34.083,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And thanks to a lot of courage

9
0:00:36.417,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that dream came true.

10
0:00:38.542,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But here's the thing about courage:

11
0:00:40.583,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it doesn't just appear whenever we need it.

12
0:00:43.208,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's the result of tough reflection and real work,

13
0:00:46.542,000 --> 0:00:5,000
involving the balance between fear and bravery.

14
0:00:51.042,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Without fear, we'll do foolish things.

15
0:00:53.875,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And without courage, we'll never step into the unknown.

16
0:00:57.917,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The balance of the two is where the magic lies,

17
0:01:00.792,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and it's a balance we all deal with every day.

18
0:01:04.958,000 --> 0:01:06,000
First, a word about my fancy wheels.

19
0:01:07.417,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I haven't always used a wheelchair.

20
0:01:09.5,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I grew up like many of you,

21
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
running, jumping and dancing.

22
0:01:13.208,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I love to dance.

23
0:01:16.083,000 --> 0:01:18,000
However, in my mid-twenties,

24
0:01:18.375,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I began to experience a series of inexplicable falls.

25
0:01:22.5,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And a few years later,

26
0:01:23.833,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I was diagnosed with a recessive genetic condition

27
0:01:27.208,000 --> 0:01:3,000
called hereditary inclusion body myopathy,

28
0:01:30.875,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or HIBM.

29
0:01:33.417,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's a progressive muscle wasting disease

30
0:01:36.25,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that affects all of my muscles from head to toe.

31
0:01:39.917,000 --> 0:01:41,000
HIBM is very rare.

32
0:01:42.083,000 --> 0:01:47,000
In the United States there are less than 200 people diagnosed.

33
0:01:47.5,000 --> 0:01:51,000
To date, there is no proved treatment or cure,

34
0:01:51.708,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and within 10 to 15 years of its onset,

35
0:01:54.792,000 --> 0:01:56,000
HIBM typically leads to quadriplegia,

36
0:01:57.708,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which is why I now use a wheelchair.

37
0:02:00.667,000 --> 0:02:03,000
When I was first diagnosed, everything changed.

38
0:02:04.292,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It was frightening news

39
0:02:06.292,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because I had no experience with chronic illness or disabilities.

40
0:02:10.667,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I had no idea how the disease might progress.

41
0:02:15.083,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But what was most disheartening

42
0:02:17.208,000 --> 0:02:2,000
was to listen to other people advise me

43
0:02:20.375,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to limit my ambitions and dreams,

44
0:02:22.542,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and to change my expectations of what to expect from life.

45
0:02:27.208,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"You should quit your international career."

46
0:02:30.042,000 --> 0:02:32,000
"No one will marry you this way."

47
0:02:32.708,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"You would be selfish to have children."

48
0:02:36.75,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The fact that someone who wasn't me

49
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
was putting limitations on my dreams and ambitions

50
0:02:41.875,000 --> 0:02:42,000
was preposterous.

51
0:02:43.667,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And unacceptable.

52
0:02:46.875,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So I ignored them.

53
0:02:48.167,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Cheers and applause)

54
0:02:54.708,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I did get married.

55
0:02:56.375,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And I decided for myself not to have children.

56
0:03:00.208,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And I continued my career with the United Nations

57
0:03:03.542,000 --> 0:03:04,000
after my diagnosis,

58
0:03:04.833,000 --> 0:03:06,000
going to work for two years in Angola,

59
0:03:07.292,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a country recovering from 27 years of brutal civil war.

60
0:03:12.125,000 --> 0:03:13,000
However, it would be another five years

61
0:03:14.083,000 --> 0:03:17,000
until I officially declared my diagnosis to my employer.

62
0:03:17.917,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Because I was afraid

63
0:03:19.25,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that they would question my capacity to manage and I'd lose my job.

64
0:03:23.625,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was working in countries where polio had been common,

65
0:03:26.875,000 --> 0:03:27,000
so when I overheard someone say

66
0:03:28.667,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that they thought I might have survived polio,

67
0:03:31.417,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I thought my secret was safe.

68
0:03:34.042,000 --> 0:03:36,000
No one asked why I was limping.

69
0:03:36.375,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So I didn't say anything.

70
0:03:38.583,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It took me over a decade

71
0:03:39.958,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to internalize the severity of HIBM,

72
0:03:43.167,000 --> 0:03:47,000
even as basic tasks and functions became increasingly difficult.

73
0:03:47.833,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Yet, I continued to pursue my dream of working all over the world,

74
0:03:51.917,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and was even appointed as a disability focal point

75
0:03:54.333,000 --> 0:03:55,000
for UNICEF in Haiti,

76
0:03:56.25,000 --> 0:03:59,000
where I served for two years after the devastating 2010 earthquake.

77
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And then my work brought me to the United States.

78
0:04:03.917,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And even as the disease progressed significantly

79
0:04:06.708,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I needed leg braces and a walker to get around,

80
0:04:09.75,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I still longed for adventure.

81
0:04:12.75,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And this time,

82
0:04:14.042,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I started dreaming of a grand outdoor adventure.

83
0:04:17.458,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And what's more grand than the Grand Canyon?

84
0:04:21.875,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Did you know that for every five million people who visit the Rim

85
0:04:26.292,000 --> 0:04:29,000
only one percent go down to the canyon's base?

86
0:04:30.417,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I wanted to be a part of that one percent.

87
0:04:33.417,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The only thing is --

88
0:04:34.958,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

89
0:04:39.333,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The only thing is that the Grand Canyon isn't exactly accessible.

90
0:04:43.75,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I was going to need some assistance

91
0:04:45.5,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to get down the 5,000-foot descent of vertical loose terrain.

92
0:04:50.458,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now, when I face obstacles,

93
0:04:52.042,000 --> 0:04:55,000
fear doesn't necessarily immediately set in

94
0:04:55.833,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because I assume that one way or another,

95
0:04:58.667,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I'll figure it out.

96
0:05:00.25,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And in this case, my thought was,

97
0:05:02.5,000 --> 0:05:04,000
well, if I can't walk down,

98
0:05:04.667,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I could learn to ride a horse.

99
0:05:06.875,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So that's what I did.

100
0:05:08.833,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And with that fateful decision

101
0:05:10.667,000 --> 0:05:11,000
began a four-year commitment,

102
0:05:12.667,000 --> 0:05:15,000
tossing back and forth between fear and courage

103
0:05:15.75,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to undertake a 12-day expedition.

104
0:05:18.5,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Four days on horseback to cross Grand Canyon rim to rim,

105
0:05:21.75,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and eight days rafting 150 miles of the Colorado River,

106
0:05:25.792,000 --> 0:05:26,000
all with a film crew in tow.

107
0:05:27.75,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Spoiler alert -- we made it.

108
0:05:30.083,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But not without showing me how my deepest fear

109
0:05:32.917,000 --> 0:05:36,000
can somehow manifest a mirror response of equal courage.

110
0:05:37.792,000 --> 0:05:4,000
On April 13, 2018,

111
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:42,000
sitting eight feet above the ground,

112
0:05:42.75,000 --> 0:05:44,000
riding a mustang horse named Sheriff,

113
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
my first impression of Grand Canyon

114
0:05:47.292,000 --> 0:05:49,000
was one of shock and terror.

115
0:05:50.208,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Who knew I had a fear of heights.

116
0:05:53.042,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:54.333,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But there was no giving up now.

118
0:05:56.875,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I mustered up every ounce of courage inside me

119
0:06:00.625,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to not let my fear get the best of me.

120
0:06:04.125,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Embarking on the South Rim,

121
0:06:05.958,000 --> 0:06:07,000
all I could do to keep myself composed

122
0:06:08.708,000 --> 0:06:11,000
was to breathe deeply, stare up into the clouds

123
0:06:12.375,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and focus on my team's voices.

124
0:06:15.917,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But then, in the first hour, disaster struck.

125
0:06:20.5,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Unable to hold myself upright in the saddle,

126
0:06:22.875,000 --> 0:06:23,000
going down an oversized step,

127
0:06:24.875,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I flung forward and smacked my face on the back of the horse's head.

128
0:06:29.417,000 --> 0:06:3,000
There was panic,

129
0:06:30.708,000 --> 0:06:31,000
my head hurt fiercely,

130
0:06:32.292,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but the path was too narrow for us to dismount.

131
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Only at the halfway point at 2,300 feet,

132
0:06:38.833,000 --> 0:06:4,000
at least another two hours down,

133
0:06:41.083,000 --> 0:06:43,000
could we stop and remove my helmet

134
0:06:43.208,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and see the egg-sized bump protruding from my forehead.

135
0:06:47.167,000 --> 0:06:49,000
For all of that planning and gear,

136
0:06:49.25,000 --> 0:06:51,000
how is it that we didn't even have an ice pack?

137
0:06:52.083,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:53.125,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Luckily for all of us, the swelling came outwards,

139
0:06:56.042,000 --> 0:07:,000
and would drain into my face as two fantastic black eyes

140
0:07:00.083,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which is an amazing way to look in a documentary film.

141
0:07:03.167,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:05.25,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause and cheers)

143
0:07:10.333,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This was not an easy, peaceful journey,

144
0:07:12.5,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and yet, that was exactly the point.

145
0:07:14.583,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Even though I was afraid to get back into the saddle,

146
0:07:17.208,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I got back in.

147
0:07:18.583,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The descent alone to the canyon floor

148
0:07:20.958,000 --> 0:07:21,000
took a total of 10 hours

149
0:07:22.875,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and that was just day one of four riding.

150
0:07:25.792,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Next came the mighty rapids.

151
0:07:27.875,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The Colorado River in the Grand Canyon

152
0:07:29.875,000 --> 0:07:31,000
has some of the highest white water in the country.

153
0:07:32.792,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And just to be prepared in case we should capsize,

154
0:07:35.667,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we'd practice having me swim through a smaller rapid.

155
0:07:38.5,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And it's safe to say it wasn't glamorous.

156
0:07:41.208,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:42.292,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I took my breath in the wrong part of the wave,

158
0:07:44.833,000 --> 0:07:45,000
choked on river water

159
0:07:46.292,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and was unable to steer myself.

160
0:07:48.833,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Yes, it was scary,

161
0:07:50.417,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but it was also fantastic.

162
0:07:52.833,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Waterfalls, slick canyons

163
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and a couple billion years of bedrock

164
0:07:56.958,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that seemed to change color throughout the day.

165
0:07:59.458,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The Grand Canyon is true wilderness

166
0:08:02.375,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and worthy of all of its accolades.

167
0:08:05.083,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Applause)

168
0:08:12.833,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The expedition,

169
0:08:14.25,000 --> 0:08:16,000
all that planning and the trip itself,

170
0:08:17.208,000 --> 0:08:22,000
showed me a level of fear I had never experienced before.

171
0:08:22.25,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But more importantly,

172
0:08:23.667,000 --> 0:08:27,000
it showed me how boldly courageous I can be.

173
0:08:28.083,000 --> 0:08:3,000
My Grand Canyon journey was not easy.

174
0:08:30.375,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This was not a vision of an Amazonian woman

175
0:08:33.042,000 --> 0:08:36,000
effortlessly making her way through epic scenery.

176
0:08:36.583,000 --> 0:08:37,000
This was me crying,

177
0:08:38.292,000 --> 0:08:41,000
exhausted and beat up with two black eyes.

178
0:08:42.208,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It was scary,

179
0:08:43.625,000 --> 0:08:44,000
it was stressful,

180
0:08:45.625,000 --> 0:08:47,000
it was exhilarating.

181
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now that the trip is over,

182
0:08:50.292,000 --> 0:08:53,000
it's easy to be blasé about what we achieved.

183
0:08:53.833,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I know I want to raft the river again.

184
0:08:56.375,000 --> 0:08:59,000
This time, all 277 miles of it.

185
0:08:59.792,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Applause)

186
0:09:03.25,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But I also know that I would never do the horseback-riding part again.

187
0:09:06.625,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:08.292,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's just too dangerous.

189
0:09:10.875,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And that's my real point.

190
0:09:12.542,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I'm not just here to show you my film footage.

191
0:09:15.458,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I'm here to remind us all

192
0:09:17.5,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that life is really just a lesson

193
0:09:19.75,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in finding the balance between fear and courage.

194
0:09:22.833,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And understanding what is and what isn't a good idea.

195
0:09:27.667,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

196
0:09:28.917,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Life is already scary,

197
0:09:30.667,000 --> 0:09:33,000
so for our dreams to come true, we need to be brave.

198
0:09:34.417,000 --> 0:09:35,000
In facing my fears

199
0:09:35.792,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and finding the courage to push through them,

200
0:09:38.417,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I swear my life has been extraordinary.

201
0:09:42.125,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So live big

202
0:09:43.583,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and try to let your courage outweigh your fear.

203
0:09:46.542,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You never know where it might take you.

204
0:09:49.5,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Thank you.

205
0:09:50.792,000 --> 0:09:53,000
(Applause and cheers)

1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Once upon a time,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
at the age of 24,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was a guest student during one month

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of a public health course.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And that changed my mindset forever.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The course was good, but it was not the course content

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in itself that changed the mindset.

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It was the brutal realization,

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the first morning,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that the Indian students were better than me.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You see, I was a study nerd.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I loved statistics from a young age.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I studied very much in Sweden.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And the fact was that Indian students

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
studied harder than we did in Sweden.

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They read the textbook twice,

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
or three times or four times.

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laugher)

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And that, to me,

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that personal experience

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
was the first time in my life

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that the mindset I grew up with

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
was changed.

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I realized that perhaps

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the Western world will not continue

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to dominate the world forever.

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's that realization of someone you meet

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that really made you change your ideas about the world.

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I will now,

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
here, onstage,

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
try to predict when that will happen --

39
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that Asia will regain

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
its dominant position

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as the leading part of the world,

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
as it used to be, over thousands of years.

43
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And I will do that

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
by trying to predict precisely

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
at what year

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the average income per person

47
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in India, in China, will reach that of the West.

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I don't mean the whole economy,

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because to grow an economy

50
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
of India to the size of U.K. --

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that's a piece of cake, with one billion people.

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But I want to see when will the average pay, the money

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for each person, per month,

54
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in India and China,

55
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?

56
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But I will start with a historical background.

57
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?

58
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I will start at 1858.

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
1858 was a year of great technological

60
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
advancement in the West.

61
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
That was the year when Queen Victoria

62
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
was able, for the first time, to communicate

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
with President Buchanan,

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And they were the first to "Twitter" transatlantically.

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,

69
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to find the text of the telegram

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.

71
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And it ends like this: "This telegraph

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
civilization, liberty and law throughout the world."

74
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious

75
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.

76
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And we will think about that

77
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.

78
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Because 1858

79
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
was also watershed year

80
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in the history of Asia.

81
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
1858 was the year

82
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
when the courageous uprising

83
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
against the foreign occupation of India

84
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
was defeated by the British forces.

85
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.

86
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
1858 in China

87
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces.

88
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty,

89
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
were allowed to trade freely in China.

90
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods.

91
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And 1858 in Japan

92
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty

93
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.

94
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And they were threatened by those black ships there,

95
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year.

96
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But, Japan, in contrast to India and China,

97
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
maintained its national sovereignty.

98
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And let's see how much difference that can make.

99
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And I will do that by bringing these bubbles

100
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
back to a Gapminder graph here,

101
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where you can see each bubble is a country.

102
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The size of the bubble here is the population.

103
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
On this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.

104
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people.

105
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I also bring an innovation here.

106
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I have transformed the laser beam

107
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
into an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.

108
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Applause)

109
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And we will see, you know.

110
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Look here, 1858, India was here,

111
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
China was here, Japan was there,

112
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
United States and United Kingdom

113
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
was richer over there.

114
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I will start the world like this.

115
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
India was not always like this level.

116
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Actually if we go back into the historical record,

117
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
there was a time hundreds of years ago

118
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
when the income per person in India and China

119
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was even above that of Europe.

120
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,

121
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and India had been de-industrialized.

122
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And you can see that the countries who were growing

123
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
their economy was United States and United Kingdom.

124
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,

125
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and Japan was starting to catch up.

126
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
India was trying down here.

127
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Can you see how it starts to move there?

128
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.

129
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And Japan is trying to move up there.

130
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And it's the new century now. Health is getting better,

131
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
United Kingdom, United States.

132
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War.

133
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And the First World War, you know,

134
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.

135
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
United Kingdom is going down.

136
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And now comes the Spanish flu also.

137
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And then after the First World War, they continue up.

138
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Still under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,

139
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
India and China are down in the corner.

140
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Not much has happened.

141
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They have grown their population but not much more.

142
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In the 1930's now, you can see

143
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that Japan is going to a period of war,

144
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
with lower life expectancy.

145
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And the Second World War was really a terrible event,

146
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
also economically for Japan.

147
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But they did recover quite fast afterwards.

148
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And we are moving into the new world.

149
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
In 1947 India finally

150
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
gained its independence.

151
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,

152
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but in very big difficulties down there.

153
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Applause)

154
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China

155
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in a way which surprised the world.

156
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And what happened?

157
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
What happens in the after independence?

158
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You can see that the health started to improve.

159
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Children started to go to school.

160
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Health services were provided.

161
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.

162
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.

163
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
China recovered. Then they said,

164
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Nevermore, stupid central planning."

165
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But they went up here, and India was trying to follow.

166
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And they were catching up indeed.

167
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And both countries had the better health, but still

168
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
a very low economy.

169
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died,

170
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and a new guy turned up from the left.

171
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.

172
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And he said, "Doesn't matter

173
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
if a cat is white or black,

174
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
as long as it catches mice."

175
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Because catching mice

176
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is what the two cats wanted to do.

177
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And you can see the two cats being here,

178
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.

179
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And they decided to go not only for health and education,

180
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but also starting to grow their economy.

181
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And the market reformer was successful there.

182
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
In '92 India follows with a market reform.

183
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And they go quite closely together,

184
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and you can see that the similarity with India and China,

185
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in many ways, are greater than the differences with them.

186
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And here they march on. And will they catch up?

187
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is the big question today.

188
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
There they are today.

189
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Now what does it mean that the --

190
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Applause)

191
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the averages there -- this is the average of China.

192
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
If I would split China, look here,

193
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Shanghai has already catched up.

194
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Shanghai is already there.

195
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And it's healthier than the United States.

196
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest

197
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
inland provinces of China, is there.

198
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,

199
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the rural part of Guizhou goes down there.

200
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You see this enormous inequity in China,

201
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in the midst of fast economic growth.

202
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And if I would also look at India,

203
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you have another type of inequity, actually, in India.

204
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.

205
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,

206
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.

207
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Kerala is flying on top there,

208
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
matching United States in health,

209
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but not in economy.

210
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,

211
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
is forging forward.

212
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Now in India, the big inequities are within the state,

213
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
rather than between the states.

214
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And that is not a bad thing, in itself.

215
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities

216
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
can be more difficult in the long term to deal with,

217
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center

218
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
relatively close to where poor people are living.

219
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
No, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.

220
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

221
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Oh, they broke my frame.

222
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Washington, D.C. went out here.

223
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this

224
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because there is a new leader in Washington

225
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
who is really concerned about the health system.

226
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.

227
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is so rich over there

228
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but they are not as healthy as Kerala.

229
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It's quite interesting, isn't it?

230
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Applause)

231
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I can see a business opportunity for Kerala,

232
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
helping fix the health system in the United States.

233
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Laughter)

234
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Applause)

235
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there.

236
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,

237
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
you see that in between them

238
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and ahead of them,

239
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is the whole emerging economies of the world,

240
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world."

241
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You can see that in health and education,

242
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a large part of the world population is putting forward,

243
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but in Africa, and other parts,

244
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
as in rural Guizhou in China,

245
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
there is still people with low health and very low economy.

246
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We have an enormous disparity in the world.

247
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.

248
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now, back to my projections.

249
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.

250
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I will show income per person on this axis instead,

251
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
poor down here, rich up there.

252
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And then time here, from 1858

253
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I start the world.

254
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And we shall see what will happen with these countries.

255
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
You see, China under foreign domination

256
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.

257
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.

258
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.

259
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But independence is coming here.

260
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Growth is starting, economic reform.

261
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Growth is faster, and with projection from IMF

262
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you can see where you expect them to be in 2014.

263
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now, the question is, "When will the catch up take place?"

264
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Look at, look at the United States.

265
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Can you see the bubble?

266
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The bubbles, not my bubbles,

267
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but the financial bubbles.

268
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there.

269
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
You see it came down there.

270
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know.

271
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries.

272
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know.

273
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And people interested in growth

274
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
are turning their eyes towards Asia.

275
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up.

276
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
You see, Japan did it like that.

277
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We add Japan to it.

278
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And there is no doubt that fast catch up

279
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
can take place.

280
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Can you see here what Japan did?

281
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Japan did it like this, until full catch up,

282
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and then they follow with the other high-income economies.

283
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But the real projections for those ones,

284
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I would like to give it like this.

285
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Can be worse, can be better.

286
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.

287
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Now, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.

288
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Laughter)

289
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I think I'm in a difficult position here.

290
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Inequalities in China and India

291
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I consider really the big obstacle

292
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity

293
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is what will create a domestic market,

294
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
what will avoid social instability,

295
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and which will make use of the entire capacity

296
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of the population.

297
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,

298
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.

299
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You know the climate. We have great international experts

300
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
within India telling us that the climate is changing,

301
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and actions has to be taken,

302
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
otherwise China and India would be the countries

303
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
most to suffer from climate change.

304
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world

305
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
in a good global climate policy.

306
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
But they ain't going to pay

307
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
for what others, who have more money,

308
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
have largely created, and I can agree on that.

309
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But what I'm really worried about is war.

310
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Will the former rich countries really accept

311
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
a completely changed world economy,

312
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and a shift of power away from where it has been

313
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
the last 50 to 100 to 150 years,

314
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
back to Asia?

315
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And will Asia be able to handle that

316
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
new position of being in charge

317
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?

318
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So, always avoid war,

319
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
because that always pushes human beings backward.

320
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,

321
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
get ready for a world in equity,

322
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
because this is what seems to be happening.

323
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And that vision that I got as a young student,

324
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,

325
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
is just about to happen.

326
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And it will happen precisely

327
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
the year 2048

328
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in the later part of the summer, in July,

329
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
more precisely, the 27th of July.

330
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Applause)

331
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
The 27th of July, 2048

332
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
is my 100th birthday.

333
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

334
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And I expect to speak

335
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
in the first session of the 39th TED India.

336
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much.

337
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.762,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, of all my childhood memories,

2
0:00:16.325,000 --> 0:00:18,000
there is one that stands above the rest.

3
0:00:19.698,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And that is the time that my brave parents

4
0:00:22.982,000 --> 0:00:24,000
rented an RV, packed it with me and my brothers,

5
0:00:25.823,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and drove west from our house in Minneapolis,

6
0:00:28.196,000 --> 0:00:3,000
out to Yellowstone National Park.

7
0:00:31.188,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We saw all the sights, like the geysers, we stopped at the Badlands,

8
0:00:34.761,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but more than any of the places, I remember this as an adventure.

9
0:00:39.371,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This was my introduction to the Wild West.

10
0:00:43.974,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But it wasn't until I got older

11
0:00:46.641,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I learned more about the National Park System

12
0:00:50.537,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that I realized just how lucky I was.

13
0:00:53.268,000 --> 0:00:54,000
One, to have that experience,

14
0:00:55.078,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but also that, hundreds of years ago,

15
0:00:57.778,000 --> 0:01:02,000
people had the foresight to set aside the very best places,

16
0:01:03.68,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the very best ecosystems in the country, for everyone.

17
0:01:09.125,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And for future generations.

18
0:01:11.046,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And to really appreciate just how prescient that idea was,

19
0:01:17.284,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you have to go back

20
0:01:18.482,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and you have to look at the history of the National Parks Service.

21
0:01:21.672,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So, a lot of people know, the first national park was Yellowstone, in 1872.

22
0:01:26.641,000 --> 0:01:29,000
A lot of people think of John Muir, the poet, naturalist,

23
0:01:29.807,000 --> 0:01:3,000
who was such a visionary

24
0:01:31.366,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in getting people inspired by the idea of conservation --

25
0:01:34.807,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that we need to take the best places and protect them.

26
0:01:38.546,000 --> 0:01:4,000
He had an audience in very high places --

27
0:01:41.315,000 --> 0:01:44,000
there's a great story of Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir

28
0:01:44.483,000 --> 0:01:47,000
going hiking, in Yosemite, during his presidency,

29
0:01:47.761,000 --> 0:01:5,000
four days, completely off the grid, just the two of them.

30
0:01:51.038,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Can you imagine a president

31
0:01:53.135,000 --> 0:01:55,000
actually just going completely off the grid for four days?

32
0:01:56.284,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:57.633,000 --> 0:01:58,000
No tweeting.

34
0:01:58.815,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

35
0:02:02.633,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Like that idea.

36
0:02:03.905,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Applause)

37
0:02:06.625,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But he had a great impact on Theodore Roosevelt.

38
0:02:12.569,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And he created dozens of national parks,

39
0:02:15.237,000 --> 0:02:18,000
hundreds of thousands of square acres of national wildlife refuges.

40
0:02:19.188,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It was an important administration, but it wasn't a done deal.

41
0:02:23.863,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Even less than 10 years after he created all of those new places,

42
0:02:29.585,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the future of those places was very much in doubt.

43
0:02:32.847,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And it wasn't until this guy, Stephen Mather,

44
0:02:36.018,000 --> 0:02:37,000
a businessman from Chicago,

45
0:02:37.657,000 --> 0:02:4,000
wrote an angry letter to the Department of the Interior, saying,

46
0:02:40.903,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"You guys aren't doing a good enough job protecting and preserving these places."

47
0:02:45.736,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Then, something was done about it.

48
0:02:47.387,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The Department of the Interior wrote him back.

49
0:02:49.577,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"Mr. Mather, if you care so much about this,

50
0:02:52.038,000 --> 0:02:54,000
why don't you come to Washington and do it yourself?"

51
0:02:55.006,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:56.141,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And he did.

53
0:02:57.942,000 --> 0:02:59,000
He took a job at the Department of the Interior,

54
0:03:00.228,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but more importantly, he started a campaign.

55
0:03:04.304,000 --> 0:03:08,000
He actually had a meeting two blocks from here, in 1914,

56
0:03:09.106,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in California Hall,

57
0:03:10.463,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and he brought together the park superintendents and a few other people

58
0:03:13.869,000 --> 0:03:15,000
who cared about this idea of conservation.

59
0:03:17.601,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And they put together a plan, they hatched a campaign

60
0:03:21.561,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that eventually led to the National Park Service in 1916.

61
0:03:26.744,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And that's really important.

62
0:03:28.102,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Because it went from an idea that we should protect these places

63
0:03:32.127,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to an actual plan,

64
0:03:33.643,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a way for people to enlist and carry that idea forward

65
0:03:37.707,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for future generations,

66
0:03:39.005,000 --> 0:03:43,000
so little kids like me can go and have these amazing experiences.

67
0:03:43.514,000 --> 0:03:46,000
That is the history of the National Parks on land.

68
0:03:47.49,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The ocean, what I want to talk to you about today,

69
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is a completely different story.

70
0:03:52.061,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we are almost precisely 100 years behind.

71
0:03:56.323,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So, the first marine sanctuary was in 1972,

72
0:03:59.1,000 --> 0:04:02,000
after the oil spill in Santa Barbara,

73
0:04:02.171,000 --> 0:04:04,000
people got interested in taking that concept

74
0:04:04.902,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and applying it to underwater environments.

75
0:04:08.18,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We've had our own John Muir, who's Dr. Sylvia Earle,

76
0:04:11.29,000 --> 0:04:12,000
who's been a tireless advocate

77
0:04:13.213,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for creating these marine protected areas around the world.

78
0:04:16.553,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So, I know there's a lot of bad news about the ocean,

79
0:04:19.776,000 --> 0:04:22,000
there's plastic pollution, coral bleaching, over-fishing --

80
0:04:22.916,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it's hard to take it all in sometimes.

81
0:04:25.845,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But this idea of setting aside places for nature is working.

82
0:04:31.3,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Science tells us that if you set these places aside,

83
0:04:34.474,000 --> 0:04:37,000
nature will come back and we can keep the oceans healthy.

84
0:04:37.641,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So we know this idea works.

85
0:04:40.141,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And Dr. Sylvia Earl has been influential, like John Muir,

86
0:04:44.117,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with administrations --

87
0:04:45.315,000 --> 0:04:48,000
George W. Bush and Obama were both fantastic ocean presidents,

88
0:04:49.196,000 --> 0:04:52,000
creating marine protected areas all around the country.

89
0:04:53.173,000 --> 0:04:56,000
This is not a conservative idea or a liberal idea,

90
0:04:56.466,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it's not even an American idea,

91
0:04:58.268,000 --> 0:04:59,000
it's just a good idea.

92
0:05:00.673,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:01.95,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Applause)

94
0:05:03.585,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But --

95
0:05:04.79,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

96
0:05:06.077,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Here we are, a few years later.

97
0:05:08.751,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And now the administration is proposing to roll back a lot of the progress

98
0:05:13.854,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we've made in the past 20 years.

99
0:05:16.449,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, so, don't mourn -- organize.

100
0:05:20.809,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We need to do what Stephen Mather did 100 years ago.

101
0:05:23.746,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We need to start a campaign to get people engaged with this idea.

102
0:05:28.365,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And I think we need a league of citizen scientists for the ocean.

103
0:05:33.486,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And I've seen glimpses of this future, and I know that it's possible.

104
0:05:37.375,000 --> 0:05:4,000
My friend Erik and I started building underwater robots,

105
0:05:40.904,000 --> 0:05:43,000
these little swimming cameras with lights that you can see underwater.

106
0:05:44.862,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We started building these in his garage five years ago,

107
0:05:47.568,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and we've watched that grow

108
0:05:48.932,000 --> 0:05:51,000
into this community of thousands of people around the world,

109
0:05:52.307,000 --> 0:05:54,000
who believe that everybody should have access to these places.

110
0:05:55.244,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We all deserve the tools to go and explore.

111
0:05:58.076,000 --> 0:05:59,000
There's stories like Laura James,

112
0:05:59.692,000 --> 0:06:02,000
who used her robot to find out that sea stars in her area were dying.

113
0:06:03.212,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And she started this whole citizen science campaign,

114
0:06:06.323,000 --> 0:06:09,000
collected data and drove awareness for sea-star wasting syndrome,

115
0:06:09.49,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to try and figure out what was happening there.

116
0:06:12.538,000 --> 0:06:14,000
There are stories of fishermen in Mexico,

117
0:06:14.697,000 --> 0:06:16,000
who used the robot to create marine protected areas

118
0:06:17.442,000 --> 0:06:21,000
where Nassau grouper were spawning, to protect the future of this species.

119
0:06:22.307,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's really amazing stuff.

120
0:06:23.855,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We found that if you give people the tools,

121
0:06:26.823,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they'll do the right thing.

122
0:06:31.291,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But we need to take it a step further.

123
0:06:33.22,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And, actually, I think we can dust off Stephen Mather's playbook.

124
0:06:37.149,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So what did he do?

125
0:06:38.374,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So, the first thing that he did was he focused on infrastructure.

126
0:06:41.942,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So 1914 wasn't just a time for the parks,

127
0:06:44.728,000 --> 0:06:46,000
it was also a time for the automobile,

128
0:06:46.967,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the Model T was rolling off the line,

129
0:06:49.007,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and Stephen Mather understood

130
0:06:51.212,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that this was going to be an important part of American culture.

131
0:06:54.244,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And so he partnered with highway associations around the country

132
0:06:57.387,000 --> 0:07:,000
to build big, beautiful highways out to these parks.

133
0:07:00.895,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And it worked, he's basically invented car camping.

134
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And he knew that if people didn't go to these places,

135
0:07:08.276,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that they wouldn’t fall in love with them and they wouldn't care.

136
0:07:11.356,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So that was a really insightful idea that he had.

137
0:07:14.474,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The second thing they did,

138
0:07:15.958,000 --> 0:07:17,000
was they focused on visionary philanthropy.

139
0:07:18.03,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So, Stephen Mather was a successful businessman from Chicago,

140
0:07:21.641,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and anytime there was a parks association that needed funding,

141
0:07:24.873,000 --> 0:07:26,000
anytime there was a highway association that needed funding,

142
0:07:27.754,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they'd step in, write the checks, make it happen.

143
0:07:30.095,000 --> 0:07:32,000
There's a great story of his friend William Kent,

144
0:07:32.477,000 --> 0:07:36,000
who recognized there was a small patch of redwoods left on the base of Mount Tam,

145
0:07:37.433,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and so he quickly bought the land

146
0:07:39.117,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and donated it to this National Parks effort.

147
0:07:41.37,000 --> 0:07:42,000
That's Muir Woods today --

148
0:07:42.719,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it's one of the most popular national parks in the whole country.

149
0:07:45.846,000 --> 0:07:47,000
My parents are visiting here from Minnesota,

150
0:07:48.152,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and they don't really even care about this talk,

151
0:07:50.445,000 --> 0:07:52,000
all they're talking about is going to Muir Woods.

152
0:07:52.83,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:55.659,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But the last thing is critical --

154
0:07:57.323,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Stephen Mather focused on engagement.

155
0:07:59.752,000 --> 0:08:03,000
In one of the first meetings that they had around this new system, he said,

156
0:08:04.244,000 --> 0:08:06,000
"If you're a writer, I want you to write about this.

157
0:08:06.736,000 --> 0:08:09,000
If you're a business owner, I want you to tell your clubs and your organizations.

158
0:08:10.625,000 --> 0:08:12,000
If you work for the government, I want you to pass regulation."

159
0:08:13.635,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Everybody had a job.

160
0:08:14.919,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"Each of you, all of you, have a role to play

161
0:08:17.066,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in protecting these places for future generations."

162
0:08:20.161,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Each of you, all of you.

163
0:08:23.154,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I love that.

164
0:08:26.339,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That's the plan -- simple, three-point plan.

165
0:08:29.585,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I think we can do the same.

166
0:08:31.411,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So, this was the headline when Obama created

167
0:08:33.518,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the Papahanaumokuakea National Monument:

168
0:08:37.3,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"Lots to see, but good luck trying to get there."

169
0:08:40.593,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But like Mather, we should focus on the technology of our time,

170
0:08:45.331,000 --> 0:08:47,000
all of this new, amazing, digital infrastructure

171
0:08:48.192,000 --> 0:08:51,000
can be built to engage people with the oceans.

172
0:08:51.751,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So, the National Marine Sanctuary

173
0:08:56.157,000 --> 0:08:59,000
has created all these wonderful VR 360 videos,

174
0:08:59.887,000 --> 0:09:02,000
where you can actually go and see what these places look like.

175
0:09:03.395,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Our team is continuing to build new tools,

176
0:09:05.874,000 --> 0:09:07,000
this is our latest, this is the trident underwater drone,

177
0:09:08.753,000 --> 0:09:11,000
it's a diving submarine, it's sleek, you can fit it in a backpack,

178
0:09:12.372,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it can go down to 100 meters, deeper than most divers can go.

179
0:09:15.796,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It can see these environments that most people have never had access to.

180
0:09:21.006,000 --> 0:09:24,000
New tools are coming and we need even better tools.

181
0:09:25.839,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We can also use more visionary philanthropists.

182
0:09:29.45,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So, when Erik and I started this, we didn't have any money,

183
0:09:32.371,000 --> 0:09:34,000
we were building this in his garage.

184
0:09:35.163,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But we went to Kickstarter.

185
0:09:36.618,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And we found over 1,800 people,

186
0:09:38.225,000 --> 0:09:4,000
almost a million dollars we've raised on Kickstarter,

187
0:09:40.745,000 --> 0:09:41,000
finding other people who think,

188
0:09:42.37,000 --> 0:09:43,000
"Yeah, that's a good idea.

189
0:09:43.873,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I want to be a part of that."

190
0:09:45.712,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We need more ways for people to get engaged

191
0:09:48.76,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and become visionary philanthropists themselves.

192
0:09:51.503,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We've also had traditional philanthropists,

193
0:09:53.54,000 --> 0:09:54,000
who've stepped up to fund us

194
0:09:54.909,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in the SEE initiative -- the Science Education and Exploration,

195
0:09:58.155,000 --> 0:10:02,000
who are going to help us get donated units out to people on the frontlines,

196
0:10:02.993,000 --> 0:10:05,000
people who are doing the science, people who are telling the stories,

197
0:10:06.279,000 --> 0:10:07,000
inspiring communities.

198
0:10:07.739,000 --> 0:10:1,000
You can go on to OpenExplorer.com and see what people are doing,

199
0:10:11.056,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it's hugely inspirational.

200
0:10:14.119,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And it will also, hopefully, spur you to get involved.

201
0:10:16.842,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Because there is plenty of room to get involved.

202
0:10:20.541,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We want to hear what ideas you have for telling these stories.

203
0:10:25.529,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Because that's just it -- this is all about engagement.

204
0:10:28.14,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There's all sorts of interesting, new ways for people to participate

205
0:10:32.021,000 --> 0:10:33,000
in the protection of these places.

206
0:10:33.894,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And the understanding.

207
0:10:35.212,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Like, Reef Check -- scuba divers are going down and swimming transects

208
0:10:38.621,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and counting fish and biodiversity data.

209
0:10:42.133,000 --> 0:10:45,000
They're getting the information we need to protect these places.

210
0:10:45.911,000 --> 0:10:48,000
If you're going down to the beach, participate in MPA Watch.

211
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Document what activities you see going on in these different areas.

212
0:10:53.038,000 --> 0:10:56,000
There is room for everybody to participate here.

213
0:10:57.49,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And that's just it, that's what we need.

214
0:10:59.434,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We need to build a future for our grandkids' grandkids.

215
0:11:03.307,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Last month, I went out sailing,

216
0:11:05.576,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and we got out to the Farallon Islands, 25 miles off the Gate.

217
0:11:09.173,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And most people think of this as kind of a bird sanctuary,

218
0:11:11.95,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but we took our robot, and we sent it in.

219
0:11:15.125,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And the people on the boat were astonished at the life beneath the surface.

220
0:11:20.101,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I mean, these are really, really important ecosystems.

221
0:11:24.625,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Really, and this is a whole wild world we haven't yet explored.

222
0:11:28.879,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And we have an opportunity right now,

223
0:11:31.895,000 --> 0:11:33,000
just as they did 100 years ago,

224
0:11:34.061,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to protect these places, to put in a plan, to keep people engaged.

225
0:11:39.625,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So last year, when the executive order came out,

226
0:11:41.974,000 --> 0:11:42,000
putting all of the progress we've made,

227
0:11:43.856,000 --> 0:11:46,000
all of these new marine protected areas, under review,

228
0:11:47.162,000 --> 0:11:5,000
there were over 100,000 people who commented online.

229
0:11:51.845,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Almost all of these letters were saying,

230
0:11:54.472,000 --> 0:11:58,000
"Don't do it; protecting these places is the right thing to do."

231
0:11:59.839,000 --> 0:12:02,000
My message to those 100,000 people, those 100,000 letters is:

232
0:12:03.752,000 --> 0:12:04,000
don't wait for Washington.

233
0:12:05.466,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We can do this ourselves.

234
0:12:07.117,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Thank you.

235
0:12:08.315,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Applause)

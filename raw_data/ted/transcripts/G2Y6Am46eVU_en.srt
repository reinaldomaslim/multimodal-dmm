1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My story actually began when I was four years old

2
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and my family moved to a new neighborhood

3
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.

4
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And this was the 1960s

5
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
when actually all the streets in this neighborhood

6
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
were named after Confederate war generals.

7
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.

8
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And when I was five,

9
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.

10
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars

11
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that made the rider look like an orangutan.

12
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That's why they were called ape hangers.

13
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,

14
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
which I'm sure my mom didn't know.

15
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac

16
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
hidden away a few streets away.

17
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I came back,

18
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly,

19
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so I decided to turn around in this big street

20
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that intersected our neighborhood,

21
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.

22
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
My mangled body flew in one direction,

23
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
my mangled bike flew in the other.

24
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,

25
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and one of my neighbors came running over.

26
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?" she said, using the name of my older brother.

27
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out.

29
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I broke my left femur that day --

30
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it's the largest bone in your body --

31
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and spent the next two months in a body cast

32
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that went from my chin to the tip of my toe

33
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to my right knee,

34
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and a steel bar went from my right knee

35
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to my left ankle.

36
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And for the next 38 years,

37
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that accident was the only medically interesting thing

38
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that ever happened to me.

39
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In fact, I made a living by walking.

40
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I traveled around the world, entered different cultures,

41
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
wrote a series of books about my travels,

42
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
including "Walking the Bible."

43
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I hosted a television show by that name

44
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
on PBS.

45
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I was, for all the world, the "walking guy."

46
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Until, in May 2008,

47
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a routine visit to my doctor

48
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and a routine blood test

49
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number

50
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that something might be wrong with my bones.

51
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,

52
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
which showed that there was some growth in my left leg.

53
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.

54
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor.

55
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"The tumor in your leg

56
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is not consistent with a benign tumor."

57
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I stopped walking,

58
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative

59
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
into a much more horrifying negative.

60
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I have cancer.

61
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And to think that the tumor was in the same bone,

62
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in the same place in my body

63
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
as the accident 38 years earlier --

64
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it seemed like too much of a coincidence.

65
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So that afternoon, I went back to my house,

66
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler,

67
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
came running to meet me.

68
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
They'd just turned three,

69
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and they were into all things pink and purple.

70
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious --

71
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
although I must say, our favorite nickname

72
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
occurred on their birthday, April 15th.

73
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46

74
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
on April 15, 2005,

75
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,

76
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and was like, "Hmm, April 15th -- tax day.

77
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Early filer and late filer."

78
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The next day I came to see him. I was like, "Doctor, that was a really good joke."

80
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And he was like, "You're the writer, kid."

81
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Anyway -- so they had just turned three,

82
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up

83
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground,

84
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
laughing with all the glee in the world.

85
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I crumbled.

86
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them,

87
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the art projects I might not mess up,

88
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the boyfriends I might not scowl at,

89
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the aisles I might not walk down.

90
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Would they wonder who I was, I thought.

91
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
Would they yearn for my approval,

92
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
my love, my voice?

93
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
A few days later, I woke with an idea

94
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of how I might give them that voice.

95
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I would reach out to six men

96
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
from all parts of my life

97
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and ask them to be present

98
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in the passages of my daughters' lives.

99
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,"

100
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I wrote these men.

101
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes,

102
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but they may not have me.

103
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They may not have their dad.

104
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Will you help be their dad?"

105
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I said to myself

106
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I would call this group of men "the Council of Dads."

107
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now as soon as I had this idea,

108
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.

109
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
She's a very upbeat,

110
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
naturally excited person.

111
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
There's this idea in this culture -- I don't have to tell you --

112
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that you sort of "happy" your way through a problem.

113
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We should focus on the positive.

114
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston.

115
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality.

116
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
She's got big hair --

117
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,

118
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because if I say she has big hair,

119
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
people will think she's from Texas.

120
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia,

121
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but not to have hair from Texas.

122
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And actually, in her defense, if she were here right now,

123
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
she would point out that, when we got married in Georgia,

124
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
there were three questions

125
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
on the marriage certificate license,

126
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the third of which was, "Are you related?"

127
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.

129
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In Arkansas they don't even ask."

130
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump.

131
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You don't need the 30-day waiting period.

132
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Because you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.

133
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea,

134
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.

135
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And she loved the idea,

136
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but she quickly started rejecting my nominees.

137
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice."

138
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So it turned out that starting a council of dads

139
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
was a very efficient way to find out

140
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
what my wife really thought of my friends.

141
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

142
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So we decided that we needed a set of rules,

143
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we came up with a number.

144
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And the first one was no family, only friends.

145
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We thought our family would already be there.

146
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Second, men only.

147
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.

148
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And then third, sort of a dad for every side.

149
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We kind of went through my personality

150
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.

151
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.

152
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And rather than send it,

153
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I decided to read it to them in person.

154
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Linda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.

155
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I sort of friend-married each of these guys.

156
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.

157
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe

158
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s.

159
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.

160
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And I snuck out behind,

161
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows.

162
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And Jeff came up beside me and said,

163
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"So, have you ever been cow tipping?"

164
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I was like, "Cow tipping?

165
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
He was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.

166
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So if you approach them from behind, down wind,

167
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
you can push them over and they go thud in the mud."

168
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not,

169
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence,

170
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
we were tiptoeing through the dung

171
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and approaching some poor, dozing cow.

172
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So a few weeks after my diagnosis,

173
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
we went up to Vermont,

174
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads.

175
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.

176
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
"Will you help be their dad?"

177
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying --

178
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes."

179
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I was like, "Yes?"

180
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter.

181
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And frankly, although I keep getting asked this,

182
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down

183
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
under the circumstances.

184
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads

185
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book.

186
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And that was, "What's the one piece of advice

187
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
you would give to my girls?"

188
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And Jeff's advice was,

189
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
"Be a traveller, not a tourist.

190
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Get off the bus. Seek out what's different.

191
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Approach the cow."

192
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"So it's 10 years from now," I said,

193
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here.

194
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
What would you tell them?"

195
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
He said, "I would approach this journey

196
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
as a young child might approach a mud puddle.

197
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror

198
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple,

199
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
or you can jump in and thrash around

200
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and see what it feels like, what it smells like."

201
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And as he talked he had that glint in his eye

202
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that I first saw back in Holland --

203
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the glint that says, "Let's go cow tipping,"

204
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
even though we never did tip the cow,

205
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
even though no one tips the cow,

206
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
even though cows don't sleep standing up.

207
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He said, "I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience,

208
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
covered in mud."

209
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed

210
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma

211
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in my left femur.

212
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.

213
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Eighty-five percent are under 21.

214
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Only a hundred adults a year

215
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
get one of these diseases.

216
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped,

217
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and there was a 15 percent survival rate.

218
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And then in the 1980's, they determined

219
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective,

220
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and within weeks I had started that regimen.

221
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And since we are in a medical room,

222
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I went through four and a half months of chemo.

223
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin

224
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and very high-dose Methotrexate.

225
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And then I had a 15-hour surgery

226
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey

227
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,

228
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
took out my left femur

229
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and replaced it with titanium.

230
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And if you did see the Sanjay special,

231
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
you saw these enormous screws

232
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that they screwed into my pelvis.

233
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Then he took my fibula from my calf,

234
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh,

235
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
where it now lives.

236
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf

237
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and re-vascularized it in my thigh

238
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and then connected it

239
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to the good parts of my knee and my hip.

240
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.

241
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This is a surgery so rare

242
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
only two human beings have survived it before me.

243
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And my reward for surviving it

244
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
was to go back for four more months of chemo.

245
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It was, as we said in my house,

246
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
a lost year.

247
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.

248
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house,

249
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children

250
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
sitting on my desk.

251
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of --

252
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland --

253
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of William Sloane Coffin --

254
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
it made me think of it.

255
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo

256
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system.

257
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.

258
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask

259
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body.

260
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law

261
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that my daughters, at that time three and a half,

262
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
were missing me and feeling my absence.

263
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And I hung up the phone,

264
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and I put my face in my hands,

265
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and I screamed this silent scream.

266
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
And what you said, Dr. Nuland -- I don't know where you are --

267
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
made me think of this today.

268
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Because the thought that came to my mind

269
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
was that the feeling that I had

270
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
was like a primal scream.

271
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And what was so striking --

272
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today --

273
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is the experience.

274
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
As I became less and less human --

275
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now.

276
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Of course, I had no hair and no immune system.

277
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
They were actually putting blood inside my body.

278
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
At that moment I was less and less human,

279
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I was also, at the same time,

280
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
maybe the most human I've ever been.

281
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And what was so striking about that time

282
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
was, instead of repulsing people,

283
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I was actually proving to be a magnet for people.

284
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
People were incredibly drawn.

285
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.

286
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Instead, it was everybody running the other way.

287
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.

288
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Instead, it was all-hands-on-deck.

289
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And when people came to me,

290
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw --

291
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I was like a living ghost --

292
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
they were incredibly moved

293
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to talk about what was going on in their own lives.

294
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy.

295
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It is an invitation, maybe even a mandate,

296
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to enter the most vital arenas of human life,

297
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the most sensitive and the most frightening,

298
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the ones that we never want to go to,

299
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but when we do go there,

300
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
we feel incredibly transformed when we do.

301
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And this also happened to my girls as they began to see,

302
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.

303
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
One day, my daughter Tybee,

304
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Tybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,

305
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses.

306
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk,

307
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
because that's where love comes from."

308
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

309
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And one night my daughter Eden came to me.

310
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And as I lifted my leg out of bed,

311
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
she reached for my crutches and handed them to me.

312
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
In fact, if I cling to one memory of this year,

313
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
it would be walking down a darkened hallway

314
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
with five spongy fingers

315
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
grasping the handle underneath my hand.

316
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I didn't need the crutch anymore,

317
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
I was walking on air.

318
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And one of the profound things that happened

319
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
was this act of actually connecting to all these people.

320
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record --

321
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
one word that I've only heard once actually

322
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday --

323
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually

324
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is the word "friend."

325
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And yet from everything we've been talking about --

326
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
compliance, or addiction, or weight loss --

327
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
we now know that community is important,

328
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.

329
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And there was something incredibly profound

330
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
about sitting down with my closest friends

331
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and telling them what they meant to me.

332
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And one of the things that I learned is that over time,

333
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
particularly men, who used to be non-communicative,

334
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
are becoming more and more communicative.

335
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And that particularly happened -- there was one in my life --

336
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is this Council of Dads

337
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that Linda said, what we were talking about,

338
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.

339
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And no one captures this modern manhood to me

340
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
more than David Black.

341
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Now David is my literary agent.

342
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day,

343
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
standing fully upright in cowboy boots.

344
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone --

345
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I can say this I guess because you've done it here --

346
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
he answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker."

347
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine,

348
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car --

349
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
although, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th.

350
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes,

351
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
he leaves work early to coach Little League.

352
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads.

353
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I was like, "David cries when you invite him to take a walk."

354
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Laughter)

355
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But he's a literary agent,

356
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true.

357
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And this is what we wanted him to capture --

358
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.

359
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?"

360
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And he said, "A belief in themselves."

361
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
"But when I came to see you," I said, "I didn't believe in myself.

362
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I was at a wall."

363
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
He said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same,

364
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Don't see the wall.

365
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
You may encounter one from time to time,

366
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.

367
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
But whatever you do, don't succumb to it.

368
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
Don't give in to the wall.

369
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge,

370
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and during the year and a half I was on crutches,

371
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
it became a sort of symbol to me.

372
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So one day near the end of my journey,

373
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge."

374
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We set out on crutches.

375
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I was on crutches, my wife was next to me,

376
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead.

377
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And because walking was one of the first things I lost,

378
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I spent most of that year

379
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
thinking about this most elemental of human acts.

380
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Walking upright, we are told,

381
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is the threshold of what made us human.

382
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,

383
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
the act is essentially unchanged.

384
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
As my physical therapist likes to say,

385
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen."

386
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
You nearly fall with one leg,

387
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
then you catch yourself with the other.

388
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches --

389
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
as I did for a year and a half --

390
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
is that you walk slower.

391
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
You hurry,

392
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
you get where you're going, but you get there alone.

393
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
You go slow, you get where you're going,

394
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but you get there with this community

395
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
you built along the way.

396
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
At the risk of admission, I was never nicer

397
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
than the year I was on crutches.

398
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
200 years ago,

399
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.

400
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
He was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades.

401
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And it was the custom of those flaneurs

402
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
to show they were men of leisure

403
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
by taking turtles for walks

404
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and letting the reptile set the pace.

405
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And I just love this ode to slow moving.

406
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And it's become my own motto for my girls.

407
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Take a walk with a turtle.

408
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Behold the world in pause.

409
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And this idea of pausing

410
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.

411
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
There's a quote from Moses

412
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
on the side of the Liberty Bell,

413
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus,

414
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.

415
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And every seven sets of seven years,

416
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
the land gets an extra year of rest

417
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
during which time all families are reunited

418
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and people surrounded with the ones they love.

419
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
That 50th year is called the jubilee year,

420
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and it's the origin of that term.

421
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And though I'm shy of 50,

422
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
it captures my own experience.

423
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
My lost year was my jubilee year.

424
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
By laying fallow,

425
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I planted the seeds for a healthier future

426
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and was reunited with the ones I love.

427
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Come the one year anniversary of my journey,

428
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey --

429
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor.

430
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage,

431
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.

432
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And I said, "Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day

433
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?'

434
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
what would you tell them?"

435
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
He said, "I would tell them what I know,

436
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and that is everybody dies,

437
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
but not everybody lives.

438
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I want you to live."

439
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I wrote a letter to my girls

440
0:17:55.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
that appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads,"

441
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and I listed these lessons,

442
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
a few of which you've heard here today:

443
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Approach the cow, pack your flipflops,

444
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
don't see the wall,

445
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
live the questions,

446
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
harvest miracles.

447
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
As I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living --

448
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
I realized, we may have done it for our girls,

449
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
but it really changed us.

450
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,

451
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
is that my wife and I did this

452
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
in an attempt to help our daughters,

453
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
but it really changed us.

454
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
So I stand here today

455
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
as you see now, walking without crutches or a cane.

456
0:18:32.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And last week I had my 18-month scans.

457
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And as you all know,

458
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.

459
0:18:38.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
In my case it's quarterly.

460
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:42,000
And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,

461
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:45,000
can never find a solution for scan-xiety.

462
0:18:45.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
As I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say

463
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
depending on what happened here.

464
0:18:51.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
I got good news that day,

465
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and I stand here today cancer-free,

466
0:18:55.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
walking without aid

467
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:19:,000
and hobbling forward.

468
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:03,000
And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit --

469
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
but I just want to briefly mention in passing

470
0:19:05.33,000 --> 0:19:07,000
that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this

471
0:19:07.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
is, at a similar meeting,

472
0:19:09.33,000 --> 0:19:11,000
back in the spring,

473
0:19:11.33,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Anne Wojcicki heard about our story

474
0:19:13.33,000 --> 0:19:15,000
and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks --

475
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:17,000
put the full resources of 23andMe,

476
0:19:17.33,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and we announced an initiative in July

477
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
to get to decode the genome

478
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
of anybody, a living person

479
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.

480
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:31,000
And she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it,

481
0:19:31.33,000 --> 0:19:34,000
we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.

482
0:19:34.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And the epidemiologists here will tell you,

483
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
that's half the number of people who get the disease

484
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:4,000
in one year in the United States.

485
0:19:40.33,000 --> 0:19:42,000
So if you go to 23andMe,

486
0:19:42.33,000 --> 0:19:45,000
or if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link.

487
0:19:45.33,000 --> 0:19:48,000
And we encourage anybody to join this effort.

488
0:19:48.33,000 --> 0:19:51,000
But I'll just close what I've been talking about

489
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:53,000
by leaving you with this message:

490
0:19:53.33,000 --> 0:19:55,000
May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,

491
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:19:57,000
or to that college roommate,

492
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
or to some person you may have turned away from.

493
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace,

494
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:04,000
or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall

495
0:20:04.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
that stands between you and one of your dreams.

496
0:20:07.33,000 --> 0:20:09,000
And every now and then,

497
0:20:09.33,000 --> 0:20:11,000
find a friend, find a turtle,

498
0:20:11.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
and take a long, slow walk.

499
0:20:14.33,000 --> 0:20:17,000
Thank you very much.

500
0:20:17.33,000 --> 0:20:27,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.739,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I grew up white, secular and middle class

2
0:00:16.518,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in 1950s America.

3
0:00:19.08,000 --> 0:00:21,000
That meant watching fireworks on the Fourth of July,

4
0:00:22.863,000 --> 0:00:23,000
trick-or-treating on Halloween

5
0:00:24.572,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and putting presents under a tree at Christmas.

6
0:00:27.338,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But by the time those traditions got to me,

7
0:00:30.002,000 --> 0:00:32,000
they were hollow, commercial enterprises,

8
0:00:32.227,000 --> 0:00:33,000
which just left me feeling empty.

9
0:00:34.99,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So from a relatively young age,

10
0:00:36.924,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I found myself looking to fill an existential hole,

11
0:00:40.407,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to connect with something bigger than myself.

12
0:00:44.261,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There hadn't been a bar mitzvah in my family in over a century,

13
0:00:47.339,000 --> 0:00:48,000
so I thought I'd take a shot at that --

14
0:00:49.314,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:50.652,000 --> 0:00:53,000
only to be devastated when my one encounter with the rabbi,

16
0:00:54.083,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a really tall, godlike figure with flowing white hair,

17
0:00:58.854,000 --> 0:01:,000
consisted of him asking me for my middle name

18
0:01:01.755,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so we could fill out a form.

19
0:01:04.094,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Yep, that was it.

20
0:01:05.438,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:06.525,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I got the fountain pen,

22
0:01:08.363,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but I didn't get the sense of belonging and confidence

23
0:01:11.239,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was searching for.

24
0:01:13.297,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Many years later,

25
0:01:15.012,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I couldn't bear the thought of my son turning 13

26
0:01:17.752,000 --> 0:01:19,000
without some kind of rite of passage.

27
0:01:21.331,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So I came up with the idea of a 13th birthday trip,

28
0:01:24.839,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I offered to take Murphy anywhere in the world

29
0:01:27.371,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that had meaning for him.

30
0:01:29.597,000 --> 0:01:31,000
A budding young naturalist who loved turtles,

31
0:01:32.32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
he immediately settled on the Galapagos.

32
0:01:35.313,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And when my daughter, Katie, turned 13,

33
0:01:38.057,000 --> 0:01:41,000
she and I spent two weeks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,

34
0:01:41.42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where Katie learned for the first time that she was powerful and brave.

35
0:01:46.79,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Since then, my partner, Ashton, and lots of our friends and relatives

36
0:01:50.617,000 --> 0:01:52,000
have taken their kids on 13th birthday trips,

37
0:01:53.609,000 --> 0:01:57,000
with everyone finding it transformative for both the child and the parent.

38
0:02:00.932,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I wasn't brought up saying grace.

39
0:02:03.709,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But for the last 20 years,

40
0:02:05.917,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we've been holding hands before every meal.

41
0:02:09.2,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It's a beautiful bit of shared silence

42
0:02:11.318,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that brings us all together in the moment.

43
0:02:14.29,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Ashton tells everyone to "pass the squeeze,"

44
0:02:17.245,000 --> 0:02:19,000
while she assures them it's not religious.

45
0:02:19.659,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:22.441,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So recently, when my family asked me

47
0:02:24.646,000 --> 0:02:29,000
if I could please do something with the more than 250 boxes of stuff

48
0:02:30.144,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that I've collected over a lifetime,

49
0:02:32.819,000 --> 0:02:34,000
my ritual-making impulse kicked in.

50
0:02:36.567,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I started wondering if I could go further than simple death cleaning.

51
0:02:40.987,000 --> 0:02:43,000
"Death cleaning" is the Swedish term for clearing out your closets,

52
0:02:44.698,000 --> 0:02:47,000
your basement and your attic before you die,

53
0:02:48.318,000 --> 0:02:5,000
so your kids don't have to do it later.

54
0:02:50.471,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:52.422,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I pictured my children opening up box after box

56
0:02:55.849,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and wondering why I'd kept any of that stuff.

57
0:02:59.343,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:00.572,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And then I imagined them looking at a specific picture

59
0:03:04.004,000 --> 0:03:06,000
of me with a beautiful young woman,

60
0:03:06.519,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and asking, "Who on earth is that with Dad?"

61
0:03:09.576,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:10.996,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And that was the aha moment.

63
0:03:13.524,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It wasn't the things I'd saved that were important;

64
0:03:16.623,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it was the stories that went with them that gave them meaning.

65
0:03:21.554,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Could using the objects to tell the stories

66
0:03:24.54,000 --> 0:03:25,000
be the seed of a new ritual,

67
0:03:26.84,000 --> 0:03:29,000
a rite of passage -- not for a 13-year-old,

68
0:03:30.317,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but for someone much further down the road?

69
0:03:34.468,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So I started experimenting.

70
0:03:36.683,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I got a few dozen things out of the boxes,

71
0:03:39.343,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I put them about in a room,

72
0:03:41.694,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and I invited people to come in

73
0:03:44.173,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and ask me about anything that they found interesting.

74
0:03:48.497,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The results were terrific.

75
0:03:50.328,000 --> 0:03:55,000
A good story became a launching pad for a much deeper discussion,

76
0:03:55.402,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in which my visitors made meaningful connections

77
0:03:57.858,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to their own lives.

78
0:04:00.949,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Derrius [Quarles] asked me about a Leonard Peltier T-shirt

79
0:04:04.367,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that I'd worn a lot in the '80s,

80
0:04:06.425,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that, sadly, is still relevant today.

81
0:04:09.924,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Our conversation moved quickly,

82
0:04:12.697,000 --> 0:04:15,000
from a large number of political prisoners in American jails,

83
0:04:16.504,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to Derrius wondering about the legacy

84
0:04:18.74,000 --> 0:04:2,000
of the Black Liberation Movement of the '60s,

85
0:04:21.694,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and how his life might be different if he'd come of age then,

86
0:04:25.172,000 --> 0:04:26,000
instead of 30-odd years later.

87
0:04:28.141,000 --> 0:04:29,000
At the end of our conversation,

88
0:04:30.465,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Derrius asked me if he could have the T-shirt.

89
0:04:33.388,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And giving it to him felt just about perfect.

90
0:04:37.51,000 --> 0:04:4,000
As these conversations established common ground,

91
0:04:40.867,000 --> 0:04:41,000
especially across generations,

92
0:04:43.648,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I realized I was opening a space

93
0:04:45.934,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for people to talk about things that really mattered to them.

94
0:04:50.269,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I started seeing myself with a renewed sense of purpose --

95
0:04:54.419,000 --> 0:04:55,000
not as the old guy on the way out,

96
0:04:56.936,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but as someone with a role to play

97
0:04:58.674,000 --> 0:04:59,000
going forward.

98
0:05:01.77,000 --> 0:05:02,000
When I was growing up,

99
0:05:03.248,000 --> 0:05:05,000
life ended for most people in their 70s.

100
0:05:07.535,000 --> 0:05:08,000
People are living far longer now,

101
0:05:10.064,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and for the first time in human history,

102
0:05:12.235,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it's common for four generations to be living side by side.

103
0:05:17.071,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I'm 71,

104
0:05:18.897,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and with a bit of luck,

105
0:05:20.238,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I've got 20 or 30 more years ahead of me.

106
0:05:24.761,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Giving away my stuff now

107
0:05:27.031,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and sharing it with friends, family, and I hope strangers, too,

108
0:05:32.067,000 --> 0:05:35,000
seems like the perfect way to enter this next stage of my life.

109
0:05:36.704,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Turns out to be just what I was looking for:

110
0:05:39.424,000 --> 0:05:41,000
a ritual that's less about dying

111
0:05:41.883,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and more about opening the door

112
0:05:43.85,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to whatever comes next.

113
0:05:46.145,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Thank you.

114
0:05:47.319,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:48.433,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Onward!

116
0:05:49.631,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

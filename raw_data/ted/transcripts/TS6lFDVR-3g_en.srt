2
0:00:12.18,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's six o'clock in the morning,

3
0:00:14.42,000 --> 0:00:15,000
pitch black outside.

4
0:00:16.46,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My 14-year-old son is fast asleep in his bed,

5
0:00:19.7,000 --> 0:00:22,000
sleeping the reckless, deep sleep of a teenager.

6
0:00:23.82,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake,

7
0:00:27.82,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because I know that, like ripping off a Band-Aid,

8
0:00:30.46,000 --> 0:00:31,000
it's better to get it over with quickly.

9
0:00:32.42,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:34.1,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I have a friend who yells "Fire!" just to rouse her sleeping teen.

11
0:00:38.86,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And another who got so fed up

12
0:00:40.86,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that she had to dump cold water on her son's head

13
0:00:43.74,000 --> 0:00:44,000
just to get him out of bed.

14
0:00:46.42,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Sound brutal ...

15
0:00:48.18,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but perhaps familiar?

16
0:00:51.42,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Every morning I ask myself,

17
0:00:54.3,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"How can I --

18
0:00:55.9,000 --> 0:00:56,000
knowing what I know

19
0:00:57.66,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and doing what I do for a living --

20
0:01:00.1,000 --> 0:01:02,000
be doing this to my own son?"

21
0:01:02.86,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You see,

22
0:01:04.18,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I'm a sleep researcher.

23
0:01:05.9,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:08.1,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So I know far too much about sleep

25
0:01:09.94,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and the consequences of sleep loss.

26
0:01:12.66,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I know that I'm depriving my son of the sleep he desperately needs

27
0:01:16.779,000 --> 0:01:17,000
as a rapidly growing teenager.

28
0:01:19.18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I also know that by waking him up

29
0:01:21.46,000 --> 0:01:25,000
hours before his natural biological clock tells him he's ready,

30
0:01:26.14,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm literally robbing him of his dreams --

31
0:01:29.22,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the type of sleep most associated with learning, memory consolidation

32
0:01:35.02,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and emotional processing.

33
0:01:37.58,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But it's not just my kid that's being deprived of sleep.

34
0:01:41.58,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Sleep deprivation among American teenagers is an epidemic.

35
0:01:46.18,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Only about one in 10 gets the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night

36
0:01:50.7,000 --> 0:01:53,000
recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians.

37
0:01:55.1,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now, if you're thinking to yourself,

38
0:01:56.86,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Phew, we're doing good, my kid's getting eight hours,"

39
0:02:00.14,000 --> 0:02:01,000
remember,

40
0:02:01.38,000 --> 0:02:04,000
eight hours is the minimum recommendation.

41
0:02:04.9,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You're barely passing.

42
0:02:06.98,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Eight hours is kind of like getting a C on your report card.

43
0:02:10.78,000 --> 0:02:12,000
There are many factors contributing to this epidemic,

44
0:02:14.42,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but a major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need

45
0:02:18.98,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is actually a matter of public policy.

46
0:02:21.98,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat.

47
0:02:27.34,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Across the country,

48
0:02:28.62,000 --> 0:02:32,000
many schools are starting around 7:30am or earlier,

49
0:02:33.5,000 --> 0:02:37,000
despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend

50
0:02:37.62,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that middle and high school start no earlier than 8:30am.

51
0:02:43.06,000 --> 0:02:47,000
These early start policies have a direct effect on how much --

52
0:02:47.22,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or really how little sleep American teenagers are getting.

53
0:02:52.34,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They're also pitting teenagers and their parents

54
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
in a fundamentally unwinnable fight against their own bodies.

55
0:03:01.18,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Around the time of puberty,

56
0:03:03.02,000 --> 0:03:06,000
teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock,

57
0:03:06.78,000 --> 0:03:09,000
which determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most sleepy.

58
0:03:11.34,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin.

59
0:03:15.9,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around 11pm,

60
0:03:21.46,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children.

61
0:03:27.66,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This means that waking a teenager up at 6am is the biological equivalent

62
0:03:33.7,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of waking an adult up at 4am.

63
0:03:37.58,000 --> 0:03:4,000
On the unfortunate days when I have to wake up at 4am,

64
0:03:41.58,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I'm a zombie.

65
0:03:42.94,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Functionally useless.

66
0:03:44.7,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I can't think straight,

67
0:03:46.34,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I'm irritable,

68
0:03:47.86,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and I probably shouldn't be driving a car.

69
0:03:51.5,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But this is how many American teenagers feel every single school day.

70
0:03:56.1,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In fact, many of the, shall we say,

71
0:03:59.14,000 --> 0:04:03,000
unpleasant characteristics that we chalk up to being a teenager --

72
0:04:03.5,000 --> 0:04:06,000
moodiness, irritability, laziness, depression --

73
0:04:06.94,000 --> 0:04:08,000
could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation.

74
0:04:10.9,000 --> 0:04:12,000
For many teens battling chronic sleep loss,

75
0:04:13.66,000 --> 0:04:18,000
their go-to strategy to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine

76
0:04:19.18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in the form of venti frappuccinos,

77
0:04:21.38,000 --> 0:04:22,000
or energy drinks and shots.

78
0:04:23.9,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So essentially,

79
0:04:25.14,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we've got an entire population of tired but wired youth.

80
0:04:33.42,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times know

81
0:04:37.06,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that adolescence is a period of dramatic brain development,

82
0:04:40.62,000 --> 0:04:42,000
particularly in the parts of the brain

83
0:04:42.7,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that are responsible for those higher order thinking processes,

84
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
including reasoning, problem-solving and good judgment.

85
0:04:51.14,000 --> 0:04:54,000
In other words, the very type of brain activity that's responsible

86
0:04:54.3,000 --> 0:04:58,000
for reining in those impulsive and often risky behaviors

87
0:04:58.9,000 --> 0:05:,000
that are so characteristic of adolescence

88
0:05:01.86,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and that are so terrifying to us parents of teenagers.

89
0:05:06.42,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They know that like the rest of us,

90
0:05:08.34,000 --> 0:05:1,000
when teenagers don't get the sleep they need,

91
0:05:10.78,000 --> 0:05:13,000
their brains, their bodies and behaviors suffer

92
0:05:13.94,000 --> 0:05:15,000
with both immediate and lasting effects.

93
0:05:17.1,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They can't concentrate,

94
0:05:18.94,000 --> 0:05:19,000
their attention plummets

95
0:05:20.86,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic ADHD.

96
0:05:26.14,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But the consequences of teen sleep loss go well beyond the classroom,

97
0:05:30.58,000 --> 0:05:33,000
sadly contributing to many of the mental health problems

98
0:05:34.22,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that skyrocket during adolescence,

99
0:05:36.94,000 --> 0:05:37,000
including substance use,

100
0:05:38.78,000 --> 0:05:4,000
depression and suicide.

101
0:05:42.22,000 --> 0:05:45,000
In our work with teens from LA Unified School District,

102
0:05:45.42,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we found that teens with sleep problems

103
0:05:47.66,000 --> 0:05:51,000
were 55 percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month.

104
0:05:52.9,000 --> 0:05:55,000
In another study with over 30,000 high school students,

105
0:05:56.82,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they found that for each hour of lost sleep,

106
0:06:00.42,000 --> 0:06:03,000
there was a 38 percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless,

107
0:06:05.22,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and a 58 percent increase in teen suicide attempts.

108
0:06:10.42,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And if that's not enough,

109
0:06:12.7,000 --> 0:06:14,000
teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk

110
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
for a host of physical health problems that plague our country,

111
0:06:19.34,000 --> 0:06:23,000
including obesity, heart disease and diabetes.

112
0:06:24.58,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Then there's the risk of putting a sleep-deprived teen,

113
0:06:27.5,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with a newly minted driver's license,

114
0:06:30.06,000 --> 0:06:31,000
behind the wheel.

115
0:06:31.98,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Studies have shown that getting five hours or less of sleep per night

116
0:06:36.5,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol content above the legal limit.

117
0:06:48.02,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times,

118
0:06:50.54,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and researchers in this area,

119
0:06:52.62,000 --> 0:06:54,000
have produced tremendous science

120
0:06:54.82,000 --> 0:06:57,000
showing the tremendous benefits of later start times.

121
0:06:58.74,000 --> 0:07:,000
The findings are unequivocal,

122
0:07:01.06,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and as a sleep scientist,

123
0:07:02.78,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I rarely get to speak with that kind of certainty.

124
0:07:06.98,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Teens from districts with later start times get more sleep.

125
0:07:10.82,000 --> 0:07:13,000
To the naysayers who may think that if schools start later,

126
0:07:14.34,000 --> 0:07:15,000
teens will just stay up later,

127
0:07:16.74,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the truth is,

128
0:07:18.02,000 --> 0:07:19,000
their bedtimes stay the same,

129
0:07:19.98,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but their wake-up times get extended,

130
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
resulting in more sleep.

131
0:07:25.18,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They're more likely to show up for school;

132
0:07:27.58,000 --> 0:07:3,000
school absences dropped by 25 percent in one district.

133
0:07:31.5,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And they're less likely to drop out.

134
0:07:34.1,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Not surprisingly, they do better academically.

135
0:07:37.62,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So this has real implications for reducing the achievement gap.

136
0:07:42.38,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Standardized test scores in math and reading

137
0:07:45.1,000 --> 0:07:47,000
go up by two to three percentage points.

138
0:07:48.14,000 --> 0:07:53,000
That's as powerful as reducing class sizes by one-third fewer students,

139
0:07:53.74,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or replacing a so-so teacher in the classroom

140
0:07:56.94,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with a truly outstanding one.

141
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Their mental and physical health improves,

142
0:08:02.82,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and even their families are happier.

143
0:08:05.18,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little more pleasantness from our teens,

144
0:08:10.02,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and a little less crankiness?

145
0:08:12.86,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Even their communities are safer

146
0:08:14.74,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because car crash rates go down --

147
0:08:17.3,000 --> 0:08:19,000
a 70 percent reduction in one district.

148
0:08:21.22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Given these tremendous benefits,

149
0:08:23.66,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you might think,

150
0:08:25.02,000 --> 0:08:27,000
well, this is a no-brainer, right?

151
0:08:27.74,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So why have we as a society failed to heed this call?

152
0:08:33.5,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Often the argument against later start times goes something like this:

153
0:08:37.82,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"Why should we delay start times for teenagers?

154
0:08:40.14,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We need to toughen them up so they're ready for the real world!"

155
0:08:44.02,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But that's like saying to the parent of a two-year-old,

156
0:08:46.94,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"Don't let Johnny nap,

157
0:08:48.46,000 --> 0:08:5,000
or he won't be ready for kindergarten."

158
0:08:50.9,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:53.7,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Delaying start times also presents many logistical challenges.

160
0:08:57.62,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Not just for students and their families,

161
0:09:00.02,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but for communities as a whole.

162
0:09:02.42,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Updating bus routes,

163
0:09:04.02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
increased transportation costs,

164
0:09:06.1,000 --> 0:09:07,000
impact on sports,

165
0:09:07.66,000 --> 0:09:09,000
care before or after school.

166
0:09:10.1,000 --> 0:09:14,000
These are the same concerns that come up in district after district,

167
0:09:14.7,000 --> 0:09:15,000
time and again around the country

168
0:09:16.7,000 --> 0:09:18,000
as school start times are debated.

169
0:09:19.78,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And they're legitimate concerns,

170
0:09:22.46,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but these are problems we have to work through.

171
0:09:25.94,000 --> 0:09:27,000
They are not valid excuses

172
0:09:28.22,000 --> 0:09:3,000
for failing to do the right thing for our children,

173
0:09:31.74,000 --> 0:09:35,000
which is to start middle and high schools no earlier than 8:30am.

174
0:09:37.58,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And in districts around the country,

175
0:09:39.5,000 --> 0:09:41,000
big and small, who have made this change,

176
0:09:42.14,000 --> 0:09:45,000
they found that these fears are often unfounded

177
0:09:45.94,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits for student health

178
0:09:50.38,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and performance,

179
0:09:52.06,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and our collective public safety.

180
0:09:55.98,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So tomorrow morning,

181
0:09:57.78,000 --> 0:10:01,000
when coincidentally we get to set our clocks back by an hour

182
0:10:03.58,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and you get that delicious extra hour of sleep,

183
0:10:09.1,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and the day seems a little longer,

184
0:10:11.9,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and a little more full of hope,

185
0:10:14.58,000 --> 0:10:17,000
think about the tremendous power of sleep.

186
0:10:19.34,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And think about what a gift it would be

187
0:10:21.94,000 --> 0:10:25,000
for our children to be able to wake up naturally,

188
0:10:25.98,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in harmony with their own biology.

189
0:10:29.22,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Thank you,

190
0:10:30.5,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and pleasant dreams.

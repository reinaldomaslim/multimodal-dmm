1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Talking about empowerment is odd,

2
0:00:15.659,000 --> 0:00:17,000
because when we talk about empowerment,

3
0:00:17.761,000 --> 0:00:2,000
what affects us most are the stories.

4
0:00:20.967,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So I want to begin with an everyday story.

5
0:00:24.179,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What is it really like to be a young woman in India?

6
0:00:28.702,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, I've spent the last 27 years of my life

7
0:00:30.974,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in India, lived in three small towns,

8
0:00:33.073,000 --> 0:00:34,000
two major cities,

9
0:00:34.889,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I've had several experiences.

10
0:00:38.118,000 --> 0:00:39,000
When I was seven,

11
0:00:39.974,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a private tutor who used to come home

12
0:00:41.931,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to teach me mathematics molested me.

13
0:00:46.646,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He would put his hand up my skirt.

14
0:00:52.794,000 --> 0:00:55,000
He put his hand up my skirt and told me

15
0:00:55.97,000 --> 0:00:58,000
he knew how to make me feel good.

16
0:00:59.93,000 --> 0:01:02,000
At 17, a boy from my high school

17
0:01:03.06,000 --> 0:01:04,000
circulated an email

18
0:01:04.507,000 --> 0:01:06,000
detailing all the sexually aggressive things

19
0:01:06.94,000 --> 0:01:08,000
he could do to me

20
0:01:09.704,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because I didn't pay attention to him.

21
0:01:13.789,000 --> 0:01:16,000
At 19, I helped a friend

22
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:2,000
whose parents had forcefully married her to an older man

23
0:01:20.592,000 --> 0:01:23,000
escape an abusive marriage.

24
0:01:24.259,000 --> 0:01:26,000
At 21, when my friend and I were walking

25
0:01:26.401,000 --> 0:01:3,000
down the road one afternoon,

26
0:01:30.734,000 --> 0:01:31,000
a man pulled down his pants

27
0:01:32.273,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and masturbated in front of us.

28
0:01:35.483,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We called people for help, and nobody came.

29
0:01:39.91,000 --> 0:01:43,000
At 25, when I was walking home one evening,

30
0:01:44.9,000 --> 0:01:46,000
two men on a motorcycle attacked me.

31
0:01:47.726,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I spent two nights in the hospital

32
0:01:49.843,000 --> 0:01:52,000
recovering from trauma and injuries.

33
0:01:53.085,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So throughout my life, I've seen women —

34
0:01:58.305,000 --> 0:01:59,000
family, friends, colleagues —

35
0:02:00.171,000 --> 0:02:02,000
live through these experiences,

36
0:02:02.964,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and they seldom talk about it.

37
0:02:06.137,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So in simple words, life in India is not easy.

38
0:02:10.777,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear.

39
0:02:14.295,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path

40
0:02:16.049,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of learning that this fear took me on.

41
0:02:20.427,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So, what happened one night in December 2012

42
0:02:23.93,000 --> 0:02:24,000
changed my life.

43
0:02:25.704,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So a young girl, a 23-year-old student,

44
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend.

45
0:02:33.904,000 --> 0:02:35,000
There were six men on the bus, young men

46
0:02:36.513,000 --> 0:02:39,000
who you might encounter every day in India,

47
0:02:39.591,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and the chilling account of what followed

48
0:02:41.923,000 --> 0:02:42,000
was played over and over again

49
0:02:43.667,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in the Indian and international media.

50
0:02:46.491,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This girl was raped repeatedly,

51
0:02:49.765,000 --> 0:02:51,000
forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod,

52
0:02:52.745,000 --> 0:02:55,000
beaten, bitten, and left to die.

53
0:02:55.996,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Her friend was gagged, attacked,

54
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and knocked unconscious.

55
0:03:01.577,000 --> 0:03:05,000
She died on the 29th of December.

56
0:03:05.761,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And at a time when most of us here

57
0:03:07.739,000 --> 0:03:09,000
were preparing to welcome the new year,

58
0:03:10.242,000 --> 0:03:13,000
India plunged into darkness.

59
0:03:13.479,000 --> 0:03:16,000
For the first time in our history,

60
0:03:16.645,000 --> 0:03:18,000
men and women in Indian cities

61
0:03:18.823,000 --> 0:03:2,000
woke up to the horrific truth

62
0:03:21.014,000 --> 0:03:24,000
about the true state of women in the country.

63
0:03:24.536,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, like many other young women,

64
0:03:26.955,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I was absolutely terrified.

65
0:03:29.149,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I couldn't believe that something like this

66
0:03:30.416,000 --> 0:03:33,000
could happen in a national capital.

67
0:03:33.591,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I was angry and I was frustrated,

68
0:03:36.144,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but most of all, I felt utterly, completely helpless.

69
0:03:40.247,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But really, what do you do, right?

70
0:03:42.388,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Some write blogs, some ignore it,

71
0:03:44.413,000 --> 0:03:45,000
some join protests.

72
0:03:46.145,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I did all of it. In fact, that was what everyone was doing

73
0:03:48.71,000 --> 0:03:49,000
two years ago.

74
0:03:50.388,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So the media was filled with stories about

75
0:03:53.367,000 --> 0:03:54,000
all the horrific deeds

76
0:03:55.133,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that Indian men are capable of.

77
0:03:57.237,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They were compared to animals,

78
0:03:58.472,000 --> 0:04:,000
sexually repressed beasts.

79
0:04:00.659,000 --> 0:04:04,000
In fact, so alien and unthinkable was this event

80
0:04:04.663,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in an Indian mind

81
0:04:05.977,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that the response from the Indian media,

82
0:04:08.393,000 --> 0:04:11,000
public and politicians proved one point:

83
0:04:12.3,000 --> 0:04:13,000
No one knew what to do.

84
0:04:14.179,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And no one wanted to be responsible for it.

85
0:04:16.776,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In fact, these were a few insensitive comments

86
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which were made in the media

87
0:04:20.441,000 --> 0:04:22,000
by prominent people

88
0:04:22.468,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in response to sexual violence against women in general.

89
0:04:26.624,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So the first one is made by a member of parliament,

90
0:04:29.826,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the second one is made by a spiritual leader,

91
0:04:33.219,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the third one was actually the defendants' lawyer

92
0:04:35.93,000 --> 0:04:36,000
when the girl was fighting for her life

93
0:04:37.776,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and she passed away.

94
0:04:40.63,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, as a woman watching this day after day,

95
0:04:44.483,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I was tired.

96
0:04:46.283,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So as a writer and gender activist,

97
0:04:47.927,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I have written extensively on women,

98
0:04:51.176,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but this time, I realized it was different,

99
0:04:53.822,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because a part of me realized

100
0:04:55.403,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I was a part of that young woman too,

101
0:04:57.751,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I decided I wanted to change this.

102
0:04:59.929,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So I did something spontaneous, hasty.

103
0:05:03.96,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I logged on to a citizen journalism platform

104
0:05:06.506,000 --> 0:05:07,000
called iReport,

105
0:05:07.962,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and I recorded a video talking about

106
0:05:10.713,000 --> 0:05:11,000
what the scene was like in Bangalore.

107
0:05:12.693,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I talked about how I felt,

108
0:05:14.38,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I talked about the ground realities,

109
0:05:15.722,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and I talked about the frustrations of living in India.

110
0:05:21.227,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In a few hours, the blog was shared widely,

111
0:05:24.845,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and comments and thoughts poured in

112
0:05:26.68,000 --> 0:05:27,000
from across the world.

113
0:05:28.34,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In that moment, a few things occurred to me.

114
0:05:32.015,000 --> 0:05:35,000
One, technology was always at hand

115
0:05:35.743,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for many young women like me.

116
0:05:38.96,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Two, like me, most young women

117
0:05:42.504,000 --> 0:05:45,000
hardly use it to express their views.

118
0:05:45.925,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Three, I realized for the first time

119
0:05:49.849,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that my voice mattered.

120
0:05:52.707,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So in the months that followed,

121
0:05:55.44,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I covered a trail of events in Bangalore

122
0:05:57.487,000 --> 0:06:,000
which had no space in the mainstream news.

123
0:06:01.469,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In Cubbon Park, which is a big park in Bangalore,

124
0:06:04.24,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I gathered with over 100 others

125
0:06:05.84,000 --> 0:06:06,000
when groups of young men came forward

126
0:06:07.749,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to wear skirts to prove that clothing

127
0:06:09.561,000 --> 0:06:12,000
does not invite rape.

128
0:06:13.241,000 --> 0:06:14,000
When I reported about these events,

129
0:06:15.075,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I felt I had charge, I felt like I had a channel

130
0:06:18.168,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to release all the emotions I had inside me.

131
0:06:22.337,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I attended the town hall march

132
0:06:24.409,000 --> 0:06:25,000
when students held up signs saying

133
0:06:26.343,000 --> 0:06:28,000
"Kill them, hang them."

134
0:06:28.872,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters."

135
0:06:32.699,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I went to a candlelight vigil

136
0:06:34.177,000 --> 0:06:36,000
where citizens gathered together

137
0:06:36.28,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly,

138
0:06:40.237,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and I recorded a lot of blogs

139
0:06:42.277,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in response to how worrying the situation was

140
0:06:44.98,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in India at that point.

141
0:06:46.249,000 --> 0:06:47,000
["I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say"]

142
0:06:47.898,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, the reactions confused me.

143
0:06:49.357,000 --> 0:06:51,000
While supportive comments poured in from across the world,

144
0:06:52.227,000 --> 0:06:54,000
as did vicious ones.

145
0:06:54.241,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So some called me a hypocrite.

146
0:06:55.675,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Some called me a victim, a rape apologist.

147
0:06:58.438,000 --> 0:07:,000
Some even said I had a political motive.

148
0:07:01.403,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But this one comment kind of describes

149
0:07:03.523,000 --> 0:07:07,000
what we are discussing here today.

150
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But I was soon to learn that this was not all.

151
0:07:11.44,000 --> 0:07:12,000
As empowered as I felt

152
0:07:13.429,000 --> 0:07:14,000
with the new liberty that this

153
0:07:14.879,000 --> 0:07:16,000
citizen journalism channel gave me,

154
0:07:17.236,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I found myself in an unfamiliar situation.

155
0:07:20.57,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So sometime last August, I logged onto Facebook

156
0:07:23.737,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and I was looking through my news feed,

157
0:07:25.14,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I noticed there was a link

158
0:07:27.183,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that was being shared by my friends.

159
0:07:28.856,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I clicked on the link; it led me back

160
0:07:31.039,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to a report uploaded by an American girl

161
0:07:35.114,000 --> 0:07:37,000
called Michaela Cross.

162
0:07:37.322,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The report was titled,

163
0:07:38.71,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"India: The story you never wanted to hear."

164
0:07:41.951,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And in this report, she recounted her firsthand

165
0:07:45.096,000 --> 0:07:48,000
account of facing sexual harassment in India.

166
0:07:48.796,000 --> 0:07:51,000
She wrote, "There is no way to prepare for the eyes,

167
0:07:52.763,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the eyes that every day stared

168
0:07:54.85,000 --> 0:07:56,000
with such entitlement at my body,

169
0:07:57.574,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with no change of expression

170
0:07:59.424,000 --> 0:08:01,000
whether I met their gaze or not.

171
0:08:02.072,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's,

172
0:08:05.21,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I got stares so sharp

173
0:08:07.309,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece."

174
0:08:10.746,000 --> 0:08:13,000
She called India a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell.

175
0:08:14.64,000 --> 0:08:16,000
She said she was stalked, groped,

176
0:08:16.656,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and masturbated at.

177
0:08:18.253,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now, late that evening, the report went viral.

178
0:08:20.692,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It was on news channels across the world.

179
0:08:24.304,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Everyone was discussing it.

180
0:08:25.91,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It had over a million views,

181
0:08:27.018,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a thousand comments and shares,

182
0:08:28.923,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and I found myself witnessing

183
0:08:30.837,000 --> 0:08:32,000
a very similar thing.

184
0:08:33.401,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The media was caught in this vicious cycle

185
0:08:36.097,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of opinion and outburst

186
0:08:38.395,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and no outcome whatsoever.

187
0:08:41.7,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So that night, as I sat wondering

188
0:08:44.105,000 --> 0:08:45,000
how I should respond,

189
0:08:45.437,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I found myself filled with doubt.

190
0:08:47.847,000 --> 0:08:5,000
You see, as a writer, I approached this issue

191
0:08:51.208,000 --> 0:08:53,000
as an observer,

192
0:08:53.586,000 --> 0:08:57,000
as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief,

193
0:08:57.964,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and as an activist, I looked at it as a defender of rights,

194
0:09:02.443,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but as a citizen journalist,

195
0:09:04.578,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I suddenly felt very vulnerable.

196
0:09:07.852,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I mean, here she was, a young woman

197
0:09:10.183,000 --> 0:09:11,000
who was using a channel to talk about

198
0:09:11.583,000 --> 0:09:13,000
her experience just as I was,

199
0:09:13.731,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and yet I felt unsettled.

200
0:09:16.545,000 --> 0:09:17,000
You see, no one ever tells you

201
0:09:18.467,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that true empowerment comes from giving yourself

202
0:09:21.407,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the permission to think and act.

203
0:09:23.783,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Empowerment is often made to sound as if

204
0:09:26.245,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it's an ideal, it's a wonderful outcome.

205
0:09:29.442,000 --> 0:09:3,000
When we talk about empowerment, we often

206
0:09:31.274,000 --> 0:09:34,000
talk about giving people access to materials,

207
0:09:34.559,000 --> 0:09:36,000
giving them access to tools.

208
0:09:37.295,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.

209
0:09:39.744,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It's a feeling.

210
0:09:41.206,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The first step to empowerment

211
0:09:43.938,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is to give yourself the authority,

212
0:09:46.818,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the key to independent will,

213
0:09:48.793,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and for women everywhere,

214
0:09:50.393,000 --> 0:09:52,000
no matter who we are or where we come from,

215
0:09:52.941,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that is the most difficult step.

216
0:09:56.261,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We fear the sound of our own voice,

217
0:09:58.87,000 --> 0:10:,000
for it means admission, but it is this that gives us

218
0:10:01.656,000 --> 0:10:04,000
the power to change our environment.

219
0:10:04.74,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now in this situation where I was faced

220
0:10:06.581,000 --> 0:10:08,000
with so many different kinds of realities,

221
0:10:09.267,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I was unsure how to judge,

222
0:10:10.753,000 --> 0:10:13,000
because I didn't know what it would mean for me.

223
0:10:13.838,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I feared to judge because I didn't know what it would be

224
0:10:16.843,000 --> 0:10:19,000
if I didn't support the same view as this girl.

225
0:10:20.124,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I didn't know what it would mean for me

226
0:10:21.49,000 --> 0:10:25,000
if I was challenging someone else's truth.

227
0:10:26.37,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But yet, it was simple.

228
0:10:27.863,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I had to make a decision:

229
0:10:29.312,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Should I speak up or should I stay quiet?

230
0:10:32.502,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So after a lot of thought,

231
0:10:34.786,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I recorded a video blog in response,

232
0:10:37.282,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and I told Michaela, well,

233
0:10:39.252,000 --> 0:10:41,000
there are different sides to India,

234
0:10:41.955,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and I also tried to explain

235
0:10:47.364,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that things would be okay

236
0:10:49.425,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and I expressed my regret for what she had faced.

237
0:10:52.091,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And a few days later, I was invited to talk

238
0:10:54.692,000 --> 0:10:55,000
on air with her,

239
0:10:56.061,000 --> 0:11:,000
and for the first time, I reached out to this girl

240
0:11:00.181,000 --> 0:11:02,000
who I had never met, who was so far away,

241
0:11:02.982,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but yet I felt so close to.

242
0:11:05.82,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Since this report came to light,

243
0:11:08.35,000 --> 0:11:1,000
more young people than ever

244
0:11:10.655,000 --> 0:11:13,000
were discussing sexual harassment on the campus,

245
0:11:14.006,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and the university that Michaela belonged to

246
0:11:16.797,000 --> 0:11:19,000
gave her the assistance she needed.

247
0:11:20.645,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The university even took measures

248
0:11:22.99,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to train its students to equip them

249
0:11:25.049,000 --> 0:11:26,000
with the skills that they need

250
0:11:26.685,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to confront challenges such as harassment,

251
0:11:30.155,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and for the first the time, I felt I wasn't alone.

252
0:11:34.448,000 --> 0:11:36,000
You see, if there's anything that I've learned

253
0:11:36.534,000 --> 0:11:38,000
as an active citizen journalist

254
0:11:39.169,000 --> 0:11:42,000
over the past few years,

255
0:11:42.252,000 --> 0:11:45,000
it is our dire lack as a society to actively find

256
0:11:46.225,000 --> 0:11:48,000
avenues where our voices can be heard.

257
0:11:49.222,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We don't realize that when we are standing up,

258
0:11:53.526,000 --> 0:11:54,000
we are not just standing up as individuals,

259
0:11:55.368,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we are standing up for our communities,

260
0:11:58.605,000 --> 0:11:59,000
our friends, our peers.

261
0:12:00.464,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Most of us say that women are denied their rights,

262
0:12:03.837,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but the truth is, oftentimes,

263
0:12:06.213,000 --> 0:12:09,000
women deny themselves these rights.

264
0:12:09.613,000 --> 0:12:11,000
In a recent survey in India,

265
0:12:12.25,000 --> 0:12:16,000
95 percent of the women who work in I.T.,

266
0:12:16.781,000 --> 0:12:19,000
aviation, hospitality and call centers,

267
0:12:20.197,000 --> 0:12:22,000
said they didn't feel safe returning home alone

268
0:12:22.764,000 --> 0:12:25,000
after work in the late hours or in the evening.

269
0:12:26.15,000 --> 0:12:27,000
In Bangalore, where I come from,

270
0:12:27.551,000 --> 0:12:29,000
this number is 85 percent.

271
0:12:30.017,000 --> 0:12:32,000
In rural areas in India,

272
0:12:32.563,000 --> 0:12:35,000
if anything is to go by the recent

273
0:12:35.72,000 --> 0:12:37,000
gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha

274
0:12:38.287,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and Aligarh are supposed to go by,

275
0:12:40.308,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we need to act really soon.

276
0:12:43.885,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Don't get me wrong,

277
0:12:45.578,000 --> 0:12:47,000
the challenges that women will face

278
0:12:48.285,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in telling their stories is real,

279
0:12:51.077,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but we need to start pursuing

280
0:12:53.782,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and trying to identify mediums

281
0:12:56.269,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to participate in our system

282
0:12:57.76,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and not just pursue the media blindly.

283
0:13:02.124,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Today, more women than ever

284
0:13:05.122,000 --> 0:13:06,000
are standing up and questioning

285
0:13:06.767,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the government in India,

286
0:13:08.146,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and this is a result of that courage.

287
0:13:11.169,000 --> 0:13:14,000
There is a sixfold increase in women

288
0:13:14.222,000 --> 0:13:15,000
reporting harassment,

289
0:13:15.784,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and the government passed

290
0:13:17.173,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013

291
0:13:20.149,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to protect women against sexual assault.

292
0:13:23.968,000 --> 0:13:24,000
As I end this talk,

293
0:13:25.92,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I just want to say

294
0:13:28.04,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets,

295
0:13:33.62,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but let us speak up.

296
0:13:35.572,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Let us fight the shame and talk about it.

297
0:13:38.241,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It could be a platform, a community,

298
0:13:41.761,000 --> 0:13:44,000
your loved one, whoever or whatever you choose,

299
0:13:45.648,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but let us speak up.

300
0:13:47.74,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The truth is, the end to this problem

301
0:13:50.8,000 --> 0:13:51,000
begins with us.

302
0:13:52.542,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Thank you.

303
0:13:54.187,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.598,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Pat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage.

2
0:00:15.271,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Sheryl Sandberg: First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out

3
0:00:18.214,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and see so many women.

4
0:00:20.132,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's so not my regular experience, as I know anyone else's.

5
0:00:25.262,000 --> 0:00:3,000
PM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media,

6
0:00:30.654,000 --> 0:00:34,000
which we assumed it would be, but that you had very much on your mind

7
0:00:35.31,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the missing leadership positions, particularly in the sector of technology and social media.

8
0:00:42.464,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave?

9
0:00:49.238,000 --> 0:00:51,000
SS: So I was really scared to get on this stage and talk about women,

10
0:00:51.809,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because I grew up in the business world, as I think so many of us did.

11
0:00:55.461,000 --> 0:01:01,000
You never talk about being a woman, because someone might notice that you're a woman, right?

12
0:01:01.793,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They might notice. Or worse, if you say "woman," people on the other end of the table

13
0:01:05.953,000 --> 0:01:08,000
think you're asking for special treatment, or complaining.

14
0:01:09.043,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Or worse, about to sue them. And so I went through -- (Laughter)

15
0:01:12.751,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Right? I went through my entire business career,

16
0:01:14.929,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and never spoke about being a woman, never spoke about it publicly.

17
0:01:18.557,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But I also had noticed that it wasn't working.

18
0:01:21.46,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I came out of college over 20 years ago, and I thought

19
0:01:24.899,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that all of my peers were men and women, all the people above me were all men,

20
0:01:28.798,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but that would change,

21
0:01:29.896,000 --> 0:01:33,000
because your generation had done such an amazing job fighting for equality,

22
0:01:34.429,000 --> 0:01:37,000
equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't.

23
0:01:38.041,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Because year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer,

24
0:01:41.376,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and now, often the only woman in a room.

25
0:01:43.328,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I talked to a bunch of people about,

26
0:01:45.418,000 --> 0:01:48,000
should I give a speech at TEDWomen about women, and they said, oh no, no.

27
0:01:48.839,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It will end your business career. You cannot be a serious business executive

28
0:01:54.033,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and speak about being a woman. You'll never be taken seriously again.

29
0:01:57.471,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But fortunately, there were the few, the proud -- like you -- who told me I should give the speech,

30
0:02:02.346,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I asked myself the question Mark Zuckerberg might --

31
0:02:05.002,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the founder of Facebook and my boss --

32
0:02:06.84,000 --> 0:02:1,000
asks all of us, which is, what would I do if I wasn't afraid?

33
0:02:11.419,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't afraid is I would get on the TED stage,

34
0:02:15.241,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and talk about women, and leadership. And I did, and survived. (Applause)

35
0:02:22.746,000 --> 0:02:25,000
PM: I would say, not only survived. I'm thinking of that moment, Sheryl,

36
0:02:26.581,000 --> 0:02:3,000
when you and I were standing backstage together, and you turned to me,

37
0:02:30.914,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and you told me a story.

38
0:02:32.652,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I said -- very last minute -- you know, you really should share that story.

39
0:02:36.531,000 --> 0:02:37,000
SS: Oh, yeah. PM: What was that story?

40
0:02:38.281,000 --> 0:02:41,000
SS: Well, it's an important part of the journey. So I had -- TEDWomen --

41
0:02:41.546,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the original one was in D.C. -- so I live here, so I had gotten on a plane the day before,

42
0:02:45.355,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and my daughter was three, she was clinging to my leg: "Mommy, don't go."

43
0:02:50.404,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And Pat's a friend, and so, not related to the speech I was planning on giving,

44
0:02:54.137,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which was chock full of facts and figures, and nothing personal,

45
0:02:58.599,000 --> 0:03:,000
I told Pat the story. I said, well, I'm having a hard day.

46
0:03:00.865,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Yesterday my daughter was clinging to my leg, and "Don't go."

47
0:03:03.469,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And you looked at me and said, you have to tell that story.

48
0:03:05.213,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding?

49
0:03:09.448,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I'm going to get on a stage and admit my daughter was clinging to my leg?

50
0:03:11.905,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And you said yes, because if you want to talk about getting more women into leadership roles,

51
0:03:16.072,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you have to be honest about how hard it is.

52
0:03:19.209,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And I did. And I think that's a really important part of the journey.

53
0:03:23.945,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The same thing happened when I wrote my book. I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter,

54
0:03:29.243,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I thought it was fabulous. It was chock-full of data and figures,

55
0:03:33.209,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai tribes, and their sociological patterns.

56
0:03:41.069,000 --> 0:03:46,000
My husband read it and he was like, this is like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter)

57
0:03:46.132,000 --> 0:03:53,000
No one -- and I apologize to Wheaties if there's someone -- no one, no one will read this book.

58
0:03:53.497,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And I realized through the process that I had to be more honest and more open,

59
0:03:57.682,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still not feeling as self-confident as I should,

60
0:04:02.428,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in many situations. My first and failed marriage. Crying at work.

61
0:04:08.647,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Felling like I didn't belong there, feeling guilty to this day.

62
0:04:12.319,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And part of my journey, starting on this stage, going to "Lean In," going to the foundation,

63
0:04:16.714,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is all about being more open and honest about those challenges,

64
0:04:20.602,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so that other women can be more open and honest,

65
0:04:22.61,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and all of us can work together towards real equality.

66
0:04:26.242,000 --> 0:04:29,000
PM: I think that one of the most striking parts about the book,

67
0:04:29.584,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and in my opinion, one of the reasons it's hit such a nerve and is resonating around the world,

68
0:04:35.449,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is that you are personal in the book, and that you do make it clear that,

69
0:04:41.234,000 --> 0:04:45,000
while you've observed some things that are very important for other women to know,

70
0:04:45.392,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that you've had the same challenges that many others of us have,

71
0:04:49.951,000 --> 0:04:55,000
as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and possibly the people who don't believe the same.

72
0:04:56.746,000 --> 0:05:,000
So talk about that process: deciding you'd go public with the private part,

73
0:05:01.384,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and then you would also put yourself in the position of something of an expert

74
0:05:05.101,000 --> 0:05:08,000
on how to resolve those challenges.

75
0:05:08.542,000 --> 0:05:1,000
SS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was --

76
0:05:10.726,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you know, I never really expected to write a book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer,

77
0:05:14.474,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and it was viewed a lot, and it really started impacting people's lives.

78
0:05:19.143,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I got this great --- one of the first letters I got was from a woman

79
0:05:22.663,000 --> 0:05:27,000
who said that she was offered a really big promotion at work, and she turned it down,

80
0:05:27.789,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and she told her best friend she turned it down, and her best friend said,

81
0:05:30.142,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you really need to watch this TED Talk.

82
0:05:31.975,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And so she watched this TED Talk, and she went back the next day, she took the job,

83
0:05:36.391,000 --> 0:05:4,000
she went home, and she handed her husband the grocery list. (Laughter)

84
0:05:41.239,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And she said, I can do this.

85
0:05:42.831,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And what really mattered to me -- it wasn't only women in the corporate world,

86
0:05:45.984,000 --> 0:05:47,000
even though I did hear from a lot of them, and it did impact a lot of them,

87
0:05:48.954,000 --> 0:05:51,000
it was also people of all different circumstances.

88
0:05:52.784,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There was a doctor I met who was an attending physician at Johns Hopkins,

89
0:05:56.531,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and he said that until he saw my TED Talk, it never really occurred to him

90
0:06:00.124,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that even though half the students in his med school classes were women,

91
0:06:02.498,000 --> 0:06:04,000
they weren't speaking as much as the men as he did his rounds.

92
0:06:05.409,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So he started paying attention, and as he waited for raised hands, he realized the men's hands were up.

93
0:06:11.635,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more,

94
0:06:13.92,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and it still didn't work.

95
0:06:15.197,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So he told everyone, no more hand raising, I'm cold-calling.

96
0:06:18.751,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So he could call evenly on men and women. And what he proved to himself was that

97
0:06:22.955,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the women knew the answers just as well or better,

98
0:06:25.588,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and he was able to go back to them and tell them that.

99
0:06:27.476,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And then there was the woman, stay-at-home mom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood,

100
0:06:32.595,000 --> 0:06:36,000
with not a great school, she said that TED Talk -- she's never had a corporate job,

101
0:06:36.631,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school and fight for a better teacher for her child.

102
0:06:42.406,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.

103
0:06:46.698,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And I realized that other women and men could find their voice through it,

104
0:06:50.752,000 --> 0:06:52,000
which is why I went from the talk to the book.

105
0:06:53.474,000 --> 0:06:59,000
PM: And in the book, you not only found your voice, which is clear and strong in the book,

106
0:06:59.799,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but you also share what you've learned --

107
0:07:03.363,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the experiences of other people in the lessons.

108
0:07:06.506,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And that's what I'm thinking about in terms of putting yourself in a --

109
0:07:10.688,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you became a sort of expert in how you lean in.

110
0:07:15.642,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So what did that feel like, and become like in your life?

111
0:07:20.034,000 --> 0:07:26,000
To launch not just a book, not just a best-selling, best-viewed talk,

112
0:07:26.246,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but a movement, where people began to literally describe their actions at work as,

113
0:07:32.09,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I'm leaning in.

114
0:07:34.772,000 --> 0:07:41,000
SS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored, I'm happy, and it's the very beginning.

115
0:07:41.986,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research.

116
0:07:46.5,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I have read every study, I have pored over the materials,

117
0:07:49.713,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and the lessons are very clear. Because here's what we know:

118
0:07:53.341,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What we know is that stereotypes are holding women back from leadership roles all over the world.

119
0:07:58.053,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's so striking. "Lean In" is very global, I've been all over the world,

120
0:08:00.656,000 --> 0:08:02,000
talking about it, and -- cultures are so different.

121
0:08:03.051,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Even within our own country, to Japan, to Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe,

122
0:08:08.044,000 --> 0:08:12,000
they're so different. Except for one thing: gender.

123
0:08:12.231,000 --> 0:08:13,000
All over the world, no matter what our cultures are,

124
0:08:14.151,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we think men should be strong, assertive, aggressive, have voice;

125
0:08:18.481,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we think women should speak when spoken to, help others.

126
0:08:22.998,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now we have, all over the world,

127
0:08:26.703,000 --> 0:08:29,000
women are called "bossy." There is a word for "bossy,"

128
0:08:30.496,000 --> 0:08:32,000
for little girls, in every language there's one.

129
0:08:32.814,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys,

130
0:08:35.024,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because if a little boy leads, there's no negative word for it,

131
0:08:37.952,000 --> 0:08:41,000
it's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy.

132
0:08:42.741,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now I know there aren't a lot of men here, but bear with me.

133
0:08:44.736,000 --> 0:08:46,000
If you're a man, you'll have to represent your gender.

134
0:08:47.27,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Please raise your hand if you've been told you're too aggressive at work.

135
0:08:52.834,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter) There's always a few, it runs about five percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen.

136
0:08:58.718,000 --> 0:09:04,000
If you're a woman, please raise your hand if you've ever been told you're too aggressive at work.

137
0:09:05.281,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter) That is what audiences have said in every country in the world,

138
0:09:08.894,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and it's deeply supported by the data.

139
0:09:11.76,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Now, do we think women are more aggressive than men? Of course not.

140
0:09:16.099,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's just that we judge them through a different lens,

141
0:09:18.449,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead,

142
0:09:23.3,000 --> 0:09:25,000
are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss,

143
0:09:26.164,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and in a woman, she's bossy.

144
0:09:27.786,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it.

145
0:09:31.872,000 --> 0:09:33,000
One of the happiest moments I had in this whole journey is,

146
0:09:34.262,000 --> 0:09:38,000
after the book came out, I stood on a stage with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.

147
0:09:39.195,000 --> 0:09:42,000
He read the book. He stood on a stage with me, he invited me in front of his whole management team,

148
0:09:42.854,000 --> 0:09:45,000
men and women, and he said, I thought we were good at this. I thought I was good at this.

149
0:09:46.246,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And then I read this book, and I realized that we -- my company --

150
0:09:51.312,000 --> 0:09:52,000
we have called all of our senior women too aggressive,

151
0:09:53.296,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and I'm standing on this stage, and I'm sorry.

152
0:09:55.745,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And I want you to know we're never going to do it again.

153
0:09:59.49,000 --> 0:10:02,000
PM: Can we send that to a lot of other people that we know? (Applause)

154
0:10:02.874,000 --> 0:10:05,000
SS: And so John is doing that because he believes it's good for his company,

155
0:10:06.775,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and so this kind of acknowledgement of these biases can change it.

156
0:10:09.829,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And so next time you all see someone call a little girl "bossy,"

157
0:10:13.477,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you walk right up to that person, big smile, and you say,

158
0:10:16.025,000 --> 0:10:22,000
"That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has executive leadership skills." (Laughter)

159
0:10:22.56,000 --> 0:10:25,000
PM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter. SS: Absolutely.

160
0:10:25.765,000 --> 0:10:28,000
PM: And you did focus in the book -- and the reason, as you said, in writing it,

161
0:10:28.834,000 --> 0:10:29,000
was to create a dialogue about this.

162
0:10:30.759,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I mean, let's just put it out there, face the fact that women are --

163
0:10:34.273,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in a time when we have more open doors, and more opportunities --

164
0:10:37.948,000 --> 0:10:4,000
are still not getting to the leadership positions.

165
0:10:41.248,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So in the months that have come since the book,

166
0:10:43.446,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in which "Lean In" focused on that and said,

167
0:10:46.004,000 --> 0:10:5,000
here are some of the challenges that remain, and many of them we have to own within ourselves

168
0:10:50.304,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and look at ourselves. What has changed?

169
0:10:53.066,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Have you seen changes?

170
0:10:55.152,000 --> 0:10:57,000
SS: Well, there's certainly more dialogue, which is great.

171
0:10:57.415,000 --> 0:11:,000
But what really matters to me, and I think all of us, is action.

172
0:11:00.463,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So everywhere I go, CEOs, they're mostly men, say to me,

173
0:11:04.247,000 --> 0:11:06,000
you're costing me so much money

174
0:11:06.866,000 --> 0:11:09,000
because all the women want to be paid as much as the men.

175
0:11:10.038,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter)

176
0:11:14.319,000 --> 0:11:17,000
At all. I mean, the women should be paid as much as the men.

177
0:11:17.557,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Everywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.

178
0:11:20.694,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Everywhere I go, women say they're getting better relationships with their spouses,

179
0:11:24.691,000 --> 0:11:27,000
asking for more help at home, asking for the promotions they should be getting at work,

180
0:11:28.671,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and importantly, believing it themselves. Even little things.

181
0:11:31.669,000 --> 0:11:35,000
One of the governors of one of the states told me that he didn't realize that more women were, in fact,

182
0:11:35.701,000 --> 0:11:37,000
literally sitting on the side of the room, which they are,

183
0:11:37.93,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and now he made a rule that all the women on his staff need to sit at the table.

184
0:11:43.417,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The foundation I started along with the book "Lean In"

185
0:11:45.573,000 --> 0:11:48,000
helps women, or men, start circles -- small groups,

186
0:11:48.925,000 --> 0:11:51,000
it can be 10, it can be however many you want, which meet once a month.

187
0:11:52.174,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I would have hoped that by now, we'd have about 500 circles. That would've been great.

188
0:11:55.495,000 --> 0:11:57,000
You know, 500 times roughly 10.

189
0:11:58.417,000 --> 0:12:01,000
There are over 12,000 circles in 50 countries in the world.

190
0:12:01.647,000 --> 0:12:02,000
PM: Wow, that's amazing.

191
0:12:03.207,000 --> 0:12:06,000
SS: And these are people who are meeting every single month.

192
0:12:06.282,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I met one of them, I was in Beijing.

193
0:12:08.621,000 --> 0:12:12,000
A group of women, they're all about 29 or 30, they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing,

194
0:12:13.321,000 --> 0:12:16,000
several of them grew up in very poor, rural China.

195
0:12:17.314,000 --> 0:12:22,000
These women are 29, they are told by their society that they are "left over,"

196
0:12:23.122,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because they are not yet married,

197
0:12:25.135,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and the process of coming together once a month at a meeting

198
0:12:27.918,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is helping them define who they are for themselves.

199
0:12:31.218,000 --> 0:12:35,000
What they want in their careers. The kind of partners they want, if at all.

200
0:12:35.554,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I looked at them, we went around and introduced ourselves,

201
0:12:37.541,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and they all said their names and where they're from,

202
0:12:39.38,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and I said, I'm Sheryl Sandberg, and this was my dream.

203
0:12:42.86,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And I kind of just started crying.

204
0:12:44.7,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Right, which, I admit, I do. Right? I've talked about it before.

205
0:12:49.457,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But the fact that a woman so far away out in the world, who grew up in a rural village,

206
0:12:54.027,000 --> 0:12:58,000
who's being told to marry someone she doesn't want to marry,

207
0:12:58.138,000 --> 0:13:,000
can now go meet once a month with a group of people and refuse that,

208
0:13:01.075,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and find life on her own terms.

209
0:13:04.069,000 --> 0:13:05,000
That's the kind of change we have to hope for.

210
0:13:06.012,000 --> 0:13:09,000
PM: Have you been surprised by the global nature of the message?

211
0:13:09.559,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Because I think when the book first came out, many people thought,

212
0:13:12.864,000 --> 0:13:15,000
well, this is a really important handbook for young women on their way up.

213
0:13:16.616,000 --> 0:13:2,000
They need to look at this, anticipate the barriers, and recognize them,

214
0:13:20.93,000 --> 0:13:22,000
put them out in the open, have the dialogue about it,

215
0:13:23.58,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but that it's really for women who are that. Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world.

216
0:13:28.699,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And yet the book is being read, as you say, in rural and developing countries.

217
0:13:33.082,000 --> 0:13:4,000
What part of that has surprised you, and perhaps led to a new perspective on your part?

218
0:13:40.359,000 --> 0:13:43,000
SS: The book is about self-confidence, and about equality.

219
0:13:43.515,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And it turns out, everywhere in the world, women need more self-confidence,

220
0:13:47.415,000 --> 0:13:49,000
because the world tells us we're not equal to men.

221
0:13:49.636,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Everywhere in the world, we live in a world where the men get "and,"

222
0:13:53.049,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and women get "or."

223
0:13:54.36,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I've never met a man who's been asked how he does it all. (Laughter)

224
0:13:58.034,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Again, I'm going to turn to the men in the audience:

225
0:14:01.247,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Please raise your hand if you've been asked, how do you do it all?

226
0:14:04.279,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Laughter)

227
0:14:05.728,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Men only.

228
0:14:07.159,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Women, women. Please raise your hand if you've been asked how you do it all?

229
0:14:12.037,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We assume men can do it all, slash -- have jobs and children.

230
0:14:18.396,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We assume women can't, and that's ridiculous,

231
0:14:20.174,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because the great majority of women everywhere in the world, including the United States,

232
0:14:23.75,000 --> 0:14:25,000
work full time and have children.

233
0:14:26.046,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I think people don't fully understand how broad the message is.

234
0:14:31.218,000 --> 0:14:35,000
There is a circle that's been started for rescued sex workers in Miami.

235
0:14:35.58,000 --> 0:14:4,000
They're using "Lean In" to help people make the transition

236
0:14:40.931,000 --> 0:14:44,000
back to what would be a fair life, really rescuing them from their pimps, and using it.

237
0:14:45.672,000 --> 0:14:48,000
There are dress-for-success groups in Texas which are using the book,

238
0:14:49.421,000 --> 0:14:5,000
for women who have never been to college.

239
0:14:51.08,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And we know there are groups all the way to Ethiopia.

240
0:14:55.008,000 --> 0:15:,000
And so these messages of equality -- of how women are told they can't have what men can have --

241
0:15:00.891,000 --> 0:15:04,000
how we assume that leadership is for men, how we assume that voice is for men,

242
0:15:05.124,000 --> 0:15:08,000
these affect all of us, and I think they are very universal.

243
0:15:08.262,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And it's part of what TEDWomen does.

244
0:15:09.923,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in,

245
0:15:13.706,000 --> 0:15:17,000
which is more women, more voice, more equality.

246
0:15:17.954,000 --> 0:15:23,000
PM: If you were invited now to make another TEDWomen talk,

247
0:15:24.735,000 --> 0:15:29,000
what would you say that is a result of this experience, for you personally,

248
0:15:30.029,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and what you've learned about women, and men,

249
0:15:32.648,000 --> 0:15:35,000
as you've made this journey?

250
0:15:36.334,000 --> 0:15:39,000
SS: I think I would say -- I tried to say this strongly,

251
0:15:39.432,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but I think I can say it more strongly --

252
0:15:41.886,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I want to say that the status quo is not enough.

253
0:15:45.29,000 --> 0:15:47,000
That it's not good enough, that it's not changing quickly enough.

254
0:15:48.27,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book, another year of data came out from the U.S. Census.

255
0:15:53.397,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And you know what we found?

256
0:15:55.186,000 --> 0:15:57,000
No movement in the wage gap for women in the United States.

257
0:15:57.963,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Seventy-seven cents to the dollar.

258
0:16:00.509,000 --> 0:16:02,000
If you are a black woman, 64 cents.

259
0:16:02.543,000 --> 0:16:04,000
If you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents.

260
0:16:05.051,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Do you know when the last time those numbers went up?

261
0:16:07.479,000 --> 0:16:11,000
2002.

262
0:16:11.786,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We are stagnating, we are stagnating in so many ways.

263
0:16:14.67,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And I think we are not really being honest about that,

264
0:16:17.478,000 --> 0:16:2,000
for so many reasons. It's so hard to talk about gender.

265
0:16:20.724,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We shy away from the word "feminist," a word I really think we need to embrace.

266
0:16:24.541,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We have to get rid of the word bossy and bring back --

267
0:16:27.733,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Applause)

268
0:16:30.893,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I think I would say in a louder voice, we need to get rid of the word "bossy"

269
0:16:35.215,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and bring back the word "feminist," because we need it.

270
0:16:38.276,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Applause)

271
0:16:39.761,000 --> 0:16:42,000
PM: And we all need to do a lot more leaning in.

272
0:16:42.803,000 --> 0:16:43,000
SS: A lot more leaning in.

273
0:16:44.004,000 --> 0:16:45,000
PM: Thank you, Sheryl.

274
0:16:45.234,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Thanks for leaning in and saying yes.

275
0:16:46.468,000 --> 0:16:48,000
SS: Thank you.

276
0:16:48.63,000 --> 0:16:5,000
(Applause)

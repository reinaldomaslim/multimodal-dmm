1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hi, my name is Frank,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I collect secrets.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It all started with a crazy idea

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in November of 2004.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
just like this.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They were blank on one side,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and on the other side

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I listed some simple instructions.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
they'd never told anyone before.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I handed out these postcards randomly

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
on the streets of Washington, D.C.,

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
not knowing what to expect.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But soon the idea began spreading virally.

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
People began to buy their own postcards

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and make their own postcards.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
not just with postmarks from Washington, D.C.,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but from Texas, California,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Vancouver, New Zealand, Iraq.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Soon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
PostSecret.com

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world.

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And this is my postcard collection today.

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
You can see my wife

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
struggling to stack a brick of postcards

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What I'd like to do now

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is share with you a very special handful of secrets

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
from that collection,

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
starting with this one.

33
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
"I found these stamps as a child,

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I have been waiting all my life

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to have someone to send them to.

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I never did have someone."

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Secrets can take many forms.

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They can be shocking

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or silly or soulful.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
They can connect us to our deepest humanity

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or with people we'll never meet.

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Maybe one of you sent this one in.

44
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I don't know.

45
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
This one does a great job of demonstrating

46
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the creativity that people have

47
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
when they make and mail me a postcard.

48
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup

49
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
with a stamp and my home address written on the other side.

50
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.

51
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I've found love. I'm happy."

52
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas,

53
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of frailty and heroism,

54
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
playing out silently

55
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in the lives of people all around us

56
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
even now.

57
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"Everyone who knew me before 9/11

58
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
believes I'm dead."

59
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people,

60
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
so sometimes I didn't wear panties,

61
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself."

62
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you.

64
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I love to speak on college campuses

65
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and share secrets and the stories with students.

66
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around

67
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and sign books and take photos with students.

68
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And this next postcard was made

69
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
out of one of those photos.

70
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And I should also mention that, just like today,

71
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
at that PostSecret event,

72
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I was using a wireless microphone.

73
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"Your mic wasn't off during sound check.

74
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We all heard you pee."

75
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This was really embarrassing when it happened,

77
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
until I realized it could have been worse.

78
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Right. You know what I'm saying.

79
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"Inside this envelope

81
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is the ripped up remains

82
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of a suicide note I didn't use.

83
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I feel like the happiest person on Earth (now.)"

84
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"One of these men is the father of my son.

85
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret."

86
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"That Saturday when you wondered where I was,

88
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
well, I was getting your ring.

89
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's in my pocket right now."

90
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog

91
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
two years ago on Valentine's Day.

92
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.

93
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours

94
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
before I received this exuberant email

95
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
from the guy who mailed me this postcard.

96
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And he said, "Frank, I've got to share with you

97
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
this story that just played out in my life."

98
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
He said, "My knees are still shaking."

99
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
He said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I,

100
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we've made it this Sunday morning ritual

101
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to visit the PostSecret blog together

102
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and read the secrets out loud.

103
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I read some to her, she reads some to me."

104
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
He says, "It's really brought us closer together

105
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
through the years.

106
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And so when I discovered

107
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that you had posted

108
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom,

109
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I was beside myself.

110
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I tried to act calm, not to give anything away.

111
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And just like every Sunday,

112
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we started reading the secrets out loud to each other."

113
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
He said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever

114
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to get through each one."

115
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But she finally did.

116
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
She got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her.

117
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And he said, "She read it once and then she read it again."

118
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And she turned to him and said,

119
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"Is that our cat?"

120
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And when she saw him,

122
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
he was down on one knee, he had the ring out.

123
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
He popped the question, she said yes. It was a very happy ending.

124
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So I emailed him back

125
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and I said, "Please share with me an image, something,

126
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that I can share with the whole PostSecret community

127
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and let everyone know your fairy tale ending."

128
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And he emailed me this picture.

129
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
"I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer.

131
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I finally got the pictures developed

132
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and I'd love to give them to you."

133
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This picture never got returned back

134
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to the people who lost it,

135
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but this secret has impacted many lives,

136
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
starting with a student up in Canada

137
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
named Matty.

138
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Matty was inspired by that secret

139
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to start his own website,

140
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
a website called IFoundYourCamera.

141
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Matty invites people

142
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to mail him digital cameras that they've found,

143
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
memory sticks that have been lost

144
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
with orphan photos.

145
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras

146
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and posts them on his website every week.

147
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And people come to visit

148
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to see if they can identify a picture they've lost

149
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
or help somebody else get the photos back to them

150
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that they might be desperately searching for.

151
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This one's my favorite.

152
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Matty has found this ingenious way

154
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to leverage the kindness of strangers.

155
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And it might seem like a simple idea, and it is,

156
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge.

157
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Matty shared with me

158
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
an emotional email he received

159
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
from the mother in that picture.

160
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"That's me, my husband and son.

161
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother.

162
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Thank you for making your site.

163
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
These pictures mean more to me than you know.

164
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
My son's birth is on this camera.

165
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
He turns four tomorrow."

166
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Every picture that you see there

167
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and thousands of others

168
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
have been returned back to the person who lost it --

169
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
sometimes crossing oceans,

170
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
sometimes going through language barriers.

171
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This is the last postcard I have to share with you today.

172
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"When people I love

173
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
leave voicemails on my phone

174
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I always save them in case they die tomorrow

175
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and I have no other way

176
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of hearing their voice ever again."

177
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
When I posted this secret,

178
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
dozens of people

179
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
sent voicemail messages from their phones,

180
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years,

181
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
messages from family or friends

182
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
who had died.

183
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They said that by preserving those voices

184
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and sharing them,

185
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive.

186
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
One young girl

187
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
posted the last message

188
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
she ever heard from her grandmother.

189
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Secrets can take many forms.

190
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
They can be shocking or silly

191
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
or soulful.

192
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
They can connect us with our deepest humanity

193
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
or with people we'll never meet again.

194
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Voicemail recording: First saved voice message.

195
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000

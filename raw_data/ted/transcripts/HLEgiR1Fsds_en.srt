1
0:00:14.595,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So what does it mean to be a woman?

2
0:00:19.341,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We all have XX chromosomes, right?

3
0:00:22.496,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Actually, that's not true.

4
0:00:25.016,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Some women are mosaics.

5
0:00:26.776,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They have a mix of chromosome types with X, with XY or with XXX.

6
0:00:33.056,000 --> 0:00:35,000
If it's not just about our chromosomes,

7
0:00:35.496,000 --> 0:00:37,000
then what is being a woman about?

8
0:00:38.496,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Being feminine?

9
0:00:40.056,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Getting married?

10
0:00:41.536,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Having kids?

11
0:00:43.553,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You don't have to look far to find fantastic exceptions

12
0:00:47.256,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to these rules,

13
0:00:48.896,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but we all share something that makes us women.

14
0:00:53.536,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Maybe that something is in our brains.

15
0:00:57.376,000 --> 0:01:,000
You might have heard theories from last century

16
0:01:00.496,000 --> 0:01:02,000
about how men are better at math than women

17
0:01:03.376,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because they have bigger brains.

18
0:01:05.656,000 --> 0:01:07,000
These theories have been debunked.

19
0:01:07.937,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The average man has a brain about three times smaller

20
0:01:10.856,000 --> 0:01:11,000
than the average elephant,

21
0:01:12.656,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but that doesn't mean

22
0:01:13.936,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the average man is three times dumber than an elephant ...

23
0:01:16.696,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or does it?

24
0:01:17.935,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:20.496,000 --> 0:01:25,000
There's a new wave of female neuroscientists

26
0:01:25.696,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that are finding important differences between female and male brains

27
0:01:29.696,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in neuron connectivity,

28
0:01:31.456,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in brain structure, in brain activity.

29
0:01:34.936,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They're finding that the brain is like a patchwork mosaic --

30
0:01:38.776,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a mixture.

31
0:01:40.096,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Women have mostly female patches and a few male patches.

32
0:01:44.776,000 --> 0:01:47,000
With all this new data, what does it mean to be a woman?

33
0:01:49.296,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is something that I've been thinking about almost my entire life.

34
0:01:53.896,000 --> 0:01:56,000
When people learn that I'm a woman who happens to be transgender,

35
0:01:57.776,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they always ask,

36
0:01:59.296,000 --> 0:02:,000
"How do you know you're a woman?"

37
0:02:02.056,000 --> 0:02:07,000
As a scientist, I'm searching for a biological basis of gender.

38
0:02:07.496,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I want to understand what makes me me.

39
0:02:12.656,000 --> 0:02:14,000
New discoveries at the front edge of science

40
0:02:15.656,000 --> 0:02:19,000
are shedding light on the biomarkers that define gender.

41
0:02:19.936,000 --> 0:02:25,000
My colleagues and I in genetics, neuroscience, physiology and psychology,

42
0:02:26.096,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we're trying to figure out exactly how gender works.

43
0:02:29.176,000 --> 0:02:32,000
These vastly different fields share a common connection --

44
0:02:33.056,000 --> 0:02:34,000
epigenetics.

45
0:02:35.576,000 --> 0:02:41,000
In epigenetics, we're studying how DNA activity

46
0:02:41.696,000 --> 0:02:43,000
can actually radically and permanently change,

47
0:02:44.696,000 --> 0:02:46,000
even though the sequence stays the same.

48
0:02:48.216,000 --> 0:02:53,000
DNA is the long, string-like molecule that winds up inside our cells.

49
0:02:53.728,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There's so much DNA

50
0:02:54.789,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that it actually gets tangled into these knot-like things --

51
0:02:57.704,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we'll just call them knots.

52
0:03:00.201,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So external factors change how those DNA knots are formed.

53
0:03:06.941,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You can think of it like this:

54
0:03:08.421,000 --> 0:03:13,000
inside our cells, there's different contraptions building things,

55
0:03:14.077,000 --> 0:03:15,000
connecting circuits,

56
0:03:15.797,000 --> 0:03:17,000
doing all the things they need to make life happen.

57
0:03:19.797,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Here's one that's sort of reading the DNA and making RNA.

58
0:03:25.477,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And then this one is carrying a huge sac of neurotransmitters

59
0:03:29.117,000 --> 0:03:3,000
from one end of the brain cell

60
0:03:30.957,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to the other.

61
0:03:32.357,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Don't they get hazard pay for this kind of work?

62
0:03:34.637,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:36.757,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This one is an entire molecular factory --

64
0:03:38.917,000 --> 0:03:39,000
some say it's the secret to life.

65
0:03:40.717,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's call the ribosome.

66
0:03:42.117,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I've been studying this since 2001.

67
0:03:46.237,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One of the stunning things about our cells

68
0:03:49.477,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is that the components inside them are actually biodegradable.

69
0:03:53.757,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They dissolve,

70
0:03:55.037,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and then they're rebuilt each day,

71
0:03:57.397,000 --> 0:03:59,000
kind of like a traveling carnival

72
0:03:59.957,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where the rides are taken down and then rebuilt every single day.

73
0:04:04.917,000 --> 0:04:07,000
A big difference between our cells and the traveling carnival

74
0:04:08.237,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is that in the carnival,

75
0:04:10.436,000 --> 0:04:13,000
there are skilled craftsmen that rebuild the rides each day.

76
0:04:15.197,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In our cells, there are no such skilled craftsmen,

77
0:04:17.837,000 --> 0:04:18,000
only dumb builder machines

78
0:04:19.397,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that build whatever's written in the plans,

79
0:04:21.717,000 --> 0:04:22,000
no matter what those plans say.

80
0:04:24.437,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Those plans are the DNA.

81
0:04:27.277,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The instructions for every nook and cranny inside our cells.

82
0:04:32.197,000 --> 0:04:34,000
If everything in, say, our brain cells

83
0:04:35.077,000 --> 0:04:37,000
dissolves almost every day,

84
0:04:37.197,000 --> 0:04:39,000
then how can the brain remember anything past one day?

85
0:04:40.917,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That's where DNA comes in.

86
0:04:42.917,000 --> 0:04:45,000
DNA is one of the those things that does not dissolve.

87
0:04:46.197,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But for DNA to remember that something happened,

88
0:04:48.917,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it has to change somehow.

89
0:04:51.477,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We know the change can't be in the sequence;

90
0:04:53.597,000 --> 0:04:55,000
if it changed sequence all the time,

91
0:04:55.717,000 --> 0:04:59,000
then we might be growing like, a new ear or a new eyeball every single day.

92
0:05:00.637,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:01.677,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So, instead it changes shape,

94
0:05:03.677,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and that's where those DNA knots come in.

95
0:05:05.677,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You can think of them like DNA memory.

96
0:05:09.317,000 --> 0:05:11,000
When something big in our life happens,

97
0:05:11.637,000 --> 0:05:13,000
like a traumatic childhood event,

98
0:05:14.157,000 --> 0:05:15,000
stress hormones flood our brain.

99
0:05:16.877,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The stress hormones don't affect the sequence of DNA,

100
0:05:19.797,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but they do change the shape.

101
0:05:21.957,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They affect that part of DNA

102
0:05:24.317,000 --> 0:05:27,000
with the instructions for molecular machines that reduce stress.

103
0:05:28.797,000 --> 0:05:3,000
That piece of DNA gets wound up into a knot,

104
0:05:31.197,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and now the dumb builder machines can't read the plans they need

105
0:05:35.157,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to build the machines that reduce stress.

106
0:05:38.037,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That's a mouthful, but it's what's happening on the microscale.

107
0:05:41.037,000 --> 0:05:44,000
On the macroscale, you practically lose the ability to deal with stress,

108
0:05:44.477,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and that's bad.

109
0:05:46.037,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And that's how DNA can remember what happens in the past.

110
0:05:51.357,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is what I think was happening to me

111
0:05:53.957,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when I first started my gender transition.

112
0:05:57.277,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I knew I was a woman on the inside,

113
0:05:59.517,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I wore women's clothes on the outside,

114
0:06:02.517,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but everyone saw me as a man in a dress.

115
0:06:07.117,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I felt like no matter how many things I try,

116
0:06:12.157,000 --> 0:06:14,000
no one would ever really see me as a woman.

117
0:06:14.797,000 --> 0:06:17,000
In science, your credibility is everything,

118
0:06:17.877,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and people were snickering in the hallways,

119
0:06:21.997,000 --> 0:06:22,000
giving me stares,

120
0:06:23.477,000 --> 0:06:24,000
looks of disgust --

121
0:06:25.317,000 --> 0:06:26,000
afraid to be near me.

122
0:06:28.197,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I remember my first big talk after transition.

123
0:06:31.157,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It was in Italy.

124
0:06:32.397,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'd given prestigious talks before,

125
0:06:34.837,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but this one, I was terrified.

126
0:06:37.677,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I looked out into the audience,

127
0:06:39.477,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and the whispers started --

128
0:06:42.357,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the stares,

129
0:06:43.757,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the smirks, the chuckles.

130
0:06:46.677,000 --> 0:06:51,000
To this day, I still have social anxiety around my experience eight years ago.

131
0:06:53.917,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I lost hope.

132
0:06:56.877,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Don't worry, I've had therapy so I'm OK --

133
0:06:59.797,000 --> 0:07:,000
I'm OK now.

134
0:07:01.037,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:02.877,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Cheers)

136
0:07:04.717,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Applause)

137
0:07:08.877,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But I felt enough is enough:

138
0:07:10.797,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I'm a scientist,

139
0:07:12.437,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I have a doctorate in astrophysics,

140
0:07:14.317,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I've published in the top journals,

141
0:07:16.037,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in wave-particle interactions, space physics,

142
0:07:18.717,000 --> 0:07:2,000
nucleic acid biochemistry.

143
0:07:20.837,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I've actually been trained to get to the bottom of things, so --

144
0:07:23.957,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:25.077,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I went online --

146
0:07:26.357,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Applause)

147
0:07:31.437,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So I went online, and I found fascinating research papers.

148
0:07:35.277,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I learned that these DNA knot things are not always bad.

149
0:07:38.597,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Actually, the knotting and unknotting --

150
0:07:40.957,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it's like a complicated computer language.

151
0:07:43.317,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It programs our bodies with exquisite precision.

152
0:07:47.477,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So when we get pregnant,

153
0:07:49.357,000 --> 0:07:52,000
our fertilized eggs grow into newborn babies.

154
0:07:53.317,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This process requires thousands of DNA decisions to happen.

155
0:07:57.397,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Should an embryo cell become a blood cell?

156
0:08:00.157,000 --> 0:08:01,000
A heart cell? A brain cell?

157
0:08:02.877,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And the decisions happen at different times during pregnancy.

158
0:08:06.117,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Some in the first trimester, some in the second trimester

159
0:08:09.317,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and some in the third trimester.

160
0:08:14.277,000 --> 0:08:17,000
To truly understand DNA decision-making,

161
0:08:17.357,000 --> 0:08:2,000
we need to see the process of knot formation in atomic detail.

162
0:08:21.877,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Even the most powerful microscopes can't see this.

163
0:08:26.196,000 --> 0:08:28,000
What if we tried to simulate these on a computer?

164
0:08:29.716,000 --> 0:08:32,000
For that we'd need a million computers to do that.

165
0:08:34.037,000 --> 0:08:37,000
That's exactly what we have at Los Alamos Labs --

166
0:08:37.317,000 --> 0:08:4,000
a million computers connected in a giant warehouse.

167
0:08:42.237,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So here we're showing the DNA making up an entire gene

168
0:08:46.277,000 --> 0:08:49,000
folded into very specific shapes of knots.

169
0:08:50.517,000 --> 0:08:51,000
For the first time,

170
0:08:51.877,000 --> 0:08:54,000
my team has simulated an entire gene of DNA --

171
0:08:55.597,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the largest biomolecular simulation performed to date.

172
0:09:00.477,000 --> 0:09:03,000
For the first time, we're beginning to understand the unsolved problem

173
0:09:03.957,000 --> 0:09:06,000
of how hormones trigger the formation of these knots.

174
0:09:09.557,000 --> 0:09:13,000
DNA knot formation can be seen beautifully in calico cats.

175
0:09:14.157,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The decision between orange and black

176
0:09:16.757,000 --> 0:09:17,000
happens early on in the womb,

177
0:09:19.07,000 --> 0:09:21,000
so that orange-and-black patchy pattern,

178
0:09:21.87,000 --> 0:09:23,000
it's an exact readout of what happened

179
0:09:24.19,000 --> 0:09:26,000
when that cat was just a tiny little kitten embryo

180
0:09:26.59,000 --> 0:09:27,000
inside her mom's womb.

181
0:09:28.795,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And the patchy pattern actually happens in our brains and in cancer.

182
0:09:34.115,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It's directly related to intellectual disability and breast cancer.

183
0:09:39.955,000 --> 0:09:43,000
These DNA decisions also happen in other parts of the body.

184
0:09:44.155,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It turns out that the precursor genitals transform into either female or male

185
0:09:49.195,000 --> 0:09:5,000
during the first trimester of pregnancy.

186
0:09:51.795,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The precursor brains, on the other hand,

187
0:09:54.075,000 --> 0:09:57,000
transform into female or male during the second trimester of pregnancy.

188
0:09:58.675,000 --> 0:10:,000
So the current working model

189
0:10:00.755,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is that a unique mix in my mom's womb

190
0:10:04.635,000 --> 0:10:07,000
caused the precursor genitals to transform one way,

191
0:10:08.195,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but the precursor brain to transform the other way.

192
0:10:15.035,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Most of epigenetic research

193
0:10:17.035,000 --> 0:10:2,000
has really focused on stress, anxiety, depression --

194
0:10:20.435,000 --> 0:10:21,000
kind of a downer,

195
0:10:21.915,000 --> 0:10:22,000
kind of bad things.

196
0:10:23.155,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Laughter)

197
0:10:24.195,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But nowadays --

198
0:10:25.795,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the latest stuff --

199
0:10:27.035,000 --> 0:10:28,000
people are looking at relaxation.

200
0:10:28.675,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Can that have a positive effect on your DNA?

201
0:10:32.195,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Right now we're missing key data from mice models.

202
0:10:36.675,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We know that mice relax,

203
0:10:38.115,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but could they meditate like the Dalai Lama?

204
0:10:42.115,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Achieve enlightenment?

205
0:10:43.915,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Could they move stones with their mind like Jedi Master Yoda?

206
0:10:47.635,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Yoda voice): Hm, a Jedi mouse must feel the force flow, hm.

207
0:10:51.515,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

208
0:10:53.475,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Applause)

209
0:10:57.755,000 --> 0:11:,000
I wonder if the support I've had since that talk back in Italy

210
0:11:01.435,000 --> 0:11:03,000
has tried to unwind my DNA.

211
0:11:04.635,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Having a great circle of friends, supportive parents

212
0:11:07.515,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and being in a loving relationship

213
0:11:09.515,000 --> 0:11:12,000
has actually given me strength and hope to help others.

214
0:11:13.875,000 --> 0:11:15,000
At work I wear a rainbow bracelet.

215
0:11:16.435,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Sometimes it raises eyebrows, but it also raises awareness.

216
0:11:20.355,000 --> 0:11:22,000
There's so many transgender people --

217
0:11:22.675,000 --> 0:11:23,000
especially women of color --

218
0:11:24.595,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that are just one demeaning comment away from taking their own lives.

219
0:11:31.195,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Forty percent of us attempt suicide.

220
0:11:35.235,000 --> 0:11:4,000
If you're listening and you feel like you have no other option,

221
0:11:40.355,000 --> 0:11:41,000
try to call a friend,

222
0:11:42.155,000 --> 0:11:44,000
go online or try to get in a support group.

223
0:11:45.755,000 --> 0:11:5,000
If you're a woman who's not transgender but you know pain of isolation,

224
0:11:50.955,000 --> 0:11:51,000
of sexual assault --

225
0:11:52.595,000 --> 0:11:53,000
reach out.

226
0:11:56.795,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So what does it mean to be a woman?

227
0:12:00.715,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The latest research is showing

228
0:12:02.515,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that female and male brains do develop differently in the womb,

229
0:12:06.635,000 --> 0:12:09,000
possibly giving us females this innate sense of being a woman.

230
0:12:11.395,000 --> 0:12:12,000
On the other hand,

231
0:12:12.675,000 --> 0:12:16,000
maybe it's our shared sense of commonality that makes us women.

232
0:12:18.195,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We come in so many different shapes and sizes

233
0:12:20.555,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that asking what it means to be a woman may not be the right question.

234
0:12:24.995,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's like asking a calico cat what it means to be a calico cat.

235
0:12:29.622,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Maybe becoming a woman means accepting ourselves

236
0:12:34.475,000 --> 0:12:35,000
for who we really are

237
0:12:36.315,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and acknowledging the same in each other.

238
0:12:39.875,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I see you.

239
0:12:41.635,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And you've just seen me.

240
0:12:44.635,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Applause and cheers)

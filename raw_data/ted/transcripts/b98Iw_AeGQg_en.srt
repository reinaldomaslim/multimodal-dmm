1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My wife sent me a message,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Whoa, earthquake,"

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and then disappeared for 25 minutes.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It was 25 minutes of absolute terror

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that thousands of people across the U.S. felt.

7
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was afraid of a tsunami;

8
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
what I didn't realize

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
was there was a greater terror in Haiti,

10
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and that was building collapse.

11
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We've all seen the photos

12
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of the collapsed buildings in Haiti.

13
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
These are shots my wife took

14
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
a couple days after the quake,

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.

16
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This is the national palace --

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the equivalent of the White House.

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean

19
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
at peak shopping time.

20
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is a nurses' college --

21
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
there are 300 nurses studying.

22
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The general hospital right next door

23
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
emerged largely unscathed.

24
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.

25
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We have all heard

26
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
about the tremendous human loss

27
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the earthquake in Haiti,

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but we haven't heard enough

29
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
about why all those lives were lost.

30
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We haven't heard about

31
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
why the buildings failed.

32
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
After all, it was the buildings,

33
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
not the earthquake,

34
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that killed 220,000 people,

35
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that injured 330,000,

36
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that displaced 1.3 million people,

37
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that cut off food

38
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and water and supplies

39
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
for an entire nation.

40
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster

41
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in decades,

42
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and it was not a natural disaster --

43
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it was a disaster of engineering.

44
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
AIDG has worked in Haiti

45
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
since 2007,

46
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
providing engineering and business support

47
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to small businesses.

48
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers

49
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to figure out why the buildings collapsed,

50
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to examine what was safe and what wasn't.

51
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Working with MINUSTAH,

52
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which is the U.N. mission in Haiti,

53
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
with the Ministry of Public Works,

54
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
with different NGOs,

55
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we inspected over 1,500 buildings.

56
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We inspected schools

57
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and private residencies.

58
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We inspected medical centers

59
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and food warehouses.

60
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We inspected government buildings.

61
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is the Ministry of Justice.

62
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Behind that door

63
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is the National Judicial Archives.

64
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault --

65
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who's the director

66
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research

67
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
at the University of Buffalo --

68
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
was examining it to see if it was safe

69
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to recover the archives.

70
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Andre told me,

71
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
after seeing these buildings fail

72
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
again and again in the same way,

73
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that there is no new research here.

74
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
There is nothing here that we don't know.

75
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The failure points were the same:

76
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --

77
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that's a roof slab hanging off the building --

78
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
cantilevered structures,

79
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
or structures that were asymmetric,

80
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that shook violently and came down,

81
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
poor building materials,

82
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
not enough concrete,

83
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
not enough compression in the blocks,

84
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
rebar that was smooth,

85
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.

86
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now there's a solution

87
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to all these problems.

88
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And we know how to build properly.

89
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The proof of this came in Chile,

90
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
almost a month later,

91
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
when 8.8 magnitude earthquake

92
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
hit Chile.

93
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
That is 500 times

94
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the power of the 7.0

95
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that hit Port-au-Prince --

96
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
500 times the power,

97
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
yet only under a thousand casualties.

98
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Adjusted for population density,

99
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that is less than one percent

100
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
of the impact of the Haitian quake.

101
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
What was the difference

102
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
between Chile and Haiti?

103
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Seismic standards

104
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and confined masonry,

105
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
where the building acts as a whole --

106
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
walls and columns

107
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and roofs and slabs

108
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
tied together to support each other --

109
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.

110
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
If you look at this building in Chile,

111
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it's ripped in half,

112
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but it's not a pile of rubble.

113
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Chileans have been building with confined masonry

114
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
for decades.

115
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,

116
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Architecture for Humanity,

117
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to bring more confined masonry training

118
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
into Haiti.

119
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is Xantus Daniel;

120
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
he's a mason,

121
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
just a general construction worker, not a foreman,

122
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
who took one of our trainings.

123
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
On his last job he was working with his boss,

124
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and they started pouring the columns wrong.

125
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
He took his boss aside,

126
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.

127
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.

128
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It won't cost us any more

129
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to do it the right way."

130
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And they redid that building.

131
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They tied the rebar right,

132
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
they poured the columns right,

133
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and that building will be safe.

134
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And every building

135
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that they build going forward

136
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
will be safe.

137
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
To make sure these buildings are safe,

138
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it's not going to take policy --

139
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it's going to take reaching out

140
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to the masons on the ground

141
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and helping them learn the proper techniques.

142
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now there are many groups doing this.

143
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And the fellow in the vest there,

144
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Craig Toten,

145
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
he has pushed forward

146
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.

147
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Through Haiti Rewired,

148
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,

149
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
AIDG,

150
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
there is the possibility

151
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to reach out

152
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons

153
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
across the country

154
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and create a movement of proper building.

155
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
If you reach out to the people on the ground

156
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in this collaborative way

157
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it's extremely affordable.

158
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
For the billions spent on reconstruction,

159
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you can train masons

160
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
for dollars on every house

161
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that they end up building over their lifetime.

162
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Ultimately, there are two ways

163
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that you can rebuild Haiti;

164
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the way at the top

165
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.

166
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The way at the top

167
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is a poorly constructed building

168
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that will fail.

169
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,

170
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
where the walls are tied together,

171
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the building is symmetric,

172
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and it will stand up to an earthquake.

173
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
For all the disaster,

174
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
there is an opportunity here

175
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to build better houses

176
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
for the next generation,

177
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
so that when the next earthquake hits,

178
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it is a disaster --

179
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but not a tragedy.

180
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Applause)

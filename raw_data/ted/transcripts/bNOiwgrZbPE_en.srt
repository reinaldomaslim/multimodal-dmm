2
0:00:13.295,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Good morning!

3
0:00:15.34,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Are you awake?

4
0:00:18.679,000 --> 0:00:2,000
They took my name tag, but I wanted to ask you,

5
0:00:21.183,000 --> 0:00:23,000
did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic?

6
0:00:23.9,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Anyone! No one? All right, no problem.

7
0:00:29.529,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Once upon a time, not long ago,

8
0:00:33.632,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend, ordering food.

9
0:00:38.477,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So I looked at the waiter and said,

10
0:00:42.087,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"Do you have a menu (Arabic)?"

11
0:00:45.683,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He looked at me strangely, thinking that he misheard.

12
0:00:49.633,000 --> 0:00:51,000
He said, "Sorry? (English)."

13
0:00:52.132,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I said, "The menu (Arabic), please."

14
0:00:56.11,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He replied, "Don't you know what they call it?"

15
0:00:59.714,000 --> 0:01:,000
"I do."

16
0:01:01.133,000 --> 0:01:04,000
He said, "No! It's called "menu" (English), or "menu" (French)."

17
0:01:04.688,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Is the French pronunciation correct?

18
0:01:06.663,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"Come, come, take care of this one!" said the waiter.

19
0:01:09.123,000 --> 0:01:13,000
He was disgusted when talking to me, as if he was saying to himself,

20
0:01:13.458,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"If this was the last girl on Earth, I wouldn't look at her!"

21
0:01:17.45,000 --> 0:01:19,000
What's the meaning of saying "menu" in Arabic?

22
0:01:19.578,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward

23
0:01:28.323,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and ignorant.

24
0:01:30.82,000 --> 0:01:35,000
How could she speak that way?

25
0:01:36.346,000 --> 0:01:38,000
At that moment, I started thinking.

26
0:01:39.059,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It made me mad.

27
0:01:40.152,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It definitely hurts!

28
0:01:41.326,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country?

29
0:01:44.441,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Where could this happen?

30
0:01:46.392,000 --> 0:01:49,000
How did we get here?

31
0:01:49.732,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Well, while we are here, there are many people like me,

32
0:01:53.674,000 --> 0:01:56,000
who would reach a stage in their lives, where they involuntarily give up

33
0:01:57.132,000 --> 0:01:59,000
everything that has happened to them in the past,

34
0:01:59.42,000 --> 0:02:01,000
just so they can say that they're modern

35
0:02:01.699,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and civilized.

36
0:02:03.92,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Should I forget all my culture, thoughts,

37
0:02:06.835,000 --> 0:02:1,000
intellect and all my memories?

38
0:02:11.69,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war!

39
0:02:15.118,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform?

40
0:02:20.423,000 --> 0:02:23,000
To be one of them?

41
0:02:23.878,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Where's the logic in that?

42
0:02:26.132,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Despite all that, I tried to understand him.

43
0:02:29.78,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me.

44
0:02:35.946,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs.

45
0:02:39.902,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's not a language for science,

46
0:02:41.764,000 --> 0:02:42,000
research,

47
0:02:43.275,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a language we're used to in universities,

48
0:02:45.294,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a language we use in the workplace,

49
0:02:47.694,000 --> 0:02:53,000
a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project,

50
0:02:53.888,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport.

51
0:02:56.555,000 --> 0:02:58,000
If we did so, they'd strip us of our clothes.

52
0:03:00.78,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Where can I use it, then? We could all ask this question!

53
0:03:04.408,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So, you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so?

54
0:03:08.66,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is one reality.

55
0:03:11.24,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about.

56
0:03:16.878,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Arabic is the mother tongue.

57
0:03:19.867,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Research says that mastery of other languages

58
0:03:25.718,000 --> 0:03:28,000
demands mastery of the mother tongue.

59
0:03:29.679,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages.

60
0:03:36.514,000 --> 0:03:37,000
How?

61
0:03:38.199,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Gibran Khalil Gibran,

62
0:03:40.489,000 --> 0:03:43,000
when he first started writing, he used Arabic.

63
0:03:44.54,000 --> 0:03:5,000
All his ideas, imagination and philosophy

64
0:03:51.122,000 --> 0:03:54,000
were inspired by this little boy in the village

65
0:03:54.869,000 --> 0:03:56,000
where he grew up, smelling a specific smell,

66
0:03:57.15,000 --> 0:03:58,000
hearing a specific voice,

67
0:03:58.421,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and thinking a specific thought.

68
0:04:00.206,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So, when he started writing in English, he had enough baggage.

69
0:04:04.917,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Even when he wrote in English,

70
0:04:07.265,000 --> 0:04:1,000
when you read his writings in English, you smell the same smell,

71
0:04:11.157,000 --> 0:04:12,000
sense the same feeling.

72
0:04:13.147,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You can imagine that that's him writing in English,

73
0:04:16.813,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon.

74
0:04:22.73,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So, this is an example no one can argue with.

75
0:04:29.401,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Second, it's often said that if you want to kill a nation,

76
0:04:34.06,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the only way to kill a nation,

77
0:04:37.006,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is to kill its language.

78
0:04:38.875,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of.

79
0:04:44.352,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese, all these nations are aware of this.

80
0:04:50.876,000 --> 0:04:53,000
That's why they legislate to protect their language.

81
0:04:54.842,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They make it sacred.

82
0:04:57.323,000 --> 0:05:02,000
That's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it.

83
0:05:03.34,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Do we know better than them?

84
0:05:06.116,000 --> 0:05:07,000
All right,

85
0:05:07.122,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we aren't from the developed world,

86
0:05:08.949,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet,

87
0:05:11.257,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and we would like to catch up with the civilized world.

88
0:05:15.181,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Countries that were once like us, but decided to strive for development,

89
0:05:19.514,000 --> 0:05:2,000
do research,

90
0:05:21.1,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and catch up with those countries,

91
0:05:22.994,000 --> 0:05:24,000
such as Turkey, Malaysia and others,

92
0:05:25.933,000 --> 0:05:28,000
they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder,

93
0:05:29.724,000 --> 0:05:32,000
protected it like a diamond.

94
0:05:33.131,000 --> 0:05:34,000
They kept it close to them.

95
0:05:34.69,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere

96
0:05:39.03,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and it's not labeled in Turkish,

97
0:05:41.616,000 --> 0:05:43,000
then it isn't a local product.

98
0:05:44.195,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You wouldn't believe it's a local product.

99
0:05:47.168,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They'd go back to being consumers,

100
0:05:49.8,000 --> 0:05:54,000
clueless consumers, like we are most of the time.

101
0:05:55.463,000 --> 0:06:,000
So, in order for them to innovate and produce, they had to protect their language.

102
0:06:03.187,000 --> 0:06:07,000
If I say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence (Arabic),"

103
0:06:08.101,000 --> 0:06:1,000
what does this remind you of?

104
0:06:12.625,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It doesn't ring a bell, does it?

105
0:06:14.819,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Regardless of the who, how and why.

106
0:06:19.58,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Language isn't just for conversing, just words coming out of our mouths.

107
0:06:25.798,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Language represents specific stages in our lives,

108
0:06:30.69,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and terminology that is linked to our emotions.

109
0:06:35.723,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So when we say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence,"

110
0:06:38.155,000 --> 0:06:41,000
each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind,

111
0:06:41.778,000 --> 0:06:43,000
there are specific feelings

112
0:06:44.444,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of a specific day in a specific historical period.

113
0:06:47.121,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Language isn't one, two or three words or letters put together.

114
0:06:50.765,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It's an idea inside that relates to how we think,

115
0:06:53.339,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and how we see each other and how others see us.

116
0:06:59.003,000 --> 0:07:,000
What is our intellect?

117
0:07:00.977,000 --> 0:07:02,000
How do you say whether this guy understands or not?

118
0:07:03.639,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So, if I say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence (English),"

119
0:07:12.164,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or if your son came up to you and said,

120
0:07:14.265,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"Dad, have you lived through the period of the freedom (English) slogan?"

121
0:07:18.971,000 --> 0:07:19,000
How would you feel?

122
0:07:21.741,000 --> 0:07:24,000
If you don't see a problem,

123
0:07:25.665,000 --> 0:07:28,000
then I'd better leave, and stop talking in vain.

124
0:07:29.334,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing.

125
0:07:35.25,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I have a francophone friend who's married to a French man.

126
0:07:40.946,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I asked her once how things were going.

127
0:07:44.253,000 --> 0:07:45,000
She said, "Everything is fine,

128
0:07:45.921,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but once, I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate

129
0:07:50.37,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him."

130
0:07:52.97,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

131
0:07:54.385,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

132
0:08:02.013,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The poor woman had mistakenly told him "toqborni,"

133
0:08:05.483,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him.

134
0:08:08.335,000 --> 0:08:11,000
He was puzzled by the thought: "How could anyone be this cruel?

135
0:08:12.093,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Does she want to commit suicide?

136
0:08:14.369,000 --> 0:08:16,000
'Bury me?' (English)"

137
0:08:17.085,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is one of the few examples.

138
0:08:19.623,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband,

139
0:08:22.772,000 --> 0:08:24,000
since he won't understand,

140
0:08:25.461,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and he's right not to; his way of thinking is different.

141
0:08:28.862,000 --> 0:08:31,000
She said to me, "He listens to Fairuz with me,

142
0:08:32.446,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and one night, I tried to translate for him

143
0:08:36.991,000 --> 0:08:39,000
so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz."

144
0:08:40.31,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The poor woman tried to translate this for him:

145
0:08:42.59,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"From them I extended my hands and stole you --"

146
0:08:46.755,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

147
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And here's the pickle:

148
0:08:49.405,000 --> 0:08:53,000
"And because you belong to them, I returned my hands and left you."

149
0:08:53.5,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

150
0:08:54.765,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Translate that for me.

151
0:08:56.14,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause)

152
0:09:03.804,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So, what have we done to protect the Arabic language?

153
0:09:08.129,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We turned this into a concern of the civil society,

154
0:09:11.495,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language.

155
0:09:14.279,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Even though many people told me, "Why do you bother?

156
0:09:17.644,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Forget about this headache and go have fun."

157
0:09:20.717,000 --> 0:09:21,000
No problem!

158
0:09:22.434,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says,

159
0:09:25.527,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West."

160
0:09:28.62,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We didn't say, "No! We do not accept this or that."

161
0:09:36.188,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We didn't adopt this style because that way, we wouldn't be understood.

162
0:09:41.203,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And when someone talks to me that way, I hate the Arabic language.

163
0:09:44.947,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We say--

164
0:09:46.359,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Applause)

165
0:09:49.271,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We want to change our reality,

166
0:09:51.703,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life.

167
0:09:56.655,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do.

168
0:10:01.95,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So, "I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West"

169
0:10:04.823,000 --> 0:10:05,000
has hit the spot.

170
0:10:06.476,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Something very easy, yet creative and persuasive.

171
0:10:10.579,000 --> 0:10:13,000
After that, we launched another campaign

172
0:10:14.277,000 --> 0:10:17,000
with scenes of letters on the ground.

173
0:10:17.795,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You've seen an example of it outside,

174
0:10:20.284,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape

175
0:10:24.666,000 --> 0:10:26,000
with "Don't kill your language!" written on it.

176
0:10:27.508,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Why? Seriously, don't kill your language.

177
0:10:31.212,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We really shouldn't kill our language.

178
0:10:34.266,000 --> 0:10:39,000
If we were to kill the language, we'd have to find an identity.

179
0:10:39.424,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We'd have to find an existence.

180
0:10:41.383,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We'd go back to the beginning.

181
0:10:43.768,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized.

182
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter.

183
0:10:57.62,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Photos of "cool" guys and girls.

184
0:11:00.263,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We are very cool!

185
0:11:02.904,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And to whoever might say, "Ha! You used an English word!"

186
0:11:07.278,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I say, "No! I adopt the word 'cool.'"

187
0:11:11.12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Let them object however they want, but give me a word that's nicer

188
0:11:14.895,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and matches the reality better.

189
0:11:17.591,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I will keep on saying "Internet"

190
0:11:19.565,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I wouldn't say: "I'm going to the world wide web"

191
0:11:22.399,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Laughs)

192
0:11:24.175,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Because it doesn't fit! We shouldn't kid ourselves.

193
0:11:27.686,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But to reach this point, we all have to be convinced

194
0:11:31.885,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger

195
0:11:34.02,000 --> 0:11:37,000
or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language,

196
0:11:37.356,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to control us or make us think and feel what they want.

197
0:11:43.685,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Creativity is the idea.

198
0:11:47.653,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So, if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on,

199
0:11:50.213,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we can be creative.

200
0:11:52.113,000 --> 0:11:55,000
At this moment, every one of you is a creative project.

201
0:11:55.95,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Creativity in your mother tongue is the path.

202
0:11:58.798,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Let's start from this moment.

203
0:12:02.534,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Let's write a novel or produce a short film.

204
0:12:04.596,000 --> 0:12:07,000
A single novel could make us global again.

205
0:12:07.934,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one.

206
0:12:12.38,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So, it's not true that there's no solution; there is a solution!

207
0:12:16.231,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But we have to know that, and be convinced that a solution exists,

208
0:12:20.23,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that we have a duty to be part of that solution.

209
0:12:23.929,000 --> 0:12:25,000
In conclusion, what can you do today?

210
0:12:26.836,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now, tweets, who's tweeting?

211
0:12:32.06,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Please, I beg of you, even though my time has finished,

212
0:12:37.43,000 --> 0:12:42,000
either Arabic, English, French or Chinese.

213
0:12:42.577,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers!

214
0:12:48.298,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Applause)

215
0:12:52.408,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It's a disaster! That's not a language.

216
0:12:55.866,000 --> 0:12:58,000
You'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language.

217
0:12:59.562,000 --> 0:13:01,000
It's not easy to come back from such a place and rise.

218
0:13:02.724,000 --> 0:13:04,000
That's the first thing we can do.

219
0:13:04.896,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Second, there are many other things that we can do.

220
0:13:07.499,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We're not here today to convince each other.

221
0:13:09.904,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language.

222
0:13:13.438,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Now I will tell you a secret.

223
0:13:17.303,000 --> 0:13:22,000
A baby first identifies its father

224
0:13:22.49,000 --> 0:13:24,000
through language.

225
0:13:24.557,000 --> 0:13:29,000
When my daughter is born, I'll tell her, "This is your father, honey (Arabic)."

226
0:13:29.796,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I wouldn't say, "This is your dad, honey (English)."

227
0:13:34.585,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And in the supermarket, I promise my daughter Noor,

228
0:13:37.77,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that if she says to me, "Thanks (Arabic),"

229
0:13:40.086,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I won't say, "Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'" and hope no one has heard her.

230
0:13:44.813,000 --> 0:13:47,000
(Applause)

231
0:13:55.98,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Let's get rid of this cultural cringe.

232
0:14:01.297,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Applause)

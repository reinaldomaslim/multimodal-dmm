0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Unless we do something to prevent it,

3
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic

4
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of neurologic diseases on a global scale.

5
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
A cheery thought.

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
On this map, every country that’s colored blue

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This is the world we live in.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And this is the world your children will live in.

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
has looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It’s already flattening out.

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
By 2050, it’s going to be a column and will start to invert.

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is why it’s happening.

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The average lifespan’s more than doubled since 1840,

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and it’s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And this is why that’s not entirely a good thing:

18
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer’s

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or Parkinson’s disease will increase exponentially.

20
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
By 2050, there’ll be about 32 million people in the United States

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it,

22
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
half of them will have Alzheimer’s disease

23
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and three million more will have Parkinson’s disease.

24
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Right now, those and other neurologic diseases --

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
for which we have no cure or prevention --

26
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.

27
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.

28
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Alzheimer’s disease starts when a protein

29
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that should be folded up properly

30
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
misfolds into a kind of demented origami.

31
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs

32
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that function like molecular Scotch tape,

33
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to hold the protein into its proper shape.

34
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That would keep it from forming the tangles

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.

36
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases

37
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which affect very different parts of the brain

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
also show tangles of misfolded protein,

39
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
which suggests that the approach might be a general one,

40
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases,

41
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
not just Alzheimer’s disease.

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here,

43
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because people with neurologic diseases

44
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
have a very low incidence of most cancers.

45
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And this is a connection that most people aren’t pursuing right now,

46
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but which we’re fascinated by.

47
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area

48
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is being funded by private philanthropies.

49
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here,

50
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I’m afraid.

51
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
In the meantime, while we’re waiting for all these things to happen,

52
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
here’s what you can do for yourself.

53
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson’s disease,

54
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why.

55
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson’s disease.

56
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.

57
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s disease,

58
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect

59
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

60
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You should also keep your blood pressure down,

61
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because chronic high blood pressure

62
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.

63
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma,

64
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye.

65
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects,

66
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"use it or lose it" applies,

67
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
so you want to stay mentally stimulated.

68
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But hey, you’re listening to me.

69
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So you’ve got that covered.

70
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And one final thing. Wish people like me luck, okay?

71
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Because the clock is ticking for all of us.

72
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Thank you.

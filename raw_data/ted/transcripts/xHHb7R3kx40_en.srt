0:00:12.968,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hello, everyone.

2
0:00:15.562,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's a bit funny, because I did write that humans will become digital,

3
0:00:20.522,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but I didn't think it will happen so fast

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and that it will happen to me.

5
0:00:25.649,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But here I am, as a digital avatar,

6
0:00:28.355,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and here you are, so let's start.

7
0:00:32.07,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And let's start with a question.

8
0:00:34.823,000 --> 0:00:37,000
How many fascists are there in the audience today?

9
0:00:38.381,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:39.855,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Well, it's a bit difficult to say,

11
0:00:42.228,000 --> 0:00:45,000
because we've forgotten what fascism is.

12
0:00:46.498,000 --> 0:00:48,000
People now use the term "fascist"

13
0:00:49.101,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as a kind of general-purpose abuse.

14
0:00:52.133,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Or they confuse fascism with nationalism.

15
0:00:56.863,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So let's take a few minutes to clarify what fascism actually is,

16
0:01:02.275,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and how it is different from nationalism.

17
0:01:05.838,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The milder forms of nationalism have been among the most benevolent

18
0:01:10.903,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of human creations.

19
0:01:12.99,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Nations are communities of millions of strangers

20
0:01:17.125,000 --> 0:01:18,000
who don't really know each other.

21
0:01:19.489,000 --> 0:01:22,000
For example, I don't know the eight million people

22
0:01:22.918,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who share my Israeli citizenship.

23
0:01:26.109,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But thanks to nationalism,

24
0:01:28.3,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we can all care about one another and cooperate effectively.

25
0:01:32.45,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This is very good.

26
0:01:34.093,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Some people, like John Lennon, imagine that without nationalism,

27
0:01:39.855,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the world will be a peaceful paradise.

28
0:01:44.01,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But far more likely,

29
0:01:45.462,000 --> 0:01:49,000
without nationalism, we would have been living in tribal chaos.

30
0:01:50.684,000 --> 0:01:55,000
If you look today at the most prosperous and peaceful countries in the world,

31
0:01:55.843,000 --> 0:01:59,000
countries like Sweden and Switzerland and Japan,

32
0:02:00.157,000 --> 0:02:04,000
you will see that they have a very strong sense of nationalism.

33
0:02:05.75,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In contrast, countries that lack a strong sense of nationalism,

34
0:02:09.934,000 --> 0:02:12,000
like Congo and Somalia and Afghanistan,

35
0:02:13.379,000 --> 0:02:15,000
tend to be violent and poor.

36
0:02:16.855,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So what is fascism, and how is it different from nationalism?

37
0:02:21.941,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Well, nationalism tells me that my nation is unique,

38
0:02:27.368,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and that I have special obligations towards my nation.

39
0:02:31.641,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Fascism, in contrast, tells me that my nation is supreme,

40
0:02:37.871,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and that I have exclusive obligations towards it.

41
0:02:42.895,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I don't need to care about anybody or anything other than my nation.

42
0:02:48.465,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Usually, of course, people have many identities

43
0:02:52.092,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and loyalties to different groups.

44
0:02:55.036,000 --> 0:02:59,000
For example, I can be a good patriot, loyal to my country,

45
0:02:59.864,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and at the same time, be loyal to my family,

46
0:03:03.126,000 --> 0:03:05,000
my neighborhood, my profession,

47
0:03:05.511,000 --> 0:03:06,000
humankind as a whole,

48
0:03:06.995,000 --> 0:03:07,000
truth and beauty.

49
0:03:09.37,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Of course, when I have different identities and loyalties,

50
0:03:13.665,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it sometimes creates conflicts and complications.

51
0:03:17.506,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But, well, who ever told you that life was easy?

52
0:03:21.649,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Life is complicated.

53
0:03:23.713,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Deal with it.

54
0:03:26.331,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Fascism is what happens when people try to ignore the complications

55
0:03:32.355,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and to make life too easy for themselves.

56
0:03:36.128,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Fascism denies all identities except the national identity

57
0:03:41.724,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and insists that I have obligations only towards my nation.

58
0:03:47.421,000 --> 0:03:51,000
If my nation demands that I sacrifice my family,

59
0:03:51.549,000 --> 0:03:53,000
then I will sacrifice my family.

60
0:03:54.009,000 --> 0:03:58,000
If the nation demands that I kill millions of people,

61
0:03:58.307,000 --> 0:04:,000
then I will kill millions of people.

62
0:04:01.442,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And if my nation demands that I betray truth and beauty,

63
0:04:07.541,000 --> 0:04:1,000
then I should betray truth and beauty.

64
0:04:11.587,000 --> 0:04:15,000
For example, how does a fascist evaluate art?

65
0:04:16.615,000 --> 0:04:21,000
How does a fascist decide whether a movie is a good movie or a bad movie?

66
0:04:22.728,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Well, it's very, very, very simple.

67
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
There is really just one yardstick:

68
0:04:29.593,000 --> 0:04:32,000
if the movie serves the interests of the nation,

69
0:04:33.093,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it's a good movie;

70
0:04:34.561,000 --> 0:04:37,000
if the movie doesn't serve the interests of the nation,

71
0:04:37.768,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it's a bad movie.

72
0:04:39.014,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That's it.

73
0:04:40.496,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Similarly, how does a fascist decide what to teach kids in school?

74
0:04:45.877,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Again, it's very simple.

75
0:04:47.988,000 --> 0:04:48,000
There is just one yardstick:

76
0:04:49.957,000 --> 0:04:53,000
you teach the kids whatever serves the interests of the nation.

77
0:04:55.323,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The truth doesn't matter at all.

78
0:05:00.372,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now, the horrors of the Second World War and of the Holocaust remind us

79
0:05:05.822,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of the terrible consequences of this way of thinking.

80
0:05:10.508,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But usually, when we talk about the ills of fascism,

81
0:05:15.077,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we do so in an ineffective way,

82
0:05:18.061,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because we tend to depict fascism as a hideous monster,

83
0:05:22.823,000 --> 0:05:25,000
without really explaining what was so seductive about it.

84
0:05:27.284,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It's a bit like these Hollywood movies that depict the bad guys --

85
0:05:32.022,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Voldemort or Sauron or Darth Vader --

86
0:05:36.069,000 --> 0:05:38,000
as ugly and mean and cruel.

87
0:05:38.725,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They're cruel even to their own supporters.

88
0:05:41.67,000 --> 0:05:44,000
When I see these movies, I never understand --

89
0:05:45.315,000 --> 0:05:51,000
why would anybody be tempted to follow a disgusting creep like Voldemort?

90
0:05:52.895,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The problem with evil is that in real life,

91
0:05:56.435,000 --> 0:05:58,000
evil doesn't necessarily look ugly.

92
0:05:59.688,000 --> 0:06:,000
It can look very beautiful.

93
0:06:02.354,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is something that Christianity knew very well,

94
0:06:05.101,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which is why in Christian art, as [opposed to] Hollywood,

95
0:06:08.831,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Satan is usually depicted as a gorgeous hunk.

96
0:06:13.259,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This is why it's so difficult to resist the temptations of Satan,

97
0:06:17.879,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and why it is also difficult to resist the temptations of fascism.

98
0:06:22.98,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Fascism makes people see themselves

99
0:06:25.726,000 --> 0:06:3,000
as belonging to the most beautiful and most important thing in the world --

100
0:06:30.993,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the nation.

101
0:06:32.319,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And then people think,

102
0:06:33.689,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"Well, they taught us that fascism is ugly.

103
0:06:37.442,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But when I look in the mirror, I see something very beautiful,

104
0:06:40.49,000 --> 0:06:42,000
so I can't be a fascist, right?"

105
0:06:43.022,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Wrong.

106
0:06:44.197,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's the problem with fascism.

107
0:06:45.768,000 --> 0:06:47,000
When you look in the fascist mirror,

108
0:06:48.411,000 --> 0:06:52,000
you see yourself as far more beautiful than you really are.

109
0:06:53.371,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In the 1930s, when Germans looked in the fascist mirror,

110
0:06:57.688,000 --> 0:07:01,000
they saw Germany as the most beautiful thing in the world.

111
0:07:02.244,000 --> 0:07:05,000
If today, Russians look in the fascist mirror,

112
0:07:05.704,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they will see Russia as the most beautiful thing in the world.

113
0:07:09.577,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And if Israelis look in the fascist mirror,

114
0:07:12.729,000 --> 0:07:16,000
they will see Israel as the most beautiful thing in the world.

115
0:07:18.657,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This does not mean that we are now facing a rerun of the 1930s.

116
0:07:24.304,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Fascism and dictatorships might come back,

117
0:07:27.803,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but they will come back in a new form,

118
0:07:31.066,000 --> 0:07:33,000
a form which is much more relevant

119
0:07:33.831,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to the new technological realities of the 21st century.

120
0:07:38.538,000 --> 0:07:39,000
In ancient times,

121
0:07:40.109,000 --> 0:07:44,000
land was the most important asset in the world.

122
0:07:44.911,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Politics, therefore, was the struggle to control land.

123
0:07:49.141,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And dictatorship meant that all the land was owned by a single ruler

124
0:07:55.025,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or by a small oligarch.

125
0:07:57.827,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And in the modern age, machines became more important than land.

126
0:08:03.347,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Politics became the struggle to control the machines.

127
0:08:07.354,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And dictatorship meant

128
0:08:09.374,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that too many of the machines became concentrated

129
0:08:13.308,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in the hands of the government or of a small elite.

130
0:08:17.109,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Now data is replacing both land and machines

131
0:08:21.839,000 --> 0:08:23,000
as the most important asset.

132
0:08:24.6,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Politics becomes the struggle to control the flows of data.

133
0:08:29.964,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And dictatorship now means

134
0:08:32.696,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that too much data is being concentrated in the hands of the government

135
0:08:38.5,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or of a small elite.

136
0:08:40.871,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The greatest danger that now faces liberal democracy

137
0:08:45.807,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is that the revolution in information technology

138
0:08:49.101,000 --> 0:08:53,000
will make dictatorships more efficient than democracies.

139
0:08:54.76,000 --> 0:08:55,000
In the 20th century,

140
0:08:56.403,000 --> 0:09:,000
democracy and capitalism defeated fascism and communism

141
0:09:01.387,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because democracy was better at processing data and making decisions.

142
0:09:07.319,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Given 20th-century technology,

143
0:09:09.709,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it was simply inefficient to try and concentrate too much data

144
0:09:15.768,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and too much power in one place.

145
0:09:19.244,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But it is not a law of nature

146
0:09:23.751,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that centralized data processing is always less efficient

147
0:09:29.379,000 --> 0:09:31,000
than distributed data processing.

148
0:09:32.605,000 --> 0:09:35,000
With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning,

149
0:09:36.066,000 --> 0:09:41,000
it might become feasible to process enormous amounts of information

150
0:09:41.927,000 --> 0:09:43,000
very efficiently in one place,

151
0:09:44.561,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to take all the decisions in one place,

152
0:09:47.776,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and then centralized data processing will be more efficient

153
0:09:52.22,000 --> 0:09:54,000
than distributed data processing.

154
0:09:55.053,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And then the main handicap of authoritarian regimes

155
0:09:58.837,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in the 20th century --

156
0:10:00.498,000 --> 0:10:04,000
their attempt to concentrate all the information in one place --

157
0:10:05.038,000 --> 0:10:08,000
it will become their greatest advantage.

158
0:10:10.768,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Another technological danger that threatens the future of democracy

159
0:10:15.699,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is the merger of information technology with biotechnology,

160
0:10:20.882,000 --> 0:10:24,000
which might result in the creation of algorithms

161
0:10:24.911,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that know me better than I know myself.

162
0:10:29.688,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And once you have such algorithms,

163
0:10:31.792,000 --> 0:10:33,000
an external system, like the government,

164
0:10:34.665,000 --> 0:10:37,000
cannot just predict my decisions,

165
0:10:38.213,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it can also manipulate my feelings, my emotions.

166
0:10:42.641,000 --> 0:10:47,000
A dictator may not be able to provide me with good health care,

167
0:10:47.91,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but he will be able to make me love him

168
0:10:51.307,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and to make me hate the opposition.

169
0:10:55.037,000 --> 0:11:,000
Democracy will find it difficult to survive such a development

170
0:11:00.524,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because, in the end,

171
0:11:02.698,000 --> 0:11:06,000
democracy is not based on human rationality;

172
0:11:06.849,000 --> 0:11:08,000
it's based on human feelings.

173
0:11:10.355,000 --> 0:11:12,000
During elections and referendums,

174
0:11:12.879,000 --> 0:11:14,000
you're not being asked, "What do you think?"

175
0:11:15.998,000 --> 0:11:18,000
You're actually being asked, "How do you feel?"

176
0:11:20.228,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And if somebody can manipulate your emotions effectively,

177
0:11:24.879,000 --> 0:11:27,000
democracy will become an emotional puppet show.

178
0:11:30.006,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So what can we do to prevent the return of fascism

179
0:11:34.545,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and the rise of new dictatorships?

180
0:11:37.99,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The number one question that we face is: Who controls the data?

181
0:11:44.823,000 --> 0:11:45,000
If you are an engineer,

182
0:11:46.522,000 --> 0:11:49,000
then find ways to prevent too much data

183
0:11:50.514,000 --> 0:11:52,000
from being concentrated in too few hands.

184
0:11:53.752,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And find ways to make sure

185
0:11:56.72,000 --> 0:12:,000
the distributed data processing is at least as efficient

186
0:12:01.157,000 --> 0:12:03,000
as centralized data processing.

187
0:12:04.077,000 --> 0:12:07,000
This will be the best safeguard for democracy.

188
0:12:07.942,000 --> 0:12:1,000
As for the rest of us who are not engineers,

189
0:12:11.292,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the number one question facing us

190
0:12:14.76,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is how not to allow ourselves to be manipulated

191
0:12:19.431,000 --> 0:12:21,000
by those who control the data.

192
0:12:23.387,000 --> 0:12:27,000
The enemies of liberal democracy, they have a method.

193
0:12:27.919,000 --> 0:12:29,000
They hack our feelings.

194
0:12:30.315,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Not our emails, not our bank accounts --

195
0:12:32.791,000 --> 0:12:37,000
they hack our feelings of fear and hate and vanity,

196
0:12:38.022,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and then use these feelings

197
0:12:40.474,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to polarize and destroy democracy from within.

198
0:12:44.903,000 --> 0:12:45,000
This is actually a method

199
0:12:46.847,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that Silicon Valley pioneered in order to sell us products.

200
0:12:52.381,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But now, the enemies of democracy are using this very method

201
0:12:57.427,000 --> 0:13:,000
to sell us fear and hate and vanity.

202
0:13:01.863,000 --> 0:13:04,000
They cannot create these feelings out of nothing.

203
0:13:06.212,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So they get to know our own preexisting weaknesses.

204
0:13:10.403,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And then use them against us.

205
0:13:13.482,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And it is therefore the responsibility of all of us

206
0:13:17.014,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to get to know our weaknesses

207
0:13:19.672,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and make sure that they do not become a weapon

208
0:13:23.331,000 --> 0:13:25,000
in the hands of the enemies of democracy.

209
0:13:27.315,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Getting to know our own weaknesses

210
0:13:29.887,000 --> 0:13:34,000
will also help us to avoid the trap of the fascist mirror.

211
0:13:36.204,000 --> 0:13:4,000
As we explained earlier, fascism exploits our vanity.

212
0:13:40.805,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It makes us see ourselves as far more beautiful than we really are.

213
0:13:46.575,000 --> 0:13:47,000
This is the seduction.

214
0:13:48.424,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But if you really know yourself,

215
0:13:50.895,000 --> 0:13:53,000
you will not fall for this kind of flattery.

216
0:13:54.879,000 --> 0:13:58,000
If somebody puts a mirror in front of your eyes

217
0:13:58.966,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that hides all your ugly bits and makes you see yourself

218
0:14:04.05,000 --> 0:14:08,000
as far more beautiful and far more important

219
0:14:08.358,000 --> 0:14:09,000
than you really are,

220
0:14:09.973,000 --> 0:14:11,000
just break that mirror.

221
0:14:13.696,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Thank you.

222
0:14:14.871,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Applause)

223
0:14:22.677,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Chris Anderson: Yuval, thank you.

224
0:14:24.333,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Goodness me.

225
0:14:25.958,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It's so nice to see you again.

226
0:14:27.922,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So, if I understand you right,

227
0:14:29.537,000 --> 0:14:31,000
you're alerting us to two big dangers here.

228
0:14:32.228,000 --> 0:14:36,000
One is the possible resurgence of a seductive form of fascism,

229
0:14:36.744,000 --> 0:14:4,000
but close to that, dictatorships that may not exactly be fascistic,

230
0:14:41.022,000 --> 0:14:43,000
but control all the data.

231
0:14:43.609,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I wonder if there's a third concern

232
0:14:45.729,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that some people here have already expressed,

233
0:14:47.871,000 --> 0:14:51,000
which is where, not governments, but big corporations control all our data.

234
0:14:52.792,000 --> 0:14:53,000
What do you call that,

235
0:14:54.125,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and how worried should we be about that?

236
0:14:56.536,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Yuval Noah Harari: Well, in the end, there isn't such a big difference

237
0:14:59.899,000 --> 0:15:01,000
between the corporations and the governments,

238
0:15:02.349,000 --> 0:15:05,000
because, as I said, the questions is: Who controls the data?

239
0:15:05.793,000 --> 0:15:06,000
This is the real government.

240
0:15:07.212,000 --> 0:15:09,000
If you call it a corporation or a government --

241
0:15:09.68,000 --> 0:15:12,000
if it's a corporation and it really controls the data,

242
0:15:12.859,000 --> 0:15:13,000
this is our real government.

243
0:15:14.811,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So the difference is more apparent than real.

244
0:15:18.529,000 --> 0:15:2,000
CA: But somehow, at least with corporations,

245
0:15:21.411,000 --> 0:15:24,000
you can imagine market mechanisms where they can be taken down.

246
0:15:24.954,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I mean, if consumers just decide

247
0:15:26.895,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that the company is no longer operating in their interest,

248
0:15:29.673,000 --> 0:15:3,000
it does open the door to another market.

249
0:15:31.61,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It seems easier to imagine that

250
0:15:33.18,000 --> 0:15:36,000
than, say, citizens rising up and taking down a government

251
0:15:36.355,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that is in control of everything.

252
0:15:37.991,000 --> 0:15:38,000
YNH: Well, we are not there yet,

253
0:15:39.57,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but again, if a corporation really knows you better than you know yourself --

254
0:15:44.752,000 --> 0:15:49,000
at least that it can manipulate your own deepest emotions and desires,

255
0:15:50.03,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and you won't even realize --

256
0:15:51.72,000 --> 0:15:53,000
you will think this is your authentic self.

257
0:15:54.768,000 --> 0:15:58,000
So in theory, yes, in theory, you can rise against a corporation,

258
0:15:58.847,000 --> 0:16:01,000
just as, in theory, you can rise against a dictatorship.

259
0:16:02.982,000 --> 0:16:05,000
But in practice, it is extremely difficult.

260
0:16:07.281,000 --> 0:16:11,000
CA: So in "Homo Deus," you argue that this would be the century

261
0:16:11.387,000 --> 0:16:14,000
when humans kind of became gods,

262
0:16:14.822,000 --> 0:16:16,000
either through development of artificial intelligence

263
0:16:17.839,000 --> 0:16:19,000
or through genetic engineering.

264
0:16:20.792,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Has this prospect of political system shift, collapse

265
0:16:26.284,000 --> 0:16:28,000
impacted your view on that possibility?

266
0:16:29.553,000 --> 0:16:32,000
YNH: Well, I think it makes it even more likely,

267
0:16:32.672,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and more likely that it will happen faster,

268
0:16:35.625,000 --> 0:16:4,000
because in times of crisis, people are willing to take risks

269
0:16:40.672,000 --> 0:16:41,000
that they wouldn't otherwise take.

270
0:16:42.68,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And people are willing to try

271
0:16:45.522,000 --> 0:16:48,000
all kinds of high-risk, high-gain technologies.

272
0:16:49.76,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So these kinds of crises might serve the same function

273
0:16:54.014,000 --> 0:16:57,000
as the two world wars in the 20th century.

274
0:16:57.252,000 --> 0:17:,000
The two world wars greatly accelerated

275
0:17:00.488,000 --> 0:17:03,000
the development of new and dangerous technologies.

276
0:17:04.124,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And the same thing might happen in the 21st century.

277
0:17:07.721,000 --> 0:17:1,000
I mean, you need to be a little crazy to run too fast,

278
0:17:11.642,000 --> 0:17:13,000
let's say, with genetic engineering.

279
0:17:13.991,000 --> 0:17:16,000
But now you have more and more crazy people

280
0:17:17.125,000 --> 0:17:19,000
in charge of different countries in the world,

281
0:17:19.83,000 --> 0:17:22,000
so the chances are getting higher, not lower.

282
0:17:23.647,000 --> 0:17:26,000
CA: So, putting it all together, Yuval, you've got this unique vision.

283
0:17:27.036,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Roll the clock forward 30 years.

284
0:17:28.647,000 --> 0:17:31,000
What's your guess -- does humanity just somehow scrape through,

285
0:17:31.934,000 --> 0:17:34,000
look back and say, "Wow, that was a close thing. We did it!"

286
0:17:35.093,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Or not?

287
0:17:36.553,000 --> 0:17:39,000
YNH: So far, we've managed to overcome all the previous crises.

288
0:17:40.425,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And especially if you look at liberal democracy

289
0:17:43.268,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and you think things are bad now,

290
0:17:46.236,000 --> 0:17:52,000
just remember how much worse things looked in 1938 or in 1968.

291
0:17:52.726,000 --> 0:17:54,000
So this is really nothing, this is just a small crisis.

292
0:17:56.167,000 --> 0:17:57,000
But you can never know,

293
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
because, as a historian,

294
0:18:00.315,000 --> 0:18:04,000
I know that you should never underestimate human stupidity.

295
0:18:05.113,000 --> 0:18:06,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

296
0:18:06.292,000 --> 0:18:1,000
It is one of the most powerful forces that shape history.

297
0:18:11.433,000 --> 0:18:13,000
CA: Yuval, it's been an absolute delight to have you with us.

298
0:18:14.322,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Thank you for making the virtual trip.

299
0:18:16.163,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Have a great evening there in Tel Aviv.

300
0:18:18.06,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Yuval Harari!

301
0:18:19.235,000 --> 0:18:2,000
YNH: Thank you very much.

302
0:18:20.635,000 --> 0:18:21,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The two places

2
0:00:16.12,000 --> 0:00:19,000
where I feel most free

3
0:00:20.68,000 --> 0:00:22,000
aren't actually places.

4
0:00:22.96,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They're moments.

5
0:00:25.64,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The first is inside of dance.

6
0:00:29.36,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Somewhere between rising up against gravity

7
0:00:32.6,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and the feeling that the air beneath me

8
0:00:36.12,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is falling in love with my body's weight.

9
0:00:39.76,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm dancing and the air is carrying me

10
0:00:43.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
like I might never come down.

11
0:00:46.92,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The second place that I feel free

12
0:00:48.8,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is after scoring a goal on the soccer pitch.

13
0:00:51.92,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My body floods with the chemical

14
0:00:54.56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that they put inside of EpiPens to revive the dead,

15
0:00:57.68,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I am weightless,

16
0:01:01.44,000 --> 0:01:03,000
raceless.

17
0:01:04.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
My story is this: I'm a curator at a contemporary arts center,

18
0:01:08.92,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but I don't really believe in art that doesn't bleed or sweat or cry.

19
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I imagine that my kids are going to live in a time

20
0:01:18.64,000 --> 0:01:22,000
when the most valuable commodities are fresh water and empathy.

21
0:01:23.56,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I love pretty dances and majestic sculpture

22
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as much as the next guy,

23
0:01:27.68,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but give me something else to go with it.

24
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Lift me up with the aesthetic sublime

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and give me a practice or some tools to turn that inspiration

26
0:01:37.88,000 --> 0:01:39,000
into understanding and action.

27
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
For instance, I'm a theater maker who loves sports.

28
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
When I was making my latest piece /peh-LO-tah/

29
0:01:48.44,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I thought a lot about how soccer was a means for my own immigrant family

30
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to foster a sense of continuity and normality and community

31
0:01:57.92,000 --> 0:01:59,000
within the new context of the US.

32
0:02:01.24,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In this heightened moment of xenophobia and assault on immigrant identity,

33
0:02:06.32,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I wanted to think through

34
0:02:07.92,000 --> 0:02:11,000
how the game could serve as an affirmational tool

35
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for first-generation Americans and immigrant kids,

36
0:02:15.52,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to ask them to consider movement patterns on the field

37
0:02:18.96,000 --> 0:02:23,000
as kin to migratory patterns across social and political borders.

38
0:02:24.88,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Whether footballers or not,

39
0:02:26.4,000 --> 0:02:29,000
immigrants in the US play on endangered ground.

40
0:02:30.88,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I wanted to help the kids understand

41
0:02:32.76,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that the same muscle that they use to plan the next goal

42
0:02:36.64,000 --> 0:02:39,000
can also be used to navigate the next block.

43
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
For me, freedom exists in the body.

44
0:02:45.24,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We talk about it abstractly and even divisively,

45
0:02:48.04,000 --> 0:02:51,000
like "protect our freedom," "build this wall,"

46
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"they hate us because of our freedom."

47
0:02:54.4,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We have all these systems that are beautifully designed

48
0:02:57.84,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to incarcerate us or deport us,

49
0:03:00.56,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but how do we design freedom?

50
0:03:04.68,000 --> 0:03:08,000
For these kids, I wanted to track the idea back to something that exists inside

51
0:03:08.88,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that no one could take away,

52
0:03:10.28,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so I developed this curriculum

53
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that's part poli-sci class, part soccer tournament,

54
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
inside of an arts festival.

55
0:03:20.24,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It accesses /peh-LO-tah/'s field of inquiry

56
0:03:23.92,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to create a sports-based political action for young people.

57
0:03:27.84,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The project is called "Moving and Passing."

58
0:03:30.56,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It intersects curriculum development, site-specific performance

59
0:03:34.72,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and the politics of joy,

60
0:03:36.64,000 --> 0:03:4,000
while using soccer as a metaphor for the urgent question

61
0:03:40.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of enfranchisement among immigrant youth.

62
0:03:44.12,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Imagine that you are a 15-year-old kid from Honduras

63
0:03:47.92,000 --> 0:03:48,000
now living in Harlem,

64
0:03:49.72,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or you're a 13-year-old girl born in DC to two Nigerian immigrants.

65
0:03:54.64,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You love the game.

66
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You're on the field with your folks.

67
0:03:57.84,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You've just been practicing dribbling through cones

68
0:04:00.28,000 --> 0:04:01,000
for, like, 15 minutes,

69
0:04:01.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and then, all of a sudden, a marching band comes down the field.

70
0:04:06.36,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I want to associate the joy of the game with the exuberance of culture,

71
0:04:11.12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to locate the site of joy in the game

72
0:04:15.64,000 --> 0:04:17,000
at the same physical coordinate

73
0:04:18.2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
as being politically informed by art,

74
0:04:22.08,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a grass-laden theater for liberation.

75
0:04:25.84,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We spend a week

76
0:04:27.08,000 --> 0:04:3,000
looking at how the midfielder would explain Black Lives Matter,

77
0:04:30.64,000 --> 0:04:33,000
or how the goalkeeper would explain gun control,

78
0:04:33.839,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or how a defender's style is the perfect metaphor

79
0:04:38.04,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for the limits of American exceptionalism.

80
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:42,000
As we study positions on the field,

81
0:04:42.88,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we also name and imagine our own freedoms.

82
0:04:48.72,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I don't know, man, soccer is, like,

83
0:04:50.48,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the only thing on this planet that we can all agree to do together.

84
0:04:55.04,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You know? It's like the official sport of this spinning ball.

85
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I want to be able to connect the joy of the game

86
0:05:05.12,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to the ever-moving footballer,

87
0:05:08.4,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to connect that moving footballer

88
0:05:10.56,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to immigrants who also moved in sight of a better position.

89
0:05:15.72,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Among these kids, I want to connect their families' histories

90
0:05:19.4,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to the bliss of a goal-scorer's run,

91
0:05:22.08,000 --> 0:05:26,000
family like that feeling after the ball beats the goalie,

92
0:05:26.12,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the closest thing going to freedom.

93
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Thank you.

94
0:05:31.24,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Applause)

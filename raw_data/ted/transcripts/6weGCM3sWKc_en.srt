1
0:00:12.555,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In 2011, during the final six months of Kim Jong-Il's life,

2
0:00:19.029,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I lived undercover in North Korea.

3
0:00:23.791,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I was born and raised in South Korea, their enemy.

4
0:00:28.035,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I live in America, their other enemy.

5
0:00:32.369,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Since 2002, I had visited North Korea a few times.

6
0:00:36.942,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning,

7
0:00:42.339,000 --> 0:00:46,000
or to understand the place beyond the regime's propaganda,

8
0:00:47.411,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the only option was total immersion.

9
0:00:54.109,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So I posed as a teacher and a missionary

10
0:00:58.36,000 --> 0:01:01,000
at an all-male university in Pyongyang.

11
0:01:06.239,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology

12
0:01:10.001,000 --> 0:01:15,000
was founded by Evangelical Christians who cooperate with the regime

13
0:01:15.958,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to educate the sons of the North Korean elite,

14
0:01:21.212,000 --> 0:01:24,000
without proselytizing, which is a capital crime there.

15
0:01:27.196,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The students were 270 young men, expected to be the future leaders

16
0:01:33.921,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence.

17
0:01:40.689,000 --> 0:01:44,000
When I arrived, they became my students.

18
0:01:47.336,000 --> 0:01:49,000
2011 was a special year,

19
0:01:49.642,000 --> 0:01:55,000
marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's original Great Leader,

20
0:01:55.908,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Kim Il-Sung.

21
0:01:57.869,000 --> 0:02:02,000
To celebrate the occasion, the regime shut down all universities,

22
0:02:03.385,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and sent students off to the fields

23
0:02:06.22,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal

24
0:02:10.378,000 --> 0:02:13,000
as the world's most powerful and prosperous nation.

25
0:02:16.958,000 --> 0:02:18,000
My students were the only ones spared from that fate.

26
0:02:21.502,000 --> 0:02:24,000
North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation.

27
0:02:26.038,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Everything there is about the Great Leader.

28
0:02:28.494,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Every book, every newspaper article, every song, every TV program --

29
0:02:33.828,000 --> 0:02:34,000
there is just one subject.

30
0:02:35.97,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The flowers are named after him,

31
0:02:37.935,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the mountains are carved with his slogans.

32
0:02:40.831,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Every citizen wears the badge of the Great Leader at all times.

33
0:02:45.861,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Even their calendar system begins with the birth of Kim Il-Sung.

34
0:02:51.521,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The school was a heavily guarded prison, posing as a campus.

35
0:02:56.751,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Teachers could only leave on group outings accompanied by an official minder.

36
0:03:03.96,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Even then, our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments

37
0:03:09.357,000 --> 0:03:1,000
celebrating the Great Leader.

38
0:03:12.405,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The students were not allowed to leave the campus,

39
0:03:16.274,000 --> 0:03:18,000
or communicate with their parents.

40
0:03:20.761,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Their days were meticulously mapped out, and any free time they had

41
0:03:24.911,000 --> 0:03:27,000
was devoted to honoring their Great Leader.

42
0:03:29.421,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Lesson plans had to meet the approval of North Korean staff,

43
0:03:34.452,000 --> 0:03:38,000
every class was recorded and reported on, every room was bugged,

44
0:03:38.681,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and every conversation, overheard.

45
0:03:42.743,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Every blank space was covered with the portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il,

46
0:03:48.413,000 --> 0:03:5,000
like everywhere else in North Korea.

47
0:03:53.092,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We were never allowed to discuss the outside world.

48
0:03:55.969,000 --> 0:04:,000
As students of science and technology, many of them were computer majors

49
0:04:01.003,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but they did not know the existence of the Internet.

50
0:04:04.555,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They had never heard of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.

51
0:04:09.525,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Facebook, Twitter -- none of those things would have meant a thing.

52
0:04:14.605,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I could not tell them.

53
0:04:18.861,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I went there looking for truth.

54
0:04:22.135,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But where do you even start when an entire nation's ideology,

55
0:04:25.805,000 --> 0:04:26,000
my students' day-to-day realities,

56
0:04:27.823,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and even my own position at the universities,

57
0:04:31.798,000 --> 0:04:33,000
were all built on lies?

58
0:04:37.93,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I started with a game.

59
0:04:39.976,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We played "Truth and Lie."

60
0:04:42.689,000 --> 0:04:44,000
A volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard,

61
0:04:45.356,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the other students had to guess

62
0:04:48.131,000 --> 0:04:51,000
whether it was a truth or a lie.

63
0:04:51.158,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Once a student wrote, "I visited China last year on vacation,"

64
0:04:55.385,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and everyone shouted, "Lie!"

65
0:04:59.025,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They all knew this wasn't possible.

66
0:05:01.317,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Virtually no North Korean is allowed to leave the country.

67
0:05:05.297,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass.

68
0:05:12.569,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I had hoped that this game would reveal some truth about my students,

69
0:05:17.87,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because they lie so often and so easily,

70
0:05:20.957,000 --> 0:05:24,000
whether about the mythical accomplishments of their Great Leader,

71
0:05:25.394,000 --> 0:05:29,000
or the strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders.

72
0:05:31.482,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them.

73
0:05:36.423,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It took me a while to understand the different types of lies;

74
0:05:40.538,000 --> 0:05:42,000
they lie to shield their system from the world,

75
0:05:43.538,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or they were taught lies, and were just regurgitating them.

76
0:05:47.417,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Or, at moments, they lied out of habit.

77
0:05:52.314,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But if all they have ever known were lies,

78
0:05:56.449,000 --> 0:05:58,000
how could we expect them to be otherwise?

79
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Next, I tried to teach them essay writing.

80
0:06:04.408,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But that turned out to be nearly impossible.

81
0:06:07.225,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Essays are about coming up with one's own thesis,

82
0:06:11.412,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and making an evidence-based argument to prove it.

83
0:06:16.044,000 --> 0:06:19,000
These students, however, were simply told what to think,

84
0:06:19.985,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and they obeyed.

85
0:06:21.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
In their world, critical thinking was not allowed.

86
0:06:26.88,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter,

87
0:06:31.535,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to anybody.

88
0:06:33.31,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It took a long time, but eventually some of them began to write

89
0:06:37.509,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to their mothers, their friends, their girlfriends.

90
0:06:42.479,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Although those were just homework,

91
0:06:45.496,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and would never reach their intended recipients,

92
0:06:49.076,000 --> 0:06:53,000
my students slowly began to reveal their true feelings in them.

93
0:06:54.376,000 --> 0:06:58,000
They wrote that they were fed up with the sameness of everything.

94
0:06:59.435,000 --> 0:07:,000
They were worried about their future.

95
0:07:01.787,000 --> 0:07:05,000
In those letters, they rarely ever mentioned their Great Leader.

96
0:07:10.806,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I was spending all of my time with these young men.

97
0:07:14.558,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We all ate meals together, played basketball together.

98
0:07:19.679,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I often called them gentlemen, which made them giggle.

99
0:07:24.858,000 --> 0:07:25,000
They blushed at the mention of girls.

100
0:07:28.332,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And I came to adore them.

101
0:07:30.703,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways,

102
0:07:34.364,000 --> 0:07:36,000
was deeply moving.

103
0:07:37.967,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But something also felt wrong.

104
0:07:40.973,000 --> 0:07:42,000
During those months of living in their world,

105
0:07:43.846,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I often wondered if the truth would, in fact, improve their lives.

106
0:07:51.759,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I wanted so much to tell them the truth,

107
0:07:54.874,000 --> 0:07:57,000
of their country and of the outside world,

108
0:07:58.318,000 --> 0:08:01,000
where Arab youth were turning their rotten regime inside out,

109
0:08:02.333,000 --> 0:08:03,000
using the power of social media,

110
0:08:04.152,000 --> 0:08:08,000
where everyone except them was connected through the world wide web,

111
0:08:08.874,000 --> 0:08:1,000
which wasn't worldwide after all.

112
0:08:13.489,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But for them, the truth was dangerous.

113
0:08:18.955,000 --> 0:08:22,000
By encouraging them to run after it, I was putting them at risk --

114
0:08:23.878,000 --> 0:08:25,000
of persecution,

115
0:08:26.259,000 --> 0:08:27,000
of heartbreak.

116
0:08:30.755,000 --> 0:08:32,000
When you're not allowed to express anything in the open,

117
0:08:33.437,000 --> 0:08:35,000
you become good at reading what is unspoken.

118
0:08:37.736,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In one of their personal letters to me, a student wrote that he understood

119
0:08:42.784,000 --> 0:08:44,000
why I always called them gentlemen.

120
0:08:46.63,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It was because I was wishing them to be gentle in life, he said.

121
0:08:54.767,000 --> 0:08:56,000
On my last day in December of 2011,

122
0:08:57.568,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced,

123
0:09:00.342,000 --> 0:09:01,000
their world shattered.

124
0:09:04.798,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I had to leave without a proper goodbye.

125
0:09:08.667,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But I think they knew how sad I was for them.

126
0:09:12.34,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Once, toward the end of my stay, a student said to me,

127
0:09:16.269,000 --> 0:09:21,000
"Professor, we never think of you as being different from us.

128
0:09:21.767,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Our circumstances are different, but you're the same as us.

129
0:09:27.898,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same."

130
0:09:37.999,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Today, if I could respond to my students with a letter of my own,

131
0:09:41.83,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which is of course impossible,

132
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I would tell them this:

133
0:09:49.876,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"My dear gentlemen,

134
0:09:52.55,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's been a bit over three years since I last saw you.

135
0:09:55.549,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And now, you must be 22 -- maybe even as old as 23.

136
0:10:00.565,000 --> 0:10:03,000
At our final class, I asked you if there was anything you wanted.

137
0:10:05.822,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The only wish you expressed, the only thing you ever asked of me

138
0:10:09.265,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in all those months we spent together,

139
0:10:12.707,000 --> 0:10:13,000
was for me to speak to you in Korean.

140
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Just once.

141
0:10:17.084,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I was there to teach you English;

142
0:10:19.584,000 --> 0:10:2,000
you knew it wasn't allowed.

143
0:10:22.144,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But I understood then, you wanted to share that bond of our mother tongue.

144
0:10:30.052,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I called you my gentlemen,

145
0:10:33.306,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but I don't know if being gentle in Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea

146
0:10:37.751,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is a good thing.

147
0:10:39.717,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I don't want you to lead a revolution --

148
0:10:42.068,000 --> 0:10:44,000
let some other young person do it.

149
0:10:45.035,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect

150
0:10:48.605,000 --> 0:10:5,000
some sort of North Korean Spring,

151
0:10:50.979,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but I don't want you to do anything risky,

152
0:10:53.525,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because I know in your world, someone is always watching.

153
0:10:59.027,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I don't want to imagine what might happen to you.

154
0:11:02.225,000 --> 0:11:06,000
If my attempts to reach you have inspired something new in you,

155
0:11:07.191,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I would rather you forget me.

156
0:11:09.646,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Become soldiers of your Great Leader, and live long, safe lives.

157
0:11:16.361,000 --> 0:11:2,000
You once asked me if I thought your city of Pyongyang was beautiful,

158
0:11:21.084,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and I could not answer truthfully then.

159
0:11:25.609,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But I know why you asked.

160
0:11:27.493,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I know that it was important for you to hear that I, your teacher,

161
0:11:32.048,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from,

162
0:11:35.933,000 --> 0:11:38,000
declare your city as the most beautiful.

163
0:11:41.793,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I know hearing that would make your lives there a bit more bearable,

164
0:11:46.972,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but no, I don't find your capital beautiful.

165
0:11:50.9,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Not because it's monotone and concrete,

166
0:11:53.553,000 --> 0:11:54,000
but because of what it symbolizes:

167
0:11:55.44,000 --> 0:11:59,000
a monster that feeds off the rest of the country,

168
0:12:00.297,000 --> 0:12:02,000
where citizens are soldiers and slaves.

169
0:12:05.734,000 --> 0:12:06,000
All I see there is darkness.

170
0:12:09.932,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But it's your home, so I cannot hate it.

171
0:12:13.623,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And I hope instead that you, my lovely young gentlemen,

172
0:12:18.684,000 --> 0:12:2,000
will one day help make it beautiful.

173
0:12:22.97,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Thank you.

174
0:12:24.183,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Applause)

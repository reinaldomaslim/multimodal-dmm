1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Now when we think of our senses,

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
we don't usually think of the reasons

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
why they probably evolved, from a biological perspective.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We don't really think of the evolutionary need

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to be protected by our senses,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but that's probably why our senses really evolved --

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to keep us safe, to allow us to live.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Really when we think of our senses,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or when we think of the loss of the sense,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we really think about something more like this:

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to smell something fragrant,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to see something beautiful.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This is what we want out of our senses.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We want beauty; we don't just want function.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And when it comes to sensory restoration,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we're still very far away from being able to provide beauty.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Likewise for hearing.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
When we think about why we hear,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren,

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
although clearly that's an important thing.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Really what we want to hear is music.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Music)

25
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.

26
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Many of you know that he was deaf, or near profoundly deaf,

27
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when he wrote that.

28
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now I'd like to impress upon you

29
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
how unusual it is that we can hear music.

30
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Music is just one of the strangest things that there is.

31
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's acoustic vibrations in the air,

32
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum.

33
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Somehow in tickling our eardrum

34
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that transmits energy down our hearing bones,

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea

36
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves

37
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that somehow wind up in our brains

38
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music.

39
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That process is entirely abstract and very, very unusual.

40
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And we could discuss that topic alone for days

41
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to really try to figure out, how is it that we hear something that's emotional

42
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
from something that starts out as a vibration in the air?

43
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Turns out that if you have hearing loss,

44
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
most people that lose their hearing

45
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
lose it at what's called the cochlea, the inner ear.

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And it's at the hair cell level that they do this.

47
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now if you had to pick a sense to lose,

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I have to be very honest with you

49
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and say, we're better at restoring hearing

50
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
than we are at restoring any sense that there is.

51
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In fact, nothing even actually comes close

52
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to our ability to restore hearing.

53
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And as a physician and a surgeon, I can confidently tell my patients

54
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that if you had to pick a sense to lose,

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing.

56
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
As a musician, I can tell you

57
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that if I had to have a cochlear implant,

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken,

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because I know that music would never sound the same to me.

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Now this is a video that I'm going to show you

61
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of a girl who's born deaf.

62
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
She's in a very supportive environment.

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Her mother's doing everything she can.

64
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Okay, play that video please.

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Video) Mother: That's an owl.

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Owl, yeah.

67
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Owl. Owl.

68
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Yeah.

69
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Baby. Baby.

70
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You want it?

71
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Kiss)

72
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Charles Limb: Now despite everything going for this child

73
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in terms of family support

74
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and simple infused learning,

75
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
there is a limitation to what a child who's deaf, an infant who was born deaf,

76
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
has in this world

77
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in terms of social, educational, vocational opportunities.

78
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful, wonderful life.

79
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles

80
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face.

81
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss

82
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
has really evolved in the past 200 years.

83
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I mean literally,

84
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears

85
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and stick funnels in.

86
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And that was the best you could do for hearing loss.

87
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum.

88
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So it's not too surprising

89
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that there were no good treatments for hearing loss.

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant,

91
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
which is an outpatient procedure.

92
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's surgically placed inside the inner ear.

93
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on where it's done,

94
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
under general anesthesia.

95
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And in the end, you achieve something like this

96
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea.

97
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Now actually, this is quite crude

98
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in comparison to our regular inner ear.

99
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But here is that same girl who is implanted now.

100
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This is her 10 years later.

101
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And this is a video that was taken

102
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
by my surgical mentor, Dr. John Niparko, who implanted her.

103
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If we could play this video please.

104
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Video) John Niparko: So you've written two books?

105
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Girl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?)

106
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Girl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.)

107
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
JN: Well this book has seven chapters,

108
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and the last chapter

109
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf."

110
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Do you remember writing that chapter?

111
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Girl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter.

112
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
JN: Yeah.

113
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Girl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying.

114
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her.

115
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
JN: I see. And who is that?

116
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Girl: Holly. (JN: Okay.)

117
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Mother: Her sister. (JN: Her sister.) Girl: My sister.

118
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
JN: And how can you avoid being annoyed by her?

119
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Girl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything.

120
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It comes in handy.

122
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
JN: So you don't want to hear everything that's out there?

123
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Girl: No.

124
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
CL: And so she's phenomenal.

125
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.

126
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine.

127
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
However, despite this incredible facility

128
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that some cochlear implant users display with language,

129
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.

130
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In fact, most implant users really struggle

131
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and dislike music because it sounds so bad.

132
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And so when it comes to this idea

133
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
of restoring beauty to somebody's life,

134
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we have a long way to go when it comes to audition.

135
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now there are a lot of reasons for that.

136
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I mentioned earlier the fact

137
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that music is a different capacity because it's abstract.

138
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Language is very different. Language is very precise.

139
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
In fact, the whole reason we use it

140
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is because it has semantic-specificity.

141
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
When you say a word,

142
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
what you care is that word was perceived correctly.

143
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You don't care that the word sounded pretty

144
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
when it was spoken.

145
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Music is entirely different.

146
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
When you hear music, if it doesn't sound good, what's the point?

147
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
There's really very little point in listening to music

148
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
when it doesn't sound good to you.

149
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language.

150
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And you can see on this figure,

151
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that the frequency range

152
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the decibel range, the dynamic range of music

153
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is far more heterogeneous.

154
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant,

155
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
what we would try to do

156
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
is target it to be able to allow music transmission.

157
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing.

158
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
If you can hear music,

159
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
you should be able to hear anything.

160
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now the problems begin first with pitch perception.

161
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music.

162
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And without the ability to perceive pitch well,

163
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
music and melody is a very difficult thing to do --

164
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
forget about a harmony and things like that.

165
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude.

166
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Now if we could just play this.

167
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Music)

168
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Okay, now if we consider

169
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that in a cochlear implant patient

170
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves,

171
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
let's see what happens here

172
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
when we randomize this to within one semitone.

173
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.

174
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Go ahead and play this one.

175
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Music)

176
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now my goal in showing you that

177
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
is to show you that music is not robust to degradation.

178
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.

179
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And it might be that you kind of like that.

180
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
That's kind of hypnotic.

181
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended.

182
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And you're not hearing the same thing

183
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that most people who have normal hearing are hearing.

184
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now the other issue comes with,

185
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
not just the ability to tell pitches apart,

186
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but the ability to tell sounds apart.

187
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument.

188
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
If we could play these two sound clips in succession.

189
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Trumpet)

190
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The trumpet.

191
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And the second one.

192
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Violin)

193
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
That's a violin.

194
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
These have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments.

195
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference

196
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
between these instruments.

197
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The sound quality, or the sound of the sound

198
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is how I like to describe timbre, tone color --

199
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
they cannot tell these things whatsoever.

200
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This implant is not transmitting

201
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth.

202
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant

203
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and you have them listen to speech,

204
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody,

205
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
what you find is that the auditory cortex

206
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is the most active during speech.

207
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech,

208
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
they were designed for speech.

209
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But actually if you look at melody,

210
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
what you find is that there's very little cortical activity

211
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in implant users compared with normal hearing controls.

212
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So for whatever reason,

213
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices

214
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
during melody perception.

215
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now the next question is,

216
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
well how does it really sound?

217
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Now we've been doing some studies

218
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users.

219
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I'm going to play you two clips of Usher,

220
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
one which is normal

221
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and one which has almost no high frequencies, almost no low frequencies

222
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and not even that many mid frequencies.

223
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Go ahead and play that.

224
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Music)

225
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Limited Frequency Music)

226
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I had patients tell me that those sound the same.

227
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They cannot differentiate sound quality differences

228
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
between those two clips.

229
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Again, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to.

230
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Now the question comes to mind: Is there any hope?

231
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And yes, there is hope.

232
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is.

233
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This is ... does somebody know?

234
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is Beethoven.

235
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like?

236
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Because his grave was exhumed.

237
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died

238
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to try to look at the cause of his deafness,

239
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
which is why he has molding clay

240
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and his skull is bulging out on the side there.

241
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But Beethoven composed music

242
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
long after he lost his hearing.

243
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
What that suggests is that, even in the case of hearing loss,

244
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
the capacity for music remains.

245
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The brains remain hardwired for music.

246
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo

247
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
where I've been working on deaf cats that are white

248
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants.

249
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food.

250
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
(Music)

251
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Text: Beethoven doesn't excite her.

252
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Music)

253
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The "1812 Overture" isn't worth waking for.

254
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Trumpet)

255
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But she jumps to action when called to duty!

256
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Trumpet)

257
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
CL: Now I'm not suggesting

258
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it.

259
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I'm suggesting that with training

260
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
you can imbue a musical sound with significance,

261
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
even in a cat.

262
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
If we were to direct efforts

263
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
towards training cochlear implant users to hear music --

264
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that,

265
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
no rehabilitative strategies,

266
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music --

267
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
we would come a long way.

268
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Now I want to show you one last video.

269
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And this is of a student of mine named Joseph

270
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab.

271
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
He's deaf, and he learned to play the piano

272
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
after he received the cochlear implant.

273
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And here's a video of Joseph.

274
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Music)

275
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
(Video) Joseph: I was born in 1986.

276
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And at about four months old,

277
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss.

278
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Not long after,

279
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I was fitted with hearing aids.

280
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But although these hearing aids

281
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time,

282
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
they weren't very helpful.

283
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So as a result, I had to rely on lip reading a lot,

284
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and I couldn't really hear what people were saying.

285
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
When I was 12 years old,

286
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I was one of the first few people in Singapore

287
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
who underwent cochlear implantation.

288
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And not long after I got my cochlear implant,

289
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I started learning how to play piano.

290
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And it was absolutely wonderful.

291
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Since then, I've never looked back.

292
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
CL: Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant.

293
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
He is now a medical student at Yale University,

294
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and he's contemplating a surgical career --

295
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery.

296
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere.

297
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And this is really unheard of stuff, and this is all because of this technology.

298
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And the fact that he can play the piano like that

299
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
is a testament to his brain.

300
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant,

301
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time.

302
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
You don't actually have to hear it.

303
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I know he doesn't hear well, because I've heard him do Karaoke.

304
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Laughter)

305
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And it's one of the most awful things --

306
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
heartwarming, but awful.

307
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Laughter)

308
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And so there is certainly a lot of hope,

309
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
but there's a lot more that needs to be done.

310
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So I just want to conclude with the following words.

311
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
When it comes to restoration of hearing,

312
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
we have certainly come a long way, a remarkably long way.

313
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And we have a much longer way to go

314
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing.

315
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And let me tell you right now,

316
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech.

317
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But I tell you, if we lost our hearing,

318
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing,

319
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
you would want perfect hearing back.

320
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
You wouldn't want decent hearing, you would want perfect hearing.

321
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Restoration of basic sensory function is critical.

322
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And I don't mean to understate

323
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
how important it is to restore basic function.

324
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty

325
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
where we can get inspiring.

326
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And I don't think that we should give up on beauty.

327
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And I want to thank you for your time.

328
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Applause)

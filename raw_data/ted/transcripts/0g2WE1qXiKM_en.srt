Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.

3
0:00:18.916,000 --> 0:00:22,000
All you have to do is read what you see. Right?

4
0:00:22.963,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together.

5
0:00:26.164,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?

6
0:00:28.663,000 --> 0:00:32,000
BL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this.

7
0:00:33.042,000 --> 0:00:38,000
BL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter)

8
0:00:38.358,000 --> 0:00:42,000
If you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.

9
0:00:43.155,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Audience: What are you reading?

10
0:00:45.133,000 --> 0:00:48,000
BL: What are you reading? There are no words there.

11
0:00:48.591,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I said, read what you're seeing. Right?

12
0:00:51.128,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" (Laughter) Right?

13
0:00:54.978,000 --> 0:00:57,000
That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?

14
0:00:58.806,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's because perception is grounded in our experience.

15
0:01:02.342,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Right? The brain takes meaningless information

16
0:01:05.239,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see

17
0:01:08.198,000 --> 0:01:1,000
what's there, we never see information,

18
0:01:10.454,000 --> 0:01:13,000
we only ever see what was useful to see in the past.

19
0:01:13.729,000 --> 0:01:15,000
All right? Which means, when it comes to perception,

20
0:01:16.465,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we're all like this frog.

21
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:24.172,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior

23
0:01:27.567,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that's useful. (Laughter)

24
0:01:32.035,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:39.067,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause)

26
0:01:45.049,000 --> 0:01:47,000
BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way,

27
0:01:47.761,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we get a little bit annoyed, right?

28
0:01:50.02,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But we're talking about perception here, right?

29
0:01:52.75,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And perception underpins everything we think, we know,

30
0:01:57.115,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear,

31
0:01:59.986,000 --> 0:02:02,000
falling in love, everything begins with perception.

32
0:02:03.729,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means

33
0:02:06.674,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.

34
0:02:10.133,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But actually, it's a tremendous problem,

35
0:02:13.209,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because how can we ever see differently?

36
0:02:16.826,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently,

37
0:02:20.889,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and all new perceptions begin in the same way.

38
0:02:24.877,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They begin with a question.

39
0:02:27.459,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty.

40
0:02:30.697,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily

41
0:02:33.426,000 --> 0:02:36,000
a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.

42
0:02:37.027,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Okay? (Laughter)

43
0:02:38.387,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.

44
0:02:41.547,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears

45
0:02:43.799,000 --> 0:02:45,000
are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because

46
0:02:45.975,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.

47
0:02:48.291,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.

48
0:02:52.946,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do,

49
0:02:56.875,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because it takes you into uncertainty.

50
0:02:59.867,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever

51
0:03:02.746,000 --> 0:03:05,000
do anything new is to step into that space.

52
0:03:06.282,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately,

53
0:03:09.506,000 --> 0:03:12,000
evolution has given us an answer, right?

54
0:03:13.09,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And it enables us to address even the most difficult

55
0:03:16.685,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.

56
0:03:21.364,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?

57
0:03:25.32,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin,

58
0:03:27.309,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already

59
0:03:30.617,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is really stepping into that space.

60
0:03:33.618,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?

61
0:03:38.428,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's play.

62
0:03:40.201,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you

63
0:03:44.394,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that actually it's a way of being.

64
0:03:47.009,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty

65
0:03:49.9,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.

66
0:03:54.226,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Right? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility,

67
0:03:58.501,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding,

68
0:04:02.61,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means

69
0:04:04.336,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is that we play to play. Play is its own reward.

70
0:04:08.942,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now if you look at these five ways of being,

71
0:04:12.833,000 --> 0:04:14,000
these are the exact same ways of being you need

72
0:04:15.554,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in order to be a good scientist.

73
0:04:17.59,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper.

74
0:04:20.617,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true

75
0:04:23.757,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for anything that is creative.

76
0:04:26.41,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So if you add rules to play, you have a game.

77
0:04:30.613,000 --> 0:04:32,000
That's actually what an experiment is.

78
0:04:33.403,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So armed with these two ideas,

79
0:04:35.322,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that science is a way of being and experiments are play,

80
0:04:39.644,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we asked, can anyone become a scientist?

81
0:04:43.097,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?

82
0:04:46.597,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena

83
0:04:50.104,000 --> 0:04:53,000
down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this

84
0:04:53.651,000 --> 0:04:57,000
was to not just get the kids to see science differently,

85
0:04:57.895,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?

86
0:05:02.493,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The first step was to ask a question.

87
0:05:05.901,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study

88
0:05:08.781,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because the scientists said small children couldn't make

89
0:05:12.111,000 --> 0:05:16,000
a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.

90
0:05:16.413,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So we did it anyway. Right? Of course.

91
0:05:20.147,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print

92
0:05:22.966,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with

93
0:05:27.406,000 --> 0:05:31,000
were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?

94
0:05:32.024,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So they were asking questions that were significant

95
0:05:34.684,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to expert scientists.

96
0:05:36.814,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Now here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?

97
0:05:40.948,000 --> 0:05:42,000
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study,

98
0:05:43.56,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and she's now one of the youngest published scientists

99
0:05:45.894,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage,

100
0:05:49.777,000 --> 0:05:52,000
will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?

101
0:05:53.475,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, science and asking questions is about courage.

102
0:05:56.35,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now she is the personification of courage, because she's

103
0:05:59.55,000 --> 0:06:,000
going to stand up here and talk to you all.

104
0:06:00.937,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So Amy, would you please come up? (Applause)

105
0:06:06.191,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Applause)

106
0:06:13.376,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call

107
0:06:15.895,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you

108
0:06:18.561,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.

109
0:06:21.106,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Amy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought

110
0:06:22.825,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes

111
0:06:26.226,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in the way that we think, because we look alike.

112
0:06:29.25,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But we wondered if there's a possible link

113
0:06:31.939,000 --> 0:06:35,000
with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees

114
0:06:36.643,000 --> 0:06:4,000
thought similar, since they seem so different from us.

115
0:06:40.756,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So we asked if humans and bees might solve

116
0:06:43.809,000 --> 0:06:45,000
complex problems in the same way.

117
0:06:46.216,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt

118
0:06:49.503,000 --> 0:06:52,000
themselves to new situations using previously learned rules

119
0:06:53.21,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and conditions. So what if bees can think like us?

120
0:06:57.424,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect

121
0:06:59.976,000 --> 0:07:01,000
with only one million brain cells.

122
0:07:02.501,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should,

123
0:07:04.643,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower

124
0:07:07.92,000 --> 0:07:1,000
regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather,

125
0:07:11.533,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause)

126
0:07:17.275,000 --> 0:07:2,000
BL: So the next step was to design an experiment,

127
0:07:21.057,000 --> 0:07:24,000
which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed

128
0:07:24.359,000 --> 0:07:27,000
this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so,

129
0:07:27.66,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Amy, can you tell us what the game was,

130
0:07:29.126,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and the puzzle that you set the bees?

131
0:07:31.269,000 --> 0:07:34,000
AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.

132
0:07:34.292,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color,

133
0:07:37.937,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but to a certain color flower only

134
0:07:40.605,000 --> 0:07:41,000
when it's in a certain pattern.

135
0:07:42.237,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers

136
0:07:45.496,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue,

137
0:07:48.556,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.

138
0:07:51.824,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn

139
0:07:54.409,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?

140
0:07:57.834,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What was really exciting about this project was we,

141
0:08:00.614,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.

142
0:08:02.957,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It was completely new, and no one had done it before,

143
0:08:05.411,000 --> 0:08:08,000
including adults. (Laughter)

144
0:08:09.134,000 --> 0:08:12,000
BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.

145
0:08:12.598,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing,

146
0:08:15.502,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher

147
0:08:18.046,000 --> 0:08:19,000
not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day --

148
0:08:19.671,000 --> 0:08:21,000
so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was

149
0:08:22.27,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the collaborator on this project. Okay?

150
0:08:24.479,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study

151
0:08:27.211,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because actually you can read about it, but the next step

152
0:08:29.849,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is observation. So here are some of the students

153
0:08:33.494,000 --> 0:08:35,000
doing the observations. They're recording the data

154
0:08:36.262,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of where the bees fly.

155
0:08:41.306,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do —Student: 5C.

156
0:08:43.329,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah.

157
0:08:47.319,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?

158
0:08:50.916,000 --> 0:08:52,000
BL: "Can you help me, Henry?" What good scientist says that, right?

159
0:08:53.82,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Student: There's two up there.

160
0:08:58.53,000 --> 0:09:,000
And three in here.

161
0:09:01.404,000 --> 0:09:03,000
BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.

162
0:09:03.679,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.

163
0:09:07.452,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And now we want to share. That's the next step.

164
0:09:09.383,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So we're going to write this up and try to submit this

165
0:09:10.991,000 --> 0:09:12,000
for publication. Right? So we have to write it up.

166
0:09:13.847,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter)

167
0:09:18.36,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter)

168
0:09:20.644,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections:

169
0:09:22.73,000 --> 0:09:24,000
an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.

170
0:09:25.537,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The introduction says, what's the question and why?

171
0:09:28.141,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?

172
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And the discussion is, who cares? Right?

173
0:09:33.403,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That's a science paper, basically. (Laughter)

174
0:09:35.862,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative,

175
0:09:40.391,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.

176
0:09:43.638,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It's not written by me. It's written by Amy

177
0:09:46.166,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and the other students in the class. As a consequence,

178
0:09:49.486,000 --> 0:09:55,000
this science paper begins, "Once upon a time ... " (Laughter)

179
0:09:55.503,000 --> 0:10:,000
The results section, it says: "Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh." Right? (Laughter)

180
0:10:00.815,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees

181
0:10:03.011,000 --> 0:10:06,000
into the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face. Right? (Laughter)

182
0:10:06.328,000 --> 0:10:09,000
This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.

183
0:10:10.161,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.

184
0:10:12.995,000 --> 0:10:14,000
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.

185
0:10:15.846,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because

186
0:10:17.896,000 --> 0:10:2,000
if it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al,"

187
0:10:21.142,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal,

188
0:10:24.199,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and it says this. It said many things, but it said this.

189
0:10:27.531,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." (Laughter)

190
0:10:31.45,000 --> 0:10:33,000
In other words, it starts off "once upon a time,"

191
0:10:34.01,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter)

192
0:10:36.536,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves,

193
0:10:40.889,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world,

194
0:10:44.422,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" — (Laughter) —

195
0:10:47.871,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"and it certainly deserves wide exposure."

196
0:10:49.968,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent.

197
0:10:54.239,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The work would be publishable if done by adults."

198
0:10:57.605,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So what did we do? We send it back to the editor.

199
0:10:59.584,000 --> 0:11:,000
They say no.

200
0:11:01.173,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write

201
0:11:03.627,000 --> 0:11:07,000
a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right,

202
0:11:07.634,000 --> 0:11:11,000
putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.

203
0:11:11.762,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees,

204
0:11:15.089,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and it was published. Okay? (Applause)

205
0:11:19.51,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Applause)

206
0:11:25.51,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It took four months to do the science,

207
0:11:28.531,000 --> 0:11:31,000
two years to get it published. (Laughter)

208
0:11:31.759,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and

209
0:11:36.594,000 --> 0:11:38,000
her friends the youngest published scientists in the world.

210
0:11:39.027,000 --> 0:11:41,000
What was the feedback like?

211
0:11:41.043,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Well, it was published two days before Christmas,

212
0:11:43.928,000 --> 0:11:47,000
downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?

213
0:11:47.931,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.

214
0:11:51.971,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.

215
0:11:54.513,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.

216
0:11:58.193,000 --> 0:12:,000
Last year, it was the second-most downloaded paper

217
0:12:00.892,000 --> 0:12:04,000
by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists

218
0:12:04.996,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and teachers but the public as well.

219
0:12:07.544,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And I'll just read one.

220
0:12:09.316,000 --> 0:12:11,000
"I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have

221
0:12:11.806,000 --> 0:12:13,000
words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.

222
0:12:14.119,000 --> 0:12:16,000
What you guys have done is real, true and amazing.

223
0:12:16.598,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic

224
0:12:19.707,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and most important things to do science.

225
0:12:21.431,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Who else can have these qualities more than children?

226
0:12:23.909,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Please congratulate your children's team from my side."

227
0:12:27.45,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.

228
0:12:30.833,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Can I do it on you? (Laughter)

229
0:12:33.801,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.

230
0:12:36.894,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter)

231
0:12:42.071,000 --> 0:12:48,000
For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter)

232
0:12:48.169,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And you like technology, right?

233
0:12:49.745,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.

234
0:12:51.921,000 --> 0:12:53,000
BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.

235
0:12:54.872,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Now ... (Laughter)

236
0:12:58.48,000 --> 0:13:,000
Okay. (Laughter)

237
0:13:01.36,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?

238
0:13:05.444,000 --> 0:13:09,000
You have to close your eyes, and you have to point

239
0:13:09.463,000 --> 0:13:12,000
where you hear me clapping. All right?

240
0:13:12.62,000 --> 0:13:16,000
(Clapping)

241
0:13:17.018,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Clapping)

242
0:13:20.162,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?

243
0:13:23.065,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Audience: (Shouts)

244
0:13:25.966,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Laughter)

245
0:13:30.412,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Shouts) (Laughter)

246
0:13:33.583,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.

247
0:13:37.224,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Everyone over there shout. (Shouts)

248
0:13:40.026,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause)

249
0:13:45.958,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

250
0:13:50.188,000 --> 0:13:53,000
What's the point? The point is what science does for us.

251
0:13:53.901,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Right? We normally walk through life responding,

252
0:13:56.307,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to

253
0:13:58.519,000 --> 0:14:,000
step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes,

254
0:14:01.208,000 --> 0:14:03,000
he was able to see the world in a new way.

255
0:14:03.59,000 --> 0:14:06,000
That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility

256
0:14:06.758,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?

257
0:14:10.774,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Now, true science education I think should be about

258
0:14:13.798,000 --> 0:14:16,000
giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice,

259
0:14:17.197,000 --> 0:14:21,000
so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.

260
0:14:21.566,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So, Amy?

261
0:14:24.671,000 --> 0:14:26,000
AO: This project was really exciting for me,

262
0:14:27.224,000 --> 0:14:29,000
because it brought the process of discovery to life,

263
0:14:29.895,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone,

264
0:14:32.806,000 --> 0:14:34,000
has the potential to discover something new,

265
0:14:35.559,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and that a small question can lead into a big discovery.

266
0:14:39.631,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Changing the way a person thinks about something

267
0:14:42.283,000 --> 0:14:45,000
can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person

268
0:14:45.995,000 --> 0:14:46,000
feels about change.

269
0:14:47.483,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But changing the way I thought about science was

270
0:14:49.935,000 --> 0:14:51,000
surprisingly easy. Once we played the games

271
0:14:52.21,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and then started to think about the puzzle,

272
0:14:54.628,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject,

273
0:14:58.485,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and that anyone can discover something new.

274
0:15:01.679,000 --> 0:15:04,000
You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came

275
0:15:04.879,000 --> 0:15:06,000
in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.

276
0:15:07.515,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause)

277
0:15:11.876,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Applause)

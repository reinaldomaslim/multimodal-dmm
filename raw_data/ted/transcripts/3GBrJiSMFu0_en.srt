1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was informed by this kind of

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
unoriginal and trite idea

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that new technologies were an opportunity

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for social transformation,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
which is what drove me then,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and still, it's a delusion that drives me now.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I wanted to update what I've been doing since then --

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but it's still the same theme song --

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and introduce you to my lab and current work,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
which is the Environmental Health Clinic

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that I run at NYU.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And what it is -- it's a twist on health.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Because, really, what I'm trying to do now

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is redefine what counts as health.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
except people come to the clinic

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with environmental health concerns,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and they walk out with prescriptions

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for things they can do to improve environmental health,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But that suggests the issue

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that I'm trying to get at here,

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Because this idea that health is internal

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and atomized and individual

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and pharmaceutical

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is largely an error.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I would use this study,

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a recent study by Philip Landrigan,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to motivate a different view of health,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and the New York area

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and logged what they spent their patient hours on.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
80 to 90 percent of their time

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
was spent on five things.

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Number one was asthma,

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
number two was developmental delays,

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
number three was 400-fold increases

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in rare childhood cancers

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in the last eight to 10, 15 years.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Number four and five were childhood obesity

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and diabetes-related issues.

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So all of those -- what's common about all of those?

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This is not the germs

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that medicos were trained to deal with;

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
this is a different definition of health,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
health that has a great advantage

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because it's external, it's shared,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we can do something about it,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or individualized.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
People who come to the clinic are called, not patients,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but impatients,

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to address local and environmental health issues.

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that I set up in various places

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that provide an immersion

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in some of the environmental challenges we face.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I like this one from the Belgian field office,

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where we met in a roundabout,

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
precisely because the roundabout iconified

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the headless social movement

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that informs much social transformation,

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
as opposed to the top-down control

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of red light traffic intersections.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In this case, of course, the roundabout

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
with that micro-decisions being made in situ

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
by people not being told what to do.

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But, of course, affords greater throughput,

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
fewer accidents,

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and an interesting model of social movement.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or keeping tabs, if you will.

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
What they are is an addition of tadpoles

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that are named after a local bureaucrat

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
whose decisions affect your water quality.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So an impatient concerned for water quality

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
would raise a tadpole bureaucrat

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in a sample of water in which they're interested.

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And we give them a couple of things to do that,

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to help them do companion animal devices

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
while they're blogging and doing their email.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is a tadpole walker

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to take your tadpole walking in the evening.

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And the interesting thing that happens --

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
because we're using tadpoles, of course,

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
several orders of magnitude more sensitive

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
than some of our senses

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
for sensing,

98
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
responding in a biologically meaningful way,

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to that whole class of industrial contaminants

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we call endocrine disruptors

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or hormone emulators.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening --

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
there's a few action shots --

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And then you have to introduce your tadpole

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and who it's named after.

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You have to explain what you're doing

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and how the developmental events of a tadpole

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
are, of course, very observable

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And so next time your neighbor sees you

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
they'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?"

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And you can let them social network with your tadpole,

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
for, not only impatients, humans,

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
but non-humans,

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
social networking for humans and non-humans.

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And of course, these endocrine disruptors

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the obesity epidemic,

121
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and other related things.

123
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,

124
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
observing the behavioral

125
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and developmental events,

126
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you will then go and introduce your tadpole

127
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to its namesake

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and discuss the evidence that you've seen.

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly,

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here --

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
instead of asking you for urine samples,

132
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I'll ask you for a mouse sample.

133
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse --

134
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a domestic partnership with mice?

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Very lucky.

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Mice, of course, are the quintessential

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
model organism.

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They're even better models of environmental health,

139
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because not only the same mammalian biology,

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but they share your diet, largely.

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
They share your environmental stressors,

142
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the asbestos levels and lead levels,

143
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
whatever you're exposed to.

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And they're geographically more limited than you are,

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because we don't know if you've been exposed

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to persistent organic pollutants

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in your home, or occupationally

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
or as a child.

149
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Mice are a very good representation.

150
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.

151
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is one of them.

152
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.

153
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Is anybody here on antidepressants?

154
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

155
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And we were testing if the mice

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
would also self-administer SSRIs.

158
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,

160
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.

161
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So do you think the mice

162
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
self-administered antidepressants?

163
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
What's the -- (Audience: Sure. Yes.)

164
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
How did you know that? They did.

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.

166
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Where's our expert?

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Vodka, gin --

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Audience: [unclear])

170
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They did, yes.

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
which was interesting.

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones --

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.

177
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We take the blood sample

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and do the blood work and hair work on the mice.

179
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I want to sort of point out the big advantage

180
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
of framing health in this external way.

181
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But we do have a few prescription products through this.

182
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's very different from the medical model.

183
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,

184
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
or to understand it or to change it,

185
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the benefits are enjoyed by anyone

186
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
you share that water quality or air quality with.

187
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And that aggregating effect,

188
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that collective action effect,

189
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is actually something we can use to our advantage.

190
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic

191
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
called the No Park.

192
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is a prescription to improve water quality.

193
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.

194
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
What we do is we take a fire hydrant,

195
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
a "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant,

196
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to create an engineered micro landscape,

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to create an infiltration opportunity.

199
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Because, many of you will know,

200
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that the biggest pollution burden

201
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now

202
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is no longer the point sources,

203
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
no longer the big polluters,

204
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
no longer the GEs,

205
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but that massive network of roads,

206
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
[those] impervious surfaces,

207
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners

208
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or the oily hydrocarbon waste

209
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
washes it straight into the estuary system.

211
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That doesn't do a lot of good.

212
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants

213
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
before they enter the harbor,

214
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and they're produced by impatients

215
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
on various city blocks

216
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in some very interesting ways.

217
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,

218
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
there's about two or three fire hydrants

219
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
on every city block.

220
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we don't prevent them from being used

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
as emergency vehicle parking spaces,

223
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.

224
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.

225
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But if we did this

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in every single --

227
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
every fire hydrant

228
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we could redefine the emergency.

229
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
That 99 percent of the time

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
when a firetruck is not parking there,

231
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
it's infiltrating pollutants.

232
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's also increasing fixing CO2s,

233
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
sequestering some of the airborne pollutants.

234
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And aggregated,

235
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
these smaller interceptions

236
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that now runs into the estuary system,

238
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.

239
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So these are small actions

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that can amount to a significant effect

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to improve local environmental health.

242
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This is one of the more ambitious ones.

243
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
What the climate crisis has revealed to us

244
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is a secondary, more insidious

245
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and more pervasive crisis,

246
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which is the crisis of agency,

247
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
which is what to do.

248
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Somehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,

249
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
driving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly,

250
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
doesn't seem sufficient

251
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in the face of climate crisis.

252
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And this is an interesting icon that happened --

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
you remember these: fallout shelters.

254
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
What is the fallout shelter

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
for the climate crisis?

256
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
This was civic mobilization.

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Churches, school groups,

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
hospitals, private residents --

259
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
everyone built one of these in a matter of months.

260
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And they still remain

261
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
as icons of civic response

262
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.

263
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Fallout shelter for the climate crisis,

264
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I would say, looks something like this, or this,

265
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
which is an intensive urban agriculture facility

266
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that's due to go on my lab building at NYU.

267
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
What it does

268
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
is a very simple idea

269
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of taking --

270
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan

271
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is building related --

272
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we take, just like a commercial greenhouse,

273
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we take the CO2 from the building --

274
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
CO2-enriched air --

275
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we force it through the urban agriculture facility,

276
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.

277
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.

278
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So it's on legs,

279
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.

280
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's built as a barn raising,

281
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
using open source hardware.

282
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
This is the quarter-scale prototype

283
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that was functioning in Spain.

284
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
This is what it will look like, fingers crossed,

285
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
NYU willing.

286
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And what I want to show you is --

287
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --

288
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
which is a solar chimney --

289
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment --

290
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that passively draws air up.

291
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You understand a solar chimney.

292
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Hot air rises.

293
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,

294
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.

295
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
What we do is actually

296
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.

297
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
That actually removes about 95 percent

298
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
of the carbon black,

299
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that stuff that, with ozone,

300
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is responsible for about half of global warming's effects,

301
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because it changes, it settles on the snow,

302
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it changes the reflectors,

303
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
it changes

304
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.

305
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Carbon black is that grime

306
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,

307
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and it's associated with.

308
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,

309
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
not from combustion itself.

310
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
When we put it through our solar chimney,

311
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
we remove actually about 95 percent of that.

312
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And then I swap it out

313
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
with the students

314
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and actually re-release that carbon black.

315
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime

316
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that we've pulled out of the air.

317
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Here's one of them that we have up now.

318
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.

319
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Okay, so I want to show you

320
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
just two more interfaces,

321
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because I think one of our big challenges

322
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,

323
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
not only through this model

324
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
of twisted personalized health,

325
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but through the animals

326
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
with whom we cohabit.

327
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We are not alone; the animals are moving in.

328
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
In fact, urban migration now describes

329
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the movement of animals formerly known as wild

330
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
into urban centers.

331
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,

332
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
elk in Westchester County.

333
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It's happening all over the Developed World,

334
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
probably for loss of habitat,

335
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but also because our cities are a little bit more livable

336
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
than they have been.

337
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And every green space we create

338
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.

339
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But we've kind of lacked imagination

340
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
in how we could do that well or interestingly.

341
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces

342
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ --

343
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
which is zoo backwards and without cages --

344
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
to try and reform

345
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
that relationship.

346
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.

347
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.

348
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
This is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,

349
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
each of which had a different argument on it,

350
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
different sound file.

351
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They said things like this.

352
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Whistling)

353
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.

354
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Go down there and buy some of those health food bars,

355
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
the ones you call bird food,

356
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and bring it here and scatter it around.

357
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
There's a good person.

358
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher)

359
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So there was several of these.

360
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The birds were able to jump from one to the other.

361
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
These are just your average urban pigeon.

362
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And an early test

363
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
which argument elicited cooperative behavior

364
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
from the people below --

365
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
about a hundred to one

366
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
decided that this was the argument

367
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that worked best on us.

368
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.

369
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
That's the sound of genetic mutations

370
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
of the avian flu

371
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
becoming a deadly human flu.

372
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Do you know what slows it down?

373
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Healthy sub-populations of birds,

374
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
increasing biodiversity generally.

375
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It is in your interests that I'm healthy,

376
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
happy, well-fed.

377
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources

378
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
instead of monopolizing them.

379
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
That is, share your lunch.

380
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
(Laughter)

381
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
NJ: It worked, and it's true.

382
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The final project I'd like to show you

383
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
is a new interface for fish

384
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
that has just been launched --

385
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
it's actually officially launched next week --

386
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.

387
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,

388
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but there is now a device for you to do so.

389
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
It looks like this: buoys that float on the water,

390
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
project three foot up, three foot down.

391
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.

392
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
This is what it looks like.

393
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
So there's another function on here.

394
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
This top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick --

395
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
this top light is actually a water quality display

396
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,

397
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.

398
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And then you can also text the fish.

399
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So there's business cards down there

400
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
that'll give you contact details.

401
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And they text back.

402
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.

403
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
But perhaps the most popular has been

404
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,

405
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
where the first beaver --

406
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
crazy as he is --

407
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to have moved in and built a lodge in New York

408
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in 250 years, hangs out.

409
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So updates from a beaver.

410
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.

411
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And what I like to think of

412
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
is this is an interface

413
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,

414
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
specifically by changing who has information,

415
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
where they have it,

416
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
who can make sense of that information,

417
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
and what you can do about it.

418
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,

419
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish --

420
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with

421
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that's in the middle of the city,

422
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and the largest pollution burden on it

423
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
is not the roadborne pollution,

424
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
it's actually white bread

425
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
from people feeding the fish and the birds.

426
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks

427
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
that you can feed the fish.

428
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
They're delicious.

429
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
They're cross-species delicious that is,

430
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
delicious for humans and non-humans.

431
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
But they also have a chelating agent in them.

432
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
They're nutritionally appropriate,

433
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
not like Doritos.

434
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And so every time

435
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that desire to interact with the animals,

436
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
which is at least as ubiquitous

437
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
as that sign: "Do not feed the animals."

438
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And there's about three of them on every New York City park.

439
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And Yellowstone National Park,

440
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
there's more "do not feed the animals" signs

441
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
than there are animals you might wish to feed.

442
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
But in that action, that interaction,

443
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
by re-scripting that,

444
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
by changing it into an opportunity

445
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,

446
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
that could augment the nutritional resources

447
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
that we ourselves have depleted

448
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
for augmenting the fish population

449
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and also adding chelating agent,

450
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,

451
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs

452
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
that are in the fish

453
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
living in this particular habitat

454
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt

455
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
where it's complexed by a reactive,

456
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
effectively removing it from bioavailability.

457
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
But I wanted to say that interaction,

458
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
re-scripting that interaction,

459
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
into collective action, collective remediative action,

460
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
very different from the approach

461
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,

462
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
where we're dredging the PCBs --

463
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,

464
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
GE's paying for the dredging

465
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
of the largest Superfund site in the world --

466
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania

467
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
or the nearest Third World country,

468
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
where it will continue to be toxic sludge.

469
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.

470
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
And that's typically the paradigm

471
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
under which we've operated.

472
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
By actually taking the opportunity

473
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
that new technologies,

474
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
new interactive technologies, present

475
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
to re-script our interactions,

476
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
to script them,

477
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
not just as isolated, individuated interactions,

478
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
but as collective aggregating actions

479
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
that can amount to something,

480
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
we can really begin to address

481
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
some of our important environmental challenges.

482
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Thank you.

483
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
(Applause)

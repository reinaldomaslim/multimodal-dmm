1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Most of the time, art and science stare at each other

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There is great confusion when the two look at each other.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,

5
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.

6
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative --

7
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
things that can be measured and described --

8
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.

9
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
In the Extreme Ice Survey,

10
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together,

11
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to merging the art and science

12
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to the end of helping us understand nature

13
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and humanity's relationship with nature better.

14
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Specifically, I as a person

15
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,

16
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
am firmly of the belief that photography, video, film

17
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
have tremendous powers for helping us understand

18
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and shape the way we think about nature

19
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and about ourselves in relationship to nature.

20
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.

21
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,

22
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the malleability of it,

23
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.

24
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
These first images are from Greenland.

25
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But ice has another meaning.

26
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Ice is the canary in the global coal mine.

27
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.

28
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.

29
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of

30
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is it raining more or is it raining less?

31
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder?

32
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?

33
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
All of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,

34
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
where the ice is, it's real and it's present.

35
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The changes are happening. They're very visible.

36
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
They're photographable. They're measurable.

37
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking.

38
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That's outside Antarctica.

39
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,

40
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.

41
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There is no significant scientific dispute about that.

42
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's been observed, it's measured, it's bomb-proof information.

43
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And the great irony and tragedy of our time

44
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.

45
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Science is not arguing about that.

46
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,

47
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old

48
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
breaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,

49
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
iceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise.

50
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career,

51
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,

52
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.

53
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements

54
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of what the paleoclimates -- the ancient climates -- were,

55
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
as recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,

56
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
as recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,

57
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.

58
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models,

59
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I decided that one day I would do a project

60
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.

61
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And that led me to this project.

62
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Initially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment --

63
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
conventional, single frame, still photography.

64
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And one crazy day, I got the idea that I should --

65
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
after that assignment was finished --

66
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,

67
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that I should station a camera or two at a glacier

68
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever

69
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and watch the progression of the landscape over time.

70
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Well, within about three weeks,

71
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras

72
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
into 25 time-lapse cameras.

73
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,

74
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
trying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.

75
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.

76
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer

77
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that tells the camera when to fire.

78
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,

79
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,

80
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and they watch the evolution of the landscape.

81
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.

82
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,

83
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.

84
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Actually, there's still a camera out there right now.

85
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.

86
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Some of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes.

87
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Here's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made.

88
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I personally obsessed about every nut, bolt and washer in these crazy things.

90
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I spent half my life at our local hardware store

91
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
during the months when we built these units originally.

92
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere.

93
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland,

94
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and we have repeat photography positions,

95
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that is places we just visit on an annual basis,

96
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia.

97
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight

98
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
as an ambassador for my whole team.

99
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There's a lot of people working on this right now.

100
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We've got 33 cameras out this moment.

101
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago

102
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
all across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened.

103
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work.

104
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We've been out for two and a half years,

105
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go.

106
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That's only half our job.

107
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public.

108
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You know, scientists have collected this kind of information

109
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.

110
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Similarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community,

111
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED,

112
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and like our relationship with the Obama White House,

113
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
with the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy

114
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
as much as possible with these pictures as well.

115
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.

116
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We have a site on Google Earth

117
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
that Google Earth was generous enough to give us,

118
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story,

119
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now.

120
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Now, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.

121
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph,

122
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads,

123
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
there would be no further societal argument about climate change

124
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because this is the story that counts.

125
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion.

126
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record.

127
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This exact same pattern is seen going back now

128
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
almost a million years before our current time.

129
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And several things are important.

130
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Number one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

131
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
go up and down basically in sync.

132
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You can see that from the orange line and the blue line.

133
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.

134
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
That's the natural cycle.

135
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Goes up to 280 and then drops

136
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here.

137
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But 280 is the peak.

138
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Right now, if you look at the top right part of that graph,

139
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we're at 385 parts per million.

140
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.

141
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Earth is having a fever.

142
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
In the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth

143
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
has gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius,

144
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and it's going to keep going up

145
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.

146
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.

147
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It's been a remorseless, steady increase.

148
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We have to turn that around.

149
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that

150
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places.

151
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But anyway, off to the world of ice.

152
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.

153
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This is a view of what's called the calving face.

154
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.

155
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
You see the glacier flowing in from the right,

156
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.

157
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
If you look in the middle background,

158
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.

159
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable,

160
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and you're about to see the consequences of that floating.

161
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
To give you a little bit of a sense of scale,

162
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that calving face in this picture

163
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
is about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.

164
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.

165
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,

166
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.

167
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep

168
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock,

169
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and floating if it isn't.

170
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Here's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska.

171
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.

172
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
This is an aerial picture we did this year.

173
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
That's the retreat of this glacier.

174
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The main stem, the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right

175
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and it's going very rapidly up that stem.

176
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks,

177
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile,

178
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed

179
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

180
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places,

181
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because as the glaciers --

182
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,

183
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
they're not normal landscapes --

184
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating,

185
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
like air is being let out of a balloon.

186
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And so, there are features on this landscape.

187
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,

188
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that shows you that a little bit.

189
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
There's a marker line called the trim line

190
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
above our little red illustration there.

191
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do --

192
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? --

193
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.

194
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984

195
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
has been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building.

196
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys

197
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.

198
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
These changes in the alpine world are accelerating.

199
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's not static.

200
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Particularly in the world of sea ice,

201
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,

202
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and the processes either are accelerating

203
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
or the predictions were too low to begin with.

204
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak.

205
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So, here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia.

206
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And you see where it ended in these various spring days,

207
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
June, May, then October.

208
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Now we turn on our time lapse.

209
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This camera was shooting every hour.

210
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Geologic process in action here.

211
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?

212
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier.

213
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Finally catches up to itself, it advances.

214
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And you can look at these pictures over and over again

215
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing

216
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
these things you don't normally get to see come alive.

217
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We've been talking about "seeing is believing "

218
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and seeing the unseen at TED Global.

219
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
That's what you see with these cameras.

220
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The images make the invisible visible.

221
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
These huge crevasses open up.

222
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
These great ice islands break off --

223
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and now watch this.

224
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This has been the springtime this year --

225
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
a huge collapse. That happened in about a month,

226
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the loss of all that ice.

227
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So that's where we started three years ago,

228
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the

229
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
last time we went into Columbia.

230
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat,

231
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
we did another cheesy illustration,

232
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
with British double-decker buses.

233
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was.

234
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's a long way.

235
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
On up to Iceland.

236
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
One of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.

237
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating.

238
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
You can see this river being formed.

239
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
You can see it deflating.

240
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
Without the photographic process, you would never see this. This is invisible.

241
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this,

242
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but the camera records it.

243
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So we wind time backwards now.

244
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We go back a couple years in time.

245
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
That's where it started.

246
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
That's where it ended a few months ago.

247
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And on up to Greenland.

248
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.

249
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Greenland took a little while to start reacting

250
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
to the warming climate of the past century,

251
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.

252
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there.

253
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It's a big place. That's all ice.

254
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick,

255
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.

256
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
The one glacier up in Greenland

257
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that puts more ice into the global ocean

258
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined

259
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
is the Ilulissat Glacier.

260
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat,

261
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat.

262
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Here's a two-year record of what that looks like.

263
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale, quickly dwarfed.

264
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
The calving face is four and a half miles across,

265
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.

266
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
So, imagine how big this is

267
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and how much ice is charging out.

268
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
The interior of Greenland is to the right.

269
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.

270
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Icebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea.

271
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago,

272
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
as you can see. June 25th,

273
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
monster calving events happened.

274
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I'll show you one of those in a second.

275
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.

276
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.

277
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It tends to go in these pulses, about every three days,

278
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
but on average, 125 feet a day,

279
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
twice the rate it did 20 years ago.

280
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier,

281
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film.

282
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We had nine cameras going.

283
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
This is what a couple of the cameras saw.

284
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.

285
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Huge icebergs rolling over.

286
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.

287
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.

288
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
A mile of retreat in 75 minutes

289
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
across the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.

290
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
The block was three-fifths of a mile deep,

291
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and if you compare the expanse of the calving face

292
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
to the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.

293
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Or if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building

294
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block,

295
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
it would be equivalent to how large that block was.

296
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
75 minutes.

297
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Now I've come to the conclusion

298
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
after spending a lot of time in this climate change world

299
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
that we don't have a problem of economics, technology and public policy.

300
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
We have a problem of perception.

301
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,

302
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
but we actually can deal with them.

303
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
I'm certain that we can.

304
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
But what we have is a perception problem

305
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
because not enough people really get it yet.

306
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
You're an elite audience. You get it.

307
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world

308
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:27,000
are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.

309
0:18:27.33,000 --> 0:18:3,000
But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.

310
0:18:30.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And that's where I think organizations like TED,

311
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact

312
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
on human perception and bring us along.

313
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Because I believe we have an opportunity right now.

314
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:45,000
We are nearly on the edge of a crisis,

315
0:18:45.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge

316
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
of our generation and, in fact, of our century.

317
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:56,000
This is a terrific, terrific call to arms

318
0:18:56.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.

319
0:18:59.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature

320
0:19:02.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you.

321
0:19:06.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
(Applause)

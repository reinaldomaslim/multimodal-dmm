1
0:00:13.084,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I grew up

2
0:00:15.057,000 --> 0:00:19,000
diagnosed as phobically shy,

3
0:00:19.86,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and, like at least 20 other people

4
0:00:22.514,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in a room of this size,

5
0:00:24.938,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I was a stutterer.

6
0:00:26.558,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Do you dare raise your hand?

7
0:00:29.218,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,

8
0:00:33.274,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because when we are treated that way,

9
0:00:38.126,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we feel invisible sometimes,

10
0:00:41.19,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or talked around and at.

11
0:00:43.823,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And as I started to look at people,

12
0:00:46.648,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which is mostly all I did,

13
0:00:49.394,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I noticed that some people

14
0:00:51.632,000 --> 0:00:56,000
really wanted attention and recognition.

15
0:00:56.986,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Remember, I was young then.

16
0:00:59.17,000 --> 0:01:,000
So what did they do?

17
0:01:00.207,000 --> 0:01:02,000
What we still do perhaps too often.

18
0:01:02.847,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We talk about ourselves.

19
0:01:05.58,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And yet there are other people I observed

20
0:01:07.957,000 --> 0:01:1,000
who had what I called a mutuality mindset.

21
0:01:11.546,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In each situation, they found a way to talk about us

22
0:01:15.142,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and create that "us" idea.

23
0:01:17.532,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So my idea to reimagine the world

24
0:01:19.627,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is to see it one where we all become

25
0:01:22.493,000 --> 0:01:26,000
greater opportunity-makers with and for others.

26
0:01:27.078,000 --> 0:01:29,000
There's no greater opportunity

27
0:01:29.658,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or call for action for us now

28
0:01:32.974,000 --> 0:01:34,000
than to become opportunity-makers

29
0:01:35.34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
who use best talents together more often

30
0:01:37.99,000 --> 0:01:38,000
for the greater good

31
0:01:39.212,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and accomplish things we couldn't have done on our own.

32
0:01:42.291,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I want to talk to you about that,

33
0:01:44.765,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because even more than giving,

34
0:01:47.165,000 --> 0:01:5,000
even more than giving,

35
0:01:50.93,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is the capacity for us to do something smarter

36
0:01:54.902,000 --> 0:01:57,000
together for the greater good

37
0:01:58.406,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that lifts us both up

38
0:02:00.277,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and that can scale.

39
0:02:02.147,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That's why I'm sitting here.

40
0:02:03.925,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But I also want to point something else out:

41
0:02:07.717,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Each one of you

42
0:02:10.226,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is better than anybody else at something.

43
0:02:14.74,000 --> 0:02:16,000
That disproves that popular notion

44
0:02:17.724,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that if you're the smartest person in the room,

45
0:02:20.66,000 --> 0:02:22,000
you're in the wrong room.

46
0:02:22.684,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:24.901,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So let me tell you about

48
0:02:27.111,000 --> 0:02:29,000
a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back,

49
0:02:29.749,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I met this up-and-coming actress,

50
0:02:32.11,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and we were soon talking about something

51
0:02:33.8,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that we both felt passionately about: public art.

52
0:02:37.641,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And she had the fervent belief

53
0:02:39.032,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that every new building in Los Angeles

54
0:02:42.618,000 --> 0:02:43,000
should have public art in it.

55
0:02:43.95,000 --> 0:02:44,000
She wanted a regulation for it,

56
0:02:45.698,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and she fervently started —

57
0:02:47.253,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who is here from Chicago? —

58
0:02:49.155,000 --> 0:02:51,000
she fervently started talking about

59
0:02:51.479,000 --> 0:02:53,000
these bean-shaped reflective sculptures

60
0:02:54.464,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in Millennium Park,

61
0:02:56.127,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and people would walk up to it

62
0:02:58.36,000 --> 0:03:,000
and they'd smile in the reflection of it,

63
0:03:00.651,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and they'd pose and they'd vamp

64
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and they'd take selfies together,

65
0:03:04.702,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and they'd laugh.

66
0:03:08.08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And as she was talking, a thought came to my mind.

67
0:03:10.764,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I said, "I know someone you ought to meet.

68
0:03:13.783,000 --> 0:03:15,000
He's getting out of San Quentin in a couple of weeks" —

69
0:03:16.298,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter) —

70
0:03:18.278,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"and he shares your fervent desire

71
0:03:20.74,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that art should engage and enable people to connect."

72
0:03:23.936,000 --> 0:03:27,000
He spent five years in solitary,

73
0:03:28.07,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin,

74
0:03:31.08,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and he's articulate

75
0:03:33.61,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and he's rather easy on the eyes because he's buff.

76
0:03:36.898,000 --> 0:03:38,000
He had workout regime he did every day.

77
0:03:39.482,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:41.519,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I think she was following me at that point.

79
0:03:43.396,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I said, "He'd be an unexpected ally."

80
0:03:45.939,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And not just that. There's James. He's an architect

81
0:03:48.784,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and he's a professor, and he loves place-making,

82
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and place-making is when you have

83
0:03:53.463,000 --> 0:03:56,000
those mini-plazas and those urban walkways

84
0:03:57.057,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and where they're dotted with art,

85
0:03:59.257,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where people draw and come up and talk sometimes.

86
0:04:03.15,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I think they'd make good allies.

87
0:04:05.545,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And indeed they were.

88
0:04:08.696,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They met together. They prepared.

89
0:04:10.866,000 --> 0:04:13,000
They spoke in front of the Los Angeles City Council.

90
0:04:14.51,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And the council members not only passed the regulation,

91
0:04:17.225,000 --> 0:04:21,000
half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards.

92
0:04:21.308,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They were startling, compelling and credible.

93
0:04:26.764,000 --> 0:04:29,000
You can't buy that.

94
0:04:30.206,000 --> 0:04:32,000
What I'm asking you to consider

95
0:04:32.276,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is what kind of opportunity- makers we might become,

96
0:04:34.973,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because more than wealth

97
0:04:37.82,000 --> 0:04:41,000
or fancy titles

98
0:04:41.869,000 --> 0:04:45,000
or a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect

99
0:04:45.909,000 --> 0:04:47,000
around each other's better side and bring it out.

100
0:04:48.249,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I'm not saying this is easy,

101
0:04:50.551,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and I'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too

102
0:04:53.106,000 --> 0:04:55,000
about who you wanted to connect with,

103
0:04:55.98,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but what I want to suggest is,

104
0:04:58.574,000 --> 0:05:01,000
this is an opportunity.

105
0:05:01.92,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I started thinking about it

106
0:05:04.144,000 --> 0:05:06,000
way back when I was a Wall Street Journal reporter

107
0:05:06.686,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and I was in Europe and I was supposed to cover trends

108
0:05:09.104,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and trends that transcended business

109
0:05:11.647,000 --> 0:05:13,000
or politics or lifestyle.

110
0:05:13.941,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So I had to have contacts

111
0:05:16.315,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in different worlds very different than mine,

112
0:05:18.283,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.

113
0:05:20.657,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And third, I had to write the story

114
0:05:23.627,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in a way stepping into the reader's shoes,

115
0:05:25.664,000 --> 0:05:29,000
so they could see how these trends could affect their lives.

116
0:05:29.754,000 --> 0:05:32,000
That's what opportunity-makers do.

117
0:05:33.274,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And here's a strange thing:

118
0:05:36.703,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Unlike an increasing number of Americans

119
0:05:39.919,000 --> 0:05:42,000
who are working and living and playing with people

120
0:05:43.365,000 --> 0:05:45,000
who think exactly like them

121
0:05:45.634,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because we then become more rigid and extreme,

122
0:05:48.306,000 --> 0:05:51,000
opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations

123
0:05:52.006,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with people unlike them,

124
0:05:54.263,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and they're building relationships,

125
0:05:56.106,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and because they do that,

126
0:05:58.334,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they have trusted relationships

127
0:06:00.212,000 --> 0:06:02,000
where they can bring the right team in

128
0:06:02.363,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and recruit them to solve a problem better and faster

129
0:06:06.18,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and seize more opportunities.

130
0:06:07.755,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They're not affronted by differences,

131
0:06:15.374,000 --> 0:06:17,000
they're fascinated by them,

132
0:06:17.607,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and that is a huge shift in mindset,

133
0:06:20.513,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and once you feel it, you want it to happen a lot more.

134
0:06:23.415,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This world is calling out for us to have a collective mindset,

135
0:06:28.469,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and I believe in doing that.

136
0:06:30.851,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's especially important now.

137
0:06:33.156,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Why is it important now?

138
0:06:35.968,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Because things can be devised like drones

139
0:06:40.515,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and drugs and data collection,

140
0:06:44.529,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and they can be devised by more people

141
0:06:46.644,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes

142
0:06:50.637,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and then, as we know from the news every day,

143
0:06:52.977,000 --> 0:06:54,000
they can be used for dangerous ones.

144
0:06:55.124,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It calls on us, each of us,

145
0:06:58.468,000 --> 0:07:,000
to a higher calling.

146
0:07:01.204,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But here's the icing on the cake:

147
0:07:03.96,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's not just the first opportunity

148
0:07:06.216,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that you do with somebody else

149
0:07:08.367,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that's probably your greatest,

150
0:07:10.123,000 --> 0:07:12,000
as an institution or an individual.

151
0:07:12.767,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It's after you've had that experience

152
0:07:14.959,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and you trust each other.

153
0:07:16.904,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's the unexpected things

154
0:07:18.715,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that you devise later on

155
0:07:20.539,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you never could have predicted.

156
0:07:22.733,000 --> 0:07:27,000
For example, Marty is the husband of that actress I mentioned,

157
0:07:28.343,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and he watched them when they were practicing,

158
0:07:30.673,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and he was soon talking to Wally,

159
0:07:32.192,000 --> 0:07:33,000
my friend the ex-con,

160
0:07:33.586,000 --> 0:07:35,000
about that exercise regime.

161
0:07:36.048,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And he thought,

162
0:07:37.356,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I have a set of racquetball courts.

163
0:07:39.536,000 --> 0:07:4,000
That guy could teach it.

164
0:07:40.86,000 --> 0:07:43,000
A lot of people who work there are members at my courts.

165
0:07:44.313,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They're frequent travelers.

166
0:07:45.982,000 --> 0:07:46,000
They could practice in their hotel room,

167
0:07:47.834,000 --> 0:07:49,000
no equipment provided.

168
0:07:49.95,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's how Wally got hired.

169
0:07:52.547,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Not only that, years later

170
0:07:53.936,000 --> 0:07:55,000
he was also teaching racquetball.

171
0:07:56.165,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Years after that,

172
0:07:57.576,000 --> 0:08:,000
he was teaching the racquetball teachers.

173
0:08:00.657,000 --> 0:08:04,000
What I'm suggesting is, when you connect with people

174
0:08:05.612,000 --> 0:08:09,000
around a shared interest and action,

175
0:08:09.719,000 --> 0:08:11,000
you're accustomed to serendipitous

176
0:08:12.059,000 --> 0:08:14,000
things happening into the future,

177
0:08:14.433,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and I think that's what we're looking at.

178
0:08:16.717,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We open ourselves up to those opportunities,

179
0:08:19.361,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and in this room are key players in technology,

180
0:08:23.208,000 --> 0:08:26,000
key players who are uniquely positioned to do this,

181
0:08:26.296,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to scale systems and projects together.

182
0:08:30.079,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So here's what I'm calling for you to do.

183
0:08:32.572,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers.

184
0:08:35.928,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength

185
0:08:40.817,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and they become pattern seekers.

186
0:08:44.541,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They get involved in different worlds than their worlds

187
0:08:48.883,000 --> 0:08:5,000
so they're trusted and they can see those patterns,

188
0:08:51.485,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and they communicate to connect

189
0:08:53.394,000 --> 0:08:56,000
around sweet spots of shared interest.

190
0:08:56.54,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So what I'm asking you is,

191
0:08:59.356,000 --> 0:09:,000
the world is hungry.

192
0:09:01.178,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I truly believe, in my firsthand experience,

193
0:09:03.945,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the world is hungry for us

194
0:09:06.656,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to unite together as opportunity-makers

195
0:09:09.312,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and to emulate those behaviors

196
0:09:11.316,000 --> 0:09:12,000
as so many of you already do —

197
0:09:12.922,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I know that firsthand —

198
0:09:15.948,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and to reimagine a world

199
0:09:17.77,000 --> 0:09:19,000
where we use our best talents together

200
0:09:19.964,000 --> 0:09:22,000
more often to accomplish greater things together

201
0:09:23.278,000 --> 0:09:26,000
than we could on our own.

202
0:09:26.994,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Just remember,

203
0:09:29.304,000 --> 0:09:31,000
as Dave Liniger once said,

204
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
"You can't succeed

205
0:09:34.429,000 --> 0:09:37,000
coming to the potluck with only a fork."

206
0:09:37.568,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:39.525,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Thank you very much.

208
0:09:41.096,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Thank you. (Applause)

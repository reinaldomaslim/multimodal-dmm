1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This is a picture of Maurice Druon,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the French Academy.

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
befitting the role of the French Academy

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
as legislating the

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
correct usage in French

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and perpetuating the language.

9
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The French Academy has two main tasks:

10
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it compiles a dictionary of official French.

11
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They're now working on their ninth edition,

12
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.

13
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They also legislate on correct usage,

14
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
such as the proper term for what the French call "email,"

15
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which ought to be "courriel."

16
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The World Wide Web, the French are told,

17
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
ought to be referred to as

18
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"la toile d'araignee mondiale" -- the Global Spider Web --

19
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:23,000
recommendations that the French gaily ignore.

20
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now, this is one model of how language comes to be:

21
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
namely, it's legislated by an academy.

22
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But anyone who looks at language realizes

23
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that this is a rather silly conceit,

24
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.

25
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language --

26
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,

27
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it will already be well out of date.

28
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We see it in the

29
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
constant appearance of slang and jargon,

30
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of the historical change in languages,

31
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
in divergence of dialects

32
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and the formation of new languages.

33
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,

34
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so much as a window onto human nature.

35
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
In a book that I'm currently working on,

36
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I hope to use language to shed light on

37
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a number of aspects of human nature,

38
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
including the cognitive machinery

39
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with which humans conceptualize the world

40
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and the relationship types that govern human interaction.

41
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.

42
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Let me start off with a technical problem in language

43
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that I've worried about for quite some time --

44
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and indulge me

45
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in my passion for verbs and how they're used.

46
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?

47
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.

48
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.

49
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Let me give you a quick reminder

50
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of something that you've long forgotten.

51
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
An intransitive verb, such as "dine," for example,

52
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
can't take a direct object.

53
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You have to say, "Sam dined," not, "Sam dined the pizza."

54
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
A transitive verb mandates

55
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that there has to be an object there:

56
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured."

57
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,

58
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
each of which shapes its sentence.

59
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So, a problem in explaining how children learn language,

60
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors,

61
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and a problem in programming computers to use language is

62
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which verbs go in which constructions.

63
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
For example, the dative construction in English.

64
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You can say, "Give a muffin to a mouse," the prepositional dative.

65
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Or, "Give a mouse a muffin," the double-object dative.

66
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on.

67
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.

68
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So a tempting generalization for a child,

69
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:47,000
for an adult, for a computer

70
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is that any verb that can appear in the construction,

71
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
"subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient"

72
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
can also be expressed as "subject-verb-recipient-thing."

73
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
A handy thing to have,

74
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because language is infinite,

75
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard.

76
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You've got to extract generalizations

77
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so you can produce and understand new sentences.

78
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This would be an example of how to do that.

79
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Unfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.

80
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You can say, "Biff drove the car to Chicago,"

81
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but not, "Biff drove Chicago the car."

82
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You can say, "Sal gave Jason a headache,"

83
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but it's a bit odd to say, "Sal gave a headache to Jason."

84
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,

85
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:29,000
are not synonymous,

86
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that when you crank up the microscope

87
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference

88
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in meaning between them.

89
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So, "give the X to the Y,"

90
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that construction corresponds to the thought

91
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"cause X to go to Y." Whereas "give the Y the X"

92
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
corresponds to the thought "cause Y to have X."

93
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now, many events can be subject to either construal,

94
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,

95
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in which you can either pay attention

96
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to the particular object,

97
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in which case the space around it recedes from attention,

98
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or you can see the faces in the empty space,

99
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in which case the object recedes out of consciousness.

100
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
How are these construals reflected in language?

101
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected

102
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is expressed as the direct object,

103
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the noun after the verb.

104
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere --

105
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
where you're doing something to the muffin --

106
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."

107
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
When you construe it as "cause the mouse to have something,"

108
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
you're doing something to the mouse,

109
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and therefore you express it as, "Give the mouse the muffin."

110
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So which verbs go in which construction --

111
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the problem with which I began --

112
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion

113
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or a kind of possession change.

114
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
To give something involves both causing something to go

115
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and causing someone to have.

116
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
To drive the car only causes something to go,

117
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.

118
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Only humans can possess things.

119
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,

120
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head

121
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and causing it to go to the other person,

122
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and implanting it in them.

123
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
You may just be loud or obnoxious,

124
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
or some other way causing them to have the headache.

125
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So, that's

126
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.

127
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So why should anyone care?

128
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,

129
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:26,000
from this and many similar kinds of analyses

130
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of hundreds of English verbs.

131
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
First, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,

132
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which we automatically and unconsciously compute

133
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
every time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.

134
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
You can think of this as the language of thought, or "mentalese."

135
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts,

136
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs --

137
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
not only in English, but in all other languages --

138
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
fundamental concepts such as space,

139
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
time, causation and human intention,

140
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
such as, what is the means and what is the ends?

141
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories

142
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that Immanuel Kant argued

143
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
are the basic framework for human thought,

144
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language

145
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
seems to reflect these Kantian categories.

146
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Doesn't care about perceptual qualities,

147
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
such as color, texture, weight and speed,

148
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which virtually never differentiate

149
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the use of verbs in different constructions.

150
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English

151
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
are used not only literally,

152
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but in a quasi-metaphorical way.

153
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
For example, this construction, the dative,

154
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is used not only to transfer things,

155
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,

156
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
as when we say, "She told a story to me"

157
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or "told me a story,"

158
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish."

159
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's exactly the same construction,

160
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.

161
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It evokes the container metaphor of communication,

162
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in which we conceive of ideas as objects,

163
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
sentences as containers,

164
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and communication as a kind of sending.

165
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
As when we say we "gather" our ideas, to "put" them "into" words,

166
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and if our words aren't "empty" or "hollow,"

167
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
we might get these ideas "across" to a listener,

168
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
who can "unpack" our words to "extract" their "content."

169
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.

170
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's very hard to find any example of abstract language

171
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that is not based on some concrete metaphor.

172
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
For example, you can use the verb "go"

173
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and the prepositions "to" and "from"

174
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in a literal, spatial sense.

175
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."

176
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
You can also say, "Biff went from sick to well."

177
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,

178
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but it's as if his health is a point in state space

179
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that you conceptualize as moving.

180
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Or, "The meeting went from three to four,"

181
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.

182
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Likewise, we use "force" to indicate

183
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
not only physical force,

184
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
as in, "Rose forced the door to open,"

185
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but also interpersonal force,

186
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:55,000
as in, "Rose forced Sadie to go," not necessarily by manhandling her,

187
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but by issuing a threat.

188
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Or, "Rose forced herself to go,"

189
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as if there were two entities inside Rose's head,

190
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
engaged in a tug of a war.

191
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive

192
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of a given event in two different ways,

193
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
such as "cause something to go to someone"

194
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and "causing someone to have something,"

195
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I think is a fundamental feature of human thought,

196
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and it's the basis for much human argumentation,

197
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in which people don't differ so much on the facts

198
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
as on how they ought to be construed.

199
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Just to give you a few examples:

200
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"ending a pregnancy" versus "killing a fetus;"

201
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
"a ball of cells" versus "an unborn child;"

202
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
"invading Iraq" versus "liberating Iraq;"

203
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:39,000
"redistributing wealth" versus "confiscating earnings."

204
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And I think the biggest picture of all

205
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
would take seriously the fact

206
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that so much of our verbiage about abstract events

207
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is based on a concrete metaphor

208
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and see human intelligence itself

209
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
as consisting of a repertoire of concepts --

210
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
such as objects, space, time, causation and intention --

211
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:01,000
which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,

212
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
whose evolution you can well imagine,

213
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and a process of metaphorical abstraction

214
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that allows us to bleach these concepts

215
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
of their original conceptual content --

216
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
space, time and force --

217
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and apply them to new abstract domains,

218
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
therefore allowing a species that evolved

219
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to deal with rocks and tools and animals,

220
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law

221
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and other abstract domains.

222
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Well, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature --

223
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,

224
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types

225
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that govern human social interaction,

226
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
again, as reflected in language.

227
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.

228
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie "Fargo."

229
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And you might remember the scene in which

230
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,

231
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is asked to show his driver's license

232
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and holds his wallet out

233
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
with a 50-dollar bill extending

234
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
at a slight angle out of the wallet.

235
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And he says, "I was just thinking

236
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,"

237
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
which everyone, including the audience,

238
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
interprets as a veiled bribe.

239
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.

240
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
For example, in polite requests,

241
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
if someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole,

242
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that would be awesome,"

243
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we know exactly what he means,

244
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
even though that's a rather bizarre

245
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
concept being expressed.

246
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Laughter)

247
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"

248
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I think most people

249
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
understand the intent behind that.

250
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And likewise, if someone says,

251
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
"Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it" --

252
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter) --

253
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we understand that as a veiled threat,

254
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.

255
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So the puzzle is, why are bribes,

256
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?

257
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
No one's fooled.

258
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Both parties know exactly what the speaker means,

259
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
and the speaker knows the listener knows

260
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.

261
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So what's going on?

262
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I think the key idea is that language

263
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
is a way of negotiating relationships,

264
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and human relationships fall into a number of types.

265
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:16,000
There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,

266
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in which relationships can be categorized, more or less,

267
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
into communality, which works on the principle

268
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
"what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,"

269
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;

270
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
dominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;"

271
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:35,000
reciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;"

272
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."

273
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Now, relationship types can be negotiated.

274
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Even though there are default situations

275
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in which one of these mindsets can be applied,

276
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
they can be stretched and extended.

277
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:54,000
For example, communality applies most naturally

278
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
within family or friends,

279
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but it can be used to try to transfer

280
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
the mentality of sharing

281
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.

282
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:08,000
For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,

283
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
sororities, locutions like "the family of man,"

284
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
you try to get people who are not related

285
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to use the relationship type that would ordinarily

286
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
be appropriate to close kin.

287
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type,

288
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.

289
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
If you went over and you helped yourself

290
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to a shrimp off your boss' plate,

291
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
for example, that would be an awkward situation.

292
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Or if a dinner guest after the meal

293
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,

294
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that would be rather awkward as well.

295
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
In less blatant cases,

296
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.

297
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
In the workplace, for example,

298
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
there's often a tension over whether an employee

299
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
can socialize with the boss,

300
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
or refer to him or her

301
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:54,000
on a first-name basis.

302
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
If two friends have a

303
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
reciprocal transaction, like selling a car,

304
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:,000
it's well known that this can be a source

305
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
of tension or awkwardness.

306
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
In dating, the transition

307
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
from friendship to sex

308
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
can lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,

309
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and as can sex in the workplace,

310
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
in which we call the conflict between a

311
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:17,000
dominant and a sexual relationship "sexual harassment."

312
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Well, what does this have to do with language?

313
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Well, language, as a social interaction,

314
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
has to satisfy two conditions.

315
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
You have to convey the actual content --

316
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
here we get back to the container metaphor.

317
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,

318
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
the solicitation and so on,

319
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
but you also have to negotiate

320
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and maintain the kind of relationship

321
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
you have with the other person.

322
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:42,000
The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:

323
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the literal form signals

324
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
the safest relationship with the listener,

325
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
whereas the implicated content --

326
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform --

327
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:54,000
allows the listener to derive the interpretation

328
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
which is most relevant in context,

329
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
which possibly initiates a changed relationship.

330
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:03,000
The simplest example of this is in the polite request.

331
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
If you express your request as a conditional --

332
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
"if you could open the window, that would be great" --

333
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
even though the content is an imperative,

334
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
the fact that you're not using the imperative voice

335
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance,

336
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.

337
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.

338
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
By expressing it as an if-then statement,

339
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
you can get the message across

340
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:32,000
without appearing to boss another person around.

341
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And in a more subtle way, I think, this works

342
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
for all of the veiled speech acts

343
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
involving plausible deniability:

344
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the bribes, threats, propositions,

345
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:42,000
solicitations and so on.

346
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like

347
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
if language -- where it could only be used literally.

348
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And you can think of it in terms of a

349
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
game-theoretic payoff matrix.

350
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Put yourself in the position of the

351
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:57,000
kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.

352
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
There's a high stakes

353
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
in the two possibilities

354
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.

355
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
If you don't bribe the officer,

356
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:1,000
then you will get a traffic ticket --

357
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:12,000
or, as is the case of "Fargo," worse --

358
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:14,000
whether the honest officer

359
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:16,000
is honest or dishonest.

360
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

361
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:21,000
In that case, the consequences are rather severe.

362
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
On the other hand, if you extend the bribe,

363
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
if the officer is dishonest,

364
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
you get a huge payoff of going free.

365
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
If the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty

366
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
of being arrested for bribery.

367
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
So this is a rather fraught situation.

368
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
On the other hand, with indirect language,

369
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
if you issue a veiled bribe,

370
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:41,000
then the dishonest officer

371
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
could interpret it as a bribe,

372
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
in which case you get the payoff of going free.

373
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:49,000
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe,

374
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.

375
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So you get the best of both worlds.

376
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And a similar analysis, I think,

377
0:16:57,000 --> 0:16:59,000
can apply to the potential awkwardness

378
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
of a sexual solicitation,

379
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.

380
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I think this affirms

381
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:08,000
something that's long been known by diplomats --

382
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:1,000
namely, that the vagueness of language,

383
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:13,000
far from being a bug or an imperfection,

384
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
actually might be a feature of language,

385
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
one that we use to our advantage in social interactions.

386
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So to sum up: language is a collective human creation,

387
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:24,000
reflecting human nature,

388
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:26,000
how we conceptualize reality,

389
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
how we relate to one another.

390
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language,

391
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.

392
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Thank you very much.

393
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.625,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So when you think about a child, a close friend, or a romantic partner,

2
0:00:17.333,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the word "love" probably comes to mind,

3
0:00:20.25,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and instantly other emotions rush in:

4
0:00:23.417,000 --> 0:00:24,000
joy and hope,

5
0:00:25.042,000 --> 0:00:28,000
excitement, trust and security,

6
0:00:28.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and yes, sometimes sadness and disappointment.

7
0:00:31.708,000 --> 0:00:33,000
There might not be a word in the dictionary

8
0:00:33.792,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that more of us are connected to than love.

9
0:00:37.292,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Yet, given its central importance in our lives,

10
0:00:39.917,000 --> 0:00:42,000
isn't it interesting that we're never explicitly taught how to love?

11
0:00:44.458,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We build friendships,

12
0:00:46.167,000 --> 0:00:48,000
navigate early romantic relationships,

13
0:00:48.667,000 --> 0:00:5,000
get married and bring babies home from the hospital

14
0:00:51.125,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with the expectation that we'll figure it out.

15
0:00:54.625,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But the truth is, we often harm and disrespect the ones we love.

16
0:00:58.5,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It can be subtle things

17
0:00:59.833,000 --> 0:01:01,000
like guilting a friend into spending time with you

18
0:01:02.708,000 --> 0:01:05,000
or sneaking a peak at your partner's texts

19
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or shaming a child for their lack of effort at school.

20
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
100 percent of us will be on the receiving end

21
0:01:12.208,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of unhealthy relationship behaviors

22
0:01:14.542,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and 100 percent of us will do unhealthy things.

23
0:01:17.875,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's part of being human.

24
0:01:20.833,000 --> 0:01:22,000
In its worst form, the harm we inflict on loved ones

25
0:01:23.375,000 --> 0:01:24,000
shows up as abuse and violence,

26
0:01:25.333,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and relationship abuse

27
0:01:27.083,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is something that one in three women and one in four men

28
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:31,000
will experience in their lifetime.

29
0:01:32.625,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now, if you're like most people, when you hear those stats,

30
0:01:35.458,000 --> 0:01:37,000
you'll go, "Oh, no, no, no, that would never happen to me."

31
0:01:38.292,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It's instinctual to move away from the words "abuse" and "violence,"

32
0:01:41.75,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to think that they happen to someone else somewhere else.

33
0:01:45.625,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But the truth is, unhealthy relationships and abuse are all around us.

34
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We just call them different things and ignore the connection.

35
0:01:54.042,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Abuse sneaks up on us disguised in unhealthy love.

36
0:01:59.708,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I work for an organization called One Love

37
0:02:01.792,000 --> 0:02:04,000
started by a family whose daughter Yeardley was killed by her ex-boyfriend.

38
0:02:06.833,000 --> 0:02:09,000
This was a tragedy no one saw coming,

39
0:02:09.875,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but when they looked back, they realized the warning signs were there

40
0:02:13.167,000 --> 0:02:15,000
just no one understood what they were seeing.

41
0:02:16.042,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Called crazy or drama or too much drinking,

42
0:02:19.833,000 --> 0:02:22,000
his actions weren't understood to be what they really were,

43
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which was clear signs of danger.

44
0:02:25.917,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Her family realized that if anyone had been educated about these signs,

45
0:02:29.75,000 --> 0:02:3,000
her death could have been prevented.

46
0:02:32.625,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So today we're on a mission to make sure

47
0:02:34.583,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that others have the information that Yeardley and her friends didn't.

48
0:02:37.893,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We have three main goals:

49
0:02:39.667,000 --> 0:02:42,000
give all of us a language for talking about a subject

50
0:02:42.958,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that's quite awkward and uncomfortable to discuss;

51
0:02:46.375,000 --> 0:02:5,000
empower a whole front line, namely friends, to help;

52
0:02:51.25,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and, in the process, improve all of our ability to love better.

53
0:02:55.875,000 --> 0:02:58,000
To do this, it's always important to start by illuminating

54
0:02:59.167,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the unhealthy signs that we frequently miss,

55
0:03:01.917,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and our work really focuses on creating content

56
0:03:04.417,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to start conversations with young people.

57
0:03:07.375,000 --> 0:03:09,000
As you'd expect, most of our content is pretty serious,

58
0:03:10.042,000 --> 0:03:11,000
given the subject at hand,

59
0:03:11.917,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but today I'm going to use one of our more light-hearted

60
0:03:14.583,000 --> 0:03:15,000
yet still thought-provoking pieces,

61
0:03:16.417,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"The Couplets,"

62
0:03:17.75,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to illuminate five markers of unhealthy love.

63
0:03:21.375,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The first is intensity.

64
0:03:24.375,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Video) Blue: I haven't seen you in a couple days. I've missed you.

65
0:03:27.583,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Orange: I've missed you too. (#thatslove)

66
0:03:29.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Blue: I haven't seen you in five minutes. It feels like a lifetime.

67
0:03:32.75,000 --> 0:03:34,000
What have you been doing without me for five whole minutes?

68
0:03:35.583,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Orange: It's been three minutes. (#thatsnotlove)

69
0:03:38.042,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Katie Hood: Anybody recognize that? I don't know. I do.

70
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Abusive relationships don't start out abusive.

71
0:03:44.208,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They start out exciting and exhilarating.

72
0:03:46.208,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There's an intensity of affection and emotion, a rush.

73
0:03:49.542,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It feels really good.

74
0:03:51.25,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You feel so lucky, like you've hit the jackpot.

75
0:03:54.75,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But in unhealthy love, these feelings shift over time

76
0:03:57.958,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from exciting to overwhelming and maybe a little bit suffocating.

77
0:04:02.875,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You feel it in your gut.

78
0:04:04.625,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Maybe it's when your new boyfriend or girlfriend

79
0:04:06.917,000 --> 0:04:08,000
says "I love you" faster than you were ready for

80
0:04:09.208,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or starts showing up everywhere, texting and calling a lot.

81
0:04:13.667,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Maybe they're impatient when you're slow to respond,

82
0:04:16.833,000 --> 0:04:18,000
even though they know you had other things going on that day.

83
0:04:20.583,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's important to remember that it's not how a relationship starts that matters,

84
0:04:24.417,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it's how it evolves.

85
0:04:25.958,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's important in the early days of a new relationship

86
0:04:28.541,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to pay attention to how you're feeling.

87
0:04:30.583,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Are you comfortable with the pace of intimacy?

88
0:04:33.208,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Do you feel like you have space and room to breathe?

89
0:04:36.792,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's also really important to start practicing using your voice

90
0:04:40.542,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to talk about your own needs.

91
0:04:42.417,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Are your requests respected?

92
0:04:45.833,000 --> 0:04:48,000
A second marker is isolation.

93
0:04:49.292,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Video) Orange 2: Want to hang out?

94
0:04:51.042,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Orange 1: Me and my boyfriend always have Monday Funday.

95
0:04:54.375,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Orange 2: Want to hang out?

96
0:04:55.708,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Orange 1: Me and my boyfriend always have Monday Funday.

97
0:04:58.375,000 --> 0:05:,000
Orange 2: Tomorrow? Orange 1: It's our Tuesday Snooze Day.

98
0:05:01.125,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Orange 2: Wednesday? Orange 1: No Friends Day.

99
0:05:04.792,000 --> 0:05:07,000
KH: If you ask me, isolation is one of the most frequently missed

100
0:05:07.875,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and misunderstood signs of unhealthy love.

101
0:05:10.25,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Why?

102
0:05:11.542,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Because every new relationship starts out with this intense desire

103
0:05:14.708,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to spend time together,

104
0:05:16.083,000 --> 0:05:18,000
it's easy to miss when something shifts.

105
0:05:19.042,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Isolation creeps in when your new boyfriend or girlfriend

106
0:05:21.792,000 --> 0:05:23,000
starts pulling you away from your friends and family,

107
0:05:24.667,000 --> 0:05:25,000
your support system,

108
0:05:26.25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and tethering you more tightly to them.

109
0:05:29.375,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They might say things like,

110
0:05:30.833,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"Why do you hang out with them? They're such losers"

111
0:05:33.333,000 --> 0:05:34,000
about your best friends,

112
0:05:34.625,000 --> 0:05:36,000
or, "They want us to break up. They're totally against us"

113
0:05:37.5,000 --> 0:05:38,000
about your family.

114
0:05:39.333,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Isolation is about sowing seeds of doubt

115
0:05:41.958,000 --> 0:05:43,000
about everyone from your prerelationship life.

116
0:05:46.125,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Healthy love includes independence,

117
0:05:48.208,000 --> 0:05:5,000
two people who love spending time together

118
0:05:50.708,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but who stay connected to the people and activities they cared about before.

119
0:05:54.958,000 --> 0:05:56,000
While at first you might spend every waking minute together,

120
0:05:57.875,000 --> 0:05:59,000
over time maintaining independence is key.

121
0:06:00.75,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You do this by making plans with friends and sticking to them

122
0:06:03.917,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and encouraging your partner to do the same.

123
0:06:07.833,000 --> 0:06:1,000
A third marker of unhealthy love is extreme jealousy.

124
0:06:11.75,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Video) Blue 2: What are you so happy about?

125
0:06:13.875,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Blue 1: She just started following me on Instagram!

126
0:06:16.833,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Blue 2: What are you so nervous about?

127
0:06:18.708,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Blue 1: She, she just started following me, like, everywhere.

128
0:06:22.958,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(#thatsnotlove)

129
0:06:26.458,000 --> 0:06:28,000
KH: As the honeymoon period begins to fade,

130
0:06:28.542,000 --> 0:06:29,000
extreme jealousy can creep in.

131
0:06:31.333,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Your partner might become more demanding,

132
0:06:33.333,000 --> 0:06:35,000
needing to know where you are and who you're with all the time,

133
0:06:36.333,000 --> 0:06:39,000
or they might start following you everywhere, online and off.

134
0:06:39.542,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Extreme jealousy also brings with it possessiveness and mistrust,

135
0:06:43.833,000 --> 0:06:46,000
frequent accusations of flirting with other people or cheating,

136
0:06:47.125,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and refusal to listen to you when you tell them

137
0:06:49.375,000 --> 0:06:51,000
they have nothing to worry about and that you only love them.

138
0:06:53.083,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Jealousy is a part of any human relationship,

139
0:06:55.833,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but extreme jealousy is different.

140
0:06:58.042,000 --> 0:07:,000
There's a threatening, desperate and angry edge to it.

141
0:07:00.833,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Love shouldn't feel like this.

142
0:07:04.333,000 --> 0:07:06,000
A fourth marker is belittling.

143
0:07:06.917,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Video) Blue: Wanna hang out? Orange: I gotta study.

144
0:07:09.5,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Blue: You'll get an A anyway, A for amazing. (#thatslove)

145
0:07:12.875,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Blue: Wanna hang out? Orange: I gotta study.

146
0:07:15.333,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Blue: You'll get an F anyway,

147
0:07:16.792,000 --> 0:07:19,000
F for, F for... stupid. (#thatsnotlove)

148
0:07:20.667,000 --> 0:07:21,000
KH: Yeah, hmm.

149
0:07:22.458,000 --> 0:07:24,000
In unhealthy love, words are used as weapons.

150
0:07:25.042,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Conversations that used to be fun and lighthearted

151
0:07:27.417,000 --> 0:07:28,000
turn mean and embarrassing.

152
0:07:29.25,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Maybe your partner makes fun of you in a way that hurts,

153
0:07:32.292,000 --> 0:07:35,000
or maybe they tell stories and jokes for laughs at your expense.

154
0:07:35.792,000 --> 0:07:37,000
When you try to explain that your feelings have been hurt,

155
0:07:38.542,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they shut you down and accuse you of overreacting.

156
0:07:41.958,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"Why are you so sensitive? What's your problem. Give me a break."

157
0:07:46.417,000 --> 0:07:47,000
You are silenced by these words.

158
0:07:49.417,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It seems pretty obvious, but your partner should have your back.

159
0:07:52.833,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Their words should build you up, not break you down.

160
0:07:55.5,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They should keep your secrets and be loyal.

161
0:07:57.917,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They should make you feel more confident,

162
0:07:59.917,000 --> 0:08:,000
not less.

163
0:08:02.25,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Finally, a fifth marker: volatility.

164
0:08:06.042,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Video) Orange 1: I'd be sad if we broke up.

165
0:08:08.167,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Orange 2: I'd be sad too. (#thatslove)

166
0:08:11.042,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Orange 1: I'd so depressed if we ever broke up.

167
0:08:13.292,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I'd throw myself off this step.

168
0:08:14.833,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I would! Don't try to stop me!

169
0:08:17.417,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(#thatsnotlove)

170
0:08:21.167,000 --> 0:08:24,000
KH: Frequent breakups and makeups, high highs and low lows:

171
0:08:24.917,000 --> 0:08:26,000
as tension rises, so does volatility.

172
0:08:28.458,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Tearful, frustrated fights followed by emotional makeups,

173
0:08:32.042,000 --> 0:08:33,000
hateful and hurtful comments like,

174
0:08:33.708,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"You're worthless, I'm not even sure why I'm with you!"

175
0:08:36.375,000 --> 0:08:4,000
followed quickly by apologies and promises it will never happen again.

176
0:08:41.208,000 --> 0:08:44,000
By this point, you've been so conditioned to this relationship roller coaster

177
0:08:45.042,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that you may not realize how unhealthy and maybe even dangerous

178
0:08:48.082,000 --> 0:08:49,000
your relationship has become.

179
0:08:51.542,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It can be really hard to see

180
0:08:53.042,000 --> 0:08:55,000
when unhealthy love turns towards abuse,

181
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but it's fair to say that the more of these markers

182
0:08:58.458,000 --> 0:08:59,000
your relationship might have,

183
0:08:59.917,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the more unhealthy and maybe dangerous your relationship could be.

184
0:09:03.417,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And if your instinct is to break up and leave,

185
0:09:05.625,000 --> 0:09:07,000
which is advice so many of us give our friends

186
0:09:07.833,000 --> 0:09:08,000
when they're in unhealthy relationships,

187
0:09:09.792,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that's not always the best advice.

188
0:09:11.75,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Time of breakup can be a real trigger for violence.

189
0:09:14.375,000 --> 0:09:17,000
If you fear you might be headed towards abuse or in abuse,

190
0:09:17.667,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you need to consult with experts to get the advice on how to leave safely.

191
0:09:23.042,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But it's not just about romantic relationships

192
0:09:25.458,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and it's not just about violence.

193
0:09:27.667,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Understanding the signs of unhealthy love

194
0:09:29.958,000 --> 0:09:32,000
can help you audit and understand nearly every relationship in your life.

195
0:09:34.625,000 --> 0:09:37,000
For the first time, you might understand why you're disappointed in a friendship

196
0:09:38.5,000 --> 0:09:4,000
or why every interaction with a certain family member

197
0:09:41.25,000 --> 0:09:44,000
leaves you discouraged and anxious.

198
0:09:44.542,000 --> 0:09:47,000
You might even begin to see how your own intensity and jealousy

199
0:09:47.583,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is causing problems with colleagues at work.

200
0:09:51.208,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Understanding is the first step to improving,

201
0:09:54.5,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and while you can't make every unhealthy relationship healthy --

202
0:09:57.583,000 --> 0:09:59,000
some you're going to have to leave behind --

203
0:09:59.708,000 --> 0:10:02,000
you can do your part every day to do relationships better.

204
0:10:04.25,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And here's the exciting news:

205
0:10:05.917,000 --> 0:10:07,000
it's actually not rocket science.

206
0:10:08.25,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Open communication, mutual respect,

207
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
kindness, patience --

208
0:10:13.25,000 --> 0:10:15,000
we can practice these things every day.

209
0:10:16.875,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And while practice will definitely make you better,

210
0:10:19.625,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I have to promise you it's also not going to make you perfect.

211
0:10:23.417,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I do this for a living

212
0:10:24.792,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and every day I think and talk about healthy relationships,

213
0:10:27.625,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and still I do unhealthy things.

214
0:10:30.25,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Just the other day as I was trying to shuttle my four kids out the door

215
0:10:33.667,000 --> 0:10:35,000
amidst quarreling, squabbling and complaints about breakfast,

216
0:10:36.667,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I completely lost it.

217
0:10:38.792,000 --> 0:10:4,000
With an intentionally angry edge,

218
0:10:40.958,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I screamed,

219
0:10:42.292,000 --> 0:10:44,000
"Everybody just shut up and do what I say!

220
0:10:44.583,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You are the worst!

221
0:10:46.167,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I am going to take away screen time and dessert

222
0:10:48.417,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and anything else you could possibly ever enjoy in life!"

223
0:10:51.625,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

224
0:10:53.125,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Anybody been there?

225
0:10:54.458,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Applause)

226
0:10:57.875,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Volatility, belittling.

227
0:11:01.417,000 --> 0:11:03,000
My oldest son turned around and looked at me, and said,

228
0:11:04.375,000 --> 0:11:05,000
"Mom, that's not love."

229
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:09.375,000 --> 0:11:11,000
For a minute, I really wanted to kill him for calling me out.

231
0:11:12.292,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Trust me.

232
0:11:13.833,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But then I gathered myself

233
0:11:15.375,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and I thought, you know what, I'm actually proud.

234
0:11:18.458,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I'm proud that he has a language to make me pause.

235
0:11:22.511,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I want all of my kids to understand what the bar should be

236
0:11:25.25,000 --> 0:11:26,000
for how they're treated

237
0:11:26.708,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and to have a language and a voice to use when that bar is not met

238
0:11:29.875,000 --> 0:11:3,000
versus just accepting it.

239
0:11:33.667,000 --> 0:11:37,000
For too long, we've treated relationships as a soft topic,

240
0:11:38.542,000 --> 0:11:4,000
when relationship skills are one of the most important

241
0:11:41.125,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and hard to build things in life.

242
0:11:43.708,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Not only can understanding unhealthy signs

243
0:11:46.375,000 --> 0:11:49,000
help you avoid the rabbit hole that leads to unhealthy love,

244
0:11:49.917,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but understanding and practicing the art of being healthy

245
0:11:52.917,000 --> 0:11:54,000
can improve nearly every aspect of your life.

246
0:11:56.625,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I'm completely convinced

247
0:11:58.708,000 --> 0:12:,000
that while love is an instinct and an emotion,

248
0:12:01.375,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the ability to love better is a skill we can all build

249
0:12:04.708,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and improve on over time.

250
0:12:06.583,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Thank you.

251
0:12:07.875,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Applause)

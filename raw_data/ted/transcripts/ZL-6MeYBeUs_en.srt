2
0:00:12.574,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I recently read about what the young generation of workers want

3
0:00:16.954,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in Harvard Business Review.

4
0:00:18.829,000 --> 0:00:23,000
One thing that stuck out to me was: don't just talk about impact,

5
0:00:23.865,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but make an impact.

6
0:00:26.542,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm a little bit older than you,

7
0:00:29.352,000 --> 0:00:3,000
maybe much older than you,

8
0:00:31.252,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but this is exactly the same goal that I had when I was in college.

9
0:00:37.301,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I wanted to make my own impact for those who live under injustice;

10
0:00:42.018,000 --> 0:00:45,000
it's the reason that I became a documentary journalist,

11
0:00:45.423,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the reason I became

12
0:00:47.788,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days.

13
0:00:51.875,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It was March 17, 2009.

14
0:00:55.226,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you,

15
0:00:58.266,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but it was the day that turned my life upside down.

16
0:01:03.346,000 --> 0:01:07,000
My team and I were making a documentary about North Korean refugees

17
0:01:07.971,000 --> 0:01:1,000
living below human life in China.

18
0:01:12.901,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We were at the border.

19
0:01:15.771,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It was our last day of filming.

20
0:01:19.417,000 --> 0:01:21,000
There was no wire fence

21
0:01:22.068,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or bars

22
0:01:23.362,000 --> 0:01:25,000
or sign to show that it is the border,

23
0:01:25.682,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but this is a place that a lot of North Korean defectors use

24
0:01:29.457,000 --> 0:01:3,000
as an escape route.

25
0:01:32.554,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It was still winter,

26
0:01:34.513,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and the river was frozen.

27
0:01:37.559,000 --> 0:01:4,000
When we were in the middle of the frozen river,

28
0:01:41.205,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we were filming about the condition of the cold weather

29
0:01:44.141,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and the environment

30
0:01:45.363,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that North Koreans had to deal with

31
0:01:48.113,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when they seek their freedom.

32
0:01:50.979,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And suddenly, one of my team members shouted,

33
0:01:54.138,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Soldiers!"

34
0:01:55.752,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So I looked back,

35
0:01:57.478,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and there were two small soldiers in green uniforms with rifles,

36
0:02:03.15,000 --> 0:02:04,000
chasing after us.

37
0:02:05.108,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We all ran as fast as we could.

38
0:02:08.593,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I prayed that, please don't let them shoot my head.

39
0:02:12.242,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I was thinking that,

40
0:02:14.068,000 --> 0:02:16,000
if my feet are on Chinese soil,

41
0:02:16.826,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I'll be safe.

42
0:02:18.203,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And I made it to Chinese soil.

43
0:02:21.244,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Then I saw my colleague Laura Ling fall on her knees.

44
0:02:26.251,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I didn't know what to do at that short moment,

45
0:02:28.891,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but I knew that I could not leave her alone there

46
0:02:31.542,000 --> 0:02:33,000
when she said, "Euna, I can't feel my legs."

47
0:02:35.68,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In a flash, we were surrounded by these two Korean soldiers.

48
0:02:40.507,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They were not much bigger than us,

49
0:02:42.874,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but they were determined to take us to their army base.

50
0:02:47.599,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I begged and yelled for any kind of help,

51
0:02:50.824,000 --> 0:02:53,000
hoping that someone would show up from China.

52
0:02:55.197,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Here I was, being stubborn

53
0:02:57.784,000 --> 0:02:59,000
towards a trained soldier with a gun.

54
0:03:00.32,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I looked at his eyes.

55
0:03:04.445,000 --> 0:03:05,000
He was just a boy.

56
0:03:06.854,000 --> 0:03:09,000
At that moment, he raised his rifle to hit me,

57
0:03:10.393,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but I saw that he was hesitating.

58
0:03:12.559,000 --> 0:03:13,000
His eyes were shaking,

59
0:03:14.358,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and his rifle was still up in the air.

60
0:03:18.037,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So I shouted at him,

61
0:03:20.323,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"OK, OK, I'll walk with you."

62
0:03:23.235,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I got up.

63
0:03:26.089,000 --> 0:03:28,000
When we arrived at their army base,

64
0:03:29.815,000 --> 0:03:32,000
my head was spinning with these worst-case scenarios,

65
0:03:33.735,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and my colleague's statement wasn't helping.

66
0:03:36.724,000 --> 0:03:38,000
She said, "We are the enemy."

67
0:03:39.771,000 --> 0:03:41,000
She was right: we were the enemy.

68
0:03:43.671,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And I was supposed to be frightened, too.

69
0:03:46.554,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But I kept having these odd experiences.

70
0:03:49.554,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This time, an officer brought me his coat

71
0:03:53.521,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to keep me warm,

72
0:03:54.956,000 --> 0:03:57,000
because I lost my coat on the frozen river

73
0:03:58.971,000 --> 0:04:,000
while battling with one of these soldiers.

74
0:04:02.757,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I will tell you what I mean by these odd experiences.

75
0:04:07.135,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I grew up in South Korea.

76
0:04:09.551,000 --> 0:04:12,000
To us, North Korea was always the enemy,

77
0:04:13.363,000 --> 0:04:14,000
even before I was born.

78
0:04:15.364,000 --> 0:04:2,000
South and North have been under armistice for 63 years,

79
0:04:20.861,000 --> 0:04:22,000
since the end of the Korean War.

80
0:04:23.772,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And growing up in the South in the '80s and '90s,

81
0:04:27.522,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we were taught propaganda about North Korea.

82
0:04:33.232,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And we heard so many graphic stories,

83
0:04:35.673,000 --> 0:04:38,000
such as, a little young boy being brutally killed

84
0:04:39.412,000 --> 0:04:42,000
by North Korean spies just because he said,

85
0:04:42.912,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"I don't like communists."

86
0:04:45.447,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Or, I watched this cartoon series

87
0:04:49.297,000 --> 0:04:53,000
about a young South Korean boy defeating these fat, big, red pig,

88
0:04:54.076,000 --> 0:04:57,000
which represented the North Koreans' first leader at the time.

89
0:04:59.974,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the effect of hearing these horrible stories over and over

90
0:05:04.53,000 --> 0:05:07,000
instilled one word in a young mind:

91
0:05:08.255,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"enemy."

92
0:05:10.139,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I think at some point, I dehumanized them,

93
0:05:14.23,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the people of North Korea became equated

94
0:05:19.243,000 --> 0:05:21,000
with the North Korean government.

95
0:05:23.221,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Now, back to my detention.

96
0:05:25.788,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It was the second day

97
0:05:27.965,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of being in a cell.

98
0:05:30.015,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I had not slept since I was out at the border.

99
0:05:34.208,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This young guard came to my cell

100
0:05:37.554,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and offered me this small boiled egg

101
0:05:41.094,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and said, "This will give you strength to keep going."

102
0:05:46.131,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Do you know what it is like,

103
0:05:49.116,000 --> 0:05:52,000
receiving a small kindness in the enemy's hand?

104
0:05:53.832,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Whenever they were kind to me, I thought the worst case

105
0:05:56.903,000 --> 0:05:58,000
was waiting for me after the kindness.

106
0:06:01.077,000 --> 0:06:03,000
One officer noticed my nervousness.

107
0:06:04.537,000 --> 0:06:07,000
He said, "Did you think we were all these red pigs?"

108
0:06:09.08,000 --> 0:06:12,000
referring to the cartoon that I just showed you.

109
0:06:15.047,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Every day was like a psychological battle.

110
0:06:18.481,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The interrogator had me sit at a table

111
0:06:21.596,000 --> 0:06:22,000
six days a week

112
0:06:23.12,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and had me writing down about my journey, my work,

113
0:06:27.234,000 --> 0:06:31,000
over and over until I wrote down the confession that they wanted to hear.

114
0:06:33.088,000 --> 0:06:36,000
After about three months of detention,

115
0:06:36.299,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the North Korean court sentenced me

116
0:06:41.185,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to 12 years in a labor camp.

117
0:06:44.637,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So I was just sitting in my room to be transferred.

118
0:06:48.366,000 --> 0:06:5,000
At that time, I really had nothing else to do,

119
0:06:50.628,000 --> 0:06:52,000
so I paid attention to these two female guards

120
0:06:53.536,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and listened to what they were talking about.

121
0:06:56.729,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Guard A was older,

122
0:06:58.836,000 --> 0:07:,000
and she studied English.

123
0:07:01.317,000 --> 0:07:04,000
She seemed like she came from an affluent family.

124
0:07:05.308,000 --> 0:07:07,000
She often showed up with these colorful dresses,

125
0:07:07.76,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and then loved to show off.

126
0:07:10.06,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And Guard B was the younger one,

127
0:07:13.405,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and she was a really good singer.

128
0:07:16.083,000 --> 0:07:2,000
She loved to sing Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" --

129
0:07:21.015,000 --> 0:07:22,000
sometimes too much.

130
0:07:22.505,000 --> 0:07:25,000
She knew just how to torture me without knowing.

131
0:07:26.361,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

132
0:07:28.029,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And this girl spent a lot of time in the morning to put on makeup,

133
0:07:34.722,000 --> 0:07:37,000
like you can see in any young girl's life.

134
0:07:39.574,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And they loved to watch this Chinese drama,

135
0:07:43.185,000 --> 0:07:44,000
a better quality production.

136
0:07:45.596,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I remember Guard B said,

137
0:07:48.992,000 --> 0:07:51,000
"I can no longer watch our TV shows after watching this."

138
0:07:53.857,000 --> 0:07:54,000
She got scolded

139
0:07:55.699,000 --> 0:07:59,000
for degrading her own country's produced TV shows.

140
0:08:00.723,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Guard B had more of a free mind than Guard A,

141
0:08:03.944,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and she often got scolded by Guard A whenever she expressed herself.

142
0:08:10.141,000 --> 0:08:13,000
One day, they invited all these female colleagues --

143
0:08:13.557,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I don't know where they came from --

144
0:08:15.482,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to where I was held,

145
0:08:18.048,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and they invited me

146
0:08:19.64,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to their guard room

147
0:08:21.438,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and asked

148
0:08:23.047,000 --> 0:08:26,000
if one-night stands really happen in the US.

149
0:08:26.65,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter)

150
0:08:29.86,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is the country where young couples are not even allowed

151
0:08:34.939,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to hold hands in public.

152
0:08:36.643,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I had no idea where they had gotten this information,

153
0:08:39.595,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but they were shy and giggly even before I said anything.

154
0:08:43.948,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I think we all forgot that I was their prisoner,

155
0:08:48.668,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and it was like going back to my high school classroom again.

156
0:08:52.98,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And I learned that these girls also grew up watching a similar cartoon,

157
0:08:58.884,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but just propaganda towards South Korea and the US.

158
0:09:03.944,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I started to understand where these people's anger was coming from.

159
0:09:09.427,000 --> 0:09:12,000
If these girls grew up learning that we are enemies,

160
0:09:13.242,000 --> 0:09:16,000
it was just natural that they would hate us

161
0:09:16.487,000 --> 0:09:17,000
just as I feared them.

162
0:09:19.855,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But at that moment, we were all just girls

163
0:09:23.729,000 --> 0:09:24,000
who shared the same interests,

164
0:09:26.778,000 --> 0:09:29,000
beyond our ideologies that separated us.

165
0:09:31.626,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I shared these stories with my boss at Current TV at the time

166
0:09:36.32,000 --> 0:09:37,000
after I came home.

167
0:09:37.754,000 --> 0:09:39,000
His first reaction was,

168
0:09:40.256,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"Euna, have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome?"

169
0:09:44.704,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Yes, and I clearly remember

170
0:09:49.01,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the feeling of fear

171
0:09:50.657,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and being threatened,

172
0:09:53.557,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and tension rising up between me and the interrogator

173
0:09:57.386,000 --> 0:09:58,000
when we talked about politics.

174
0:09:59.379,000 --> 0:10:03,000
There definitely was a wall that we couldn't climb over.

175
0:10:04.168,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But we were able to see each other as human beings

176
0:10:08.24,000 --> 0:10:1,000
when we talked about family,

177
0:10:10.665,000 --> 0:10:11,000
everyday life,

178
0:10:12.266,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the importance of the future for our children.

179
0:10:18.506,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It was about a month before I came home.

180
0:10:21.31,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I got really sick.

181
0:10:23.452,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye,

182
0:10:27.567,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because she was leaving the detention center.

183
0:10:32.868,000 --> 0:10:34,000
She made sure that no one watched us,

184
0:10:35.839,000 --> 0:10:36,000
no one heard us,

185
0:10:37.447,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and quietly said,

186
0:10:39.026,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"I hope you get better

187
0:10:40.88,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and go back to your family soon."

188
0:10:45.132,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It is these people --

189
0:10:47.747,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the officer who brought me his coat,

190
0:10:51.225,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the guard who offered me a boiled egg,

191
0:10:54.868,000 --> 0:10:58,000
these female guards who asked me about dating life in the US --

192
0:10:59.622,000 --> 0:11:03,000
they are the ones that I remember of North Korea:

193
0:11:04.219,000 --> 0:11:06,000
humans just like us.

194
0:11:07.51,000 --> 0:11:12,000
North Koreans and I were not ambassadors of our countries,

195
0:11:13.033,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but I believe that we were representing

196
0:11:16.642,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the human race.

197
0:11:19.924,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now I'm back home and back to my life.

198
0:11:24.456,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The memory of these people has blurred as time has passed.

199
0:11:29.62,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And I'm in this place

200
0:11:31.08,000 --> 0:11:35,000
where I read and hear about North Korea provoking the US.

201
0:11:35.892,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I realized how easy it is

202
0:11:38.951,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to see them as an enemy again.

203
0:11:42.921,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But I have to keep reminding myself that when I was over there,

204
0:11:49.475,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I was able to see humanity

205
0:11:52.413,000 --> 0:11:53,000
over hatred

206
0:11:53.589,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in my enemy's eyes.

207
0:11:56.529,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Thank you.

208
0:11:58.02,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Applause)

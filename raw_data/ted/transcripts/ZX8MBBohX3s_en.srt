0:00:15.326,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Good morning. So magic is an excellent way

3
0:00:18.308,000 --> 0:00:2,000
for staying ahead of the reality curve,

4
0:00:20.351,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to make possible today

5
0:00:23.266,000 --> 0:00:25,000
what science will make a reality tomorrow.

6
0:00:25.348,000 --> 0:00:28,000
As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion

7
0:00:28.349,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and science to give us a feel of how future technologies

8
0:00:33.308,000 --> 0:00:35,000
might be experienced.

9
0:00:35.355,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's new technology. You look through them

11
0:00:41.287,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and the world you see is augmented with data:

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
names of places, monuments, buildings,

13
0:00:47.317,000 --> 0:00:51,000
maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.

14
0:00:51.333,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So these are my illusion glasses.

15
0:00:55.349,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.

16
0:00:59.304,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And when you look through them, you get a glimpse

17
0:01:02.31,000 --> 0:01:06,000
into the mind of the cyber-illusionist.

18
0:01:06.318,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Let me show you what I mean.

19
0:01:08.343,000 --> 0:01:12,000
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.

20
0:01:13.324,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it

21
0:01:17.334,000 --> 0:01:21,000
when we see it again.

22
0:01:22.322,000 --> 0:01:25,000
All right. Very significant mark.

23
0:01:26.272,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And let's put it back into the deck,

24
0:01:28.272,000 --> 0:01:32,000
somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.

25
0:01:33.266,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Music)

26
0:01:34.296,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Voice: System ready. Acquiring image.

27
0:01:37.273,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Marco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards,

28
0:01:39.302,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a deck of cards is made up of four different suits:

29
0:01:43.271,000 --> 0:01:46,000
hearts, clubs,

30
0:01:46.272,000 --> 0:01:49,000
diamonds and spades.

31
0:01:49.293,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols,

32
0:01:52.283,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and have been interpreted in many different ways.

33
0:01:57.287,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, some say that the four suits

34
0:02:01.275,000 --> 0:02:05,000
represent the four seasons.

35
0:02:05.277,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There's spring, summer,

36
0:02:08.347,000 --> 0:02:1,000
autumn and â€”

37
0:02:11.274,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.

38
0:02:14.268,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Winter is like magic. It's a time of change,

39
0:02:17.285,000 --> 0:02:2,000
when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow,

40
0:02:20.356,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and then it all disappears.

41
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
There are 13 cards in each suit. (Music)

42
0:02:30.353,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.

43
0:02:34.31,000 --> 0:02:36,000
MT: So over here is low tide,

44
0:02:37.268,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and over here is high tide,

45
0:02:39.338,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and in the middle is the moon.

46
0:02:42.326,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.

47
0:02:46.286,000 --> 0:02:5,000
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.

48
0:02:50.351,000 --> 0:02:52,000
There is the color red

49
0:02:53.342,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and the color black,

50
0:02:58.279,000 --> 0:03:,000
representing the constant change

51
0:03:01.278,000 --> 0:03:04,000
from day to night.

52
0:03:04.278,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter)

53
0:03:06.319,000 --> 0:03:1,000
MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards

54
0:03:10.356,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?

55
0:03:15.359,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Music)

56
0:03:19.293,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards,

57
0:03:21.331,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the result is 365.

58
0:03:24.265,000 --> 0:03:27,000
MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year,

59
0:03:27.309,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the number of days between

60
0:03:30.309,000 --> 0:03:32,000
each birthday.

61
0:03:32.344,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Make a wish. (Blowing noise)

62
0:03:36.3,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.

63
0:03:38.344,000 --> 0:03:4,000
MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday

64
0:03:41.303,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that I received my first deck of cards,

65
0:03:44.347,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world

66
0:03:49.287,000 --> 0:03:52,000
performing magic for boys and girls,

67
0:03:52.343,000 --> 0:03:54,000
men and women, husbands and wives,

68
0:03:55.29,000 --> 0:04:01,000
even kings and queens. (Applause)

69
0:04:01.315,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Voice: And who are these?MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch.

70
0:04:05.309,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Wake up.

71
0:04:07.318,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Joker: Whoa.MT: Are you ready for your party piece?

72
0:04:09.31,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Joker: Ready!MT: Let me see what you've got.

73
0:04:11.333,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Joker: Presenting my pogo stick.MT: Ah. Watch out.

74
0:04:14.34,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music)

75
0:04:18.274,000 --> 0:04:23,000
MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.

76
0:04:23.334,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I'm performing for you.

77
0:04:26.354,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Voice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me

78
0:04:29.352,000 --> 0:04:33,000
how do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job?

79
0:04:34.281,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7.

80
0:04:37.287,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I don't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.

81
0:04:41.333,000 --> 0:04:44,000
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration,

82
0:04:45.273,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but it does take practice. Now, some people will say,

83
0:04:48.325,000 --> 0:04:52,000
well, magic, that must be the work of some evil

84
0:04:53.296,000 --> 0:04:56,000
supernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause)

85
0:04:56.304,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Music)

86
0:04:59.282,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Whoa.

87
0:05:04.275,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Well, to this, I just say, no no.

88
0:05:08.261,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Actually, in German, it's nein nein. (Laughter)

89
0:05:10.35,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you, though,

90
0:05:14.301,000 --> 0:05:17,000
if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this,

91
0:05:18.267,000 --> 0:05:21,000
don't play for money.

92
0:05:21.28,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Music)

93
0:05:24.313,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.

94
0:05:28.264,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.

95
0:05:31.342,000 --> 0:05:35,000
MT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds.

96
0:05:36.284,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Voice: I think you got your birthday wish.MT: And that actually leaves me with the last,

97
0:05:41.281,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and most important card of all:

98
0:05:44.292,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the one with this very significant mark on it.

99
0:05:47.293,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And unlike anything else we've just seen,

100
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
virtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected.

101
0:05:54.281,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing.

102
0:06:03.287,000 --> 0:06:11,000
MT: Bye bye. (Music)

103
0:06:12.28,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Thank you. (Applause)

104
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Applause)

105
0:06:18.348,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

106
0:06:25.317,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Applause)

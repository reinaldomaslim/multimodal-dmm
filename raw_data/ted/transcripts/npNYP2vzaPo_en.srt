1
0:00:13.373,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Most of us think of motion as a very visual thing.

2
0:00:17.889,000 --> 0:00:22,000
If I walk across this stage or gesture with my hands while I speak,

3
0:00:22.977,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that motion is something that you can see.

4
0:00:26.255,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But there's a world of important motion that's too subtle for the human eye,

5
0:00:31.737,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and over the past few years,

6
0:00:33.778,000 --> 0:00:34,000
we've started to find that cameras

7
0:00:35.775,000 --> 0:00:38,000
can often see this motion even when humans can't.

8
0:00:40.305,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So let me show you what I mean.

9
0:00:42.717,000 --> 0:00:45,000
On the left here, you see video of a person's wrist,

10
0:00:46.339,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and on the right, you see video of a sleeping infant,

11
0:00:49.486,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but if I didn't tell you that these were videos,

12
0:00:52.632,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you might assume that you were looking at two regular images,

13
0:00:56.393,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because in both cases,

14
0:00:58.065,000 --> 0:01:01,000
these videos appear to be almost completely still.

15
0:01:02.175,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But there's actually a lot of subtle motion going on here,

16
0:01:06.06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and if you were to touch the wrist on the left,

17
0:01:08.452,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you would feel a pulse,

18
0:01:10.448,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and if you were to hold the infant on the right,

19
0:01:12.933,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you would feel the rise and fall of her chest

20
0:01:15.324,000 --> 0:01:16,000
as she took each breath.

21
0:01:17.762,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And these motions carry a lot of significance,

22
0:01:21.338,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but they're usually too subtle for us to see,

23
0:01:24.681,000 --> 0:01:26,000
so instead, we have to observe them

24
0:01:26.957,000 --> 0:01:28,000
through direct contact, through touch.

25
0:01:30.997,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But a few years ago,

26
0:01:32.262,000 --> 0:01:36,000
my colleagues at MIT developed what they call a motion microscope,

27
0:01:36.667,000 --> 0:01:4,000
which is software that finds these subtle motions in video

28
0:01:41.051,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and amplifies them so that they become large enough for us to see.

29
0:01:45.416,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And so, if we use their software on the left video,

30
0:01:48.899,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it lets us see the pulse in this wrist,

31
0:01:52.149,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and if we were to count that pulse,

32
0:01:53.844,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we could even figure out this person's heart rate.

33
0:01:57.095,000 --> 0:02:,000
And if we used the same software on the right video,

34
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
it lets us see each breath that this infant takes,

35
0:02:03.387,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and we can use this as a contact-free way to monitor her breathing.

36
0:02:08.884,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And so this technology is really powerful because it takes these phenomena

37
0:02:14.232,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that we normally have to experience through touch

38
0:02:16.599,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and it lets us capture them visually and non-invasively.

39
0:02:21.104,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So a couple years ago, I started working with the folks that created that software,

40
0:02:25.515,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and we decided to pursue a crazy idea.

41
0:02:28.882,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We thought, it's cool that we can use software

42
0:02:31.575,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to visualize tiny motions like this,

43
0:02:34.71,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch.

44
0:02:39.168,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But what if we could do the same thing with our ability to hear?

45
0:02:44.508,000 --> 0:02:48,000
What if we could use video to capture the vibrations of sound,

46
0:02:49.173,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which are just another kind of motion,

47
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and turn everything that we see into a microphone?

48
0:02:56.236,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, this is a bit of a strange idea,

49
0:02:58.207,000 --> 0:03:,000
so let me try to put it in perspective for you.

50
0:03:01.523,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Traditional microphones work by converting the motion

51
0:03:05.011,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of an internal diaphragm into an electrical signal,

52
0:03:08.61,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and that diaphragm is designed to move readily with sound

53
0:03:12.928,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so that its motion can be recorded and interpreted as audio.

54
0:03:17.735,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But sound causes all objects to vibrate.

55
0:03:21.403,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see.

56
0:03:26.883,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So what if we record them with a high-speed camera

57
0:03:30.621,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and then use software to extract tiny motions

58
0:03:34.197,000 --> 0:03:36,000
from our high-speed video,

59
0:03:36.287,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them?

60
0:03:41.859,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This would let us turn visible objects into visual microphones from a distance.

61
0:03:49.08,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And so we tried this out,

62
0:03:51.263,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and here's one of our experiments,

63
0:03:53.19,000 --> 0:03:55,000
where we took this potted plant that you see on the right

64
0:03:56.139,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and we filmed it with a high-speed camera

65
0:03:58.577,000 --> 0:04:01,000
while a nearby loudspeaker played this sound.

66
0:04:02.275,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

67
0:04:11.82,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And so here's the video that we recorded,

68
0:04:14.644,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and we recorded it at thousands of frames per second,

69
0:04:18.568,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but even if you look very closely,

70
0:04:20.89,000 --> 0:04:21,000
all you'll see are some leaves

71
0:04:22.841,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that are pretty much just sitting there doing nothing,

72
0:04:25.906,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because our sound only moved those leaves by about a micrometer.

73
0:04:31.103,000 --> 0:04:35,000
That's one ten-thousandth of a centimeter,

74
0:04:35.379,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which spans somewhere between a hundredth and a thousandth

75
0:04:39.535,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of a pixel in this image.

76
0:04:41.881,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So you can squint all you want,

77
0:04:44.768,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but motion that small is pretty much perceptually invisible.

78
0:04:49.667,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But it turns out that something can be perceptually invisible

79
0:04:53.824,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and still be numerically significant,

80
0:04:56.633,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because with the right algorithms,

81
0:04:58.635,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we can take this silent, seemingly still video

82
0:05:02.322,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and we can recover this sound.

83
0:05:04.69,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

84
0:05:12.074,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Applause)

85
0:05:22.058,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So how is this possible?

86
0:05:23.997,000 --> 0:05:27,000
How can we get so much information out of so little motion?

87
0:05:28.341,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Well, let's say that those leaves move by just a single micrometer,

88
0:05:33.702,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and let's say that that shifts our image by just a thousandth of a pixel.

89
0:05:39.269,000 --> 0:05:41,000
That may not seem like much,

90
0:05:41.841,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but a single frame of video

91
0:05:43.837,000 --> 0:05:46,000
may have hundreds of thousands of pixels in it,

92
0:05:47.094,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and so if we combine all of the tiny motions that we see

93
0:05:50.548,000 --> 0:05:52,000
from across that entire image,

94
0:05:52.846,000 --> 0:05:54,000
then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel

95
0:05:55.469,000 --> 0:05:57,000
can start to add up to something pretty significant.

96
0:05:58.87,000 --> 0:06:01,000
On a personal note, we were pretty psyched when we figured this out.

97
0:06:02.505,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

98
0:06:04.825,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But even with the right algorithm,

99
0:06:08.078,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle.

100
0:06:11.695,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You see, there are a lot of factors that affect when and how well

101
0:06:15.299,000 --> 0:06:16,000
this technique will work.

102
0:06:17.296,000 --> 0:06:2,000
There's the object and how far away it is;

103
0:06:20.5,000 --> 0:06:22,000
there's the camera and the lens that you use;

104
0:06:22.894,000 --> 0:06:26,000
how much light is shining on the object and how loud your sound is.

105
0:06:27.945,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And even with the right algorithm,

106
0:06:31.32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
we had to be very careful with our early experiments,

107
0:06:34.71,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because if we got any of these factors wrong,

108
0:06:37.102,000 --> 0:06:39,000
there was no way to tell what the problem was.

109
0:06:39.47,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We would just get noise back.

110
0:06:42.117,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And so a lot of our early experiments looked like this.

111
0:06:45.437,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And so here I am,

112
0:06:47.643,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and on the bottom left, you can kind of see our high-speed camera,

113
0:06:51.683,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which is pointed at a bag of chips,

114
0:06:53.866,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and the whole thing is lit by these bright lamps.

115
0:06:56.815,000 --> 0:07:,000
And like I said, we had to be very careful in these early experiments,

116
0:07:01.18,000 --> 0:07:03,000
so this is how it went down.

117

(Video) Abe Davis: Three, two, one, go.

118

Mary had a little lamb! Little lamb! Little lamb!

119
0:07:12.836,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

120
0:07:17.336,000 --> 0:07:19,000
AD: So this experiment looks completely ridiculous.

121
0:07:20.15,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

122
0:07:21.938,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I mean, I'm screaming at a bag of chips --

123
0:07:24.283,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter) --

124
0:07:25.834,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and we're blasting it with so much light,

125
0:07:27.951,000 --> 0:07:31,000
we literally melted the first bag we tried this on. (Laughter)

126
0:07:32.525,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But ridiculous as this experiment looks,

127
0:07:35.799,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it was actually really important,

128
0:07:37.587,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because we were able to recover this sound.

129
0:07:40.513,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Audio) Mary had a little lamb! Little lamb! Little lamb!

130
0:07:45.225,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Applause)

131
0:07:49.313,000 --> 0:07:5,000
AD: And this was really significant,

132
0:07:51.194,000 --> 0:07:55,000
because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech

133
0:07:55.424,000 --> 0:07:57,000
from silent video of an object.

134
0:07:57.765,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And so it gave us this point of reference,

135
0:08:00.156,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and gradually we could start to modify the experiment,

136
0:08:04.106,000 --> 0:08:07,000
using different objects or moving the object further away,

137
0:08:07.911,000 --> 0:08:09,000
using less light or quieter sounds.

138
0:08:11.887,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And we analyzed all of these experiments

139
0:08:14.761,000 --> 0:08:17,000
until we really understood the limits of our technique,

140
0:08:18.383,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because once we understood those limits,

141
0:08:20.333,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we could figure out how to push them.

142
0:08:22.679,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And that led to experiments like this one,

143
0:08:25.86,000 --> 0:08:27,000
where again, I'm going to speak to a bag of chips,

144
0:08:28.599,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but this time we've moved our camera about 15 feet away,

145
0:08:33.429,000 --> 0:08:35,000
outside, behind a soundproof window,

146
0:08:36.262,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight.

147
0:08:40.529,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And so here's the video that we captured.

148
0:08:44.45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And this is what things sounded like from inside, next to the bag of chips.

149
0:08:49.009,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Audio) Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,

150
0:08:54.047,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.

151
0:08:59.666,000 --> 0:09:03,000
AD: And here's what we were able to recover from our silent video

152
0:09:03.683,000 --> 0:09:05,000
captured outside behind that window.

153
0:09:06.028,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Audio) Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,

154
0:09:10.463,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.

155

156
0:09:22.421,000 --> 0:09:25,000
AD: And there are other ways that we can push these limits as well.

157
0:09:25.963,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So here's a quieter experiment

158
0:09:27.761,000 --> 0:09:31,000
where we filmed some earphones plugged into a laptop computer,

159
0:09:31.871,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and in this case, our goal was to recover the music that was playing on that laptop

160
0:09:35.981,000 --> 0:09:37,000
from just silent video

161
0:09:38.28,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of these two little plastic earphones,

162
0:09:40.787,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and we were able to do this so well

163
0:09:42.97,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that I could even Shazam our results.

164
0:09:45.431,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Laughter)

165
0:09:49.191,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Music: "Under Pressure" by Queen)

166
0:10:01.615,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Applause)

167
0:10:06.584,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And we can also push things by changing the hardware that we use.

168
0:10:11.135,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Because the experiments I've shown you so far

169
0:10:13.596,000 --> 0:10:15,000
were done with a camera, a high-speed camera,

170
0:10:15.918,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that can record video about a 100 times faster

171
0:10:18.797,000 --> 0:10:19,000
than most cell phones,

172
0:10:20.724,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but we've also found a way to use this technique

173
0:10:23.533,000 --> 0:10:25,000
with more regular cameras,

174
0:10:25.763,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and we do that by taking advantage of what's called a rolling shutter.

175
0:10:29.832,000 --> 0:10:33,000
You see, most cameras record images one row at a time,

176
0:10:34.63,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and so if an object moves during the recording of a single image,

177
0:10:40.344,000 --> 0:10:42,000
there's a slight time delay between each row,

178
0:10:43.061,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and this causes slight artifacts

179
0:10:46.218,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that get coded into each frame of a video.

180
0:10:49.701,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And so what we found is that by analyzing these artifacts,

181
0:10:53.507,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we can actually recover sound using a modified version of our algorithm.

182
0:10:58.122,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So here's an experiment we did

183
0:11:00.034,000 --> 0:11:01,000
where we filmed a bag of candy

184
0:11:01.729,000 --> 0:11:02,000
while a nearby loudspeaker played

185
0:11:03.47,000 --> 0:11:05,000
the same "Mary Had a Little Lamb" music from before,

186
0:11:06.442,000 --> 0:11:1,000
but this time, we used just a regular store-bought camera,

187
0:11:10.645,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and so in a second, I'll play for you the sound that we recovered,

188
0:11:13.819,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and it's going to sound distorted this time,

189
0:11:15.869,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but listen and see if you can still recognize the music.

190
0:11:19.723,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Audio: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

191
0:11:37.527,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And so, again, that sounds distorted,

192
0:11:40.992,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but what's really amazing here is that we were able to do this

193
0:11:45.378,000 --> 0:11:47,000
with something that you could literally run out

194
0:11:48.004,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and pick up at a Best Buy.

195
0:11:51.122,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So at this point,

196
0:11:52.485,000 --> 0:11:53,000
a lot of people see this work,

197
0:11:54.459,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and they immediately think about surveillance.

198
0:11:57.872,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And to be fair,

199
0:12:00.287,000 --> 0:12:04,000
it's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone.

200
0:12:04.42,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But keep in mind that there's already a lot of very mature technology

201
0:12:08.367,000 --> 0:12:09,000
out there for surveillance.

202
0:12:09.946,000 --> 0:12:11,000
In fact, people have been using lasers

203
0:12:12.036,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to eavesdrop on objects from a distance for decades.

204
0:12:15.978,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But what's really new here,

205
0:12:18.003,000 --> 0:12:19,000
what's really different,

206
0:12:19.443,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object,

207
0:12:23.738,000 --> 0:12:26,000
which gives us a new lens through which to look at the world,

208
0:12:27.151,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and we can use that lens

209
0:12:28.661,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to learn not just about forces like sound that cause an object to vibrate,

210
0:12:33.56,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but also about the object itself.

211
0:12:36.975,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And so I want to take a step back

212
0:12:38.668,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and think about how that might change the ways that we use video,

213
0:12:42.917,000 --> 0:12:45,000
because we usually use video to look at things,

214
0:12:46.47,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and I've just shown you how we can use it

215
0:12:48.792,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to listen to things.

216
0:12:50.649,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But there's another important way that we learn about the world:

217
0:12:54.62,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that's by interacting with it.

218
0:12:56.895,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We push and pull and poke and prod things.

219
0:13:00.006,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We shake things and see what happens.

220
0:13:03.187,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And that's something that video still won't let us do,

221
0:13:07.46,000 --> 0:13:09,000
at least not traditionally.

222
0:13:09.596,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So I want to show you some new work,

223
0:13:11.546,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and this is based on an idea I had just a few months ago,

224
0:13:14.213,000 --> 0:13:17,000
so this is actually the first time I've shown it to a public audience.

225
0:13:17.514,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And the basic idea is that we're going to use the vibrations in a video

226
0:13:22.877,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to capture objects in a way that will let us interact with them

227
0:13:27.358,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and see how they react to us.

228
0:13:31.12,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So here's an object,

229
0:13:32.884,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and in this case, it's a wire figure in the shape of a human,

230
0:13:36.716,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and we're going to film that object with just a regular camera.

231
0:13:39.804,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So there's nothing special about this camera.

232
0:13:41.928,000 --> 0:13:43,000
In fact, I've actually done this with my cell phone before.

233
0:13:44.889,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But we do want to see the object vibrate,

234
0:13:47.141,000 --> 0:13:48,000
so to make that happen,

235
0:13:48.274,000 --> 0:13:51,000
we're just going to bang a little bit on the surface where it's resting

236
0:13:51.62,000 --> 0:13:53,000
while we record this video.

237
0:13:59.398,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So that's it: just five seconds of regular video,

238
0:14:03.069,000 --> 0:14:05,000
while we bang on this surface,

239
0:14:05.205,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and we're going to use the vibrations in that video

240
0:14:08.718,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to learn about the structural and material properties of our object,

241
0:14:13.262,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and we're going to use that information to create something new and interactive.

242
0:14:24.866,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And so here's what we've created.

243
0:14:27.519,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And it looks like a regular image,

244
0:14:29.748,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but this isn't an image, and it's not a video,

245
0:14:32.859,000 --> 0:14:34,000
because now I can take my mouse

246
0:14:35.227,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and I can start interacting with the object.

247
0:14:44.936,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And so what you see here

248
0:14:47.389,000 --> 0:14:49,000
is a simulation of how this object

249
0:14:49.615,000 --> 0:14:53,000
would respond to new forces that we've never seen before,

250
0:14:54.073,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and we created it from just five seconds of regular video.

251
0:14:59.249,000 --> 0:15:03,000
(Applause)

252
0:15:09.421,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And so this is a really powerful way to look at the world,

253
0:15:12.648,000 --> 0:15:14,000
because it lets us predict how objects will respond

254
0:15:15.62,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to new situations,

255
0:15:17.443,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and you could imagine, for instance, looking at an old bridge

256
0:15:20.916,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and wondering what would happen, how would that bridge hold up

257
0:15:24.443,000 --> 0:15:26,000
if I were to drive my car across it.

258
0:15:27.276,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And that's a question that you probably want to answer

259
0:15:30.05,000 --> 0:15:32,000
before you start driving across that bridge.

260
0:15:33.988,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And of course, there are going to be limitations to this technique,

261
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
just like there were with the visual microphone,

262
0:15:39.722,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but we found that it works in a lot of situations

263
0:15:42.903,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that you might not expect,

264
0:15:44.778,000 --> 0:15:46,000
especially if you give it longer videos.

265
0:15:47.546,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So for example, here's a video that I captured

266
0:15:50.054,000 --> 0:15:52,000
of a bush outside of my apartment,

267
0:15:52.353,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and I didn't do anything to this bush,

268
0:15:55.441,000 --> 0:15:57,000
but by capturing a minute-long video,

269
0:15:58.146,000 --> 0:16:01,000
a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations

270
0:16:01.524,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that we could learn enough about this bush to create this simulation.

271
0:16:07.27,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Applause)

272
0:16:13.412,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And so you could imagine giving this to a film director,

273
0:16:16.384,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and letting him control, say,

274
0:16:18.103,000 --> 0:16:22,000
the strength and direction of wind in a shot after it's been recorded.

275
0:16:24.81,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Or, in this case, we pointed our camera at a hanging curtain,

276
0:16:29.345,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and you can't even see any motion in this video,

277
0:16:33.474,000 --> 0:16:35,000
but by recording a two-minute-long video,

278
0:16:36.399,000 --> 0:16:38,000
natural air currents in this room

279
0:16:38.837,000 --> 0:16:42,000
created enough subtle, imperceptible motions and vibrations

280
0:16:43.249,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that we could learn enough to create this simulation.

281
0:16:48.243,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And ironically,

282
0:16:50.609,000 --> 0:16:53,000
we're kind of used to having this kind of interactivity

283
0:16:53.697,000 --> 0:16:55,000
when it comes to virtual objects,

284
0:16:56.344,000 --> 0:16:59,000
when it comes to video games and 3D models,

285
0:16:59.641,000 --> 0:17:03,000
but to be able to capture this information from real objects in the real world

286
0:17:04.045,000 --> 0:17:06,000
using just simple, regular video,

287
0:17:06.862,000 --> 0:17:08,000
is something new that has a lot of potential.

288
0:17:10.41,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So here are the amazing people who worked with me on these projects.

289
0:17:16.057,000 --> 0:17:21,000
(Applause)

290
0:17:24.819,000 --> 0:17:27,000
And what I've shown you today is only the beginning.

291
0:17:27.876,000 --> 0:17:29,000
We've just started to scratch the surface

292
0:17:29.989,000 --> 0:17:31,000
of what you can do with this kind of imaging,

293
0:17:32.961,000 --> 0:17:34,000
because it gives us a new way

294
0:17:35.342,000 --> 0:17:39,000
to capture our surroundings with common, accessible technology.

295
0:17:40.066,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And so looking to the future,

296
0:17:41.995,000 --> 0:17:43,000
it's going to be really exciting to explore

297
0:17:44.032,000 --> 0:17:45,000
what this can tell us about the world.

298
0:17:46.381,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Thank you.

299
0:17:47.61,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Applause)

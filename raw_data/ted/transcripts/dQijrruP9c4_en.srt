1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to address the issue of compassion.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Compassion has many faces.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
some of them are tender; some of them are wise.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A line that the Dalai Lama once said,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
he said, "Love and compassion are necessities.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They are not luxuries.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Without them,

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
humanity cannot survive."

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I would suggest,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
it is not only humanity that won't survive,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but it is all species on the planet,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
as we've heard today.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It is the big cats,

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and it's the plankton.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was so privileged

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to be able to teach in a hospice

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
on the outskirts of Bangalore.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And early in the morning,

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I went into the ward.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In that hospice,

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
there were 31 men and women

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
who were actively dying.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I walked up to the bedside

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of an old woman

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
who was breathing very rapidly, fragile,

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
obviously in the latter phase

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
of active dying.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I looked into her face.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I looked into the face

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of her son sitting next to her,

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and his face was just riven

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with grief and confusion.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I remembered

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a line from the Mahabharata,

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the great Indian epic:

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?"

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And Yudhisthira replied,

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"The most wondrous thing in the world

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is that all around us

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
people can be dying

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and we don't realize

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
it can happen to us."

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I looked up.

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Tending those 31 dying people

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
were young women

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
from villages around Bangalore.

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I looked into the face of one of these women,

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and I saw in her face

51
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the strength that arises

52
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
when natural compassion is really present.

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I watched her hands

54
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
as she bathed an old man.

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
My gaze went to another young woman

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
as she wiped the face

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of another dying person.

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And it reminded me

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of something that I had just been present for.

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Every year or so,

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I have the privilege of taking clinicians

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And we run clinics

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in these very remote regions

65
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
where there's no medical care whatsoever.

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And on the first day at Simikot in Humla,

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
far west of Nepal,

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the most impoverished region of Nepal,

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
an old man came in

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
clutching a bundle of rags.

71
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And he walked in, and somebody said something to him,

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
we realized he was deaf,

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and we looked into the rags,

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and there was this pair of eyes.

75
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The rags were unwrapped

76
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
from a little girl

77
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
whose body was massively burned.

78
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Again,

79
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the eyes and hands

80
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of Avalokiteshvara.

81
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It was the young women, the health aids,

82
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
who cleaned the wounds of this baby

83
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and dressed the wounds.

84
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I know those hands and eyes;

85
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
they touched me as well.

86
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They touched me at that time.

87
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They have touched me throughout my 68 years.

88
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They touched me when I was four

89
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I lost my eyesight

90
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and was partially paralyzed.

91
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And my family brought in

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
a woman whose mother had been a slave

93
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to take care of me.

94
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And that woman

95
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
did not have sentimental compassion.

96
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
She had phenomenal strength.

97
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And it was really her strength, I believe,

98
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that has been a guiding light in my life.

100
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So we can ask:

101
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
What is compassion comprised of?

102
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And there are various facets.

103
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And there's referential and non-referential compassion.

104
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But first, compassion is comprised

105
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of that capacity

106
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to see clearly

107
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
into the nature of suffering.

108
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It is that ability

109
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to really stand strong

110
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and to recognize also

111
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that I'm not separate from this suffering.

112
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But that is not enough,

113
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because compassion,

114
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which activates the motor cortex,

115
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
means that we aspire,

116
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we actually aspire to transform suffering.

117
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And if we're so blessed,

118
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we engage in activities

119
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that transform suffering.

120
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But compassion has another component,

121
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and that component is really essential.

122
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
That component

123
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is that we cannot be attached to outcome.

124
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now I worked with dying people

125
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for over 40 years.

126
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I had the privilege of working on death row

127
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in a maximum security [prison] for six years.

128
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I realized so clearly

129
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in bringing my own life experience,

130
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
from working with dying people

131
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and training caregivers,

132
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that any attachment to outcome

133
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
would distort deeply

134
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
my own capacity to be fully present

135
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
to the whole catastrophe.

136
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And when I worked in the prison system,

137
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it was so clear to me, this:

138
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that many of us

139
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in this room,

140
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row,

141
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.

142
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
That compassion is actually

143
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
an inherent human quality.

144
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It is there within every human being.

145
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But the conditions

146
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
for compassion to be activated,

147
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to be aroused,

148
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
are particular conditions.

149
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I had that condition, to a certain extent,

150
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from my own childhood illness.

151
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Eve Ensler, whom you'll hear later,

152
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
has had that condition activated

153
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
amazingly in her

154
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
through the various waters of suffering

155
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that she has been through.

156
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And what is fascinating

157
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is that compassion has enemies,

158
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and those enemies are things like pity,

159
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
moral outrage,

160
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
fear.

161
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And you know, we have a society, a world,

162
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that is paralyzed by fear.

163
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And in that paralysis, of course,

164
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
our capacity for compassion

165
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is also paralyzed.

166
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The very word terror

167
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is global.

168
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The very feeling of terror is global.

169
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So our work, in a certain way,

170
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is to address this imago,

171
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
this kind of archetype

172
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that has pervaded the psyche

173
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of our entire globe.

174
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now we know from neuroscience

175
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that compassion has

176
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
some very extraordinary qualities.

177
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
For example:

178
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
A person who is cultivating compassion,

179
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
when they are in the presence of suffering,

180
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
they feel that suffering a lot more

181
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
than many other people do.

182
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
However,

183
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
they return to baseline a lot sooner.

184
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This is called resilience.

185
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Many of us think that compassion drains us,

186
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but I promise you

187
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
it is something that truly enlivens us.

188
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Another thing about compassion

189
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.

190
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It hooks up all parts of the brain.

191
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Another, which has been discovered

192
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
by various researchers

193
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
at Emory and at Davis and so on,

194
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
is that compassion enhances our immune system.

195
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Hey,

196
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
we live in a very noxious world.

197
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

198
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Most of us are shrinking

199
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons,

200
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of the toxins of our world.

201
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But compassion, the generation of compassion,

202
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
actually mobilizes

203
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
our immunity.

204
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You know, if compassion is so good for us,

205
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I have a question.

206
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Why don't we train our children

207
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in compassion?

208
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Applause)

209
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
If compassion is so good for us,

210
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
why don't we train our health care providers in compassion

211
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
so that they can do what they're supposed to do,

212
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
which is to really transform suffering?

213
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And if compassion is so good for us,

214
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
why don't we vote on compassion?

215
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Why don't we vote for people in our government

216
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
based on compassion,

217
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
so that we can have

218
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a more caring world?

219
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In Buddhism,

220
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front."

221
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It takes tremendous strength of the back

222
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.

223
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And that is the mental quality of equanimity.

224
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But it also takes a soft front --

225
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
the capacity to really be open to the world as it is,

226
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to have an undefended heart.

227
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And the archetype of this in Buddhism

228
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.

229
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It's a female archetype:

230
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
she who perceives

231
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the cries of suffering in the world.

232
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
She stands with 10,000 arms,

233
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and in every hand,

234
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
there is an instrument of liberation,

235
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes,

236
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and these are the eyes of wisdom.

237
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I say that, for thousands of years,

238
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
women have lived,

239
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
exemplified, met in intimacy,

240
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the archetype of Avalokitesvara,

241
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
of Kuan-Yin,

242
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
she who perceives

243
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the cries of suffering in the world.

244
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Women have manifested for thousands of years

245
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the strength arising from compassion

246
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in an unfiltered, unmediated way

247
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
in perceiving suffering

248
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
as it is.

249
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They have infused societies with kindness,

250
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and we have really felt that

251
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
as woman after woman

252
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
has stood on this stage

253
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
in the past day and a half.

254
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And they have actualized compassion

255
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
through direct action.

256
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Jody Williams called it:

257
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's good to meditate.

258
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.

259
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Step back, give your mother a break, okay.

260
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter)

261
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But the other side of the equation

262
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is you've got to come out of your cave.

263
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You have to come into the world

264
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
like Asanga did,

265
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha

266
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
after 12 years sitting in the cave.

267
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
He said, "I'm out of here."

268
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
He's going down the path.

269
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
He sees something in the path.

270
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
He looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.

271
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.

272
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The wound is just filled with maggots.

273
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
He puts out his tongue

274
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in order to remove the maggots,

275
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
so as not to harm them.

276
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And at that moment,

277
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the dog transformed

278
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
into the Buddha of love and kindness.

279
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I believe

280
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that women and girls today

281
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
have to partner in a powerful way with men --

282
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
with their fathers,

283
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with their sons, with their brothers,

284
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
with the plumbers, the road builders,

285
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers,

286
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
with our president,

287
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and with all beings.

288
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The women in this room

289
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
are lotuses in a sea of fire.

290
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
May we actualize that capacity

291
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
for women everywhere.

292
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you.

293
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Applause)

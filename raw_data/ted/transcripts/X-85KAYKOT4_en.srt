1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and why this is an incredibly important,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
long, oily, hot summer,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But before I talk about the political chemistry,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This is a photograph from when I visited

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to watch the Minerals Management Service

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
testing their ability

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to burn oil spills in ice.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
you see some ice cubes,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The napalm is burning there quite nicely.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And the thing is, is that

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We're four percent of the world's population;

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we use 25 percent of the world's oil production.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And we don't really understand what oil is,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
until you check out its molecules,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So this is what happens as that burn gets going.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It takes off. It's a big woosh.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
on the geopolitics of oil again.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It'll just bake your retinas.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So there it is; the retinas are baking.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It starts of with the very small ones,

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which are one carbon, four hydrogen --

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that's methane -- it just floats off.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon.

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And it goes all the way over

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons,

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and they have thousands of hydrogens,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Those are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They're very important in oil spills.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Let me tell you a little bit about

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the chemistry of oil in water.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It spreads out to be really thin,

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so you have a hard time corralling it.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The next thing that happens

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is the light ends evaporate,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and some of the toxic things float into the water column

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and kill fish eggs

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and smaller fish and things like that, and shrimp.

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing --

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
into a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise.

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It triples the amount

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of oily, messy goo that you have in the water,

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and it makes it very hard to handle.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It also makes it very viscous.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain,

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
there were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of emulsified oil,

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
with the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
It's incredibly hard to clean up.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And every single oil is different when it hits water.

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
When the chemistry of the oil and water

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
also hits our politics,

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it's absolutely explosive.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
For the first time, American consumers

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves.

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They have a "eureka!" moment,

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
when we suddenly understand oil in a different context.

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics,

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because it's really crucial to understanding

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
why this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused.

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks,

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"Wow! I'm going to go buy

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and drive happily to work."

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
No, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They set the prices, and I don't even know.

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I am helpless over this."

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump --

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and actually, gas pumps are specifically designed

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to diffuse that anger.

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one,

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
are designed to look like ATMs.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger,

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because supposedly we feel good about ATMs.

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That shows you how bad it is.

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness

98
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
comes in because most Americans actually feel

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy,

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And the thing is, too,

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume,

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which is somewhat reasonable,

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because in fact, we have designed this system

105
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where, if you want to get a job,

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it's much more important to have a car that runs,

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And that's actually very perverse.

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas,

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which is that we'd rather be doing anything else.

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This is BP's gas station

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in downtown Los Angeles.

113
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.

114
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"Now," you think, "why would something so lame

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
work on people so smart?"

116
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas,

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.

118
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else.

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We don't want to be buying oil;

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we want to be doing something green.

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And we get kind of in on our own con.

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I mean -- and this is funny,

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it looks funny here.

124
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked.

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But it's an inherent part of our energy policy,

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which is we don't talk about

127
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
reducing the amount of oil that we use.

128
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars.

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And so, cognitive dissonance

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil,

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill.

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Okay, so the politics of oil

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
are very moral in the United States.

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus

136
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of engineering and finance

137
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and everything else,

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but we actually see it in very moral terms.

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers.

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Early journalists looked at these spills,

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and they said, "This is a filthy industry."

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But they also saw in it

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that people were getting rich for doing nothing.

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically.

146
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing,

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
long before it became funny.

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller.

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And the thing about John D. is that

150
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
he went into this chaotic wild-east

151
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of oil industry,

152
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and he rationalized it

153
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
into a vertically integrated company, a multinational.

154
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now,

155
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.

156
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it also the kind of root

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
of how we see oil as a conspiracy.

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But what's really amazing is that

159
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Ida Tarbell, the journalist,

160
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller

161
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and actually got the whole antitrust laws

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
put in place.

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But in many ways,

164
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And here's one of the things

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that Ida Tarbell said --

167
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
she said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn.

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There were no lips.

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes

170
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
with creases running from them."

171
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Okay, so that guy is actually still with us.

173
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA.

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And then there's this guy, okay.

176
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So, you might be wondering why it is that,

177
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill,

178
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
we call these CEOs down to Washington,

179
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.

180
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And this is something that we've been doing since 1974,

181
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
when we first asked them, "Why are there these obscene profits?"

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
into these CEOs.

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And we take it as, you know --

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we look at it on a moral level,

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.

187
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions --

188
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I'm just saying that, when you focus on

189
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards,

190
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
you don't actually get around to the point

191
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate,

192
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
or you're going to get around

193
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
to really reducing the amount of oil

194
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and reducing our dependence on oil.

195
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.

196
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But it makes for good theater,

197
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week.

198
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So the thing about water oil spills

199
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is that they are very politically galvanizing.

200
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill.

201
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
You have these pictures of birds.

202
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They really influence people.

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969,

204
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.

205
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It started Earth Day.

206
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act,

207
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.

208
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period.

209
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and understand what happens to us.

211
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Here we are normally;

212
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.

213
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We look at these pictures

214
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain.

215
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We connect the dots in the supply chain.

216
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And we have this kind of --

217
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
as voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.

218
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This is why these moments of these oil spills

219
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
are so important.

220
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But it's also really important that we don't get distracted

221
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
by the theater or the morals of it.

222
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We actually need to go in

223
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and work on the roots of the problem.

224
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills

225
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
was that we really worked on some of the symptoms.

226
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive

227
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
about what happened.

228
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And so what we did was, actually,

229
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.

230
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We stopped drilling in ANWR,

231
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.

232
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
In fact, it's continued to increase.

233
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume

234
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is much higher prices.

235
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
As you can see, our own production has fallen off

236
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.

237
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves;

238
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.

239
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
One of the things that's happened because of this

240
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is that, since 1969,

241
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the country of Nigeria, or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil,

242
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland --

243
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
has had thousands of oil spills a year.

244
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills

245
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
when we import oil from places

246
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
without tight environmental regulations.

247
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill

248
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
every year since 1969.

249
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And we can wrap our heads around the spills,

250
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
because that's what we see here,

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone.

252
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year

253
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in this area twice the size of Maryland,

254
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and it's all related to the oil.

255
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S.,

256
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
they might be actually here in this room.

257
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They have degrees in political science, degrees in business --

258
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing.

259
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And it's sort of one of the other groups of people

260
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who pay a price for us.

261
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The other thing that we've done,

262
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
as we've continued to increase demand,

263
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.

264
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
One of the places we put in a big oil project

265
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in Chad, with Exxon.

266
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it;

267
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the World Bank, Exxon paid for it.

268
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem.

269
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I was there in 2003.

270
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We were driving along this dark, dark road,

271
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and the guy in the green stepped out,

272
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it."

273
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out,

274
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and we realized it was okay.

275
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.

276
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But at the same time,

277
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Chad has become much more unstable,

278
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and we are not paying for that price at the pump.

279
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th.

280
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We do the same thing

281
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
with the price of policing the Persian Gulf

282
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and keeping the shipping lanes open.

283
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is 1988 --

284
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.

285
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there

286
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that we do not pay for at the pump.

287
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We pay for it on April 15th,

288
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement.

289
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil

290
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and our increased consumption

291
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
is the Gulf of Mexico,

292
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
which was not part of the moratoriums.

293
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see,

294
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
this is the Minerals Management diagram

295
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of wells for gas and oil.

296
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It's become this intense industrialized zone.

297
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It doesn't have the same resonance for us

298
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has,

299
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.

300
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Also, every time you buy gasoline in the United States,

301
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
half of it is actually being refined along the coast,

302
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because the Gulf actually has

303
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
about 50 percent of our refining capacity

304
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and a lot of our marine terminals as well.

305
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us

306
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
through a less-clean environment.

307
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And finally, American families also pay a price for oil.

308
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high

309
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
when you consider the actual cost of the oil,

310
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but on the other hand,

311
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the fact that people have no other transit options

312
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
means that they pay a large amount of their income

313
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
into just getting back and forth to work,

314
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
generally in a fairly crummy car.

315
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
If you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids,

316
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
they might have three jobs or more,

317
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and then they have to really commute.

318
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
They're actually spending more on their car and fuel

319
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
than they are on taxes or on health care.

320
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And the same thing happens

321
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
at the 50th percentile, around 80,000.

322
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain

323
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
on the American economy,

324
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but they're also a drain on individual families

325
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher.

326
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So, what I'm going to talk to you about now is:

327
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
what do we have to do this time?

328
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
What are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?

329
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater.

330
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We need to stay away from the moratoriums.

331
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We need to focus really back again

332
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
on the molecules.

333
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus

334
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
on the molecules on the oil.

335
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
One of the things that we also need to do,

336
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves

337
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
into thinking that you can have a green world,

338
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
before you reduce the amount of oil that we use.

339
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We need to focus on reducing the oil.

340
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic

341
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy.

342
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray,

343
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and the un-useful stuff,

344
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
which is called the rejected energy -- the waste,

345
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
goes up to the top.

346
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs

347
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the actually useful amount.

348
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And one of the things that we need to do

349
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles

350
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and make them much more efficient,

351
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but we also need to fix the economy in general.

352
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel.

353
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
For example, we have an insurance system

354
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year

355
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.

356
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We actually encourage people to drive more.

357
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies.

358
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
We need to have more mobility choices.

359
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We need to make the gas price

360
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
better reflect the real cost of oil.

361
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry,

362
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
which is at least 10 billion dollars a year,

363
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute.

364
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Whether that's getting a much more efficient car

365
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and also kind of building markets

366
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
for new cars and new fuels down the road,

367
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
this is where we need to be.

368
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing,

369
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
and you can find more about this policy.

370
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It's called STRONG, which is "Secure Transportation

371
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Reducing Oil Needs Gradually,"

372
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and the idea is instead of being helpless, we need to be more strong.

373
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
They're up at NewAmerica.net.

374
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
What's important about these

375
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
is that we try to move

376
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
from feeling helpless at the pump,

377
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to actually being active

378
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and to really sort of thinking about who we are,

379
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
having kind of that special moment,

380
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
where we connect the dots actually at the pump.

381
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Now supposedly, oil taxes

382
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone.

383
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil

384
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
is probably too much,

385
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
but I think that if we started this year

386
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
with three cents a gallon on gasoline,

387
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year,

388
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
all the way up to 30 cents by 2020,

389
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption,

390
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and at the same time we would give people time to prepare,

391
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
time to respond,

392
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.

393
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work.

394
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
This is a gas receipt, hypothetically, for a year from now.

395
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The first thing that you have on the tax is --

396
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents.

397
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So you're not helpless at the pump.

398
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign,

399
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
very similar to what you would find

400
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
on a cigarette pack.

401
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences

402
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car

403
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
creates 29 cents in health care costs."

404
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
That's a lot.

405
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And so this -- you can see that you're paying considerably less

406
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
than the health care costs on the tax.

407
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And also, the hope is that

408
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
you start to be connected to the whole greater system.

409
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And at the same time, you have a number that you can call

410
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
to get more information on commuting,

411
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car,

412
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
or whatever it is you're going to need

413
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
to actually reduce your gasoline dependence.

414
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
With this whole sort of suite of policies,

415
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption --

416
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
or our oil consumption --

417
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
by 20 percent by 2020.

418
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So, three million barrels a day.

419
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
But in order to do this,

420
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
one of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember

421
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
we are people of the hydrocarbon.

422
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
We need to keep or minds on the molecules

423
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and not get distracted by the theater,

424
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance

425
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
of the green possibilities that are out there.

426
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work

427
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules.

428
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you.

429
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.486,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I love paper, and I love technology,

2
0:00:16.57,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and what I do is I make paper interactive.

3
0:00:19.901,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And that's what I say when people ask me what I do,

4
0:00:22.354,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but it really confuses most people,

5
0:00:24.253,000 --> 0:00:26,000
so really, the best way for me to convey it

6
0:00:26.432,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is to take the technology and be creative

7
0:00:29.444,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and create experiences.

8
0:00:31.545,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So I tried to think what I could use for here,

9
0:00:33.797,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea

10
0:00:35.917,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that I wanted to print two DJ decks

11
0:00:39.73,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and to try and mix some music.

12
0:00:42.214,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I'm going to try and show that at the end,

13
0:00:44.429,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and the suspense will be as much mine if it works.

14
0:00:47.938,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician,

15
0:00:50.604,000 --> 0:00:52,000
so I'm a little bit scared of that.

16
0:00:53.327,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So I think, I found the best way to describe my journey

17
0:00:58.864,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is just to mention a few little things

18
0:01:00.514,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that have happened to me throughout my life.

19
0:01:02.614,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There's three particular things that I've done,

20
0:01:04.896,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I'll just describe those first,

21
0:01:06.587,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and then talk about some of my work.

22
0:01:08.606,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So when I was a kid, I was obsessed with wires,

23
0:01:11.835,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I used to thread them under my carpet

24
0:01:14.941,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and thread them behind the walls

25
0:01:16.535,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and have little switches and little speakers,

26
0:01:18.856,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive

27
0:01:21.572,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but kind of all hidden away.

28
0:01:23.102,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I was also really interested in wireless as well.

29
0:01:27.143,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So I bought one of those little kits that you could get

30
0:01:29.787,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to make a radio transmitter,

31
0:01:31.372,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and I got an old book and I carved out the inside

32
0:01:34.637,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I hid it inside there,

33
0:01:36.507,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and then I placed it next to my dad

34
0:01:38.914,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and snuck back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio

35
0:01:42.992,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so I could eavesdrop.

36
0:01:44.72,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I was not at all interested in what he was saying.

37
0:01:47.125,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's more that I just liked the idea

38
0:01:48.963,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of an everyday object

39
0:01:50.477,000 --> 0:01:51,000
having something inside

40
0:01:51.758,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and doing something different.

41
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Several year later,

42
0:01:56.826,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I managed to successfully fail all of my exams

43
0:02:00.049,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and didn't really leave school with much to show for at all,

44
0:02:04.774,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and my parents, maybe as a reward,

45
0:02:08.332,000 --> 0:02:09,000
bought me what turned out to be

46
0:02:10.192,000 --> 0:02:11,000
a one-way ticket to Australia,

47
0:02:11.902,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and I came back home about four years later.

48
0:02:15.344,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere.

49
0:02:19.326,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It was in far western New South Wales.

50
0:02:21.774,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And this farm was 120,000 acres.

51
0:02:24.525,000 --> 0:02:25,000
There were 22,000 sheep,

52
0:02:26.318,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and it was about 40 degrees,

53
0:02:28.232,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or 100 or so Fahrenheit.

54
0:02:30.886,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And on this farm there was the farmer, his wife,

55
0:02:33.92,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and there was the four-year-old daughter.

56
0:02:36.631,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And they kind of took me into the farm

57
0:02:39.253,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and showed me what it was like to live and work.

58
0:02:42.026,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Obviously, one of the most important things was the sheep,

59
0:02:44.812,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and so my job was, well, pretty much to do everything,

60
0:02:47.749,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead.

61
0:02:51.149,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And we'd do that by building fences,

62
0:02:53.14,000 --> 0:02:55,000
using motorbikes and horses,

63
0:02:55.694,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and the sheep would make their way all the way back

64
0:02:58.147,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to the shearing shed for the different seasons.

65
0:03:01.954,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And what I learned was,

66
0:03:03.862,000 --> 0:03:05,000
although at the time, like everyone else,

67
0:03:05.958,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I thought sheep were pretty stupid

68
0:03:07.602,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because they didn't do what we wanted them to do,

69
0:03:09.31,000 --> 0:03:12,000
what I realize now, probably only just in the last few weeks

70
0:03:12.431,000 --> 0:03:14,000
looking back, is the sheep weren't stupid at all.

71
0:03:14.462,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We'd put them in an environment where they didn't want to be,

72
0:03:16.894,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and they didn't want to do what we wanted them to do.

73
0:03:19.442,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So the challenge was to try and get them

74
0:03:21.856,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to do what we wanted them to do

75
0:03:22.878,000 --> 0:03:25,000
by listening to the weather, the lay of the land,

76
0:03:25.969,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and creating things that would let the sheep flow

77
0:03:28.98,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and go where we wanted them to go.

78
0:03:31.678,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Another bunch of years later,

79
0:03:33.285,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I ended up at Cambridge University

80
0:03:35.644,000 --> 0:03:37,000
at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.

81
0:03:37.826,000 --> 0:03:38,000
doing a Ph.D. in physics.

82
0:03:39.54,000 --> 0:03:44,000
My Ph.D. was to move electrons around, one at a time.

83
0:03:44.564,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I realize — again, it's kind of these realizations

84
0:03:47.22,000 --> 0:03:49,000
looking back as to what I did —

85
0:03:49.419,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I realize now that it was pretty much the same

86
0:03:52.35,000 --> 0:03:53,000
as moving sheep around.

87
0:03:54.187,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It really is.

88
0:03:56.461,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It's just you do it by changing an environment.

89
0:03:59.317,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And that's kind of been a big lesson to me,

90
0:04:01.368,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that you can't act on any object.

91
0:04:02.964,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You change its environment, and the object will flow.

92
0:04:05.512,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So we made it very small,

93
0:04:07.554,000 --> 0:04:09,000
so things were about 30 nanometers in size;

94
0:04:10.442,000 --> 0:04:14,000
making it very cold, so at liquid helium temperatures;

95
0:04:15.237,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and changing environment by changing the voltage,

96
0:04:18.297,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and the electrons could make flow around a loop

97
0:04:21.761,000 --> 0:04:23,000
one at a time, on and off, a little memory node.

98
0:04:24.398,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I wanted to go one step further,

99
0:04:26.334,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and I wanted to move one electron on

100
0:04:28.517,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and one electron off.

101
0:04:30.452,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this,

102
0:04:33.314,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which, you know, as we've heard from other people,

103
0:04:35.328,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that's the thing that makes you do it.

104
0:04:37.162,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And I was determined, and I managed to show that I could do that.

105
0:04:40.7,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And a lot of that learning, I think,

106
0:04:42.439,000 --> 0:04:43,000
came from being on that farm,

107
0:04:43.944,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because when I was working on the farm,

108
0:04:45.969,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we'd have to use what was around us,

109
0:04:47.997,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we'd have to use the environment,

110
0:04:49.79,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and there was no such thing

111
0:04:51.664,000 --> 0:04:52,000
as something can't be done,

112
0:04:52.974,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because you're in an environment where,

113
0:04:54.856,000 --> 0:04:56,000
if you can't do what you need to do,

114
0:04:57.069,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you can die, and, you know,

115
0:04:58.679,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I had seen that sort of thing happen.

116
0:05:02.409,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So now my obsession is printing,

117
0:05:05.019,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I'm really fascinated by the idea

118
0:05:07.836,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of using conventional printing processes,

119
0:05:10.78,000 --> 0:05:12,000
so the types of print that are used to create

120
0:05:13.005,000 --> 0:05:14,000
many of the things around us

121
0:05:14.363,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to make paper and card interactive.

122
0:05:18.128,000 --> 0:05:2,000
When I spoke to some printers when I started doing this

123
0:05:20.249,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and told them what I wanted to do,

124
0:05:21.893,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which was to print conductive inks onto paper,

125
0:05:24.119,000 --> 0:05:25,000
they told me it couldn't be done,

126
0:05:25.715,000 --> 0:05:27,000
again, that kind of favorite thing.

127
0:05:27.961,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So I got about 10 credit cards and loans

128
0:05:32.667,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and got myself very close to bankruptcy, really,

129
0:05:36.165,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and bought myself this huge printing press,

130
0:05:38.258,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which I had no idea how to use at all.

131
0:05:40.382,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It was about five meters long,

132
0:05:41.913,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I covered myself and the floor with ink

133
0:05:44.171,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and made a massive mess, but I learned to print.

134
0:05:47.459,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And then I took it back to the printers and showed them what I've done,

135
0:05:49.988,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and they were like, "Of course you can do that.

136
0:05:52.203,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Why didn't you come here in the first place?"

137
0:05:54.407,000 --> 0:05:56,000
That's always the case.

138
0:05:57.377,000 --> 0:06:,000
So what we do is we take conventional printing presses,

139
0:06:01.164,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we make conductive inks,

140
0:06:03.119,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and run those through a press, and basically

141
0:06:06.612,000 --> 0:06:09,000
just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow

142
0:06:09.964,000 --> 0:06:1,000
through pieces of paper

143
0:06:11.335,000 --> 0:06:12,000
so we can make that paper interactive.

144
0:06:13.324,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And it's pretty simple, really.

145
0:06:14.825,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's just a collection of things that have been done before,

146
0:06:17.688,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but bringing them together in a different way.

147
0:06:19.903,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on,

148
0:06:22.527,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips,

149
0:06:27.14,000 --> 0:06:29,000
one to run some capacitive touch software,

150
0:06:29.206,000 --> 0:06:3,000
so we know where we've touched it,

151
0:06:30.85,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and the other to run, quite often,

152
0:06:33.388,000 --> 0:06:36,000
some wireless software so the piece of paper can connect.

153
0:06:37.351,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created.

154
0:06:40.758,000 --> 0:06:42,000
There's lots of different things we've created.

155
0:06:43.021,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is one of them, because I love cake.

156
0:06:45.462,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And this one, it's a large poster,

157
0:06:48.154,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it,

158
0:06:50.392,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and the poster talks to you when you touch it

159
0:06:52.63,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and asks you a series of questions,

160
0:06:54.321,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and it works out your perfect cake.

161
0:06:56.335,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But it doesn't tell you the cake there and then.

162
0:06:58.731,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It uploads a picture,

163
0:07:00.329,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and the reason why it chose that cake for you,

164
0:07:02.727,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to our Facebook page and to Twitter.

165
0:07:05.95,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So we're trying to create that connection

166
0:07:08.777,000 --> 0:07:09,000
between the physical and the digital,

167
0:07:10.563,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but have it not looking on a screen,

168
0:07:12.601,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and just looking like a regular poster.

169
0:07:15.724,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We've worked with a bunch of universities on a project

170
0:07:20.46,000 --> 0:07:21,000
looking at interactive newsprint.

171
0:07:22.437,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So for example, we've created a newspaper,

172
0:07:24.578,000 --> 0:07:25,000
a regular newspaper.

173
0:07:25.893,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly,

174
0:07:28.878,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and when you touch it, you can hear the music

175
0:07:31.045,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that's described on the top, which is something you can't read.

176
0:07:34.069,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You can hear a press conference

177
0:07:36.235,000 --> 0:07:38,000
as well as reading what the editor has determined

178
0:07:38.779,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that press conference was about.

179
0:07:40.327,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And you can press a Facebook "like" button

180
0:07:42.464,000 --> 0:07:44,000
or you can vote on something as well.

181
0:07:45.143,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Something else that we created,

182
0:07:46.382,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and this was an idea that I had a couple of years ago,

183
0:07:48.646,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and so we've done a project on this.

184
0:07:49.715,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It was for funding from the government

185
0:07:51.756,000 --> 0:07:54,000
for user-centered design for energy-efficient buildings,

186
0:07:55.286,000 --> 0:07:57,000
difficult to say, and something I had no idea what it was

187
0:07:57.32,000 --> 0:07:59,000
when I went into the workshop, but quickly learned.

188
0:08:00.104,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And we wanted to try and encourage people

189
0:08:02.267,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to use energy better.

190
0:08:04.115,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I really liked the idea that, instead of looking at dials

191
0:08:07.637,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and reading things to say --

192
0:08:10.183,000 --> 0:08:11,000
looking at your energy usage,

193
0:08:12.125,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected

194
0:08:15.379,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and had color-changing inks on it,

195
0:08:17.023,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and so if your energy usage was trending better,

196
0:08:20.599,000 --> 0:08:22,000
than the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear

197
0:08:22.926,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and all would be good.

198
0:08:24.312,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti

199
0:08:26.336,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and the leaves would fall off the trees.

200
0:08:28.265,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So it was trying to make you look after something

201
0:08:30.755,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in your immediate environment,

202
0:08:32.88,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which you don't want to see not looking so good,

203
0:08:35.369,000 --> 0:08:37,000
rather than expecting people to do things

204
0:08:37.496,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in the local environment because of the effect

205
0:08:39.807,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that it has a long way off.

206
0:08:41.286,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And I think, kind of like going back to the farm,

207
0:08:43.644,000 --> 0:08:46,000
it's about how to let people do what you want them to do

208
0:08:46.672,000 --> 0:08:5,000
rather than making people do what you want them to do.

209
0:08:51.089,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Okay.

210
0:08:52.549,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So this is the bit I'm really scared of.

211
0:08:55.371,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So a couple of things I've created are,

212
0:08:57.61,000 --> 0:08:58,000
there's a poster over here

213
0:08:59.027,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that you can play drums on.

214
0:09:01.458,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And I am not a musician. It seemed like a good idea at the time.

215
0:09:06.205,000 --> 0:09:08,000
If anyone wants to try and play drums, then they can.

216
0:09:08.977,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I'll just describe how this works.

217
0:09:10.621,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone,

218
0:09:14.615,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and when you touch it, it connects to the app.

219
0:09:17.491,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Drums)

220
0:09:25.778,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And it has really good response time.

221
0:09:27.622,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It's using Bluetooth 4, so it's pretty instantaneous.

222
0:09:32.322,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Okay. Thanks.

223
0:09:34.904,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Applause)

224
0:09:39.168,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And there's a couple of other things.

225
0:09:40.954,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So this one is like a sound board,

226
0:09:43.486,000 --> 0:09:47,000
so you can touch it, and I just love these horrible noises.

227
0:09:48.096,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass)

228
0:09:55.876,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable.

229
0:09:58.685,000 --> 0:10:,000
So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,

230
0:10:01.142,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and this is a software that's running on the iPad.

231
0:10:05.779,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Oh, yes. I just love doing that.

232
0:10:09.403,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I'm not a D.J., though, but I just always wanted to do that.

233
0:10:12.427,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Scratching)

234
0:10:14.828,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So I have a crossfader, and I have the two decks.

235
0:10:19.721,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So I've made some new technology,

236
0:10:22.076,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and I love things being creative,

237
0:10:23.672,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and I love working with creative people.

238
0:10:25.601,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,

239
0:10:28.273,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and she's called Charlotte,

240
0:10:29.293,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and I asked her to record something,

241
0:10:31.479,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and I worked with a friend called Elliot

242
0:10:33.408,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to put some beats together.

243
0:10:34.925,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So this is my niece, Charlotte.

244
0:10:36.985,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Music)

245
0:11:10.273,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Yay!

246
0:11:12.356,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Applause)

247
0:11:21.422,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So that's pretty much what I do.

248
0:11:23.494,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I just love bringing technology together,

249
0:11:25.15,000 --> 0:11:26,000
having a lot of fun, being creative.

250
0:11:27.091,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But it's not about the technology.

251
0:11:28.839,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's just about, I want to create some great experiences.

252
0:11:31.703,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So thank you very much.

253
0:11:33.103,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

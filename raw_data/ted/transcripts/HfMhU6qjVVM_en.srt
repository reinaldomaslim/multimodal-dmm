1
0:00:16.06,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"You have cancer."

2
0:00:20.5,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Sadly, about 40 percent of us will hear those three words within our lifetime,

3
0:00:25.66,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and half will not survive.

4
0:00:28.78,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This means that two out of five of your closest friends and relatives

5
0:00:32.66,000 --> 0:00:34,000
will be diagnosed with some form of cancer,

6
0:00:35.14,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and one will die.

7
0:00:39.1,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Beyond the physical hardships,

8
0:00:40.58,000 --> 0:00:43,000
roughly one-third of cancer survivors here in the US

9
0:00:43.78,000 --> 0:00:44,000
will go into debt from treatment.

10
0:00:45.54,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And they're at least two and a half times more likely to declare bankruptcy

11
0:00:49.3,000 --> 0:00:5,000
than those without cancer.

12
0:00:51.5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This disease is pervasive.

13
0:00:53.9,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's emotionally draining

14
0:00:55.5,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and, for many,

15
0:00:56.74,000 --> 0:00:57,000
financially destructive.

16
0:00:59.7,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But a cancer diagnosis doesn't have to be a death sentence.

17
0:01:03.74,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Finding cancer early,

18
0:01:05.62,000 --> 0:01:06,000
closer its genesis,

19
0:01:06.86,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is one of the critical factors to improving treatment options,

20
0:01:10.5,000 --> 0:01:11,000
reducing its emotional impact

21
0:01:12.5,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and minimizing financial burdens.

22
0:01:15.38,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Most importantly,

23
0:01:16.62,000 --> 0:01:17,000
finding cancer early --

24
0:01:17.9,000 --> 0:01:19,000
which is one of the primary aims of my research --

25
0:01:20.82,000 --> 0:01:22,000
greatly enhances your odds of survival.

26
0:01:23.94,000 --> 0:01:25,000
If we just look at the case of breast cancer for example,

27
0:01:26.7,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we find that those who are diagnosed and treated at stage one

28
0:01:30.22,000 --> 0:01:33,000
have a five-year survival rate of nearly 100 percent --

29
0:01:34.58,000 --> 0:01:38,000
odds that decrease to just 22 percent if treated at stage four.

30
0:01:39.86,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And similar trends are found for colorectal and ovarian cancer.

31
0:01:45.82,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, we're all aware that an early diagnosis that is accurate

32
0:01:51.3,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is critical for survival.

33
0:01:55.42,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The problem is that many cancer diagnostic tools are invasive,

34
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
costly,

35
0:02:00.5,000 --> 0:02:01,000
often inaccurate

36
0:02:01.74,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and they can take an agonizing amount of time to get the results back.

37
0:02:06.34,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Still worse, when it comes to some forms of cancer,

38
0:02:08.78,000 --> 0:02:12,000
such as ovarian, liver or pancreatic cancer,

39
0:02:13.1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
good screening methods simply don't exist,

40
0:02:16.7,000 --> 0:02:2,000
meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface,

41
0:02:20.78,000 --> 0:02:23,000
which are themselves already indicators of late-stage progression.

42
0:02:25.74,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Like a tornado strike in an area without an early warning system,

43
0:02:29.34,000 --> 0:02:3,000
there is no alarm to warn,

44
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for the danger is already at your doorstep

45
0:02:34.14,000 --> 0:02:37,000
when your odds of survival are greatly reduced.

46
0:02:39.22,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Having the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options

47
0:02:43.5,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that are affordable, noninvasive and could provide results much sooner,

48
0:02:48.86,000 --> 0:02:52,000
would provide us with a formidable weapon in the fight against cancer.

49
0:02:54.58,000 --> 0:02:57,000
An early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease

50
0:02:57.66,000 --> 0:02:59,000
instead of merely following in its relentless wake.

51
0:03:00.42,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And this is exactly what I've been doing.

52
0:03:02.42,000 --> 0:03:05,000
For the past three years, I've been developing technologies

53
0:03:05.58,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that could ultimately aid clinicians

54
0:03:07.34,000 --> 0:03:09,000
with rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics.

55
0:03:10.74,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I've been fueled by a deep scientific curiosity,

56
0:03:14.62,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and a passion to change these statistics.

57
0:03:18.7,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Last year however,

58
0:03:20.78,000 --> 0:03:21,000
this fight became much more personal

59
0:03:23.86,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.

60
0:03:27.38,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It was an experience that added a strong and unexpected emotional dimension

61
0:03:31.82,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to these efforts.

62
0:03:35.06,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I know firsthand how life-altering treatment can be,

63
0:03:39.34,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and I'm keenly aware of the emotional havoc

64
0:03:42.02,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that cancer can wreak on a family,

65
0:03:44.5,000 --> 0:03:46,000
which in our case included our two young daughters.

66
0:03:48.22,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Because we found it early during a routine mammogram,

67
0:03:51.38,000 --> 0:03:54,000
we were able to focus primarily on treatment options

68
0:03:55.1,000 --> 0:03:56,000
for the localized tumor,

69
0:03:56.66,000 --> 0:04:,000
reaffirming to me how important an early diagnosis is.

70
0:04:02.78,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Unlike other forms of cancer,

71
0:04:05.22,000 --> 0:04:08,000
mammograms do offer an early-stage screening option for breast cancer.

72
0:04:08.9,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Still, not everyone has this done,

73
0:04:11.14,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or they may develop breast cancer

74
0:04:12.75,000 --> 0:04:15,000
before the middle age recommendation for having a mammogram.

75
0:04:17.38,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So, there's still a lot of room for improvement,

76
0:04:19.66,000 --> 0:04:21,000
even for cancers that do have screening options,

77
0:04:21.94,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and, of course, considerable benefits for those that don't.

78
0:04:25.5,000 --> 0:04:27,000
A key challenge then for cancer researchers

79
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is to develop methods

80
0:04:29.58,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that make regular screening for many types of cancers

81
0:04:33.14,000 --> 0:04:34,000
much more accessible.

82
0:04:35.74,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Imagine a scenario where during your regular checkup,

83
0:04:38.82,000 --> 0:04:41,000
your doctor can take a simple, noninvasive urine sample,

84
0:04:42.62,000 --> 0:04:43,000
or other liquid biopsy,

85
0:04:44.54,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and present you with the results before you even leave the doctor's office.

86
0:04:48.62,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Such a technology could dramatically reduce the number of people

87
0:04:52.18,000 --> 0:04:55,000
who slip through the net of an early-stage cancer diagnosis.

88
0:04:56.66,000 --> 0:04:58,000
My research team of engineers and biochemists

89
0:04:59.5,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is working on exactly this challenge.

90
0:05:02.14,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We're working on ways to frequently activate an early-stage cancer alarm

91
0:05:07.3,000 --> 0:05:11,000
by enabling regular screenings that would start when a person is healthy

92
0:05:11.66,000 --> 0:05:15,000
so that action could be taken to stop cancer the moment it emerges,

93
0:05:15.98,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and before it can progress beyond its infancy.

94
0:05:20.46,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The silver bullet in this case are tiny vesicles,

95
0:05:23.5,000 --> 0:05:27,000
little escape pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes.

96
0:05:28.5,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Exosomes are important biomarkers

97
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that provide an early-warning system for the development of cancer.

98
0:05:35.54,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And because they're abundantly present in just about every bodily fluid,

99
0:05:38.98,000 --> 0:05:4,000
including blood, urine and saliva,

100
0:05:41.5,000 --> 0:05:45,000
they're extremely attractive for noninvasive liquid biopsies.

101
0:05:46.86,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There's just one problem.

102
0:05:48.46,000 --> 0:05:52,000
An automated system for rapidly sorting these important biomarkers

103
0:05:52.78,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is not currently available.

104
0:05:55.5,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We've created a technology that we call nano-DLD

105
0:05:58.82,000 --> 0:06:,000
that is capable of precisely this:

106
0:06:01.74,000 --> 0:06:03,000
automated exosome isolation

107
0:06:04.46,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to aid rapid cancer diagnostics.

108
0:06:07.86,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Exosomes are the newest early-warning weapon, if you will,

109
0:06:11.42,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.

110
0:06:13.5,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And they're really, really small.

111
0:06:15.82,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They measure just 30 to 150 nanometers in diameter.

112
0:06:20.1,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is so tiny

113
0:06:21.42,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that you could fit about a million of them into a single red blood cell.

114
0:06:25.62,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That's roughly the difference between a golf ball

115
0:06:27.98,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and a fine grain piece of sand.

116
0:06:30.74,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Once thought to be little bins for unwanted cellular waste,

117
0:06:34.46,000 --> 0:06:36,000
it has been found that cells actually communicate

118
0:06:37.46,000 --> 0:06:4,000
by producing and absorbing these exosomes

119
0:06:40.62,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which contain surface receptors,

120
0:06:43.02,000 --> 0:06:47,000
proteins and other genetic material collected from their cell of origin.

121
0:06:48.34,000 --> 0:06:5,000
When absorbed by a neighboring cell,

122
0:06:51.02,000 --> 0:06:54,000
exosomes release their contents into the receiving cell,

123
0:06:54.86,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and can set in motion fundamental changes in gene expression --

124
0:06:58.1,000 --> 0:06:59,000
some good,

125
0:06:59.34,000 --> 0:07:,000
and this is where cancer comes in,

126
0:07:01.1,000 --> 0:07:02,000
some bad.

127
0:07:02.7,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Because they are clothed in the material of the mother cell,

128
0:07:06.5,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and contain a sample of its environment,

129
0:07:08.46,000 --> 0:07:13,000
they provide a genetic snapshot of that cell's health and its origin.

130
0:07:15.02,000 --> 0:07:18,000
All of these qualities make exosomes invaluable messengers

131
0:07:18.18,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that potentially allow physicians

132
0:07:19.82,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to eavesdrop on your health at the cellular level.

133
0:07:23.9,000 --> 0:07:24,000
To catch cancer early, however,

134
0:07:25.58,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you have to frequently intercept these messages

135
0:07:28.54,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to determine when cancer-causing troublemakers within your body

136
0:07:32.06,000 --> 0:07:33,000
decide to start staging a coup,

137
0:07:33.9,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which is why regular screening is so critical

138
0:07:36.94,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and why we're developing technologies to make this possible.

139
0:07:40.94,000 --> 0:07:45,000
While the first exosome-based diagnostics emerged on the market just this year,

140
0:07:46.62,000 --> 0:07:49,000
they are not yet part of mainstream healthcare options.

141
0:07:51.14,000 --> 0:07:52,000
In addition to their recent emergence,

142
0:07:53.02,000 --> 0:07:56,000
another factor that's limiting their widespread adoption

143
0:07:56.5,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is that currently, no automated exosome isolation system exists

144
0:08:00.46,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to make regular screening economically accessible.

145
0:08:04.62,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The current gold standard for exosome isolation

146
0:08:07.38,000 --> 0:08:08,000
includes ultracentrifugation,

147
0:08:09.34,000 --> 0:08:12,000
a process requiring expensive laboratory equipment,

148
0:08:12.62,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a trained lab tech

149
0:08:13.9,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and about 30 hours of time to process a sample.

150
0:08:18.42,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We've come up with a different approach for achieving automated exosome isolation

151
0:08:23.1,000 --> 0:08:24,000
from a sample such as urine.

152
0:08:25.38,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We use a chip-based, continuous flow separation technique

153
0:08:29.66,000 --> 0:08:31,000
called deterministic lateral displacement.

154
0:08:32.66,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And we have done with it

155
0:08:34.06,000 --> 0:08:38,000
what the semiconductor industry has done so successfully for the past 50 years.

156
0:08:38.54,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We shrunk the dimensions of this technology

157
0:08:40.62,000 --> 0:08:42,000
from the micron scale to the true nanoscale.

158
0:08:44.54,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So how does it work?

159
0:08:46.02,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In a nutshell,

160
0:08:47.3,000 --> 0:08:5,000
a set of tiny pillars separated by nanoscopic gaps

161
0:08:51.3,000 --> 0:08:52,000
are arranged in such a way

162
0:08:52.58,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that the system divides the fluid into streamlines,

163
0:08:55.66,000 --> 0:08:58,000
with the larger cancer-related nanoparticles being separated

164
0:08:59.06,000 --> 0:09:02,000
through a process of redirection from the smaller, healthier ones,

165
0:09:02.98,000 --> 0:09:03,000
which can in contrast

166
0:09:04.54,000 --> 0:09:06,000
move around the pillars in a zigzag-type motion

167
0:09:07.1,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in the direction of fluid flow.

168
0:09:09.9,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The net result is a complete separation of these two particle populations.

169
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You can visualize this separation process

170
0:09:18.98,000 --> 0:09:21,000
similar to traffic on a highway that separates into two roads,

171
0:09:22.86,000 --> 0:09:25,000
with one road going into a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain,

172
0:09:26.34,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and the other road going around it.

173
0:09:28.42,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Here, smaller cars can go through the tunnel

174
0:09:31.22,000 --> 0:09:34,000
while larger trucks, carrying potentially hazardous material,

175
0:09:34.54,000 --> 0:09:35,000
are forced to take the detour route.

176
0:09:37.42,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Traffic is effectively separated by size and contents

177
0:09:41.54,000 --> 0:09:43,000
without impeding its flow.

178
0:09:43.58,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And this is exactly how our system works on a much, much smaller scale.

179
0:09:49.42,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The idea here is that the separation process for screening

180
0:09:53.3,000 --> 0:09:57,000
could be as simple as processing a sample of urine, blood or saliva,

181
0:09:57.38,000 --> 0:10:,000
which is a near-term possibility within the next few years.

182
0:10:00.7,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Ultimately, it could be used to isolate and detect target exosomes

183
0:10:06.02,000 --> 0:10:09,000
associated with a particular type of cancer,

184
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
sensing and reporting their presence within minutes.

185
0:10:12.42,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This would make rapid diagnostics virtually painless.

186
0:10:16.54,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Broadly speaking,

187
0:10:17.82,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the ability to separate and enrich biomarkers

188
0:10:20.5,000 --> 0:10:22,000
with nanoscale precision in an automated way,

189
0:10:24.14,000 --> 0:10:27,000
opens the door to better understanding diseases such as cancer,

190
0:10:27.62,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with applications ranging from sample preparation to diagnostics,

191
0:10:31.62,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and from drug resistance monitoring to therapeutics.

192
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Even before my wife's bout with cancer,

193
0:10:37.3,000 --> 0:10:4,000
it was a dream of mine to facilitate the automation of this process --

194
0:10:41.66,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to make regular screening more accessible,

195
0:10:44.62,000 --> 0:10:46,000
similar to the way Henry Ford made the automobile accessible

196
0:10:47.54,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to the general population

197
0:10:49.14,000 --> 0:10:51,000
through development of the assembly line.

198
0:10:51.42,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Automation is the key to accessibility.

199
0:10:56.1,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And in the spirit of the Hoover dream,

200
0:10:57.98,000 --> 0:10:59,000
"a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage,"

201
0:11:00.9,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we're developing a technology

202
0:11:02.34,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that could ultimately place an early-warning cancer detection system

203
0:11:06.18,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in every home.

204
0:11:07.82,000 --> 0:11:09,000
This would allow every man, woman and child

205
0:11:09.9,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the opportunity to be regularly tested while they're still healthy,

206
0:11:14.06,000 --> 0:11:15,000
catching cancer when it first emerges.

207
0:11:17.22,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It is my hope and dream

208
0:11:18.74,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to help people around the world avoid the high costs --

209
0:11:22.46,000 --> 0:11:24,000
physical, financial and emotional --

210
0:11:25.02,000 --> 0:11:26,000
faced by today's cancer patients,

211
0:11:27.42,000 --> 0:11:29,000
hardships that I'm well acquainted with.

212
0:11:31.22,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I'm also happy to report that because we caught my wife's cancer early,

213
0:11:35.62,000 --> 0:11:36,000
her treatment was successful,

214
0:11:37.3,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and she is now, thankfully, cancer-free.

215
0:11:39.58,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Applause)

216
0:11:47.98,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It is an outcome that I would like to see for everyone with a cancer diagnosis.

217
0:11:53.1,000 --> 0:11:55,000
With the work that my team has already done

218
0:11:55.18,000 --> 0:11:57,000
on separation of nanoscale biomarkers

219
0:11:57.94,000 --> 0:11:59,000
for rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics,

220
0:12:00.9,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I am optimistic that within the next decade,

221
0:12:03.46,000 --> 0:12:05,000
this type of technology will be available,

222
0:12:06.06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
helping protect our friends, our family and future generations.

223
0:12:10.5,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Even if we are so unlucky as to be diagnosed with cancer,

224
0:12:14.42,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that early-stage alarm will provide a strong beacon of hope.

225
0:12:18.1,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Thank you.

226
0:12:19.34,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.721,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A computer is an incredibly powerful means

2
0:00:15.388,000 --> 0:00:16,000
of creative expression,

3
0:00:17.042,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but for the most part,

4
0:00:18.613,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that expression is confined to the screens

5
0:00:20.778,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of our laptops and mobile phones.

6
0:00:23.196,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I'd like to tell you a story about

7
0:00:25.396,000 --> 0:00:26,000
bringing this power of the computer

8
0:00:27.352,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to move things around and interact with us

9
0:00:29.722,000 --> 0:00:31,000
off of the screen and into the physical world

10
0:00:32.635,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in which we live.

11
0:00:33.824,000 --> 0:00:34,000
A few years ago, I got a call from

12
0:00:35.442,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York,

13
0:00:37.928,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the next thing I knew,

14
0:00:39.192,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures

15
0:00:41.885,000 --> 0:00:42,000
for their window displays.

16
0:00:43.277,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This one's called "The Chase."

17
0:00:44.672,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There are two pairs of shoes,

18
0:00:46.018,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a man's pair and a woman's pair,

19
0:00:47.643,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and they play out this slow, tense chase

20
0:00:50.547,000 --> 0:00:51,000
around the window

21
0:00:51.825,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in which the man scoots up behind the woman

22
0:00:54.05,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and gets in her personal space,

23
0:00:55.623,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and then she moves away.

24
0:00:57.558,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Each of the shoes has magnets in it,

25
0:00:59.399,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and there are magnets underneath the table

26
0:01:01.402,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that move the shoes around.

27
0:01:03.366,000 --> 0:01:05,000
My friend Andy Cavatorta was building

28
0:01:05.398,000 --> 0:01:08,000
a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour

29
0:01:08.94,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and I wound up building the electronics

30
0:01:11.332,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and motion control software

31
0:01:13.521,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to make the harps move and play music.

32
0:01:15.987,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The harp has four separate pendulums,

33
0:01:17.998,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and each pendulum has 11 strings,

34
0:01:20.124,000 --> 0:01:22,000
so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates

35
0:01:22.612,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in order to play different musical notes,

36
0:01:24.815,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and the harps are all networked together

37
0:01:26.977,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so that they can play the right notes

38
0:01:28.777,000 --> 0:01:3,000
at the right time in the music.

39
0:01:31.403,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I built an interactive chemistry exhibit

40
0:01:33.827,000 --> 0:01:35,000
at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago,

41
0:01:36.426,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and this exhibit lets people use physical objects

42
0:01:39.407,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table

43
0:01:42.443,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and bring them together to cause

44
0:01:43.851,000 --> 0:01:44,000
chemical reactions to happen.

45
0:01:45.617,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And the museum noticed that people

46
0:01:47.541,000 --> 0:01:49,000
were spending a lot of time with this exhibit,

47
0:01:49.767,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and a researcher from a science education center

48
0:01:52.914,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in Australia decided to study this exhibit

49
0:01:55.719,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and try to figure out what was going on.

50
0:01:57.959,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And she found that the physical objects

51
0:02:00.252,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that people were using were helping people

52
0:02:01.916,000 --> 0:02:03,000
understand how to use the exhibit,

53
0:02:03.93,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and were helping people learn in a social way.

54
0:02:06.873,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And when you think about it, this makes a lot of sense,

55
0:02:09.139,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that using specialized physical objects

56
0:02:11.379,000 --> 0:02:14,000
would help people use an interface more easily.

57
0:02:14.651,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I mean, our hands and our minds are optimized

58
0:02:17.49,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to think about and interact with tangible objects.

59
0:02:20.759,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Think about which you find easier to use,

60
0:02:22.821,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard

61
0:02:25.14,000 --> 0:02:27,000
like on a phone?

62
0:02:27.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But the thing that struck me

63
0:02:28.265,000 --> 0:02:29,000
about all of these different projects

64
0:02:30.264,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is that they really had to be built from scratch,

65
0:02:33.381,000 --> 0:02:34,000
down to the level of the electronics

66
0:02:35.171,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the printed circuit boards and

67
0:02:36.277,000 --> 0:02:38,000
all the mechanisms all the way up to the software.

68
0:02:39.022,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I wanted to create something

69
0:02:40.784,000 --> 0:02:43,000
where we could move objects under computer control

70
0:02:44.103,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and create interactions around that idea

71
0:02:46.352,000 --> 0:02:48,000
without having to go through this process

72
0:02:48.567,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of building something from scratch

73
0:02:49.95,000 --> 0:02:5,000
every single time.

74
0:02:51.325,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So my first attempt at this

75
0:02:53.316,000 --> 0:02:54,000
was at the MIT Media Lab

76
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:56,000
with Professor Hiroshi Ishii,

77
0:02:56.581,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and we built this array of

78
0:02:58.416,000 --> 0:03:,000
512 different electromagnets,

79
0:03:00.673,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and together they were able to move objects around

80
0:03:03.3,000 --> 0:03:04,000
on top of their surface.

81
0:03:04.836,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But the problem with this

82
0:03:06.384,000 --> 0:03:07,000
was that these magnets

83
0:03:08.04,000 --> 0:03:1,000
cost over 10,000 dollars.

84
0:03:10.2,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Although each one was pretty small,

85
0:03:11.866,000 --> 0:03:12,000
altogether they weighed so much

86
0:03:13.575,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that the table that they were on

87
0:03:14.83,000 --> 0:03:15,000
started to sag.

88
0:03:16.388,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So I wanted to build something

89
0:03:17.72,000 --> 0:03:18,000
where you could have this kind of interaction

90
0:03:19.336,000 --> 0:03:21,000
on any tabletop surface.

91
0:03:21.979,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So to explore this idea,

92
0:03:24.06,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I built an army of small robots,

93
0:03:26.21,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels.

94
0:03:28.975,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They're these special wheels

95
0:03:30.28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that can move equally easily in all directions,

96
0:03:32.946,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and when you couple these robots

97
0:03:35.535,000 --> 0:03:36,000
with a video projector,

98
0:03:37.445,000 --> 0:03:38,000
you have these physical tools

99
0:03:39.253,000 --> 0:03:41,000
for interacting with digital information.

100
0:03:42.153,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So here's an example of what I mean.

101
0:03:43.995,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This is a video editing application

102
0:03:45.917,000 --> 0:03:46,000
where all of the controls

103
0:03:47.403,000 --> 0:03:49,000
for manipulating the video are physical.

104
0:03:49.71,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So if we want to tweak the color,

105
0:03:51.292,000 --> 0:03:52,000
we just enter the color mode,

106
0:03:52.644,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and then we get three different dials

107
0:03:53.94,000 --> 0:03:54,000
for tweaking the color,

108
0:03:55.318,000 --> 0:03:56,000
or if we want to adjust the audio,

109
0:03:57.279,000 --> 0:04:,000
then we get two different dials for that, these physical objects.

110
0:04:00.62,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So here the left and right channel stay in sync,

111
0:04:03.466,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but if we want to, we can override that

112
0:04:05.209,000 --> 0:04:07,000
by grabbing both of them at the same time.

113
0:04:08.208,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So the idea is that we get the speed

114
0:04:10.136,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials

115
0:04:13.253,000 --> 0:04:15,000
together with the flexibility and versatility

116
0:04:16.043,000 --> 0:04:19,000
of a system that's designed in software.

117
0:04:19.374,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And this is a mapping application

118
0:04:21.309,000 --> 0:04:23,000
for disaster response.

119
0:04:23.436,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So you have these physical objects

120
0:04:25.381,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that represent police, fire and rescue,

121
0:04:27.608,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and a dispatcher can grab them

122
0:04:29.161,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and place them on the map

123
0:04:30.487,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to tell those units where to go,

124
0:04:32.476,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and then the position of the units on the map

125
0:04:34.852,000 --> 0:04:35,000
gets synced up with the position

126
0:04:36.821,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of those units in the real world.

127
0:04:40.448,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is a video chat application.

128
0:04:42.06,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's amazing how much emotion you can convey

129
0:04:44.412,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with just a few simple movements

130
0:04:45.625,000 --> 0:04:47,000
of a physical object.

131
0:04:48.05,000 --> 0:04:51,000
With this interface, we open up a huge array of possibilities

132
0:04:51.102,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in between traditional board games

133
0:04:53.18,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and arcade games,

134
0:04:54.594,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where the physical possibilities of interaction

135
0:04:57.141,000 --> 0:05:,000
make so many different styles of play possible.

136
0:05:00.854,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But one of the areas that I'm most excited

137
0:05:03.243,000 --> 0:05:04,000
about using this platform for

138
0:05:05.057,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is applying it to problems that are difficult

139
0:05:07.6,000 --> 0:05:09,000
for computers or people to solve alone.

140
0:05:09.854,000 --> 0:05:11,000
One example of those is protein folding.

141
0:05:12.476,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So here we have an interface

142
0:05:13.888,000 --> 0:05:16,000
where we have physical handles onto a protein,

143
0:05:17.402,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and we can grab those handles

144
0:05:19.153,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways.

145
0:05:22.14,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense

146
0:05:25.14,000 --> 0:05:26,000
with the underlying molecular simulation,

147
0:05:27.107,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we get this physical feedback where we can

148
0:05:29.309,000 --> 0:05:3,000
actually feel these physical handles

149
0:05:31.282,000 --> 0:05:32,000
pulling back against us.

150
0:05:32.89,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So feeling what's going on

151
0:05:34.421,000 --> 0:05:36,000
inside a molecular simulation

152
0:05:36.66,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is a whole different level of interaction.

153
0:05:39.606,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So we're just beginning to explore

154
0:05:42.587,000 --> 0:05:44,000
what's possible when we use software

155
0:05:45.098,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to control the movement

156
0:05:46.589,000 --> 0:05:48,000
of objects in our environment.

157
0:05:48.832,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Maybe this is the computer of the future.

158
0:05:51.736,000 --> 0:05:52,000
There's no touchscreen.

159
0:05:53.352,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There's no technology visible at all.

160
0:05:55.383,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But when we want to have a video chat

161
0:05:57.227,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or play a game

162
0:05:58.688,000 --> 0:06:,000
or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk,

163
0:06:01.401,000 --> 0:06:03,000

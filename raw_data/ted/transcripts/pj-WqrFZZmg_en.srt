1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:14,000
[This talk contains graphic images]

2
0:00:16.849,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I'm sitting across from Pedro,

3
0:00:19.186,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the coyote, the human smuggler,

4
0:00:21.395,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in his cement block apartment,

5
0:00:24.766,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in a dusty Reynosa neighborhood

6
0:00:26.686,000 --> 0:00:28,000
somewhere on the US-Mexico border.

7
0:00:29.546,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's 3am.

8
0:00:31.371,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The day before, he had asked me to come back to his apartment.

9
0:00:35.006,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We would talk man to man.

10
0:00:37.77,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He wanted me to be there at night and alone.

11
0:00:41.062,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I didn't know if he was setting me up,

12
0:00:43.309,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but I knew I wanted to tell his story.

13
0:00:46.087,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He asked me, "What will you do

14
0:00:48.675,000 --> 0:00:52,000
if one of these pollitos, or migrants, slips into the water and can't swim?

15
0:00:53.604,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Will you simply take your pictures and watch him drown?

16
0:00:56.921,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Or will you jump in and help me?"

17
0:01:00.631,000 --> 0:01:06,000
At that moment, Pedro wasn't a cartoonish TV version of a human smuggler.

18
0:01:07.052,000 --> 0:01:09,000
He was just a young man, about my age,

19
0:01:09.523,000 --> 0:01:11,000
asking me some really tough questions.

20
0:01:12.284,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This was life and death.

21
0:01:14.077,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The next night, I photographed Pedro as he swam the Rio Grande,

22
0:01:18.099,000 --> 0:01:22,000
crossing with a group of young migrants into the United States.

23
0:01:23.228,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Real lives hung in the balance every time he crossed people.

24
0:01:28.292,000 --> 0:01:29,000
For the last 20 years,

25
0:01:29.467,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I've documented one of the largest transnational migrations

26
0:01:33.028,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in world history,

27
0:01:34.544,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which has resulted in millions of undocumented people

28
0:01:37.375,000 --> 0:01:38,000
living in the United States.

29
0:01:39.528,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The vast majority of these people leave Central America and Mexico

30
0:01:43.688,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to escape grinding poverty and extreme levels of social violence.

31
0:01:48.696,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I photograph intimate moments of everyday people's lives,

32
0:01:52.825,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of people living in the shadows.

33
0:01:55.706,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Time and again, I've witnessed resilient individuals

34
0:01:59.492,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in extremely challenging situations

35
0:02:02.022,000 --> 0:02:06,000
constructing practical ways to improve their lives.

36
0:02:07.061,000 --> 0:02:08,000
With these photographs,

37
0:02:08.297,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I place you squarely in the middle of these moments

38
0:02:11.553,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and ask you to think about them as if you knew them.

39
0:02:14.427,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This body of work is a historical document,

40
0:02:17.188,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a time capsule that can teach us not only about migration,

41
0:02:21.258,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but about society and ourselves.

42
0:02:25.027,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I started the project in the year 2000.

43
0:02:31.242,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The migrant trail has taught me

44
0:02:34.101,000 --> 0:02:37,000
how we treat our most vulnerable residents in the United States.

45
0:02:37.704,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It has taught me about violence and pain and hope and resilience

46
0:02:43.423,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and struggle and sacrifice.

47
0:02:45.625,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It has taught me firsthand

48
0:02:47.569,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that rhetoric and political policy directly impact real people.

49
0:02:52.981,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And most of all,

50
0:02:55.005,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the migrant trail has taught me

51
0:02:57.282,000 --> 0:03:,000
that everyone who embarks on it is changed forever.

52
0:03:01.544,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I began this project in the year 2000

53
0:03:04.344,000 --> 0:03:08,000
by documenting a group of day laborers on Chicago’s Northwest side.

54
0:03:09.503,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Each day, the men would wake up at 5am,

55
0:03:12.201,000 --> 0:03:14,000
go to a McDonald's, where they would stand outside

56
0:03:14.569,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and wait to jump into strangers' work vans,

57
0:03:17.3,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in the hopes of finding a job for the day.

58
0:03:19.887,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They earned five dollars an hour,

59
0:03:22.157,000 --> 0:03:24,000
had no job security, no health insurance

60
0:03:24.807,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and were almost all undocumented.

61
0:03:27.292,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The men were all pretty tough.

62
0:03:31.109,000 --> 0:03:32,000
They had to be.

63
0:03:32.284,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The police constantly harassed them for loitering,

64
0:03:35.157,000 --> 0:03:37,000
as they made their way each day.

65
0:03:38.395,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Slowly, they welcomed me into their community.

66
0:03:40.974,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And this was one of the first times

67
0:03:42.768,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that I consciously used my camera as a weapon.

68
0:03:45.53,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One day, as the men were organizing to make a day-labor worker center,

69
0:03:50.093,000 --> 0:03:53,000
a young man named Tomás came up to me and asked me

70
0:03:53.323,000 --> 0:03:55,000
will I stay afterwards and photograph him.

71
0:03:55.379,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So I agreed.

72
0:03:56.744,000 --> 0:03:59,000
As he walked into the middle of the empty dirt lot,

73
0:03:59.982,000 --> 0:04:01,000
a light summer rain started to fall.

74
0:04:03.76,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Much to my surprise, he started to take off his clothes. (Laughs)

75
0:04:07.927,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I didn't exactly know what to do.

76
0:04:10.871,000 --> 0:04:11,000
He pointed to the sky and said,

77
0:04:12.776,000 --> 0:04:13,000
"Our bodies are all we have."

78
0:04:15.171,000 --> 0:04:18,000
He was proud, defiant and vulnerable, all at once.

79
0:04:19.633,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And this remains one of my favorite photographs of the past 20 years.

80
0:04:23.411,000 --> 0:04:25,000
His words have stuck with me ever since.

81
0:04:26.99,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I met Lupe Guzmán around the same time,

82
0:04:29.908,000 --> 0:04:32,000
while she was organizing and fighting the day-labor agencies

83
0:04:33.434,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which were exploiting her and her coworkers.

84
0:04:36.252,000 --> 0:04:4,000
She organized small-scale protests, sit-ins and much more.

85
0:04:41.395,000 --> 0:04:44,000
She paid a high price for her activism,

86
0:04:44.76,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because the day-labor agencies like Ron's

87
0:04:47.585,000 --> 0:04:49,000
blackballed her and refused to give her work.

88
0:04:51.029,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So in order to survive,

89
0:04:52.847,000 --> 0:04:55,000
she started selling elotes, or corn on the cob, on the street,

90
0:04:56.522,000 --> 0:04:57,000
as a street vendor.

91
0:04:58.054,000 --> 0:05:,000
And today, you can still find her

92
0:05:00.323,000 --> 0:05:03,000
selling all types of corn and different candies and stuff.

93
0:05:04.882,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Lupe brought me into the inner world of her family

94
0:05:07.771,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and showed me the true impact of migration.

95
0:05:11.271,000 --> 0:05:14,000
She introduced me to everyone in her extended family,

96
0:05:14.466,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Gabi, Juan, Conchi, Chava, everyone.

97
0:05:19.149,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Her sister Remedios had married Anselmo,

98
0:05:21.911,000 --> 0:05:22,000
whose eight of nine siblings

99
0:05:23.839,000 --> 0:05:26,000
had migrated from Mexico to Chicago in the nineties.

100
0:05:27.244,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So many people in her family opened their world to me

101
0:05:31.284,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and shared their stories.

102
0:05:33.577,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Families are the heart and lifeblood of the migrant trail.

103
0:05:38.824,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When these families migrate,

104
0:05:40.879,000 --> 0:05:42,000
they change and transform societies.

105
0:05:44.3,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's rare to be able to access so intimately

106
0:05:47.427,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the intimate and day-to-day lives

107
0:05:49.868,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of people who, by necessity, are closed to outsiders.

108
0:05:53.622,000 --> 0:05:54,000
At the time,

109
0:05:54.796,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Lupe's family lived in the insular world of the Back of the Yards,

110
0:05:58.76,000 --> 0:06:,000
a tight-knit Chicago neighborhood,

111
0:06:01.569,000 --> 0:06:04,000
which for more than 100 years had been a portal of entry

112
0:06:04.932,000 --> 0:06:05,000
for recent immigrants --

113
0:06:07.371,000 --> 0:06:08,000
first, from Europe, like my family,

114
0:06:09.161,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and more recently, from Latin America.

115
0:06:11.609,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Their world was largely hidden from view.

116
0:06:14.775,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And they call the larger, white world outside the neighborhood

117
0:06:18.123,000 --> 0:06:19,000
"Gringolandia."

118
0:06:21.252,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You know, like lots of generations moving to the Back of the Yards,

119
0:06:24.736,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the family did the thankless hidden jobs that most people didn't want to do:

120
0:06:29.632,000 --> 0:06:34,000
cleaning office buildings, preparing airline meals in cold factories,

121
0:06:34.76,000 --> 0:06:36,000
meat packing, demolitions.

122
0:06:38.037,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It was hard manual labor for low exploitation wages.

123
0:06:41.718,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But on weekends, they celebrated together,

124
0:06:44.638,000 --> 0:06:46,000
with backyard barbecues

125
0:06:47.368,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and birthday celebrations,

126
0:06:49.258,000 --> 0:06:51,000
like most working families the world over.

127
0:06:52.315,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I became an honorary family member.

128
0:06:55.378,000 --> 0:06:59,000
My nickname was "Johnny Canales," after the Tejano TV star.

129
0:07:00.259,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I had access to the dominant culture,

130
0:07:02.172,000 --> 0:07:06,000
so I was part family photographer, part social worker

131
0:07:06.387,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and part strange outsider payaso clown, who was there to amuse them.

132
0:07:11.934,000 --> 0:07:14,000
One of the most memorable moments of this time

133
0:07:15.228,000 --> 0:07:19,000
was photographing the birth of Lupe's granddaughter, Elizabeth.

134
0:07:20.514,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Her two older siblings had crossed across the Sonoran Desert,

135
0:07:25.151,000 --> 0:07:28,000
being carried and pushed in strollers into the United States.

136
0:07:28.413,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So at that time,

137
0:07:30.143,000 --> 0:07:33,000
her family allowed me to photograph her birth.

138
0:07:33.942,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And it was one of the really coolest things

139
0:07:36.014,000 --> 0:07:41,000
as the nurses placed baby Elizabeth on Gabi's chest.

140
0:07:41.506,000 --> 0:07:43,000
She was the family's first American citizen.

141
0:07:44.847,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That girl is 17 today.

142
0:07:48.077,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And I still remain in close contact with Lupe

143
0:07:51.553,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and much of her family.

144
0:07:54.093,000 --> 0:07:58,000
My work is firmly rooted in my own family's history

145
0:07:58.843,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of exile and subsequent rebirth in the United States.

146
0:08:03.2,000 --> 0:08:07,000
My father was born in Nazi Germany in 1934.

147
0:08:07.72,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Like most assimilated German Jews,

148
0:08:10.204,000 --> 0:08:12,000
my grandparents simply hoped

149
0:08:12.68,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that the troubles of the Third Reich would blow over.

150
0:08:16.616,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But in spring of 1939,

151
0:08:18.83,000 --> 0:08:22,000
a small but important event happened to my family.

152
0:08:23.409,000 --> 0:08:25,000
My dad needed an appendectomy.

153
0:08:25.465,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And because he was Jewish,

154
0:08:27.088,000 --> 0:08:29,000
not one hospital would operate on him.

155
0:08:31.02,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The operation was carried out on his kitchen table,

156
0:08:34.121,000 --> 0:08:35,000
on the family's kitchen table.

157
0:08:37.553,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Only after understanding the discrimination they faced

158
0:08:40.514,000 --> 0:08:42,000
did my grandparents make the gut-wrenching decision

159
0:08:43.376,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to send their two children on the Kindertransport bound for England.

160
0:08:49.84,000 --> 0:08:53,000
My family's survival has informed my deep commitment

161
0:08:54.358,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to telling this migration story

162
0:08:56.546,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in a deep and nuanced way.

163
0:08:58.821,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The past and the present are always interconnected.

164
0:09:03.56,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The long-standing legacy

165
0:09:05.45,000 --> 0:09:08,000
of the US government's involvement in Latin America

166
0:09:08.768,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is controversial and well-documented.

167
0:09:11.322,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The 1954 CIA-backed coup of Árbenz in Guatemala,

168
0:09:15.353,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the Iran-Contra scandal, the School of the Americas,

169
0:09:18.879,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the murder of Archbishop Romero on the steps of a San Salvador church

170
0:09:22.665,000 --> 0:09:24,000
are all examples of this complex history,

171
0:09:25.506,000 --> 0:09:29,000
a history which has led to instability

172
0:09:29.87,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and impunity in Central America.

173
0:09:34.068,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Luckily, the history is not unremittingly dark.

174
0:09:39.292,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The United States and Mexico took in thousands and millions, actually,

175
0:09:43.947,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of refugees escaping the civil wars of the 70s and 80s.

176
0:09:48.542,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But by the time I was documenting the migrant trail in Guatemala

177
0:09:52.138,000 --> 0:09:53,000
in the late 2000s,

178
0:09:53.63,000 --> 0:09:59,000
most Americans had no connection to the increasing levels of violence,

179
0:09:59.665,000 --> 0:10:01,000
impunity and migration in Central America.

180
0:10:02.514,000 --> 0:10:05,000
To most US citizens, it might as well have been the Moon.

181
0:10:07.662,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Over the years, I slowly pieced together

182
0:10:10.734,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the complicated puzzle that stretched from Central America through Mexico

183
0:10:15.9,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to my backyard in Chicago.

184
0:10:18.18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I hit almost all the border towns -- Brownsville, Reynosa, McAllen,

185
0:10:22.553,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Yuma, Calexico --

186
0:10:23.887,000 --> 0:10:25,000
recording the increasing militarization of the border.

187
0:10:27.383,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Each time I returned,

188
0:10:29.129,000 --> 0:10:32,000
there was more infrastructure, more sensors, more fences,

189
0:10:32.986,000 --> 0:10:35,000
more Border Patrol agents and more high-tech facilities

190
0:10:36.888,000 --> 0:10:4,000
with which to incarcerate the men, women and children

191
0:10:41.847,000 --> 0:10:42,000
who our government detained.

192
0:10:44.077,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Post-9/11, it became a huge industry.

193
0:10:47.901,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I photographed the massive and historic immigration marches in Chicago,

194
0:10:52.694,000 --> 0:10:54,000
children at detention facilities

195
0:10:54.869,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and the slow percolating rise of anti-immigrant hate groups,

196
0:10:59.754,000 --> 0:11:01,000
including sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona.

197
0:11:03.23,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I documented the children in detention facilities,

198
0:11:08.38,000 --> 0:11:09,000
deportation flights

199
0:11:10.32,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and a lot of different things.

200
0:11:13.807,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I witnessed the rise of the Mexican drug war

201
0:11:16.538,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and the deepening levels of social violence in Central America.

202
0:11:20.871,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I came to understand how interconnected all these disparate elements were

203
0:11:25.109,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and how interconnected we all are.

204
0:11:27.998,000 --> 0:11:28,000
As photographers,

205
0:11:29.553,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we never really know which particular moment will stay with us

206
0:11:34.369,000 --> 0:11:37,000
or which particular person will be with us.

207
0:11:38.55,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The people we photograph become a part of our collective history.

208
0:11:42.193,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Jerica Estrada was a young eight-year-old girl

209
0:11:45.331,000 --> 0:11:46,000
whose memory has stayed with me.

210
0:11:47.593,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Her father had gone to LA in order to work to support his family.

211
0:11:53.158,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And like any dutiful father,

212
0:11:54.528,000 --> 0:11:57,000
he returned home to Guatemala, bearing gifts.

213
0:11:58.618,000 --> 0:12:01,000
That weekend, he had presented his eldest son with a motorcycle --

214
0:12:02.356,000 --> 0:12:03,000
a true luxury.

215
0:12:04.368,000 --> 0:12:07,000
As the son was driving the father back home

216
0:12:07.575,000 --> 0:12:08,000
from a family party,

217
0:12:11.274,000 --> 0:12:14,000
a gang member rode up and shot the dad through the back.

218
0:12:15.685,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It was a case of mistaken identity,

219
0:12:17.955,000 --> 0:12:19,000
an all too common occurrence in this country.

220
0:12:20.717,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But the damage was done.

221
0:12:22.32,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The bullet passed through the father and into the son.

222
0:12:27.524,000 --> 0:12:29,000
This was not a random act of violence,

223
0:12:29.794,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but one instance of social violence

224
0:12:32.239,000 --> 0:12:34,000
in a region of the world where this has become the norm.

225
0:12:36.215,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Impunity thrives when all the state and governmental institutions

226
0:12:40.607,000 --> 0:12:41,000
fail to protect the individual.

227
0:12:42.998,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Too often, the result forces people to leave their homes and flee

228
0:12:47.275,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and take great risks in search of safety.

229
0:12:50.068,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Jerica's father died en route to the hospital.

230
0:12:53.331,000 --> 0:12:55,000
His body had saved his son's life.

231
0:12:56.125,000 --> 0:12:59,000
As we arrived to the public hospital,

232
0:12:59.601,000 --> 0:13:,000
to the gates of the public hospital,

233
0:13:01.371,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I noticed a young girl in a pink striped shirt, screaming.

234
0:13:05.649,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Nobody comforted the little girl as she clasped her tiny hands.

235
0:13:10.228,000 --> 0:13:11,000
She was the man's youngest daughter,

236
0:13:11.98,000 --> 0:13:12,000
her name was Jerica Estrada.

237
0:13:13.982,000 --> 0:13:14,000
She cried and raged,

238
0:13:15.76,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and nobody could do anything, for her father was gone.

239
0:13:18.768,000 --> 0:13:2,000
These days, when people ask me

240
0:13:21.125,000 --> 0:13:24,000
why young mothers with four-month-old babies

241
0:13:24.196,000 --> 0:13:25,000
will travel thousands of miles,

242
0:13:25.871,000 --> 0:13:28,000
knowing they will likely be imprisoned in the United States,

243
0:13:29.268,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I remember Jerica, and I think of her and of her pain

244
0:13:33.762,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and of her father who saved his son's life with his own body,

245
0:13:38.526,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and I understand the truly human need

246
0:13:40.923,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to migrate in search of a better life.

247
0:13:43.183,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Thank you.

248
0:13:44.357,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Applause)

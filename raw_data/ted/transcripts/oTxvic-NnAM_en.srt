1
0:00:16.315,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's an amazing thing

2
0:00:17.49,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that we're here to talk about the year of patients rising.

3
0:00:22.266,000 --> 0:00:23,000
You heard stories earlier today

4
0:00:24.01,000 --> 0:00:27,000
about patients who are taking control of their cases,

5
0:00:27.062,000 --> 0:00:28,000
patients who are saying,

6
0:00:28.241,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"You know what, I know what the odds are,

7
0:00:30.239,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I'm going to look for more information.

8
0:00:32.413,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm going to define what the terms of my success are."

9
0:00:36.197,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm going to be sharing with you how, four years ago, I almost died --

10
0:00:40.01,000 --> 0:00:42,000
found out I was, in fact, already almost dead --

11
0:00:42.917,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and what I then found out

12
0:00:45.179,000 --> 0:00:47,000
about what's called the e-Patient movement.

13
0:00:47.405,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'll explain what that term means.

14
0:00:49.078,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I had been blogging under the name "Patient Dave,"

15
0:00:51.87,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and when I discovered this,

16
0:00:53.268,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave.

17
0:00:55.939,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Regarding the word "patient":

18
0:00:57.666,000 --> 0:01:,000
When I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care

19
0:01:01.626,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and attending meetings as just a casual observer,

20
0:01:04.01,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I noticed that people would talk about patients

21
0:01:06.273,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as if it was somebody who's not in the room here --

22
0:01:08.872,000 --> 0:01:09,000
somebody out there.

23
0:01:10.29,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Some of our talks today, we still act like that.

24
0:01:12.827,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But I'm here to tell you:

25
0:01:14.763,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"patient" is not a third-person word.

26
0:01:18.145,000 --> 0:01:19,000
All right?

27
0:01:19.332,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You yourself will find yourself in a hospital bed --

28
0:01:22.576,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or your mother, your child --

29
0:01:24.255,000 --> 0:01:25,000
there are heads nodding, people who say,

30
0:01:26.197,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"Yes, I know exactly what you mean."

31
0:01:27.962,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So when you hear what I'm going to talk about here today,

32
0:01:31.01,000 --> 0:01:34,000
first of all, I want to say that I am here

33
0:01:34.064,000 --> 0:01:36,000
on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met,

34
0:01:36.668,000 --> 0:01:37,000
all the ones I haven't met.

35
0:01:38.395,000 --> 0:01:41,000
This is about letting patients play a more active role

36
0:01:42.192,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in helping health care, in fixing health care.

37
0:01:45.193,000 --> 0:01:46,000
One of the senior doctors at my hospital,

38
0:01:47.216,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Charlie Safran, and his colleague, Warner Slack,

39
0:01:49.814,000 --> 0:01:5,000
have been saying for decades

40
0:01:51.356,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that the most underutilized resource in all of health care

41
0:01:55.14,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is the patient.

42
0:01:56.859,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They have been saying that since the 1970s.

43
0:01:59.549,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, I'm going to step back in history.

44
0:02:01.529,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This is from July, 1969.

45
0:02:03.439,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I was a freshman in college,

46
0:02:05.125,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and this was when we first landed on the Moon.

47
0:02:08.113,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And it was the first time

48
0:02:09.568,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we had ever seen from another surface --

49
0:02:12.355,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that's the place where you and I are right now,

50
0:02:14.623,000 --> 0:02:15,000
where we live.

51
0:02:15.805,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The world was changing.

52
0:02:17.376,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee.

53
0:02:20.377,000 --> 0:02:23,000
A few weeks later, Woodstock happened.

54
0:02:24.645,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Three days of fun and music.

55
0:02:26.749,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Here, just for historical authenticity,

56
0:02:28.873,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is a picture of me in that year.

57
0:02:30.696,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:33.946,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Yeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes --

59
0:02:35.947,000 --> 0:02:36,000
it was really something.

60
0:02:37.61,000 --> 0:02:38,000
That fall of 1969,

61
0:02:39.611,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the Whole Earth Catalog came out.

62
0:02:41.522,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It was a hippie journal of self-sufficiency.

63
0:02:45.01,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We think of hippies of being just hedonists,

64
0:02:48.065,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but there's a very strong component -- I was in that movement --

65
0:02:51.29,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a very strong component of being responsible for yourself.

66
0:02:54.658,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This book's title's subtitle is "Access to Tools."

67
0:02:58.579,000 --> 0:03:,000
It talked about how to build your own house,

68
0:03:00.899,000 --> 0:03:02,000
how to grow your own food, all kinds of things.

69
0:03:03.328,000 --> 0:03:04,000
In the 1980s,

70
0:03:04.756,000 --> 0:03:06,000
this young doctor, Tom Ferguson,

71
0:03:06.914,000 --> 0:03:08,000
was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog.

72
0:03:09.565,000 --> 0:03:13,000
He saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care

73
0:03:14.36,000 --> 0:03:15,000
is taking care of ourselves.

74
0:03:16.271,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent

75
0:03:18.646,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of how we actually take care of our bodies.

76
0:03:20.939,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Well, he also saw that when health care turns to medical care

77
0:03:25.641,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because of a more serious disease,

78
0:03:27.575,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the key thing that holds us back is access to information.

79
0:03:30.923,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And when the Web came along, that changed everything,

80
0:03:34.213,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because not only could we find information,

81
0:03:36.83,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we could find other people like ourselves

82
0:03:39.57,000 --> 0:03:41,000
who could gather, who could bring us information.

83
0:03:42.185,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And he coined this term "e-Patients" --

84
0:03:44.724,000 --> 0:03:46,000
equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.

85
0:03:47.079,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Obviously, at this stage of life

86
0:03:48.804,000 --> 0:03:51,000
he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then.

87
0:03:52.795,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term.

88
0:03:56.773,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In 2006, I went to my doctor for a regular physical,

89
0:03:59.773,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and I had said, "I have a sore shoulder."

90
0:04:02.096,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Well, I got an X-ray,

91
0:04:03.693,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the next morning --

92
0:04:05.365,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you may have noticed, those of you who have been through a medical crisis

93
0:04:08.914,000 --> 0:04:09,000
will understand this.

94
0:04:10.138,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This morning, some of the speakers named the date when they found out

95
0:04:14.624,000 --> 0:04:15,000
about their condition.

96
0:04:15.919,000 --> 0:04:17,000
For me, it was 9am

97
0:04:18.356,000 --> 0:04:2,000
on January 3, 2007.

98
0:04:21.084,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I was at the office; my desk was clean.

99
0:04:23.603,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I had the blue partition carpet on the walls.

100
0:04:27.347,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The phone rang and it was my doctor.

101
0:04:30.167,000 --> 0:04:32,000
He said, "Dave, I pulled up the X-ray image

102
0:04:33.01,000 --> 0:04:35,000
on the screen on the computer at home."

103
0:04:35.124,000 --> 0:04:37,000
He said, "Your shoulder is going to be fine,

104
0:04:37.215,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but Dave, there's something in your lung."

105
0:04:39.324,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And if you look in that red oval,

106
0:04:41.256,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that shadow was not supposed to be there.

107
0:04:45.01,000 --> 0:04:46,000
To make a long story short,

108
0:04:47.01,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I said, "So you need me to get back in there?"

109
0:04:49.189,000 --> 0:04:52,000
He said, "Yeah, we're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest."

110
0:04:52.464,000 --> 0:04:54,000
In parting, I said, "Is there anything I should do?"

111
0:04:55.129,000 --> 0:04:56,000
He said -- think about this one,

112
0:04:57.01,000 --> 0:04:58,000
this is the advice your doctor gives you:

113
0:04:59.01,000 --> 0:05:02,000
"Just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife."

114
0:05:04.283,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I went in for the CAT scan.

115
0:05:07.478,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs.

116
0:05:10.729,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So at that point we knew that it was cancer.

117
0:05:12.915,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We knew it wasn't lung cancer.

118
0:05:14.978,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That meant it was metastasized from somewhere.

119
0:05:18.388,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The question was, where from?

120
0:05:20.494,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So I went in for an ultrasound.

121
0:05:23.144,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I got to do what many women have --

122
0:05:25.661,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the jelly on the belly and the, "Bzzzz!"

123
0:05:29.01,000 --> 0:05:3,000
My wife came with me.

124
0:05:31.195,000 --> 0:05:32,000
She's a veterinarian,

125
0:05:32.824,000 --> 0:05:33,000
so she's seen lots of ultrasounds.

126
0:05:34.645,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I mean, she knows I'm not a dog.

127
0:05:36.253,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:37.921,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This is an MRI image.

129
0:05:40.922,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be.

130
0:05:43.368,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What we saw in that kidney

131
0:05:46.142,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was that big blob there.

132
0:05:47.677,000 --> 0:05:5,000
There were actually two of these: one was growing out the front

133
0:05:50.741,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and had already erupted and latched onto the bowel.

134
0:05:53.188,000 --> 0:05:56,000
One was growing out the back and it attached to the psoas muscle,

135
0:05:56.431,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which is a big muscle in the back that I'd never heard of,

136
0:05:59.24,000 --> 0:06:,000
but all of a sudden I cared about it.

137
0:06:01.097,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:02.12,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I went home.

139
0:06:03.307,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Now, I've been Googling --

140
0:06:04.605,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I've been online since 1989, on CompuServe.

141
0:06:07.019,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I went home, and I know you can't read the details here;

142
0:06:09.673,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that's not important.

143
0:06:10.863,000 --> 0:06:14,000
My point is, I went to a respected medical website, WebMD,

144
0:06:15.091,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because I know how to filter out junk.

145
0:06:17.373,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I also found my wife online.

146
0:06:19.898,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Before I met her,

147
0:06:21.604,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I went through some suboptimal search results.

148
0:06:24.104,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:25.676,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So I looked for quality information.

150
0:06:28.854,000 --> 0:06:29,000
There's so much about trust --

151
0:06:30.61,000 --> 0:06:32,000
what sources of information can we trust?

152
0:06:33.137,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Where does my body end and an invader start?

153
0:06:37.925,000 --> 0:06:4,000
A cancer, a tumor, is something you grow out of your own tissue.

154
0:06:41.087,000 --> 0:06:42,000
How does that happen?

155
0:06:42.676,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Where does medical ability end and start?

156
0:06:46.719,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Well, so what I read on WebMD:

157
0:06:49.175,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer.

158
0:06:54.185,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Almost all patients are incurable."

159
0:06:57.567,000 --> 0:07:,000
I've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get,

160
0:07:01.306,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I go look for more.

161
0:07:02.483,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And what I found on other websites was,

162
0:07:05.169,000 --> 0:07:07,000
even by the third page of Google results:

163
0:07:07.557,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"Outlook is bleak."

164
0:07:09.612,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"Prognosis is grim."

165
0:07:12.199,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And I'm thinking, "What the heck?"

166
0:07:14.319,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I didn't feel sick at all.

167
0:07:16.075,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I mean, I'd been getting tired in the evening,

168
0:07:18.289,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but I was 56 years old, you know?

169
0:07:20.329,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I was slowly losing weight,

170
0:07:22.01,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but for me, that was what the doctor told me to do.

171
0:07:26.258,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It was really something.

172
0:07:27.954,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And this is the diagram of stage 4 kidney cancer

173
0:07:31.158,000 --> 0:07:32,000
from the drug I eventually got.

174
0:07:32.939,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Totally by coincidence, there's that thing in my lung.

175
0:07:36.009,000 --> 0:07:38,000
In the left femur, the left thigh bone, there's another one.

176
0:07:39.01,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I had one. My leg eventually snapped.

177
0:07:41.399,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I fainted and landed on it, and it broke.

178
0:07:44.345,000 --> 0:07:45,000
There's one in the skull,

179
0:07:45.617,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and then for good measure, I had these other tumors,

180
0:07:48.104,000 --> 0:07:5,000
including, by the time my treatment started,

181
0:07:50.199,000 --> 0:07:51,000
one was growing out of my tongue.

182
0:07:51.812,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue.

183
0:07:53.98,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And what I read

184
0:07:55.163,000 --> 0:07:57,000
was that my median survival was 24 weeks.

185
0:07:58.424,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This was bad.

186
0:07:59.903,000 --> 0:08:,000
I was facing the grave.

187
0:08:02.303,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I thought, "What's my mother's face going to look like

188
0:08:04.901,000 --> 0:08:05,000
on the day of my funeral?"

189
0:08:06.605,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I had to sit down with my daughter and say, "Here's the situation."

190
0:08:12.114,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Her boyfriend was with her.

191
0:08:13.552,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I said, "I don't want you guys to get married prematurely,

192
0:08:16.377,000 --> 0:08:18,000
just so you can do it while Dad's still alive."

193
0:08:20.339,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's really serious.

194
0:08:21.932,000 --> 0:08:24,000
If you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help,

195
0:08:25.536,000 --> 0:08:26,000
think about this.

196
0:08:26.718,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Well, my doctor prescribed a patient community, ACOR.org,

197
0:08:30.772,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a network of cancer patients, of all amazing things.

198
0:08:34.01,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Very quickly they told me,

199
0:08:36.01,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease.

200
0:08:38.01,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Get yourself to a specialist center.

201
0:08:40.011,000 --> 0:08:42,000
There is no cure, but there's something that sometimes works --

202
0:08:43.034,000 --> 0:08:44,000
it usually doesn't --

203
0:08:44.614,000 --> 0:08:45,000
called high-dosage interleukin.

204
0:08:46.452,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Most hospitals don't offer it,

205
0:08:48.484,000 --> 0:08:5,000
so they won't even tell you it exists.

206
0:08:50.683,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Don't let them give you anything else first.

207
0:08:52.826,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And by the way, here are four doctors in your part of the United States

208
0:08:56.223,000 --> 0:08:57,000
who offer it, and their phone numbers."

209
0:08:58.198,000 --> 0:09:,000
How amazing is that?

210
0:09:00.66,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Applause)

211
0:09:03.498,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Here's the thing:

212
0:09:04.718,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Here we are, four years later --

213
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
you can't find a website that gives patients that information.

214
0:09:09.93,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Government-approved, American Cancer Society,

215
0:09:12.487,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but patients know what patients want to know.

216
0:09:16.094,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's the power of patient networks.

217
0:09:18.889,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This amazing substance -- again, I mentioned:

218
0:09:22.142,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Where does my body end?

219
0:09:23.52,000 --> 0:09:25,000
My oncologist and I talk a lot these days

220
0:09:25.938,000 --> 0:09:27,000
because I try to keep my talks technically accurate.

221
0:09:28.463,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And he said, "You know, the immune system is good at detecting invaders,

222
0:09:33.537,000 --> 0:09:35,000
bacteria coming from outside,

223
0:09:35.878,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but when it's your own tissue that you've grown,

224
0:09:38.376,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it's a whole different thing."

225
0:09:39.919,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And I went through a mental exercise, actually,

226
0:09:42.899,000 --> 0:09:46,000
because I started a patient support community of my own on a website,

227
0:09:47.741,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and one of my friends -- one of my relatives, actually -- said,

228
0:09:50.799,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"Look, Dave, who grew this thing?

229
0:09:54.154,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself?"

230
0:09:58.201,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So we went into it.

231
0:09:59.829,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The story of how all that happened is in the book.

232
0:10:02.57,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Anyway, this is the way the numbers unfolded.

233
0:10:05.018,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Me being me, I put the numbers from my hospital's website,

234
0:10:08.173,000 --> 0:10:09,000
for my tumor sizes,

235
0:10:09.356,000 --> 0:10:1,000
into a spreadsheet.

236
0:10:10.531,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Don't worry about the numbers.

237
0:10:12.01,000 --> 0:10:13,000
You see, that's the immune system.

238
0:10:13.786,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Amazing thing, those two yellow lines

239
0:10:15.787,000 --> 0:10:19,000
are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart.

240
0:10:20.01,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between.

241
0:10:23.164,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Just incredible.

242
0:10:24.647,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Who knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it?

243
0:10:28.101,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The punch line is that a year and a half later,

244
0:10:30.441,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I was there when this magnificent young woman, my daughter,

245
0:10:34.765,000 --> 0:10:35,000
got married.

246
0:10:35.952,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And when she came down those steps,

247
0:10:38.351,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and it was just her and me for that moment,

248
0:10:40.605,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother,

249
0:10:43.851,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"I wish Dad could have been here."

250
0:10:45.931,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And this is what we're doing when we make health care better.

251
0:10:49.835,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Now, I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients

252
0:10:52.762,000 --> 0:10:55,000
who are doing everything in their power to improve health care.

253
0:10:55.795,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This is Regina Holliday,

254
0:10:57.458,000 --> 0:11:01,000
a painter in Washington DC, whose husband died of kidney cancer

255
0:11:01.681,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a year after my disease.

256
0:11:03.205,000 --> 0:11:04,000
She's painting, here, a mural

257
0:11:05.01,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of his horrible final weeks in the hospital.

258
0:11:08.01,000 --> 0:11:1,000
One of the things that she discovered

259
0:11:10.481,000 --> 0:11:14,000
was that her husband's medical record in this paper folder

260
0:11:14.789,000 --> 0:11:15,000
was just disorganized.

261
0:11:16.339,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And she thought, "You know, if I have a nutrition facts label

262
0:11:19.628,000 --> 0:11:2,000
on the side of a cereal box,

263
0:11:21.375,000 --> 0:11:22,000
why can't there be something that simple

264
0:11:23.354,000 --> 0:11:25,000
telling every new nurse who comes on duty,

265
0:11:25.922,000 --> 0:11:26,000
every new doctor,

266
0:11:27.171,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the basics about my husband's condition?"

267
0:11:29.305,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label,

268
0:11:34.605,000 --> 0:11:35,000
something like that,

269
0:11:35.786,000 --> 0:11:36,000
in a diagram of him.

270
0:11:37.01,000 --> 0:11:39,000
She then, last year, painted this diagram.

271
0:11:40.01,000 --> 0:11:41,000
She studied health care like me.

272
0:11:41.918,000 --> 0:11:43,000
She came to realize there were a lot of people

273
0:11:44.378,000 --> 0:11:46,000
who'd written patient-advocate books

274
0:11:46.412,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that you just don't hear about at medical conferences.

275
0:11:49.279,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Patients are such an underutilized resource.

276
0:11:52.939,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Well, as it said in my introduction,

277
0:11:54.688,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I've gotten somewhat known for saying

278
0:11:56.494,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that patients should have access to their data.

279
0:11:58.725,000 --> 0:12:,000
I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago,

280
0:12:01.425,000 --> 0:12:02,000
"Give me my damn data,

281
0:12:02.612,000 --> 0:12:04,000
because you people can't be trusted to keep it clean."

282
0:12:05.239,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And here, she has our "damned" data --

283
0:12:08.01,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it's a pun --

284
0:12:09.328,000 --> 0:12:11,000
which is starting to break out, starting to break through --

285
0:12:12.28,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the water symbolizes our data.

286
0:12:14.4,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And in fact,

287
0:12:15.575,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I want to do a little something improvisational for you.

288
0:12:18.303,000 --> 0:12:21,000
There's a guy on Twitter that I know, a health IT guy outside Boston,

289
0:12:22.196,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and he wrote the e-Patient rap.

290
0:12:24.752,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And it goes like this.

291
0:12:26.474,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Laughter)

292
0:12:28.116,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Beatboxing)

293
0:12:32.2,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Rapping) Gimme my damn data

294
0:12:34.249,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I wanna be an e-Patient just like Dave

295
0:12:36.741,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Gimme my damn data, 'cause it's my life to save

296
0:12:39.301,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Normal voice) Now, I'm not going to go any further --

297
0:12:41.903,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Applause) (Cheering)

298
0:12:56.265,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Well, thank you. That shot the timing.

299
0:12:58.694,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Laughter)

300
0:13:00.359,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Think about the possibility.

301
0:13:01.854,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster

302
0:13:06.264,000 --> 0:13:08,000
than the health tools that are available to you

303
0:13:08.528,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to help take care of your family?

304
0:13:10.78,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Here's a website, VisibleBody.com, that I stumbled across.

305
0:13:14.924,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And I thought, "You know, I wonder what my psoas muscle is?"

306
0:13:17.882,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So you can click on things and remove it.

307
0:13:19.883,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And I saw, "Aha! That's the kidney and the psoas muscle."

308
0:13:22.884,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I was rotating it in 3D and saying, "I understand now."

309
0:13:26.869,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth,

310
0:13:29.828,000 --> 0:13:31,000
where you can fly to any address.

311
0:13:32.605,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And I thought, "Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data

312
0:13:37.957,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and have Google Earth for my body?"

313
0:13:40.866,000 --> 0:13:42,000
What did Google come out with this year?

314
0:13:43.01,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Now there's Google Body browser.

315
0:13:45.618,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But you see, it's still generic.

316
0:13:47.619,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's not my data.

317
0:13:49.523,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But if we can get that data out from behind the dam

318
0:13:52.621,000 --> 0:13:54,000
so software innovators can pounce on it

319
0:13:55.622,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the way software innovators like to do,

320
0:13:57.922,000 --> 0:13:59,000
who knows what we'll be able to come up with.

321
0:14:00.132,000 --> 0:14:01,000
One final story.

322
0:14:01.307,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This is Kelly Young, a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida.

323
0:14:06.258,000 --> 0:14:09,000
This is a live story, unfolding just in the last few weeks.

324
0:14:09.801,000 --> 0:14:14,000
RA patients, as they call themselves -- her blog is "RA Warrior" --

325
0:14:15.369,000 --> 0:14:16,000
have a big problem,

326
0:14:16.75,000 --> 0:14:18,000
because 40 percent of them have no visible symptoms.

327
0:14:20.01,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And that makes it really hard to tell how the disease is going,

328
0:14:23.092,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and some doctors think, "Yeah right, you're really in pain."

329
0:14:26.273,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Well, she found, through her online research,

330
0:14:29.01,000 --> 0:14:32,000
a nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer,

331
0:14:32.422,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but it can also reveal inflammation.

332
0:14:35.235,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And she saw that if there is no inflammation,

333
0:14:39.169,000 --> 0:14:41,000
then the scan is a uniform gray.

334
0:14:41.653,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So she took it.

335
0:14:42.872,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And the radiologist's report said, "No cancer found."

336
0:14:47.177,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Well, that's not what he was supposed to do with it.

337
0:14:49.68,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So she wanted to have it read again,

338
0:14:52.125,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and her doctor fired her.

339
0:14:54.01,000 --> 0:14:55,000
She pulled up the CD.

340
0:14:55.917,000 --> 0:14:58,000
He said, "If you don't want to follow my instructions, go away."

341
0:15:00.219,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So she pulled up the CD of the scan images,

342
0:15:03.01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and look at all those hot spots.

343
0:15:05.01,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And she's now actively engaged on her blog

344
0:15:08.01,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in looking for assistance in getting better care.

345
0:15:11.32,000 --> 0:15:13,000
See, that is an empowered patient -- no medical training.

346
0:15:14.136,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We are, you are,

347
0:15:16.131,000 --> 0:15:18,000
the most underused resource in health care.

348
0:15:18.85,000 --> 0:15:19,000
What she was able to do

349
0:15:20.39,000 --> 0:15:22,000
was because she had access to the raw data.

350
0:15:23.156,000 --> 0:15:24,000
How big a deal was this?

351
0:15:24.552,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Well at TED2009,

352
0:15:26.322,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Tim Berners-Lee himself, inventor of the Web,

353
0:15:29.62,000 --> 0:15:31,000
gave a talk where he said the next big thing

354
0:15:32.621,000 --> 0:15:36,000
is not to have your browser find other people's articles about the data,

355
0:15:37.32,000 --> 0:15:38,000
but the raw data.

356
0:15:38.526,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And he got them chanting by the end of the talk,

357
0:15:41.32,000 --> 0:15:44,000
"Raw data now! Raw data now!"

358
0:15:45.011,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And I ask you,

359
0:15:46.549,000 --> 0:15:48,000
three words, please, to improve health care:

360
0:15:49.827,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Let patients help!

361
0:15:51.828,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Let patients help!

362
0:15:53.566,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Let patients help!

363
0:15:55.445,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Let patients help!

364
0:15:57.387,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Thank you.

365
0:15:58.675,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Applause)

366
0:16:15.422,000 --> 0:16:2,000
For all the patients around the world watching this on the Webcast,

367
0:16:20.832,000 --> 0:16:22,000
God bless you, everyone. Let patients help.

368
0:16:23.177,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Host: And bless yourself. Thank you very much.

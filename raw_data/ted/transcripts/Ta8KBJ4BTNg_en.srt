1
0:00:13.146,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I am an astrodynamicist --

2
0:00:15.551,000 --> 0:00:18,000
you know, like that guy Rich Purnell in the movie "The Martian."

3
0:00:19.885,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And it's my job to study and predict motion of objects in space.

4
0:00:27.172,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Currently we track about one percent of hazardous objects on orbit --

5
0:00:33.714,000 --> 0:00:36,000
hazardous to services like location,

6
0:00:36.855,000 --> 0:00:38,000
agriculture, banking,

7
0:00:39.229,000 --> 0:00:4,000
television and communications,

8
0:00:41.22,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and soon -- very soon --

9
0:00:43.11,000 --> 0:00:44,000
even the internet itself.

10
0:00:45.892,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now these services are not protected from, roughly, half a million objects

11
0:00:52.113,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the size of a speck of paint

12
0:00:55.06,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all the way to a school bus in size.

13
0:00:58.398,000 --> 0:00:59,000
A speck of paint,

14
0:01:00.296,000 --> 0:01:02,000
traveling at the right speed,

15
0:01:03.175,000 --> 0:01:04,000
impacting one of these objects,

16
0:01:04.757,000 --> 0:01:06,000
could render it absolutely useless.

17
0:01:08.394,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But we can't track things as small as a speck of paint.

18
0:01:12.694,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We can only track things as small as say, a smartphone.

19
0:01:17.605,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So of this half million objects that we should be concerned about,

20
0:01:22.495,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we can only track about 26,000 of these objects.

21
0:01:26.676,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And of these 26,000, only 2,000 actually work.

22
0:01:33.805,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Everything else

23
0:01:35.764,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is garbage.

24
0:01:38.481,000 --> 0:01:39,000
That's a lot of garbage.

25
0:01:40.227,000 --> 0:01:41,000
To make things a little bit worse,

26
0:01:43.356,000 --> 0:01:47,000
most of what we launch into orbit never comes back.

27
0:01:49.496,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We send the satellite in orbit,

28
0:01:52.131,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it stops working, it runs out of fuel,

29
0:01:55.123,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and we send something else up ...

30
0:01:57.782,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and then we send up something else ...

31
0:02:00.171,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and then something else.

32
0:02:01.686,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And every once in a while,

33
0:02:03.239,000 --> 0:02:05,000
two of these things will collide with each other

34
0:02:05.793,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or one of these things will explode,

35
0:02:07.588,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or even worse,

36
0:02:08.807,000 --> 0:02:11,000
somebody might just happen to destroy one of their satellites on orbit,

37
0:02:13.595,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and this generates many, many more pieces,

38
0:02:17.278,000 --> 0:02:19,000
most of which also never come back.

39
0:02:20.748,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now these things are not just randomly scattered in orbit.

40
0:02:25.715,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It turns out that given the curvature of space-time,

41
0:02:28.984,000 --> 0:02:29,000
there are ideal locations

42
0:02:30.97,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where we put some of these satellites --

43
0:02:32.98,000 --> 0:02:34,000
think of these as space highways.

44
0:02:37.344,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Very much like highways on earth,

45
0:02:39.257,000 --> 0:02:43,000
these space highways can only take up a maximum capacity of traffic

46
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to sustain space-safe operations.

47
0:02:49.014,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Unlike highways on earth,

48
0:02:51.374,000 --> 0:02:53,000
there are actually no space traffic rules.

49
0:02:53.61,000 --> 0:02:54,000
None whatsoever, OK?

50
0:02:57.662,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Wow.

51
0:03:00.45,000 --> 0:03:01,000
What could possibly go wrong with that?

52
0:03:02.419,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:04.482,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, what would be really nice

54
0:03:06.821,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is if we had something like a space traffic map,

55
0:03:10.483,000 --> 0:03:13,000
like a Waze for space that I could look up

56
0:03:13.53,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and see what the current traffic conditions are in space,

57
0:03:16.321,000 --> 0:03:17,000
maybe even predict these.

58
0:03:17.779,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The problem with that, however,

59
0:03:19.906,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is that ask five different people,

60
0:03:24.337,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"What's going on in orbit?

61
0:03:25.764,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Where are things going?"

62
0:03:27.003,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and you're probably going to get 10 different answers.

63
0:03:29.7,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Why is that?

64
0:03:31.106,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's because information about things on orbit is not commonly shared either.

65
0:03:37.187,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So what if we had a globally accessible,

66
0:03:39.706,000 --> 0:03:42,000
open and transparent space traffic information system

67
0:03:43.078,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that can inform the public of where everything is located

68
0:03:46.117,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to try to keep space safe and sustainable?

69
0:03:49.121,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And what if the system could be used

70
0:03:52.749,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to form evidence-based norms of behavior --

71
0:03:55.75,000 --> 0:03:56,000
these space traffic rules?

72
0:03:57.83,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So I developed ASTRIAGraph,

73
0:04:00.013,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the world's first crowdsourced, space traffic monitoring system

74
0:04:03.802,000 --> 0:04:04,000
at the University of Texas at Austin.

75
0:04:06.694,000 --> 0:04:11,000
ASTRIAGraph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe --

76
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:13,000
government, industry and academia --

77
0:04:13.941,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access today.

78
0:04:19.249,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Here, you can see 26,000 objects orbiting the earth,

79
0:04:23.783,000 --> 0:04:24,000
multiple opinions,

80
0:04:25.636,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and it gets updated in near real time.

81
0:04:28.447,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But back to my problem of space traffic map:

82
0:04:32.077,000 --> 0:04:35,000
What if you only had information from the US government?

83
0:04:36.018,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Well, in that case, that's what your space traffic map would look like.

84
0:04:39.989,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But what do the Russians think?

85
0:04:45.343,000 --> 0:04:46,000
That looks significantly different.

86
0:04:47.881,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Who's right? Who's wrong?

87
0:04:50.058,000 --> 0:04:51,000
What should I believe?

88
0:04:51.487,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What could I trust?

89
0:04:52.871,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This is part of the issue.

90
0:04:55.864,000 --> 0:05:01,000
In the absence of this framework to monitor space-actor behavior,

91
0:05:03.421,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to monitor activity in space --

92
0:05:05.718,000 --> 0:05:06,000
where these objects are located --

93
0:05:07.493,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to reconcile these inconsistencies

94
0:05:10.454,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and make this knowledge commonplace,

95
0:05:12.934,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we actually risk losing the ability

96
0:05:17.58,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to use space for humanity's benefit.

97
0:05:22.393,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Thank you very much.

98
0:05:23.576,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Applause and cheers)

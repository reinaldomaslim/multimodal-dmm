2
0:00:18.002,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Rainn Wilson: It takes its toll, being alone.

3
0:00:21.937,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm a little bit lost,

4
0:00:23.144,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and it's finally time to make a real connection.

5
0:00:26.663,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Who am I?

6
0:00:28.171,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Drums)

7
0:00:30.495,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm a single white male,

8
0:00:32.288,000 --> 0:00:33,000
45 years of age.

9
0:00:34.165,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I love animals.

10
0:00:36.283,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Gainfully employed.

11
0:00:38.86,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm a people person.

12
0:00:41.771,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I keep fit.

13
0:00:44.795,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Who am I looking for?

14
0:00:46.446,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'm looking for my idea mate.

15
0:00:49.531,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Are you that idea that matches with who I really am?

16
0:00:52.409,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Video) Ron Finley: How would you feel

17
0:00:54.29,000 --> 0:00:56,000
if you had no access to healthy food?

18
0:00:56.869,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do.

19
0:01:04.994,000 --> 0:01:07,000
RW: Wow, we sure are getting our fingers dirty for a first date, huh?

20
0:01:08.273,000 --> 0:01:11,000
RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do.

21
0:01:12.075,000 --> 0:01:14,000
People in these areas -- they're exposed to crappy food.

22
0:01:14.767,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I want people to know that growing your own food

23
0:01:17.059,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is like printing your own money.

24
0:01:18.631,000 --> 0:01:19,000
RW: You're like a food superhero!

25
0:01:20.242,000 --> 0:01:22,000
RF: Food is the problem and food is the solution.

27
0:01:24.29,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer.

28
0:01:25.897,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My job is to put every word possible into the dictionary.

29
0:01:29.561,000 --> 0:01:3,000
RW: I love words, too --

30
0:01:30.925,000 --> 0:01:32,000
just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer.

31
0:01:34.517,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What if you love a word that you've just made up,

32
0:01:36.954,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like -- I don't know -- "scuberfinkles"?

33
0:01:38.914,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality?

34
0:01:40.921,000 --> 0:01:42,000
RW: Well, I'm a little nearsighted, but yeah.

35
0:01:43.252,000 --> 0:01:44,000
BL: Well, you can't -- I mean,

36
0:01:44.776,000 --> 0:01:45,000
your brain has no access to this world.

37
0:01:46.747,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In fact, even the sensory information that your eyes are receiving,

38
0:01:50.004,000 --> 0:01:51,000
your ears are receiving,

39
0:01:51.185,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is completely meaningless because it could mean anything.

40
0:01:53.883,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That tree could be a large object far away

41
0:01:56.626,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or a small object up close,

42
0:01:57.964,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and your brain has no way of knowing.

43
0:01:59.931,000 --> 0:02:02,000
RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot but it was just a German shepherd.

44
0:02:03.165,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,

45
0:02:06.326,000 --> 0:02:07,000
your closest living relatives.

46
0:02:07.821,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex

47
0:02:10.389,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to manage conflict and solve social issues.

48
0:02:13.465,000 --> 0:02:14,000
RW: I'm just curious:

49
0:02:15.213,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Do we have any conflict that needs managing

50
0:02:17.427,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or social issues to resolve?

51
0:02:19.467,000 --> 0:02:22,000
IBI: Remember -- you're on a date with my idea,

52
0:02:22.733,000 --> 0:02:23,000
not me.

53
0:02:25.228,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Jane McGonigal: This is the face of someone who, against all odds,

54
0:02:28.454,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is on the verge of an epic win.

55
0:02:30.24,000 --> 0:02:31,000
RW: An epic win?

56
0:02:31.465,000 --> 0:02:34,000
JM: An epic win is an outcome so extraordinarily positive,

57
0:02:35.093,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you didn't even know it was possible until you achieved it.

58
0:02:40.331,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You're not making the face.

59
0:02:44.672,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You're making the "I'm not good at life" face.

60
0:02:47.483,000 --> 0:02:49,000
RW: Arthur, I want to be really honest with you.

61
0:02:49.777,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I am seeing other ideas. OK?

62
0:02:51.896,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'm dating around.

63
0:02:53.077,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That's the situation.

64
0:02:54.779,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Arthur Benjamin: I'd say this:

65
0:02:56.255,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Mathematics is not just solving for x,

66
0:02:58.708,000 --> 0:03:,000
it's also figuring out why.

67
0:03:01.734,000 --> 0:03:02,000
RW: Do you want to get some pie?

68
0:03:03.301,000 --> 0:03:04,000
AB: Pi?

69
0:03:04.479,000 --> 0:03:08,000
3.14159265358979 --

70
0:03:08.877,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Reggie Watts: If we're going to do something,

71
0:03:12.045,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we've got to just make a decision.

72
0:03:13.896,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Because without a decision we're left powerless.

73
0:03:16.465,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Without power,

74
0:03:18.23,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we have nothing to supply

75
0:03:20.766,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the chain of those who are truly curious

76
0:03:23.102,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to solve all of our current conditions.

77
0:03:26.242,000 --> 0:03:28,000
RW: And, "If you choose not to decide,

78
0:03:28.307,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you still have made a choice" -- Rush.

79
0:03:31.172,000 --> 0:03:32,000
JM: Yes!

80
0:03:32.356,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is the face we need to see

81
0:03:33.891,000 --> 0:03:35,000
on millions of problem solvers worldwide,

82
0:03:36.009,000 --> 0:03:39,000
as we try to tackle the challenges of the next century.

83
0:03:41.149,000 --> 0:03:42,000
RW: So, are we going Dutch?

87
0:03:52.458,000 --> 0:03:54,000
RW: One night, want to go to a movie or something?

88
0:03:54.835,000 --> 0:03:55,000
RF: Hell, no! Let's go plant some shit!

89
0:03:56.737,000 --> 0:03:57,000
RW: Let's plant some shit!

90
0:03:58.004,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Good, now what is this that I'm planting?

91
0:04:00.005,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Bonobos!

92
0:04:01.185,000 --> 0:04:03,000
IBI: Bonobos! (Laughs)

93
0:04:03.347,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Bonobos.

94
0:04:04.72,000 --> 0:04:06,000
RWatts: Um, interested much?

95
0:04:08.904,000 --> 0:04:09,000
RW: I want to have your idea baby.

96
0:04:11.13,000 --> 0:04:13,000
RWatts: Well, you know what they say in Russia.

97
0:04:14.121,000 --> 0:04:15,000
RW: Hm?

98
0:04:15.3,000 --> 0:04:16,000
RWatts: "scuberfinckle."

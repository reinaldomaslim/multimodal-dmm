1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My name is Amit.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I pitched this idea

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of doing something with museums and art

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to my boss who's actually here,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and she allowed me to do it.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And it took 18 months.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But I'm going to focus on the demo.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and it's access.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I grew up in India.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I had a great education -- I'm not complaining --

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums,

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I started learning a lot.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And while working at Google,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I tried to put this desire

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to make it more accessible with technology together.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So we formed a team, a great team of people,

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and we started doing this.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'm going to probably get into the demo

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and then tell you a couple of the interesting things

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
we've had since launch.

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
You look around at all these museums here.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Two ways of going in -- very simple.

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Click and, bang, you're in this museum.

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It doesn't matter where you are --

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
You move around, you have fun.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You want to navigate around the museum?

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Open the plan up,

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and, in one click, jump.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Keep going. Have fun.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Explore.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Applause)

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I see this plus sign.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now this is one of the images.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So this is all of the meta-data information.

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
For those of you who are truly interested in art,

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now.

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And this is one of these images that we captured

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
in what we call gigapixel technology.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So this image, for example,

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I get a lot of people asking me:

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You can zoom around very simply.

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You see some fun stuff happening here.

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I love this guy; his expression is priceless.

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But then you really want to go deep.

66
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And so I started playing around,

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and I found something going on over here.

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting."

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Went in, and I started noticing

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that these kids were actually beating something.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and actually found out that this is a game

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
called squall,

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which involves beating a goose with a stick

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
on Shrove Tuesday.

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And apparently it was quite popular.

77
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I don't know why they did it,

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but I learned something about it.

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now just to give you some perspective,

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Here is where we were,

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and this is the painting.

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Applause)

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The best is yet to come -- so in a second.

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So now let's just quickly

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
jump into the MoMA, again in New York.

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night."

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But what if you want to see brush strokes?

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And what if you want to see

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You zoom in. You really go in.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and I'm really going to get to the cracks.

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This is "The Starry Night,"

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I think, never seen like this before.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Any one of you, anybody --

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,

103
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter.

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You can go and create your own museum online --

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
create your own collection across all these images.

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Very simply, you go in --

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom --

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
you can just zoom around.

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and really get a conversation going

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
about what you're feeling

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
when you go through these masterpieces.

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So I think, in conclusion,

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for me, the main thing

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I probably shouldn't say that.

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It really comes from these artists.

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And that's been my humbling experience in this.

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I mean, I hope in this digital medium

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that we do justice to their artwork

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and represent it properly online.

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is, "Did you do this

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to replicate the experience of going to a museum?"

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And the answer is no.

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's to supplement the experience.

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And that's it. Thank you.

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Applause)

131
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Thank you.

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the 21st century.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is to go back to our school days

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
when we learned how to count.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Because what we actually count

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
truly counts.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Let me start by telling you a little story.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This is Van Quach.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
She changed her name to Vivian

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
because she wanted to fit in here in America.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Her first job was at an inner-city motel

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in San Francisco as a maid.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I happened to buy that motel

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
about three months after Vivian started working there.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in 1987,

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a very impractical name,

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because I actually was looking to create joy of life.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And this first hotel that I bought, motel,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in the inner-city of San Francisco.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
As I spent time with Vivian,

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in how she did her work.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It made me question and curious:

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
How could someone actually find joy

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in cleaning toilets for a living?

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Her job, her goal and her calling

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
she created with her fellow employees and our guests.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And what gave her inspiration and meaning

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
was the fact that she was taking care of people

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
who were far away from home.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That very human lesson,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
more than 20 years ago,

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
served me well during the last

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
economic downturn we had.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
San Francisco Bay Area hotels

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
went through the largest percentage revenue drop

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in the history of American hotels.

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
so we were particularly vulnerable.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But also back then,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Well, not exactly, of course not.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We started eating "freedom fries,"

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and we started boycotting anything that was French.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so I started getting these letters

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
from places like Alabama and Orange County

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
saying to me that they were going to boycott my company

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because they thought we were a French company.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So one particular day

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
looking for a business solution.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in the self-help section very quickly.

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That's where I got reacquainted with

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I took one psychology class in college,

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But as I sat there for four hours,

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the full afternoon, reading Maslow,

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I recognized something

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that is true of most leaders.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
One of the simplest facts in business

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is something that we often neglect,

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and that is that we're all human.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
has some hierarchy of needs

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in the workplace.

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So as I started reading more Maslow,

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
what I started to realize is that

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Maslow, later in his life,

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and apply it to the collective,

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to organizations and specifically to business.

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So I realized in that dotcom crash

99
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And that's what I did a few years ago

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid

102
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which is survival, success and transformation.

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And we started asking ourselves the questions

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
about how we were actually addressing

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the higher needs, these transformational needs

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
for our key employees in the company.

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
These three levels of the hierarchy needs

110
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
relate to the five levels

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the higher needs of our employees and our customers,

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I realized we had no metrics.

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So we started asking ourselves:

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
What kind of less obvious metrics

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
could we use to actually evaluate

119
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
our employees' sense of meaning,

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
For example, we actually started asking our employees,

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
do they understand the mission of our company,

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and do they feel like they believe in it,

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
can they actually influence it,

125
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We started asking our customers,

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
did they feel an emotional connection with us,

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in one of seven different kinds of ways.

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Miraculously, as we asked these questions

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,

131
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
what we found is we created more loyalty.

132
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Our employee turnover dropped

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to one-third of the industry average,

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and during that five year dotcom bust,

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
we tripled in size.

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and asking them how they were getting through that time,

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
what they told me over and over again

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was that they just manage what they can measure.

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
What we can measure is that tangible stuff

142
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
at the bottom of the pyramid.

143
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They didn't even see the intangible stuff

144
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
higher up the pyramid.

145
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So I started asking myself the question:

146
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?

147
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and all we can measure is the tangible in life,

149
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.

150
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So I went out and studied a bunch of things,

151
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and I found a survey that showed

152
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that 94 percent

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
of business leaders worldwide

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
believe that the intangibles are important in their business,

155
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
things like intellectual property,

156
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,

157
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and yet, only five percent of those same leaders

158
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.

159
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So as leaders, we understand

160
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that intangibles are important,

161
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but we don't have a clue how to measure them.

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So here's another Einstein quote:

163
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"Not everything that can be counted counts,

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and not everything that counts can be counted."

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I hate to argue with Einstein,

166
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but if that which is most valuable

167
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in our life and our business

168
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
actually can't be counted or valued,

169
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
aren't we going to spend our lives

170
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
just mired in measuring the mundane?

171
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It was that sort of heady question about what counts

172
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week

173
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.

174
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,

175
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
a place some folks call Shangri-La.

176
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid

177
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to becoming a transformational

178
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
role model for the world.

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I went to Bhutan.

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,

181
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but this was back in 1972,

182
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
when he ascended to the throne

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
two days after his father passed away.

184
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions

185
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
On a trip through India,

187
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
early in his reign as king,

188
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
he was asked by an Indian journalist

189
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
about the Bhutanese GDP,

190
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the size of the Bhutanese GDP.

191
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The king responded in a fashion

192
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that actually has transformed us four decades later.

193
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed

194
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and focused with gross domestic product?

195
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Why don't we care more about

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
gross national happiness?"

197
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider

198
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
an alternative definition of success,

199
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
what has come to be known as

200
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
GNH, or gross national happiness.

201
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Most world leaders didn't take notice,

202
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."

203
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But the king was serious.

204
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This was a notable moment,

205
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because this was the first time a world leader

206
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
in almost 200 years

207
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
had suggested

208
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that intangible of happiness --

209
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that leader 200 years ago,

210
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --

211
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
200 years later,

212
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness

213
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is something that we should measure,

214
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and it's something we should actually value

215
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
as government officials.

216
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
For the next three dozen years as king,

217
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
this king actually started measuring

218
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and managing around happiness in Bhutan --

219
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
including, just recently, taking his country

220
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy

221
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with no bloodshed, no coup.

222
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,

223
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.

224
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,

225
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I got to really understand what they're doing.

226
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.

227
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.

228
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I asked him,

229
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"How can you create and measure

230
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
something which evaporates --

231
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in other words, happiness?"

232
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And he's a very wise man, and he said,

233
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.

234
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We create the conditions for happiness to occur.

235
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."

236
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Wow, that's interesting.

237
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
He said that they have a science behind that art,

238
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and they've actually created four essential pillars,

239
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
nine key indicators

240
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and 72 different metrics

241
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that help them to measure their GNH.

242
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
One of those key indicators is:

243
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
How do the Bhutanese feel about

244
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
how they spend their time each day?

245
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's a good question. How do you feel about

246
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
how you spend your time each day?

247
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Time is one of the scarcest resources

248
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
in the modern world.

249
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And yet, of course,

250
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that little intangible piece of data

251
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
doesn't factor into our GDP calculations.

252
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,

253
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I started to imagine

254
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
what I call an emotional equation.

255
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And it focuses on something I read long ago

256
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.

257
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
How many know him? Anybody?

258
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"

259
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and he suggested that happiness

260
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is not about having what you want;

261
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
instead, it's about wanting what you have.

262
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe

263
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
happiness equals wanting what you have --

264
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
imagine gratitude --

265
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
divided by having what you want --

266
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
gratification.

267
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,

268
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
constantly focused on what they don't have.

269
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Their religion, their isolation,

270
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
their deep respect for their culture

271
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and now the principles of their GNH movement

272
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
all have fostered a sense of gratitude

273
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
about what they do have.

274
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,

275
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
spend more of our time

276
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?

277
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We are a bottom-heavy culture

278
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
in more ways than one.

279
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Laughter)

280
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The reality is, in Western countries,

281
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness

282
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
as if happiness is something that we have to go out --

283
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.

284
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,

285
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
many dictionaries define pursuit

286
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
as to "chase with hostility."

287
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Do we pursue happiness with hostility?

288
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Good question. But back to Bhutan.

289
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Bhutan's bordered on its north and south

290
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
by 38 percent of the world's population.

291
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Could this little country,

292
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
like a startup in a mature industry,

293
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
be the spark plug that influences

294
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
a 21st century

295
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of middle-class in China and India?

296
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Bhutan's created the ultimate export,

297
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
a new global currency of well-being,

298
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and there are 40 countries around the world today

299
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that are studying their own GNH.

300
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
You may have heard, this last fall

301
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Nicolas Sarkozy in France

302
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
announcing the results of an 18-month study

303
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
by two Nobel economists,

304
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
focusing on happiness and wellness in France.

305
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Sarkozy suggested that

306
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
world leaders should stop

307
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
myopically focusing on GDP

308
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and consider a new index,

309
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."

310
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I like it.

311
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Co-branding opportunities.

312
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED,

313
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we had a simulcast of David Cameron,

314
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
potentially the next prime minister of the UK,

315
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,

316
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968

317
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
when he suggested that we're

318
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
myopically focused on the wrong thing

319
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and that GDP is a misplaced metric.

320
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.

321
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,

322
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.

323
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
This is a collection of things

324
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.

325
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
GDP counts everything from air pollution

326
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to the destruction of our redwoods.

327
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But it doesn't count the health of our children

328
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or the integrity of our public officials.

329
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
As you look at these two columns here,

330
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us

331
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to start figuring out a new way to count,

332
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
a new way to imagine

333
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
what's important to us in life?

334
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Applause)

335
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.

336
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
He said GDP "measures everything in short,

337
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
except that which makes life worthwhile."

338
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Wow.

339
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So how do we do that?

340
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Let me say one thing we can just start doing

341
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
ten years from now, at least in this country.

342
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Why in the heck in America

343
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
are we doing a census in 2010?

344
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.

345
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.

346
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But all of those questions are tangible.

347
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
They're about demographics.

348
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
They're about where you live, how many people you live with,

349
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and whether you own your home or not.

350
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
That's about it.

351
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We're not asking meaningful metrics.

352
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
We're not asking important questions.

353
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We're not asking anything that's intangible.

354
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Abe Maslow said long ago

355
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.

356
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,

357
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
everything starts to look like a nail."

358
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We've been fooled by our tool.

359
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Excuse that expression.

360
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Laughter)

361
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We've been fooled by our tool.

362
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
GDP has been our hammer.

363
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century

364
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
industrial-era model of success.

365
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And yet, 64 percent

366
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
of the world's GDP today

367
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is in that intangible industry we call service,

368
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
the service industry, the industry I'm in.

369
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries

370
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
of manufacturing and agriculture.

371
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?

372
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that

373
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,

374
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
but actually counts what we most value,

375
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
the things that are intangible.

376
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.

377
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.

378
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
I learned that economists measure everything

379
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
in tangible units of production and consumption

380
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
as if each of those tangible units

381
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
is exactly the same.

382
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
They aren't the same.

383
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn

384
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
is that we can influence

385
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
the quality of that unit of production

386
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
by creating the conditions

387
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
for our employees to live their calling.

388
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
In Vivian's case,

389
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
her unit of production

390
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
isn't the tangible hours she works,

391
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
it's the intangible difference she makes

392
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
during that one hour of work.

393
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
This is Dave Arringdale who's actually

394
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.

395
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
He stayed there a hundred times

396
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
in the last 20 years,

397
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship

398
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.

399
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.

400
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
He tells me that he can always count

401
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
on Vivian and the staff there

402
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
to make him feel at home.

403
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Why is it that

404
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
business leaders and investors

405
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
quite often don't see the connection

406
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
between creating the intangible

407
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
of employee happiness

408
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
with creating the tangible

409
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
of financial profits in their business?

410
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
We don't have to choose between

411
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
inspired employees and sizable profits,

412
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
we can have both.

413
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
In fact, inspired employees quite often

414
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
help make sizable profits, right?

415
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So what the world needs now,

416
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
in my opinion,

417
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
is business leaders and political leaders

418
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
who know what to count.

419
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We count numbers.

420
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
We count on people.

421
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers

422
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
to truly take into account our people.

423
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I learned that from a maid in a motel

424
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and a king of a country.

425
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
What can you

426
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
start counting today?

427
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
What one thing can you start counting today

428
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that actually would be meaningful in your life,

429
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
whether it's your work life or your business life?

430
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Thank you very much.

431
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
(Applause)

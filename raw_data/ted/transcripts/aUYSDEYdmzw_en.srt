1
0:00:13.636,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What makes a great leader today?

2
0:00:17.231,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Many of us carry this image

3
0:00:19.874,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of this all-knowing superhero

4
0:00:23.194,000 --> 0:00:25,000
who stands and commands

5
0:00:25.642,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and protects his followers.

6
0:00:29.271,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But that's kind of an image from another time,

7
0:00:33.567,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and what's also outdated

8
0:00:35.818,000 --> 0:00:37,000
are the leadership development programs

9
0:00:38.22,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that are based on success models

10
0:00:40.603,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for a world that was, not a world that is

11
0:00:44.785,000 --> 0:00:46,000
or that is coming.

12
0:00:46.949,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We conducted a study of 4,000 companies,

13
0:00:51.36,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and we asked them, let's see the effectiveness

14
0:00:54.367,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of your leadership development programs.

15
0:00:56.958,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Fifty-eight percent of the companies

16
0:00:59.146,000 --> 0:01:01,000
cited significant talent gaps

17
0:01:01.514,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for critical leadership roles.

18
0:01:03.869,000 --> 0:01:06,000
That means that despite corporate training programs,

19
0:01:07.308,000 --> 0:01:11,000
off-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things,

20
0:01:11.745,000 --> 0:01:12,000
more than half the companies

21
0:01:13.686,000 --> 0:01:17,000
had failed to grow enough great leaders.

22
0:01:18.543,000 --> 0:01:2,000
You may be asking yourself,

23
0:01:20.566,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is my company helping me to prepare

24
0:01:23.297,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to be a great 21st-century leader?

25
0:01:26.54,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The odds are, probably not.

26
0:01:29.952,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, I've spent 25 years of my professional life

27
0:01:34.015,000 --> 0:01:37,000
observing what makes great leaders.

28
0:01:37.52,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies,

29
0:01:39.985,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I've advised over 200 CEOs,

30
0:01:42.054,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines

31
0:01:44.813,000 --> 0:01:47,000
than you can imagine.

32
0:01:47.823,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend

33
0:01:51.548,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in leadership preparation.

34
0:01:54.763,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I noticed that, despite all the efforts,

35
0:01:58.589,000 --> 0:02:,000
there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing

36
0:02:01.128,000 --> 0:02:03,000
about individuals.

37
0:02:03.252,000 --> 0:02:06,000
One story was about Chris,

38
0:02:06.886,000 --> 0:02:08,000
a high-potential, superstar leader

39
0:02:09.23,000 --> 0:02:12,000
who moves to a new unit and fails,

40
0:02:12.832,000 --> 0:02:14,000
destroying unrecoverable value.

41
0:02:15.568,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO,

42
0:02:19.161,000 --> 0:02:2,000
who was so frustrated

43
0:02:20.863,000 --> 0:02:22,000
because her company is cited

44
0:02:22.93,000 --> 0:02:24,000
as a best company for leaders,

45
0:02:25.259,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped

46
0:02:29.096,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to lead their crucial initiatives.

47
0:02:31.681,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And then there were stories

48
0:02:33.638,000 --> 0:02:35,000
like the senior leadership team

49
0:02:36.168,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of a once-thriving business

50
0:02:38.248,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that's surprised by a market shift,

51
0:02:41.704,000 --> 0:02:43,000
finds itself having to force the company

52
0:02:44.435,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to reduce its size in half

53
0:02:46.763,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or go out of business.

54
0:02:49.576,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, these recurring stories

55
0:02:52.294,000 --> 0:02:54,000
cause me to ask two questions.

56
0:02:54.861,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Why are the leadership gaps widening

57
0:02:57.332,000 --> 0:02:58,000
when there's so much more investment

58
0:02:59.265,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in leadership development?

59
0:03:01.489,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And what are the great leaders doing

60
0:03:04.786,000 --> 0:03:07,000
distinctly different to thrive and grow?

61
0:03:08.661,000 --> 0:03:1,000
One of the things that I did,

62
0:03:11.03,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I was so consumed by these questions

63
0:03:13.706,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and also frustrated by those stories,

64
0:03:16.65,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that I left my job

65
0:03:19.058,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so that I could study this full time,

66
0:03:21.638,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I took a year to travel

67
0:03:24.583,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to different parts of the world

68
0:03:26.603,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to learn about effective and ineffective

69
0:03:28.989,000 --> 0:03:3,000
leadership practices in companies,

70
0:03:31.374,000 --> 0:03:34,000
countries and nonprofit organizations.

71
0:03:34.877,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And so I did things like travel to South Africa,

72
0:03:38.204,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where I had an opportunity to understand

73
0:03:41.13,000 --> 0:03:43,000
how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time

74
0:03:43.604,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in anticipating and navigating

75
0:03:45.495,000 --> 0:03:48,000
his political, social and economic context.

76
0:03:48.912,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I also met a number of nonprofit leaders

77
0:03:51.935,000 --> 0:03:54,000
who, despite very limited financial resources,

78
0:03:55.905,000 --> 0:03:57,000
were making a huge impact in the world,

79
0:03:58.848,000 --> 0:04:01,000
often bringing together seeming adversaries.

80
0:04:02.71,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries

81
0:04:07.765,000 --> 0:04:09,000
trying to understand how the environment

82
0:04:10.097,000 --> 0:04:11,000
had shaped the leaders,

83
0:04:11.255,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the moves that they made,

84
0:04:12.858,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and then the impact of those moves

85
0:04:14.384,000 --> 0:04:16,000
beyond their tenure.

86
0:04:17.311,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And then, when I returned to work full time,

87
0:04:20.312,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues

88
0:04:23.601,000 --> 0:04:26,000
who were also interested in these questions.

89
0:04:27.093,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now, from all this, I distilled

90
0:04:30.038,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the characteristics of leaders who are thriving

91
0:04:34.042,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and what they do differently,

92
0:04:35.868,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and then I also distilled

93
0:04:38.321,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the preparation practices that enable people

94
0:04:41.263,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to grow to their potential.

95
0:04:43.919,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I want to share some of those with you now.

96
0:04:45.852,000 --> 0:04:47,000
("What makes a great leader in the 21st century?")

97
0:04:47.927,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In a 21st-century world, which is more global,

98
0:04:51.292,000 --> 0:04:53,000
digitally enabled and transparent,

99
0:04:53.743,000 --> 0:04:56,000
with faster speeds of information flow and innovation,

100
0:04:57.156,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and where nothing big gets done

101
0:04:59.451,000 --> 0:05:02,000
without some kind of a complex matrix,

102
0:05:02.687,000 --> 0:05:05,000
relying on traditional development practices

103
0:05:06.347,000 --> 0:05:08,000
will stunt your growth as a leader.

104
0:05:09.005,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In fact, traditional assessments

105
0:05:11.852,000 --> 0:05:15,000
like narrow 360 surveys or outdated performance criteria

106
0:05:16.195,000 --> 0:05:18,000
will give you false positives,

107
0:05:18.233,000 --> 0:05:21,000
lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared

108
0:05:21.659,000 --> 0:05:23,000
than you really are.

109
0:05:23.799,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Leadership in the 21st century is defined

110
0:05:27.692,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and evidenced by three questions.

111
0:05:30.846,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Where are you looking

112
0:05:32.18,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to anticipate the next change

113
0:05:35.256,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to your business model or your life?

114
0:05:38.729,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The answer to this question is on your calendar.

115
0:05:43.579,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Who are you spending time with? On what topics?

116
0:05:47.52,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Where are you traveling? What are you reading?

117
0:05:50.068,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And then how are you distilling this

118
0:05:51.815,000 --> 0:05:54,000
into understanding potential discontinuities,

119
0:05:55.522,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and then making a decision to do something

120
0:05:57.774,000 --> 0:06:01,000
right now so that you're prepared and ready?

121
0:06:02.188,000 --> 0:06:05,000
There's a leadership team that does a practice

122
0:06:05.19,000 --> 0:06:07,000
where they bring together each member

123
0:06:08.162,000 --> 0:06:1,000
collecting, here are trends that impact me,

124
0:06:10.969,000 --> 0:06:12,000
here are trends that impact another team member,

125
0:06:13.254,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and they share these,

126
0:06:14.653,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and then make decisions, to course-correct a strategy

127
0:06:17.449,000 --> 0:06:2,000
or to anticipate a new move.

128
0:06:20.706,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Great leaders are not head-down.

129
0:06:23.759,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They see around corners,

130
0:06:26.004,000 --> 0:06:29,000
shaping their future, not just reacting to it.

131
0:06:29.913,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The second question is,

132
0:06:31.868,000 --> 0:06:33,000
what is the diversity measure

133
0:06:33.887,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of your personal and professional stakeholder network?

134
0:06:37.506,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You know, we hear often about good ol' boy networks

135
0:06:40.508,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and they're certainly alive and well in many institutions.

136
0:06:44.424,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But to some extent, we all have a network

137
0:06:46.967,000 --> 0:06:47,000
of people that we're comfortable with.

138
0:06:48.896,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So this question is about your capacity

139
0:06:51.808,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to develop relationships with people

140
0:06:54.307,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that are very different than you.

141
0:06:55.83,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And those differences can be biological,

142
0:06:58.823,000 --> 0:07:02,000
physical, functional, political, cultural, socioeconomic.

143
0:07:03.607,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And yet, despite all these differences,

144
0:07:07.05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they connect with you

145
0:07:08.807,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and they trust you enough

146
0:07:10.061,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to cooperate with you

147
0:07:11.343,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in achieving a shared goal.

148
0:07:14.481,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Great leaders understand

149
0:07:16.816,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that having a more diverse network

150
0:07:19.745,000 --> 0:07:22,000
is a source of pattern identification

151
0:07:23.286,000 --> 0:07:25,000
at greater levels and also of solutions,

152
0:07:26.071,000 --> 0:07:27,000
because you have people that are thinking

153
0:07:27.895,000 --> 0:07:29,000
differently than you are.

154
0:07:30.58,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Third question: are you courageous enough

155
0:07:33.93,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to abandon a practice that has made you successful in the past?

156
0:07:39.832,000 --> 0:07:43,000
There's an expression: Go along to get along.

157
0:07:43.981,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But if you follow this advice,

158
0:07:46.899,000 --> 0:07:48,000
chances are as a leader,

159
0:07:49.291,000 --> 0:07:53,000
you're going to keep doing what's familiar and comfortable.

160
0:07:53.806,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Great leaders dare to be different.

161
0:07:56.659,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They don't just talk about risk-taking,

162
0:07:58.304,000 --> 0:07:59,000
they actually do it.

163
0:08:00.122,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that

164
0:08:03.034,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the most impactful development comes

165
0:08:05.611,000 --> 0:08:08,000
when you are able to build the emotional stamina

166
0:08:08.915,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to withstand people telling you that your new idea

167
0:08:13.075,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is naïve or reckless or just plain stupid.

168
0:08:17.793,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now interestingly, the people who will join you

169
0:08:21.655,000 --> 0:08:24,000
are not your usual suspects in your network.

170
0:08:25.11,000 --> 0:08:28,000
They're often people that think differently

171
0:08:28.761,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and therefore are willing to join you

172
0:08:31.633,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in taking a courageous leap.

173
0:08:33.992,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And it's a leap, not a step.

174
0:08:37.243,000 --> 0:08:39,000
More than traditional leadership programs,

175
0:08:40.152,000 --> 0:08:41,000
answering these three questions

176
0:08:42.034,000 --> 0:08:43,000
will determine your effectiveness

177
0:08:43.417,000 --> 0:08:46,000
as a 21st-century leader.

178
0:08:46.886,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So what makes a great leader in the 21st century?

179
0:08:51.307,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I've met many, and they stand out.

180
0:08:54.856,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They are women and men

181
0:08:56.507,000 --> 0:08:57,000
who are preparing themselves

182
0:08:58.273,000 --> 0:09:01,000
not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday

183
0:09:01.392,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but also for the realities of today

184
0:09:05.168,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.

185
0:09:09.429,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Thank you.

186
0:09:11.856,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Well we all know the World Wide Web

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
commerce and social connectivity,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but where did it all come from?

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I'll quote three people:

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So let's just run through these guys.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is Vannevar Bush.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And in 1945,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And the article was called "As We May Think."

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And what Vannevar Bush was saying

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
was the way we use information is broken.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We don't work in terms of libraries

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and catalog systems and so forth.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The brain works by association.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And the way information is structured

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And so he suggested a machine,

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and he called it the memex.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And the memex would link information,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now this was in 1945.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
A computer in those days

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
was something the secret services used to use for code breaking.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And nobody knew anything about it.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So this was before the computer was invented.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And he proposed this machine called the memex.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and then you could call it up at will.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So spinning forward,

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And he was so inspired by this article,

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it kind of directed the rest of his life.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
He built a system.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And in a premonition of today's world

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of cloud computing and softwares of service,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
his system was called NLS

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for oN-Line System.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And this is Doug Engelbart.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in 1968.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
What he showed --

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
He had his head mic like I've got.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And he works this system.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And you can see, he's working between documents

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and graphics and so forth.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And he's driving it all

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
with this platform here,

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
with a five-finger keyboard

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and the world's first computer mouse,

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which he specially designed in order to do this system.

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So this is where the mouse came from as well.

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So this is Doug Engelbart.

63
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So for a personal computer,

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it wasn't really very practical.

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But spin on to the 80s

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
when personal computers did arrive,

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And my company, OWL

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system.

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And this began to get a head of steam.

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard,

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and they made a bit of a fuss about it.

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The magazines started to cover it.

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
had special issues covering hypertext.

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We developed a PC version of this product

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
as well as the Macintosh version.

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And our PC version became quite mature.

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We developed a system such

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that it had a markup language based on html.

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We called it hml: hypertext markup language.

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And the system was capable of doing

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
very, very large documentation systems over computer networks.

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in late November 1990.

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
who said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah."

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And he said, "I need to talk to you."

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name,

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
would take over the world one day.

101
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,

102
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it was just plain text.

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I thought, well, you know, interesting,

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So we didn't do it.

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In the next couple of years,

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the hypertext community didn't recognize him either.

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
In 1993,

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
there was a table at the conference in Seattle,

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and a guy called Marc Andreessen

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker.

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
There was a guy called Dick Rowe

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
There was a guy called Gary Kildall

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
who went flying his plane

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
when IBM came looking for an operating system

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
for the IBM PC,

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.

125
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And the 12 publishers

126
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
On the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And according to Fortune magazine,

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
he's worth 700 million dollars.

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But is he happy?

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

133
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

0:00:15.911,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It was a Saturday afternoon in May,

3
0:00:19.09,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I suddenly realized

4
0:00:21.604,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that the next day was Mother's Day,

5
0:00:25.058,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,

6
0:00:26.904,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so I started thinking about

7
0:00:28.305,000 --> 0:00:3,000
what should I get my mom for Mother's Day?

8
0:00:30.642,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I thought, why don't I make her

9
0:00:32.486,000 --> 0:00:35,000
an interactive Mother's Day card

10
0:00:35.535,000 --> 0:00:37,000
using the Scratch software that I'd been developing

11
0:00:38.243,000 --> 0:00:41,000
with my research group at the MIT Media Lab?

12
0:00:42.06,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We developed it so that people could easily create

13
0:00:45.44,000 --> 0:00:49,000
their own interactive stories and games and animations,

14
0:00:49.684,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and then share their creations with one another.

15
0:00:53.453,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch

16
0:00:57.321,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to make an interactive card for my mom.

17
0:01:00.221,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Before making my own Mother's Day card,

18
0:01:02.397,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I thought I would take a look

19
0:01:04.382,000 --> 0:01:05,000
at the Scratch website.

20
0:01:05.955,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So over the last several years, kids around the world

21
0:01:09.313,000 --> 0:01:12,000
ages 8 and up, have shared their projects,

22
0:01:12.507,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects,

23
0:01:15.942,000 --> 0:01:18,000
whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.

24
0:01:19.327,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So in the search box I typed in

25
0:01:22.321,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Mother's Day,"

26
0:01:23.866,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I was surprised and delighted to see a list

27
0:01:26.869,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards

28
0:01:29.573,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that showed up on the Scratch website,

29
0:01:32.087,000 --> 0:01:34,000
many of them just in the past 24 hours

30
0:01:34.405,000 --> 0:01:37,000
by procrastinators just like myself.

31
0:01:37.611,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I started taking a look at them. (Music)

32
0:01:40.733,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I saw one of them that featured a kitten

33
0:01:43.189,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day.

34
0:01:50.06,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And the creator very considerately

35
0:01:52.591,000 --> 0:01:55,000
offered a replay for her mom.

36
0:01:56.095,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Another one was an interactive project where,

37
0:01:58.479,000 --> 0:02:01,000
when you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day,"

38
0:02:01.677,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan.

39
0:02:06.597,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative

40
0:02:10.58,000 --> 0:02:12,000
about how she had Googled to find out

41
0:02:13.239,000 --> 0:02:16,000
when Mother's Day was happening.

42
0:02:16.356,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,

43
0:02:20.499,000 --> 0:02:22,000
she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting

44
0:02:22.977,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of how much she loved her mom.

45
0:02:26.604,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects

46
0:02:28.829,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and interacting with these projects.

47
0:02:30.481,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project,

48
0:02:34.322,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter)

49
0:02:39.076,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.

50
0:02:42.656,000 --> 0:02:43,000
She wrote back to me and she said,

51
0:02:44.041,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"I'm so proud to have a son that created the software

52
0:02:47.308,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."

53
0:02:51.42,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So my mom was happy, and that made me happy,

54
0:02:55.22,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but actually I was even happier for another reason.

55
0:02:59.844,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I was happy because these kids were using Scratch

56
0:03:03.803,000 --> 0:03:05,000
just in the way that we had hoped that they would.

57
0:03:06.604,000 --> 0:03:08,000
As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards,

58
0:03:09.415,000 --> 0:03:11,000
you could see that they were really

59
0:03:11.696,000 --> 0:03:14,000
becoming fluent with new technologies.

60
0:03:15.008,000 --> 0:03:16,000
What do I mean by fluent?

61
0:03:16.471,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves

62
0:03:20.503,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and to start expressing their ideas.

63
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:25,000
When you become fluent with language,

64
0:03:25.934,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it means you can write an entry in your journal

65
0:03:29.471,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.

66
0:03:33.524,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it's similar with new technologies.

67
0:03:36.681,000 --> 0:03:4,000
By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards,

68
0:03:40.863,000 --> 0:03:42,000
these kids were showing that they were really fluent

69
0:03:43.393,000 --> 0:03:44,000
with new technologies.

70
0:03:45.066,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this,

71
0:03:47.831,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because a lot of times people feel that

72
0:03:50.527,000 --> 0:03:53,000
young people today can do all sorts of things with technology.

73
0:03:53.927,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives."

74
0:03:58.388,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term.

75
0:04:02.185,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.

76
0:04:05.686,000 --> 0:04:07,000
When you really look at it, how is it that young people

77
0:04:08.239,000 --> 0:04:11,000
spend most of their time using new technologies?

78
0:04:11.775,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You often see them in situations like this,

79
0:04:15.298,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or like this,

80
0:04:17.492,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and there's no doubt that young people

81
0:04:19.01,000 --> 0:04:22,000
are very comfortable and familiar browsing

82
0:04:22.326,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and chatting and texting and gaming.

83
0:04:26.848,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But that doesn't really make you fluent.

84
0:04:30.047,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So young people today have lots of experience

85
0:04:34.006,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies,

86
0:04:37.801,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but a lot less so of creating with new technologies

87
0:04:41.206,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and expressing themselves with new technologies.

88
0:04:44.178,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's almost as if they can read

89
0:04:46.57,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but not write with new technologies.

90
0:04:49.903,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent

91
0:04:53.801,000 --> 0:04:55,000
so they can write with new technologies?

92
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And that really means that they need to be able to

93
0:04:59.69,000 --> 0:05:03,000
write their own computer programs, or code.

94
0:05:04.202,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize

95
0:05:06.914,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the importance of learning to code.

96
0:05:10.218,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You know, in recent years, there have been

97
0:05:12.82,000 --> 0:05:14,000
hundreds of new organizations and websites

98
0:05:15.712,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that are helping young people learn to code.

99
0:05:19.006,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You look online, you'll see places like Codecademy

100
0:05:22.597,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and events like CoderDojo

101
0:05:24.968,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and sites like Girls Who Code,

102
0:05:27.399,000 --> 0:05:28,000
or Black Girls Code.

103
0:05:29.093,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It seems that everybody is getting into the act.

104
0:05:32.201,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You know, just at the beginning of this year,

105
0:05:34.784,000 --> 0:05:35,000
at the turn of the new year,

106
0:05:36.149,000 --> 0:05:38,000
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg

107
0:05:38.809,000 --> 0:05:4,000
made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn

108
0:05:41.069,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to code in 2012.

109
0:05:43.848,000 --> 0:05:46,000
A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that

110
0:05:47.016,000 --> 0:05:5,000
all of its first graders should learn to code.

111
0:05:50.672,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.

112
0:05:53.464,000 --> 0:05:57,000
about whether all the children there should learn to code.

113
0:05:57.773,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now, for some of you, when you hear about this,

114
0:06:00.616,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.

115
0:06:04.224,000 --> 0:06:07,000
When many people think of coding, they think of it

116
0:06:07.374,000 --> 0:06:1,000
as something that only a very narrow sub-community

117
0:06:10.95,000 --> 0:06:12,000
of people are going to be doing,

118
0:06:13.608,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and they think of coding looking like this.

119
0:06:16.53,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And in fact, if this is what coding is like,

120
0:06:18.696,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it will only be a narrow sub-community of people

121
0:06:21.191,000 --> 0:06:24,000
with special mathematical skills and technological background

122
0:06:24.263,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that can code.

123
0:06:26.529,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But coding doesn't have to be like this.

124
0:06:29.029,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.

125
0:06:33.008,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.

126
0:06:37.287,000 --> 0:06:38,000
In this case, you take a move block,

127
0:06:39.202,000 --> 0:06:4,000
snap it into a stack,

128
0:06:40.971,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors

129
0:06:43.729,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of the different characters in your game or your story,

130
0:06:47.247,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in this case controlling the big fish.

131
0:06:49.548,000 --> 0:06:52,000
After you've created your program, you can click on "share,"

132
0:06:52.999,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and then share your project with other people,

133
0:06:56.075,000 --> 0:06:57,000
so that they can use the project

134
0:06:57.898,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and start working on the project as well.

135
0:07:00.872,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing

136
0:07:04.194,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you can do with Scratch.

137
0:07:05.839,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website,

138
0:07:07.819,000 --> 0:07:09,000
there's everything from animated stories

139
0:07:10.643,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to school science projects

140
0:07:13.059,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to anime soap operas

141
0:07:15.123,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to virtual construction kits

142
0:07:17.445,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to recreations of classic video games

143
0:07:20.158,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to political opinion polls

144
0:07:22.427,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to trigonometry tutorials

145
0:07:25.067,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to interactive artwork, and, yes,

146
0:07:27.987,000 --> 0:07:29,000
interactive Mother's Day cards.

147
0:07:30.771,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So I think there's so many different ways

148
0:07:33.807,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that people can express themselves using this,

149
0:07:37.267,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.

150
0:07:40.667,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And it doesn't just stay on the screen.

151
0:07:43.229,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You can also code to interact with the physical world around you.

152
0:07:46.996,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Here's an example from Hong Kong,

153
0:07:49.475,000 --> 0:07:5,000
where some kids made a game

154
0:07:50.882,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and then built their own physical interface device

155
0:07:54.163,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and had a light sensor, so the light sensor

156
0:07:57.055,000 --> 0:07:58,000
detects the hole in the board,

157
0:07:58.998,000 --> 0:08:,000
so as they move the physical saw,

158
0:08:01.198,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the light sensor detects the hole

159
0:08:03.438,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and controls the virtual saw on the screen

160
0:08:06.394,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and saws down the tree.

161
0:08:09.174,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We're going to continue to look at new ways

162
0:08:11.283,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world

163
0:08:14.339,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and connecting to the world around us.

164
0:08:17.267,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is an example from a new version of Scratch

165
0:08:19.5,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that we'll be releasing in the next few months,

166
0:08:23.123,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and we're looking again to be able

167
0:08:25.173,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to push you in new directions.

168
0:08:26.869,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Here's an example.

169
0:08:29.133,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It uses the webcam.

170
0:08:33.207,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons

171
0:08:38.063,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or I can move the bug.

172
0:08:40.948,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect,

173
0:08:43.513,000 --> 0:08:45,000
where you interact with gestures in the world.

174
0:08:46.229,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But instead of just playing someone else's game,

175
0:08:48.473,000 --> 0:08:5,000
you get to create the games,

176
0:08:50.715,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and if you see someone else's game,

177
0:08:52.098,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you can just say "see inside,"

178
0:08:54.738,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.

179
0:08:57.632,000 --> 0:09:,000
So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is,

180
0:09:01.187,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and then, if there's so much video motion,

181
0:09:04.308,000 --> 0:09:07,000
it will then tell the balloon to pop.

182
0:09:07.687,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The same way that this uses the camera

183
0:09:10.071,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to get information into Scratch,

184
0:09:12.576,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you can also use the microphone.

185
0:09:15.583,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Here's an example of a project using the microphone.

186
0:09:19.567,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So I'm going to let all of you control this game

187
0:09:21.967,000 --> 0:09:23,000
using your voices.

188
0:09:24.213,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping)

189
0:09:40.669,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:49.298,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Applause)

191
0:09:58.082,000 --> 0:10:,000
As kids are creating projects like this,

192
0:10:00.687,000 --> 0:10:02,000
they're learning to code,

193
0:10:02.952,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but even more importantly, they're coding to learn.

194
0:10:06.886,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Because as they learn to code,

195
0:10:09.175,000 --> 0:10:12,000
it enables them to learn many other things,

196
0:10:12.495,000 --> 0:10:14,000
opens up many new opportunities for learning.

197
0:10:15.367,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.

198
0:10:19.751,000 --> 0:10:21,000
When you learn to read and write, it opens up

199
0:10:22.691,000 --> 0:10:25,000
opportunities for you to learn so many other things.

200
0:10:25.751,000 --> 0:10:28,000
When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.

201
0:10:29.511,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And it's the same thing with coding.

202
0:10:31.699,000 --> 0:10:33,000
If you learn to code, you can code to learn.

203
0:10:34.246,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.

204
0:10:36.8,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You learn more about how computers work.

205
0:10:39.298,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But that's just where it starts.

206
0:10:41.616,000 --> 0:10:43,000
When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn

207
0:10:44.211,000 --> 0:10:46,000
many other things.

208
0:10:46.456,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Let me show you an example.

209
0:10:48.802,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Here's another project,

210
0:10:51.072,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and I saw this when I was visiting

211
0:10:53.34,000 --> 0:10:55,000
one of the computer clubhouses.

212
0:10:55.482,000 --> 0:10:58,000
These are after-school learning centers that we helped start

213
0:10:58.502,000 --> 0:11:,000
that help young people from low-income communities

214
0:11:01.264,000 --> 0:11:05,000
learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.

215
0:11:05.343,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago,

216
0:11:08.138,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software

217
0:11:11.863,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to create a game somewhat like this one,

218
0:11:14.759,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game,

219
0:11:17.682,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but also he wanted to do more.

220
0:11:20.647,000 --> 0:11:22,000
He wanted to keep score.

221
0:11:22.951,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish,

222
0:11:26.027,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but he wanted to keep score, so that each time

223
0:11:28.954,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the big fish eats the little fish,

224
0:11:32.332,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the score would go up and it would keep track,

225
0:11:34.871,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and he didn't know how to do that.

226
0:11:37.383,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So I showed him.

227
0:11:39.648,000 --> 0:11:42,000
In Scratch, you can create something called a variable.

228
0:11:43.225,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I'll call it score.

229
0:11:47.352,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And that creates some new blocks for you,

230
0:11:50.183,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score,

231
0:11:54.849,000 --> 0:11:59,000
so each time I click on "change score," it increments the score.

232
0:12:00.101,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So I showed this to the clubhouse member --

233
0:12:02.626,000 --> 0:12:04,000
let's call him Victor -- and Victor,

234
0:12:05.327,000 --> 0:12:07,000
when he saw that this block would let him increment the score,

235
0:12:08.129,000 --> 0:12:09,000
he knew exactly what to do.

236
0:12:09.945,000 --> 0:12:11,000
He took the block

237
0:12:12.259,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and he put it into the program

238
0:12:15.303,000 --> 0:12:19,000
exactly where the big fish eats the little fish.

239
0:12:19.496,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish,

240
0:12:24.519,000 --> 0:12:29,000
he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.

241
0:12:30.514,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And it's in fact working.

242
0:12:32.211,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And he saw this, and he was so excited,

243
0:12:34.465,000 --> 0:12:35,000
he reached his hand out to me,

244
0:12:36.144,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and he said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."

245
0:12:38.693,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And what went through my mind was,

246
0:12:40.762,000 --> 0:12:43,000
how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students

247
0:12:43.804,000 --> 0:12:46,000
for teaching them variables? (Laughter)

248
0:12:47.207,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It doesn't happen in most classrooms,

249
0:12:49.688,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables,

250
0:12:52.647,000 --> 0:12:54,000
they don't know why they're learning it.

251
0:12:55.155,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It's nothing that, really, they can make use of.

252
0:12:58.026,000 --> 0:13:,000
When you learn ideas like this in Scratch,

253
0:13:00.188,000 --> 0:13:04,000
you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you,

254
0:13:04.291,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that you can understand the reason for learning variables,

255
0:13:07.281,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and we see that kids learn it more deeply

256
0:13:09.323,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and learn it better.

257
0:13:10.738,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Victor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools,

258
0:13:13.779,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but he really didn't -- he wasn't paying attention.

259
0:13:15.967,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Now he had a reason for learning variables.

260
0:13:18.25,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn,

261
0:13:21.324,000 --> 0:13:25,000
you're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things.

262
0:13:26.208,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this,

263
0:13:29.663,000 --> 0:13:31,000
they're learning important concepts like variables,

264
0:13:32.447,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but that's just the start.

265
0:13:34.575,000 --> 0:13:37,000
As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts,

266
0:13:38.425,000 --> 0:13:41,000
he was also learning about the process of design,

267
0:13:41.677,000 --> 0:13:43,000
how to start with the glimmer of an idea

268
0:13:44.296,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project

269
0:13:47.202,000 --> 0:13:49,000
like you see here.

270
0:13:49.709,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So he was learning many different core principles of design,

271
0:13:53.749,000 --> 0:13:56,000
about how to experiment with new ideas,

272
0:13:56.991,000 --> 0:14:,000
how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts,

273
0:14:01.696,000 --> 0:14:03,000
how to collaborate with other people on your projects,

274
0:14:04.686,000 --> 0:14:07,000
about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong,

275
0:14:08.137,000 --> 0:14:11,000
how to keep persistent and to persevere

276
0:14:11.191,000 --> 0:14:14,000
in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well.

277
0:14:14.596,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Now those are important skills

278
0:14:16.369,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that aren't just relevant for coding.

279
0:14:19.237,000 --> 0:14:21,000
They're relevant for all sorts of different activities.

280
0:14:22.064,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become

281
0:14:25.232,000 --> 0:14:27,000
a programmer or a professional computer scientist?

282
0:14:28.156,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It's probably not so likely,

283
0:14:29.968,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but regardless of what he does,

284
0:14:31.756,000 --> 0:14:34,000
he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.

285
0:14:35.46,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager

286
0:14:38.044,000 --> 0:14:41,000
or a mechanic or a community organizer,

287
0:14:41.164,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that these ideas are useful for everybody.

288
0:14:43.62,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language.

289
0:14:47.542,000 --> 0:14:51,000
When you become fluent with reading and writing,

290
0:14:51.898,000 --> 0:14:53,000
it's not something that you're doing

291
0:14:54.339,000 --> 0:14:55,000
just to become a professional writer.

292
0:14:56.299,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Very few people become professional writers.

293
0:14:58.996,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.

294
0:15:02.564,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Again, the same thing with coding.

295
0:15:04.659,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Most people won't grow up to become professional

296
0:15:06.881,000 --> 0:15:09,000
computer scientists or programmers,

297
0:15:10.1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
but those skills of thinking creatively,

298
0:15:12.438,000 --> 0:15:14,000
reasoning systematically, working collaboratively --

299
0:15:14.952,000 --> 0:15:16,000
skills you develop when you code in Scratch --

300
0:15:17.662,000 --> 0:15:21,000
are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives.

301
0:15:22.484,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And it's not just about your work life.

302
0:15:24.86,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Coding can also enable you to

303
0:15:27.58,000 --> 0:15:3,000
express your ideas and feelings in your personal life.

304
0:15:30.756,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Let me end with just one more example.

305
0:15:33.429,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So this is an example that came from

306
0:15:36.556,000 --> 0:15:4,000
after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom,

307
0:15:41.024,000 --> 0:15:44,000
she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.

308
0:15:44.125,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So she made this project for my birthday

309
0:15:47.156,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.

310
0:15:50.732,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design,

311
0:15:54.588,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom

312
0:15:57.563,000 --> 0:16:01,000
is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.

313
0:16:01.8,000 --> 0:16:03,000
But working on this project enabled her

314
0:16:04.772,000 --> 0:16:06,000
to make a connection to someone that she cares about

315
0:16:07.438,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and enabled her to keep on learning new things

316
0:16:10.246,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and continuing to practice her creativity

317
0:16:12.678,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and developing new ways of expressing herself.

318
0:16:15.853,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So as we take a look and we see that

319
0:16:20.064,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Michael Bloomberg is learning to code,

320
0:16:22.628,000 --> 0:16:24,000
all of the children of Estonia learn to code,

321
0:16:25.278,000 --> 0:16:27,000
even my mom has learned to code,

322
0:16:27.478,000 --> 0:16:28,000
don't you think it's about time that you might be

323
0:16:29.25,000 --> 0:16:3,000
thinking about learning to code?

324
0:16:31.162,000 --> 0:16:33,000
If you're interested in giving it a try,

325
0:16:33.355,000 --> 0:16:35,000
I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website.

326
0:16:35.791,000 --> 0:16:37,000
It's scratch.mit.edu,

327
0:16:37.816,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and give a try at coding.

328
0:16:39.638,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Thanks very much. (Applause)

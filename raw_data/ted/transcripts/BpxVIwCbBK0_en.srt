Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I professionally watch YouTube videos.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's true.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and then why that even matters.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We all want to be stars --

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
celebrities, singers, comedians --

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But now Web video has made it

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
can become completely famous

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in a part of our world's culture.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
by next Saturday.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
every minute.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And of that, only a tiny percentage

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So how does it happen?

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Three things:

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
tastemakers, communities of participation

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and unexpectedness.

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
All right, let's go.

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Oh, my God!

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Wooo!

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Ohhhhh, wowwww!

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This is a chart of what it looked like

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
when it first became popular last summer.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
He just wanted to share a rainbow.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And this video had actually been posted

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
all the way back in January.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So what happened here?

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Jimmy Kimmel actually.

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
introduce us to new and interesting things

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and bring them to a larger audience.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000

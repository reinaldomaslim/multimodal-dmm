0:00:16.526,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In 2002, a group of treatment activists met

3
0:00:21.015,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to discuss the early development of the airplane.

4
0:00:25.045,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century,

5
0:00:29.746,000 --> 0:00:3,000
had for the first time managed

6
0:00:31.448,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to make one of those devices fly.

7
0:00:34.02,000 --> 0:00:37,000
They also had taken out numerous patents

8
0:00:37.283,000 --> 0:00:38,000
on essential parts of the airplane.

9
0:00:39.259,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They were not the only ones.

10
0:00:40.7,000 --> 0:00:43,000
That was common practice in the industry,

11
0:00:44.284,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and those who held patents on airplanes

12
0:00:46.576,000 --> 0:00:47,000
were defending them fiercely

13
0:00:47.732,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and suing competitors left and right.

14
0:00:51.154,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry,

15
0:00:56.071,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government

16
0:00:59.377,000 --> 0:01:01,000
was interested in ramping up

17
0:01:01.934,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the production of military airplanes.

18
0:01:04.623,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So there was a bit of a conflict there.

19
0:01:07.334,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The U.S. government decided to take action,

20
0:01:10.573,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and forced those patent holders

21
0:01:12.905,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to make their patents available to share with others

22
0:01:17.066,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to enable the production of airplanes.

23
0:01:22.575,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So what has this

24
0:01:25.545,000 --> 0:01:29,000
got to do with this?

25
0:01:29.565,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In 2002, Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist,

26
0:01:34.628,000 --> 0:01:39,000
discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment.

27
0:01:39.769,000 --> 0:01:43,000
He was told that a cure did not exist.

28
0:01:44.004,000 --> 0:01:47,000
AIDS, he heard, was lethal,

29
0:01:47.207,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and treatment was not offered. This was at a time

30
0:01:50.4,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that treatment actually existed in rich countries.

31
0:01:53.168,000 --> 0:01:55,000
AIDS had become a chronic disease.

32
0:01:56.163,000 --> 0:01:59,000
People in our countries here in Europe, in North America,

33
0:01:59.764,000 --> 0:02:01,000
were living with HIV, healthy lives.

34
0:02:02.709,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough,

35
0:02:05.544,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and not so for his three-year-old son, who he discovered a year later

36
0:02:09.516,000 --> 0:02:12,000
also had HIV.

37
0:02:12.756,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Nelson decided to become a treatment activist

38
0:02:16.176,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and join up with other groups.

39
0:02:18.305,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In 2002, they were facing a different battle.

40
0:02:24.648,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Prices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV,

41
0:02:29.363,000 --> 0:02:33,000
cost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year.

42
0:02:33.76,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The patents on those drugs were held

43
0:02:36.285,000 --> 0:02:41,000
by a number of Western pharmaceutical companies

44
0:02:42.056,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that were not necessarily willing

45
0:02:44.977,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to make those patents available.

46
0:02:48.218,000 --> 0:02:5,000
When you have a patent, you can exclude

47
0:02:50.39,000 --> 0:02:54,000
anyone else from making, from producing or making

48
0:02:55.119,000 --> 0:02:57,000
low-cost versions, for example,

49
0:02:58.117,000 --> 0:03:01,000
available of those medications.

50
0:03:01.693,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out

51
0:03:05.954,000 --> 0:03:07,000
all over the globe.

52
0:03:08.912,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Luckily, those patents did not exist everywhere.

53
0:03:12.573,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There were countries that did not recognize

54
0:03:14.965,000 --> 0:03:16,000
pharmaceutical product patents, such as India,

55
0:03:17.884,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and Indian pharmaceutical companies

56
0:03:20.405,000 --> 0:03:23,000
started to produce so-called generic versions,

57
0:03:24.364,000 --> 0:03:28,000
low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines,

58
0:03:28.831,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and make them available in the developing world,

59
0:03:32.128,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and within a year the price had come down

60
0:03:34.844,000 --> 0:03:37,000
from 10,000 dollars per patient per year

61
0:03:38.63,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to 350 dollars per patient per year,

62
0:03:41.132,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and today that same triple pill cocktail

63
0:03:44.648,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is available for 60 dollars per patient per year,

64
0:03:47.484,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and of course that started to have an enormous effect

65
0:03:50.848,000 --> 0:03:53,000
on the number of people who could afford access

66
0:03:53.937,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to those medicines.

67
0:03:55.427,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Treatment programs became possible,

68
0:03:58.005,000 --> 0:04:01,000
funding became available, and the number of people

69
0:04:01.119,000 --> 0:04:07,000
on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.

70
0:04:07.88,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Today, eight million people

71
0:04:10.593,000 --> 0:04:13,000
have access to antiretroviral drugs.

72
0:04:13.709,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV.

73
0:04:17.691,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Never has this number been so high,

74
0:04:19.69,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but actually this is good news,

75
0:04:20.932,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because what it means is people stop dying.

76
0:04:23.565,000 --> 0:04:25,000
People who have access to these drugs stop dying.

77
0:04:25.885,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And there's something else.

78
0:04:27.221,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They also stop passing on the virus.

79
0:04:30.005,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is fairly recent science that has shown that.

80
0:04:33.667,000 --> 0:04:35,000
What that means is we have the tools

81
0:04:36.323,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to break the back of this epidemic.

82
0:04:40.08,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So what's the problem?

83
0:04:45.349,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Well, things have changed.

84
0:04:47.215,000 --> 0:04:5,000
First of all, the rules have changed.

85
0:04:51.043,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Today, all countries are obliged to provide

86
0:04:56.974,000 --> 0:05:,000
patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.

87
0:05:01.496,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is as a result of the intellectual property rules

88
0:05:04.432,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of the World Trade Organization.

89
0:05:06.78,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So what India did is no longer possible.

90
0:05:09.959,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Second, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.

91
0:05:15.296,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Here you see the patent practices

92
0:05:19.68,000 --> 0:05:23,000
before the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95,

93
0:05:23.769,000 --> 0:05:25,000
before antiretroviral drugs.

94
0:05:26.154,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is what you see today,

95
0:05:28.854,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and this is in developing countries, so what that means is,

96
0:05:31.542,000 --> 0:05:33,000
unless we do something deliberate

97
0:05:33.965,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and unless we do something now,

98
0:05:36.348,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis,

99
0:05:41.464,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because new drugs are developed,

100
0:05:43.684,000 --> 0:05:46,000
new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented

101
0:05:47.046,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in a much wider range of countries.

102
0:05:50.115,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So unless we act, unless we do something today,

103
0:05:54.752,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we will soon be faced [with] what some have termed

104
0:05:58.684,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the treatment time bomb.

105
0:06:01.728,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented.

106
0:06:06.587,000 --> 0:06:08,000
There's something else that can really scare

107
0:06:09.37,000 --> 0:06:1,000
generic manufacturers away.

108
0:06:11.211,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This shows you a patent landscape.

109
0:06:15.212,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This is the landscape of one medicine.

110
0:06:18.896,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So you can imagine that if you are a generic company

111
0:06:21.497,000 --> 0:06:22,000
about to decide whether to invest

112
0:06:23.49,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in the development of this product, unless you know

113
0:06:26.626,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that the licenses to these patents

114
0:06:29.129,000 --> 0:06:31,000
are actually going to be available,

115
0:06:31.627,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you will probably choose to do something else.

116
0:06:34.679,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Again, deliberate action is needed.

117
0:06:38.612,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So surely

118
0:06:41.009,000 --> 0:06:44,000
if a patent pool could be established

119
0:06:44.936,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to ramp up the production of military airplanes,

120
0:06:48.997,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we should be able to do something similar

121
0:06:52.531,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

122
0:06:56.238,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And we did.

123
0:06:58.301,000 --> 0:07:03,000
In 2010, UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool

124
0:07:03.69,000 --> 0:07:06,000
for HIV.

125
0:07:07.173,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And this is how it works:

126
0:07:08.802,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Patent holders, inventors

127
0:07:12.473,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that develop new medicines

128
0:07:16.318,000 --> 0:07:18,000
patent those inventions,

129
0:07:18.884,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but make those patents available

130
0:07:20.635,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool

131
0:07:23.608,000 --> 0:07:26,000
then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents.

132
0:07:27.423,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That can be generic manufacturers.

133
0:07:29.099,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies,

134
0:07:32.912,000 --> 0:07:33,000
for example.

135
0:07:34.389,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Those manufacturers can then sell those medicines

136
0:07:36.903,000 --> 0:07:41,000
at much lower cost to people who need access to them,

137
0:07:41.952,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to treatment programs that need access to them.

138
0:07:44.524,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders,

139
0:07:48.7,000 --> 0:07:58,000
so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.

140
0:07:59.029,000 --> 0:08:03,000
There is one key difference

141
0:08:03.087,000 --> 0:08:06,000
with the airplane patent pool.

142
0:08:06.447,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism.

143
0:08:11.364,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The airplane patent holders were not left a choice

144
0:08:14.796,000 --> 0:08:15,000
whether they'd license their patents or not.

145
0:08:16.436,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They were forced to do so.

146
0:08:18.64,000 --> 0:08:21,000
That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do.

147
0:08:22.562,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies

148
0:08:25.914,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to license their patents and make them available

149
0:08:29.484,000 --> 0:08:33,000
for others to use.

150
0:08:34.024,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.

151
0:08:39.189,000 --> 0:08:42,000
He has access to antiretroviral drugs.

152
0:08:43.171,000 --> 0:08:46,000
His son will soon be 14 years old.

153
0:08:46.948,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Nelson is a member of the expert advisory group

154
0:08:49.518,000 --> 0:08:51,000
of the Medicines Patent Pool,

155
0:08:51.977,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and he told me not so long ago,

156
0:08:54.078,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"Ellen, we rely in Kenya and in many other countries

157
0:08:59.619,000 --> 0:09:02,000
on the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure

158
0:09:03.018,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that new medicines also become available to us,

159
0:09:08.53,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that new medicines, without delay, become available to us."

160
0:09:13.919,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And this is no longer fantasy.

161
0:09:17.278,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Already, I'll give you an example.

162
0:09:21.757,000 --> 0:09:24,000
In August of this year, the United States drug agency

163
0:09:25.215,000 --> 0:09:28,000
approved a new four-in-one AIDS medication.

164
0:09:29.164,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The company, Gilead, that holds the patents,

165
0:09:31.869,000 --> 0:09:35,000
has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.

166
0:09:36.105,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The pool is already working today, two months later,

167
0:09:40.032,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product

168
0:09:43.137,000 --> 0:09:46,000
can go to market at low cost

169
0:09:46.286,000 --> 0:09:49,000
where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.

170
0:09:49.696,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This has never been done before.

171
0:09:51.636,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product

172
0:09:55.355,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to go to market in developing countries, if at all.

173
0:09:58.326,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This has never been seen before.

174
0:10:02.359,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Nelson's expectations are very high,

175
0:10:05.863,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and quite rightly so. He and his son will need access

176
0:10:10.132,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to the next generation of antiretrovirals

177
0:10:13.221,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and the next, throughout their lifetime,

178
0:10:16.328,000 --> 0:10:2,000
so that he and many others in Kenya and other countries

179
0:10:21.006,000 --> 0:10:25,000
can continue to live healthy, active lives.

180
0:10:25.438,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now we count on the willingness of drug companies

181
0:10:28.658,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to make that happen. We count on those companies

182
0:10:31.28,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that understand that it is in the interest, not only in the interest

183
0:10:34.7,000 --> 0:10:37,000
of the global good, but also in their own interest,

184
0:10:37.884,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to move from conflict to collaboration,

185
0:10:43.598,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen.

186
0:10:46.479,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They can also choose not to do that,

187
0:10:49.875,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but those that go down that road may end up

188
0:10:56.086,000 --> 0:10:58,000
in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with

189
0:10:59.01,000 --> 0:11:02,000
early last century, facing forcible measures

190
0:11:02.844,000 --> 0:11:07,000
by government. So they'd better jump now.

191
0:11:08.026,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Thank you. (Applause)

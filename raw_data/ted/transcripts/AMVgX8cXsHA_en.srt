1
0:00:12.94,000 --> 0:00:14,000
"These are the times,"

2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
said Thomas Paine,

3
0:00:17.3,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"that try men's souls."

4
0:00:19.98,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And they're trying ours now.

5
0:00:21.46,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This is a fateful moment in the history of the West.

6
0:00:25.66,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We've seen divisive elections and divided societies.

7
0:00:31.18,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We've seen a growth of extremism

8
0:00:33.74,000 --> 0:00:35,000
in politics and religion,

9
0:00:36.54,000 --> 0:00:39,000
all of it fueled by anxiety, uncertainty and fear,

10
0:00:40.98,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of a world that's changing almost faster than we can bear,

11
0:00:46.3,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and the sure knowledge that it's going to change faster still.

12
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I have a friend in Washington.

13
0:00:52.74,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I asked him, what was it like being in America

14
0:00:54.94,000 --> 0:00:57,000
during the recent presidential election?

15
0:00:58.7,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He said to me, "Well,

16
0:01:00.7,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it was like the man

17
0:01:03.5,000 --> 0:01:05,000
sitting on the deck of the Titanic

18
0:01:06.54,000 --> 0:01:09,000
with a glass of whiskey in his hand

19
0:01:10.14,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and he's saying, 'I know I asked for ice --

20
0:01:13.94,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:19.5,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but this is ridiculous.'"

22
0:01:23.38,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So is there something we can do,

23
0:01:26.82,000 --> 0:01:27,000
each of us,

24
0:01:29.18,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to be able to face the future without fear?

25
0:01:32.06,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I think there is.

26
0:01:34.62,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And one way into it is to see

27
0:01:36.82,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that perhaps the most simple way into a culture and into an age

28
0:01:42.74,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is to ask: What do people worship?

29
0:01:45.74,000 --> 0:01:47,000
People have worshipped so many different things --

30
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the sun, the stars, the storm.

31
0:01:50.66,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Some people worship many gods, some one, some none.

32
0:01:54.66,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In the 19th and 20th centuries,

33
0:01:57.54,000 --> 0:01:59,000
people worshipped the nation,

34
0:01:59.74,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the Aryan race, the communist state.

35
0:02:02.22,000 --> 0:02:04,000
What do we worship?

36
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I think future anthropologists

37
0:02:08.22,000 --> 0:02:1,000
will take a look at the books we read

38
0:02:11.14,000 --> 0:02:14,000
on self-help, self-realization,

39
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
self-esteem.

40
0:02:16.22,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They'll look at the way we talk about morality

41
0:02:19.06,000 --> 0:02:21,000
as being true to oneself,

42
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the way we talk about politics

43
0:02:23.7,000 --> 0:02:25,000
as a matter of individual rights,

44
0:02:26.5,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and they'll look at this wonderful new religious ritual we have created.

45
0:02:31.86,000 --> 0:02:32,000
You know the one?

46
0:02:33.66,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Called the "selfie."

47
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I think they'll conclude that what we worship in our time

48
0:02:39.9,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is the self, the me, the I.

49
0:02:43.5,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And this is great.

50
0:02:45.42,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's liberating. It's empowering. It's wonderful.

51
0:02:49.34,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But don't forget that biologically, we're social animals.

52
0:02:55.02,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We've spent most of our evolutionary history

53
0:02:58.66,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in small groups.

54
0:03:00.54,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We need those face-to-face interactions

55
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
where we learn the choreography of altruism

56
0:03:08.7,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and where we create those spiritual goods

57
0:03:11.78,000 --> 0:03:14,000
like friendship and trust and loyalty and love

58
0:03:16.02,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that redeem our solitude.

59
0:03:19.38,000 --> 0:03:22,000
When we have too much of the "I" and too little of the "we,"

60
0:03:23.34,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we can find ourselves vulnerable,

61
0:03:26.22,000 --> 0:03:28,000
fearful and alone.

62
0:03:28.9,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It was no accident that Sherry Turkle of MIT

63
0:03:31.9,000 --> 0:03:34,000
called the book she wrote on the impact of social media

64
0:03:35.02,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"Alone Together."

65
0:03:38.22,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So I think the simplest way of safeguarding the future "you"

66
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is to strengthen the future "us"

67
0:03:46.34,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in three dimensions:

68
0:03:47.62,000 --> 0:03:49,000
the us of relationship,

69
0:03:49.66,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the us of identity

70
0:03:51.94,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and the us of responsibility.

71
0:03:53.7,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So let me first take the us of relationship.

72
0:03:56.3,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And here, forgive me if I get personal.

73
0:03:59.22,000 --> 0:04:,000
Once upon a time,

74
0:04:01.62,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a very long time ago,

75
0:04:04.1,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I was a 20-year-old undergraduate

76
0:04:06.78,000 --> 0:04:07,000
studying philosophy.

77
0:04:08.46,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and Sartre and Camus.

78
0:04:12.34,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I was full of ontological uncertainty

79
0:04:16.74,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and existential angst.

80
0:04:18.3,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It was terrific.

81
0:04:20.1,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:21.9,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I was self-obsessed and thoroughly unpleasant to know,

83
0:04:25.14,000 --> 0:04:26,000
until one day I saw

84
0:04:27.74,000 --> 0:04:29,000
across the courtyard

85
0:04:29.899,000 --> 0:04:3,000
a girl

86
0:04:31.3,000 --> 0:04:34,000
who was everything that I wasn't.

87
0:04:34.9,000 --> 0:04:36,000
She radiated sunshine.

88
0:04:36.94,000 --> 0:04:38,000
She emanated joy.

89
0:04:40.5,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I found out her name was Elaine.

90
0:04:42.42,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We met. We talked.

91
0:04:43.9,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We married.

92
0:04:45.34,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And 47 years, three children and eight grandchildren later,

93
0:04:49.7,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I can safely say

94
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it was the best decision I ever took in my life,

95
0:04:54.22,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because it's the people not like us

96
0:04:57.86,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that make us grow.

97
0:05:00.22,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And that is why I think

98
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we have to do just that.

99
0:05:05.86,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The trouble with Google filters,

100
0:05:07.98,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Facebook friends

101
0:05:09.94,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and reading the news by narrowcasting rather than broadcasting

102
0:05:13.7,000 --> 0:05:17,000
means that we're surrounded almost entirely by people like us

103
0:05:18.54,000 --> 0:05:21,000
whose views, whose opinions, whose prejudices, even,

104
0:05:22.06,000 --> 0:05:23,000
are just like ours.

105
0:05:24.02,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And Cass Sunstein of Harvard has shown

106
0:05:26.74,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that if we surround ourselves with people with the same views as us,

107
0:05:31.14,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we get more extreme.

108
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I think we need to renew those face-to-face encounters

109
0:05:38.06,000 --> 0:05:39,000
with the people not like us.

110
0:05:41.1,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I think we need to do that

111
0:05:43.22,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in order to realize that we can disagree strongly

112
0:05:47.3,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and yet still stay friends.

113
0:05:50.62,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's in those face-to-face encounters

114
0:05:52.74,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that we discover that the people not like us

115
0:05:56.74,000 --> 0:05:58,000
are just people, like us.

116
0:06:00.62,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And actually, every time

117
0:06:03.46,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we hold out the hand of friendship

118
0:06:05.78,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to somebody not like us,

119
0:06:07.82,000 --> 0:06:11,000
whose class or creed or color are different from ours,

120
0:06:13.86,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we heal

121
0:06:15.58,000 --> 0:06:16,000
one of the fractures

122
0:06:17.22,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of our wounded world.

123
0:06:19.02,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That is the us of relationship.

124
0:06:21.94,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Second is the us of identity.

125
0:06:25.22,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Let me give you a thought experiment.

126
0:06:28.06,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Have you been to Washington? Have you seen the memorials?

127
0:06:30.78,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Absolutely fascinating.

128
0:06:32.5,000 --> 0:06:33,000
There's the Lincoln Memorial:

129
0:06:34.14,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Gettysburg Address on one side, Second Inaugural on the other.

130
0:06:38.58,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You go to the Jefferson Memorial,

131
0:06:40.34,000 --> 0:06:41,000
screeds of text.

132
0:06:42.3,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Martin Luther King Memorial,

133
0:06:44.34,000 --> 0:06:46,000
more than a dozen quotes from his speeches.

134
0:06:46.78,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I didn't realize, in America you read memorials.

135
0:06:51.62,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now go to the equivalent in London in Parliament Square

136
0:06:55.54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and you will see that the monument to David Lloyd George

137
0:06:58.94,000 --> 0:07:,000
contains three words:

138
0:07:00.98,000 --> 0:07:02,000
David Lloyd George.

139
0:07:03.14,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:05.38,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Nelson Mandela gets two.

141
0:07:07.18,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Churchill gets just one:

142
0:07:09.54,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Churchill.

143
0:07:10.78,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:12.1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Why the difference? I'll tell you why the difference.

145
0:07:14.62,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Because America was from the outset a nation of wave after wave of immigrants,

146
0:07:18.94,000 --> 0:07:2,000
so it had to create an identity

147
0:07:21.14,000 --> 0:07:23,000
which it did by telling a story

148
0:07:23.5,000 --> 0:07:25,000
which you learned at school, you read on memorials

149
0:07:26.18,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and you heard repeated in presidential inaugural addresses.

150
0:07:30.06,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Britain until recently wasn't a nation of immigrants,

151
0:07:33.14,000 --> 0:07:35,000
so it could take identity for granted.

152
0:07:35.62,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The trouble is now

153
0:07:38.86,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that two things have happened which shouldn't have happened together.

154
0:07:42.38,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The first thing is in the West we've stopped telling this story

155
0:07:45.7,000 --> 0:07:46,000
of who we are and why,

156
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
even in America.

157
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And at the same time,

158
0:07:50.86,000 --> 0:07:54,000
immigration is higher than it's ever been before.

159
0:07:55.74,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So when you tell a story and your identity is strong,

160
0:07:59.06,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you can welcome the stranger,

161
0:08:01.22,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but when you stop telling the story,

162
0:08:03.74,000 --> 0:08:04,000
your identity gets weak

163
0:08:05.3,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and you feel threatened by the stranger.

164
0:08:08.82,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And that's bad.

165
0:08:10.42,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I tell you, Jews have been scattered and dispersed and exiled for 2,000 years.

166
0:08:16.74,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We never lost our identity.

167
0:08:18.46,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Why? Because at least once a year,

168
0:08:20.58,000 --> 0:08:21,000
on the festival of Passover,

169
0:08:22.34,000 --> 0:08:24,000
we told our story and we taught it to our children

170
0:08:25.3,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and we ate the unleavened bread of affliction

171
0:08:27.58,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery.

172
0:08:30.02,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So we never lost our identity.

173
0:08:32.1,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I think collectively

174
0:08:33.82,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we've got to get back to telling our story,

175
0:08:36.7,000 --> 0:08:38,000
who we are, where we came from,

176
0:08:38.74,000 --> 0:08:41,000
what ideals by which we live.

177
0:08:42.22,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And if that happens,

178
0:08:44.1,000 --> 0:08:46,000
we will become strong enough

179
0:08:46.54,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to welcome the stranger and say,

180
0:08:49.22,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"Come and share our lives,

181
0:08:52.34,000 --> 0:08:53,000
share our stories,

182
0:08:54.54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
share our aspirations and dreams."

183
0:08:58.7,000 --> 0:08:59,000
That is the us of identity.

184
0:09:00.62,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And finally, the us of responsibility.

185
0:09:04.66,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Do you know something?

186
0:09:05.94,000 --> 0:09:07,000
My favorite phrase in all of politics,

187
0:09:08.58,000 --> 0:09:09,000
very American phrase,

188
0:09:11.34,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is: "We the people."

189
0:09:14.94,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Why "we the people?"

190
0:09:16.18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Because it says that we all share collective responsibility

191
0:09:21.3,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for our collective future.

192
0:09:23.86,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And that's how things really are and should be.

193
0:09:27.74,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Have you noticed how magical thinking

194
0:09:31.1,000 --> 0:09:33,000
has taken over our politics?

195
0:09:34.66,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So we say, all you've got to do is elect this strong leader

196
0:09:40.5,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and he or she will solve all our problems for us.

197
0:09:46.46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Believe me, that is magical thinking.

198
0:09:51.22,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And then we get the extremes:

199
0:09:52.82,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the far right, the far left,

200
0:09:55.74,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the extreme religious and the extreme anti-religious,

201
0:09:59.46,000 --> 0:10:03,000
the far right dreaming of a golden age that never was,

202
0:10:04.42,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the far left dreaming of a utopia that never will be

203
0:10:09.22,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and the religious and anti-religious equally convinced

204
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that all it takes is God or the absence of God

205
0:10:17.62,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to save us from ourselves.

206
0:10:20.58,000 --> 0:10:23,000
That, too, is magical thinking,

207
0:10:23.78,000 --> 0:10:27,000
because the only people who will save us from ourselves

208
0:10:28.46,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is we the people,

209
0:10:30.86,000 --> 0:10:31,000
all of us together.

210
0:10:33.06,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And when we do that,

211
0:10:36.66,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and when we move from the politics of me

212
0:10:40.06,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to the politics of all of us together,

213
0:10:43.46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
we rediscover those beautiful, counterintuitive truths:

214
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that a nation is strong

215
0:10:52.54,000 --> 0:10:53,000
when it cares for the weak,

216
0:10:55.06,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that it becomes rich

217
0:10:56.9,000 --> 0:10:58,000
when it cares for the poor,

218
0:10:59.06,000 --> 0:11:03,000
it becomes invulnerable when it cares about the vulnerable.

219
0:11:03.7,000 --> 0:11:05,000
That is what makes great nations.

220
0:11:06.14,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Applause)

221
0:11:14.94,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So here is my simple suggestion.

222
0:11:18.54,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It might just change your life,

223
0:11:22.06,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and it might just help to begin to change the world.

224
0:11:26.22,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Do a search and replace operation

225
0:11:30.18,000 --> 0:11:32,000
on the text of your mind,

226
0:11:32.94,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and wherever you encounter the word "self,"

227
0:11:36.06,000 --> 0:11:38,000
substitute the word "other."

228
0:11:39.22,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So instead of self-help, other-help;

229
0:11:42.5,000 --> 0:11:45,000
instead of self-esteem, other-esteem.

230
0:11:47.06,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And if you do that,

231
0:11:49.06,000 --> 0:11:51,000
you will begin to feel the power

232
0:11:52.66,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of what for me is one of the most moving sentences

233
0:11:56.7,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in all of religious literature.

234
0:11:59.94,000 --> 0:12:03,000
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

235
0:12:04.86,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I will fear no evil,

236
0:12:07.34,000 --> 0:12:09,000
for you are with me."

237
0:12:10.22,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We can face any future without fear

238
0:12:14.78,000 --> 0:12:15,000
so long as we know

239
0:12:16.54,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we will not face it alone.

240
0:12:19.9,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So for the sake of the future "you,"

241
0:12:23.98,000 --> 0:12:25,000
together let us strengthen

242
0:12:26.86,000 --> 0:12:27,000
the future "us."

243
0:12:29.14,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Thank you.

244
0:12:30.38,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to be talking to you

2
0:00:17.33,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about how we can tap

3
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a really underutilized resource in health care,

4
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which is the patient,

5
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or, as I like to use the scientific term,

6
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
people.

7
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Because we are all patients, we are all people.

8
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Even doctors are patients at some point.

9
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So I want to talk about that

10
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
as an opportunity

11
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country

12
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and, in fact, worldwide.

13
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
If you want to get at the big part --

14
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I mean from a public health level, where my training is --

15
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you're looking at behavioral issues.

16
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You're looking at things where people are actually given information,

17
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and they're not following through with it.

18
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,

19
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
obesity, many forms of heart disease,

20
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking.

21
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.

22
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
They know what they're supposed to be doing,

23
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but they're not doing it.

24
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now behavior change is something

25
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that is a long-standing problem in medicine.

26
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It goes all the way back to Aristotle.

27
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And doctors hate it, right?

28
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I mean, they complain about it all the time.

29
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.

30
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
When people don't take their pills,

31
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
when people don't follow doctors' orders --

32
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
these are behavior problems.

33
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But for as much as clinical medicine

34
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
agonizes over behavior change,

35
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
there's not a lot of work done

36
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in terms of trying to fix that problem.

37
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So the crux of it

38
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
comes down to this notion of decision-making --

39
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
giving information to people in a form

40
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that doesn't just educate them

41
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or inform them,

42
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but actually leads them to make better decisions,

43
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
better choices in their lives.

44
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
One part of medicine, though,

45
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,

46
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and that's dentistry.

47
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is --

48
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
many dentists would have to acknowledge

49
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.

50
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.

51
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But they have really taken this problem of behavior change

52
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and solved it.

53
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's the one great preventive health success

54
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we have in our health care system.

55
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
People brush and floss their teeth.

56
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.

57
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So I'm going to talk about one experiment

58
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that a few dentists in Connecticut

59
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
cooked up about 30 years ago.

60
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,

61
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because it was very simple,

62
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
so it's an easy story to tell.

63
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So these Connecticut dentists decided

64
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,

65
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and they were going to use one variable:

66
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they wanted to scare them.

67
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They wanted to tell them how bad it would be

68
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
if they didn't brush and floss their teeth.

69
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They had a big patient population.

70
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They divided them up into two groups.

71
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They had a low-fear population,

72
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,

73
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
all based in science,

74
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,

75
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,

76
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.

77
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So that was the low-fear group.

78
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.

79
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They showed bloody gums.

80
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.

81
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They told them that their teeth were going to fall out.

82
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They said that they could have infections

83
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,

84
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.

85
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They would get dentures, and if you got dentures,

86
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,

87
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you weren't going to be able to eat apples,

88
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you weren't going to be able to eat steak.

89
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You'll eat mush for the rest of your life.

90
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So go brush and floss your teeth.

91
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That was the message. That was the experiment.

92
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now they measured one other variable.

93
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They wanted to capture one other variable,

94
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which was the patients' sense of efficacy.

95
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This was the notion of whether the patients felt

96
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.

97
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So they asked them at the beginning,

98
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"

99
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"

100
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they were characterized as high efficacy,

101
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and the people who said,

102
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,"

103
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
they were characterized as low efficacy.

104
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So the upshot was this.

105
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The upshot of this experiment

106
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
was that fear was not really a primary driver

107
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of the behavior at all.

108
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The people who brushed and flossed their teeth

109
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
were not necessarily the people

110
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
who were really scared about what would happen --

111
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity

112
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to change their behavior.

113
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So fear showed up as not really the driver.

114
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It was the sense of efficacy.

115
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I want to isolate this,

116
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because it was a great observation --

117
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
30 years ago, right, 30 years ago --

118
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and it's one that's laid fallow in research.

119
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It was a notion that really came out

120
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
of Albert Bandura's work,

121
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
who studied whether

122
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
people could get a sense of empowerment.

123
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that

124
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.

125
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
In health care terms, you could characterize this

126
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as whether or not somebody feels

127
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that they see a path towards better health,

128
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that they can actually see their way towards getting better health,

129
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and that's a very important notion.

130
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It's an amazing notion.

131
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.

132
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Except, maybe we do.

133
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.

134
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And this is a great example

135
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of how we haven't learned that lesson at all.

136
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.

137
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This is still the way we're communicating messages about health.

138
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,

139
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"

140
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people."

141
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I don't know if it works.

142
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now here's what does work:

143
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
personalized information works.

144
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Again, Bandura recognized this

145
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
years ago, decades ago.

146
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
When you give people specific information

147
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
about their health, where they stand,

148
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and where they want to get to, where they might get to,

149
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that path, that notion of a path --

150
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
that tends to work for behavior change.

151
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So let me just spool it out a little bit.

152
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So you start with personalized data, personalized information

153
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that comes from an individual,

154
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and then you need to connect it to their lives.

155
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You need to connect it to their lives,

156
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.

157
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.

158
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers --

159
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
this overload of health information

160
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that we're inundated with.

161
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But it actually hits home.

162
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.

163
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
There's an emotional connection to information

164
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
because it's from us.

165
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
That information then needs to be connected to choices,

166
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
needs to be connected to a range of options,

167
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
directions that we might go to --

168
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
trade-offs, benefits.

169
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.

170
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We need to connect the information

171
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
always with the action,

172
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and then that action feeds back

173
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
into different information,

174
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and it creates, of course, a feedback loop.

175
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion

176
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
for behavior change.

177
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there --

178
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.

179
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It's a difficult and expensive commodity,

180
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
until now.

181
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.

182
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs.

183
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
You've seen them all around,

184
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
especially these days as radars are cheaper.

185
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And here's how they work in the feedback loop.

186
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So you start with the personalized data

187
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point

188
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is 25,

189
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and, of course, you're going faster than that.

190
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We always are. We're always going above the speed limit.

191
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The choice in this case is pretty simple.

192
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We either keep going fast, or we slow down.

193
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We should probably slow down,

194
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and that point of action is probably now.

195
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We should take our foot off the pedal right now,

196
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective

197
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in terms of getting people to slow down.

198
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.

199
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They last for about five miles,

200
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in which case we put our foot back on the pedal.

201
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But it works, and it even has some health repercussions.

202
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit.

203
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.

204
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But by and large, this is a feedback loop

205
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that's so nifty and too rare.

206
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Because in health care, most health care,

207
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the data is very removed from the action.

208
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's very difficult to line things up so neatly.

209
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But we have an opportunity.

210
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about

211
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
how we deliver health information in this country,

212
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
how we actually get information.

213
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This is a pharmaceutical ad.

214
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.

215
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Nobody's had the brilliant idea

216
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of calling their drug Havidol quite yet.

217
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But it looks completely right.

218
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So it's exactly the way we get

219
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
health information and pharmaceutical information,

220
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and it just sounds perfect.

221
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And then we turn the page of the magazine,

222
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and we see this --

223
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies

224
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to put into their ads, or to follow their ads,

225
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and to me, this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine.

226
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
Because we know.

227
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Who among us would actually say that people read this?

228
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And who among us would actually say

229
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that people who do try to read this

230
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
actually get anything out of it?

231
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This is a bankrupt effort

232
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
at communicating health information.

233
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
There is no good faith in this.

234
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So this is a different approach.

235
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is an approach that has been developed

236
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,

237
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.

238
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And they created this thing called the "drug facts box."

239
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
They took inspiration from, of all things,

240
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Cap'n Crunch.

241
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
They went to the nutritional information box

242
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,

243
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
actually helps people understand what's in their food.

244
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
God forbid we should use that same standard

245
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that we make Cap'n Crunch live by

246
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and bring it to drug companies.

247
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So let me just walk through this quickly.

248
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,

249
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
so you can start to personalize your understanding

250
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of whether the information is relevant to you

251
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
or whether the drug is relevant to you.

252
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
You can understand exactly what the benefits are.

253
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,

254
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but you get the statistics for how effective it is.

255
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And finally, you understand what those choices are.

256
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You can start to unpack the choices involved

257
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because of the side effects.

258
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.

259
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So it spells those out in very clean terms,

260
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and that works.

261
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So I love this. I love that drug facts box.

262
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And so I was thinking about,

263
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
what's an opportunity that I could have

264
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to help people understand information?

265
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
What's another latent body of information that's out there

266
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that people are really not putting to use?

267
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And so I came up with this: lab test results.

268
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Blood test results are this great source of information.

269
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
They're packed with information.

270
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.

271
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They go right to doctors.

272
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them,

273
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
they don't really understand all this stuff either.

274
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This is the worst presented information.

275
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You ask Tufte, and he would say,

276
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."

277
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
What we did at Wired

278
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
was we went, and I got our graphic design department

279
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to re-imagine these lab reports.

280
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So that's what I want to walk you through.

281
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So this is the general blood work before,

282
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and this is the after, this is what we came up with.

283
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The after takes what was four pages --

284
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that previous slide was actually

285
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the first of four pages of data

286
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that's just the general blood work.

287
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.

288
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This is our one-page summary.

289
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We use the notion of color.

290
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's an amazing notion that color could be used.

291
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So on the top-level you have your overall results,

292
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the things that might jump out at you from the fine print.

293
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Then you can drill down

294
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and understand how actually we put your level in context,

295
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and we use color to illustrate

296
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
exactly where your value falls.

297
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes

298
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
because of their glucose level.

299
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Likewise, you can go over your lipids

300
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is

301
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.

302
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But again, always using color

303
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and personalized proximity

304
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to that information.

305
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
All those other values,

306
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,

307
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
we summarize.

308
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We tell you that you're okay, you're normal.

309
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.

310
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And then we do two other very important things

311
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that kind of help fill in this feedback loop:

312
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we help people understand in a little more detail

313
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
what these values are and what they might indicate.

314
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do.

315
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We give them some insight

316
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
into what choices they can make, what actions they can take.

317
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So that's our general blood work test.

318
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Then we went to CRP test.

319
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
In this case, it's a sin of omission.

320
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
They have this huge amount of space,

321
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and they don't use it for anything, so we do.

322
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Now the CRP test is often done

323
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
following a cholesterol test,

324
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
or in conjunction with a cholesterol test.

325
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
So we take the bold step

326
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
of putting the cholesterol information on the same page,

327
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.

328
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.

329
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
It's a protein that shows up

330
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
when your blood vessels might be inflamed,

331
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
which might be a risk for heart disease.

332
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
What you're actually measuring

333
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
is spelled out in clean language.

334
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Then we use the information

335
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that's already in the lab report.

336
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We use the person's age and their gender

337
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to start to fill in the personalized risks.

338
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So we start to use the data we have

339
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to run a very simple calculation

340
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that's on all sorts of online calculators

341
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to get a sense of what the actual risk is.

342
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.

343
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Here's the before, and here's the after.

344
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Now a lot of our effort on this one --

345
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
as many of you probably know,

346
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
a PSA test is a very controversial test.

347
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It's used to test for prostate cancer,

348
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but there are all sorts of reasons

349
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
why your prostate might be enlarged.

350
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And so we spent a good deal of our time

351
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
indicating that.

352
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We again personalized the risks.

353
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So this patient is in their 50s,

354
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
so we can actually give them a very precise estimate

355
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
of what their risk for prostate cancer is.

356
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.

357
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And then again, the follow-up actions.

358
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.

359
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
That's what Wired magazine spent on this.

360
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Why is Wired magazine doing this?

361
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Laughter)

362
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp,

363
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
the two largest lab testing companies --

364
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars

365
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and over 500 million dollars respectively.

366
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Now this is not a problem of resources;

367
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
this is a problem of incentives.

368
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We need to recognize that the target of this information

369
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.

370
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
It should be the patient.

371
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It's the person who actually, in the end,

372
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
is going to be having to change their lives

373
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and then start adopting new behaviors.

374
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
This is information that is incredibly powerful.

375
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.

376
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there.

377
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It's being lost.

378
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So I want to just offer four questions

379
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that every patient should ask,

380
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
because I don't actually expect people

381
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to start developing these lab test reports.

382
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
But you can create your own feedback loop.

383
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:

384
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Can I have my results?

385
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And the only acceptable answer is --

386
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Audience: Yes.) -- yes.

387
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.

388
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
What are my options? What choices are now on the table?

389
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And then, what's next?

390
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
How do I integrate this information

391
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
into the longer course of my life?

392
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So I want to wind up by just showing

393
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that people have the capacity to understand this information.

394
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.

395
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
You do not need to have the education level of people in this room.

396
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information,

397
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them

398
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
in a form that they can engage with.

399
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And engagement is essential here,

400
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
because it's not just giving them information;

401
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
it's giving them an opportunity to act.

402
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.

403
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior

404
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
in medicine today.

405
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And this information is out there.

406
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I've been talking today about latent information,

407
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
all this information that exists in the system

408
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that we're not putting to use.

409
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
But there are all sorts of other bodies of information

410
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that are coming online,

411
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and we need to recognize the capacity of this information

412
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to engage people, to help people

413
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and to change the course of their lives.

414
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Thank you very much.

415
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Applause)

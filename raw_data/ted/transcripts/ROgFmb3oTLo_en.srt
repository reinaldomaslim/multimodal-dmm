Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED,

2
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've decided to bring along an old friend

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to help break the ice a bit.

4
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.

5
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.

6
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But I'd also like to introduce you to

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
what may be an unfamiliar face.

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.

10
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations,

11
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.

12
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
They have different interests. They have divergent values.

13
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And should they ever come in contact ...

14
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.

15
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.

16
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Where I work, in the Arab region,

17
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
people are busy taking up Western innovations

18
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and changing them into things

19
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which are neither conventionally Western,

20
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
nor are they traditionally Islamic.

21
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I want to show you two examples.

22
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The first is 4Shbab.

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.

24
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Video): Video clips from across the globe.

25
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The USA.

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000

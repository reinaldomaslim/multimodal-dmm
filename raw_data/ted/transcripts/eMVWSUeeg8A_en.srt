1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I spent the best part of last year

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
working on a documentary

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about my own happiness --

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
trying to see

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
if I can actually train my mind

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in a particular way,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
like I can train my body,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
so I can end up with an improved feeling

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
of overall well-being.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Then this January,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
my mother died,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and pursuing a film like that

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So in a very typical, silly designer fashion,

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
after years worth of work,

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film.

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Music)

18
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They were still done

19
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia.

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.

21
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It was a little bit too funky,

22
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and we wanted a more feminine point of view

23
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and employed a duck

24
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who did it in a much more fitting way --

25
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
fashion.

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
My studio in Bali

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and monkeys, of course,

29
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
are supposed to be the happiest of all animals.

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So we trained them to be able to do three separate words,

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to lay out them properly.

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
You can see,

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The serif is not really in place.

35
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So of course, what you don't do properly yourself

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is never deemed done really.

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So this is us climbing onto the trees

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and putting it up over the Sayan Valley

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in Indonesia.

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
In that year, what I did do a lot

41
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
was look at all sorts of surveys,

42
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
looking at a lot of data on this subject.

43
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And it turns out

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that men and women

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
report very, very similar levels of happiness.

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
This is a very quick overview

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of all the studies that I looked at.

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That climate plays no role.

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That if you live in the best climate,

50
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in San Diego in the United States,

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
you are going to be just as happy

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in either place.

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,

55
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
any salary increase you're going to experience

56
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
will have only a tiny, tiny influence

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
on your overall well-being.

58
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Black people are just as happy as white people are.

59
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
If you're old or young

60
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it doesn't really make a difference.

61
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
If you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking

62
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it makes no difference whatsoever.

63
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You will adapt to it and get used to it.

64
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
If you have manageable health problems

65
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
it doesn't really matter.

66
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now this does matter.

67
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So now the woman on the right

68
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is actually much happier than the guy on the left --

69
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
meaning that, if you have a lot of friends,

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and you have meaningful friendships,

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that does make a lot of difference.

72
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier

73
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
than if you are single.

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
came up with this beautiful little analogy

76
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
between the conscious and the unconscious mind.

77
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider

78
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
on this giant elephant, the unconscious.

79
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And the rider thinks

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that he can tell the elephant what to do,

81
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but the elephant really has his own ideas.

82
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
If I look at my own life,

83
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I'm born in 1962 in Austria.

84
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If I would have been born a hundred years earlier,

85
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
the big decisions in my life would have been made for me --

86
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in;

87
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I would have very much likely

88
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
entered the same profession that my dad did;

89
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and I would have very much likely married a woman

90
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that my mom had selected.

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I, of course, and all of us,

92
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are very much in charge

93
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of these big decisions in our lives.

94
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We live where we want to be --

95
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
at least in the West.

96
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We become what we really are interested in.

97
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We choose our own profession,

98
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we choose our own partners.

99
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And so it's quite surprising

100
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that many of us

101
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
let our unconscious influence those decisions

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in ways that we are not quite aware of.

103
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If you look at the statistics

104
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and you see that the guy called George,

105
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
when he decides on where he wants to live --

106
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is it Florida or North Dakota? --

107
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
he goes and lives in Georgia.

108
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And if you look at a guy called Dennis,

109
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
when he decides what to become --

110
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor

111
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or a teacher? --

112
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.

113
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And if Paula decides

114
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
should she marry Joe or Jack,

115
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
somehow Paul sounds the most interesting.

116
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And so even if we make

117
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
those very important decisions

118
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
for very silly reasons,

119
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it remains statistically true

120
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that there are more Georges living in Georgia

121
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and there are more Dennises becoming dentists

122
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul

123
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
than statistically viable.

124
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now I, of course, thought,

126
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"Well this is American data,"

127
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and I thought, "Well, those silly Americans.

128
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They get influenced by things

129
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that they're not aware of.

130
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This is just completely ridiculous."

131
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Then, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad --

132
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Karolina and Karl,

134
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and grandmom and granddad,

135
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Josefine and Josef.

136
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So I am looking still for a Stephanie.

137
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I'll figure something out.

138
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal

139
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and see what makes me happy as a designer,

140
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the easiest answer, of course,

141
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is do more of the stuff that I like to do

142
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do --

143
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
for which it would be helpful

144
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to know what it is that I actually do like to do.

145
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'm a big list maker,

146
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
so I came up with a list.

147
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
One of them is to think without pressure.

148
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This is a project we're working on right now

149
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with a very healthy deadline.

150
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's a book on culture,

151
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and, as you can see,

152
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
culture is rapidly drifting around.

153
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Doing things like I'm doing right now --

154
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
traveling to Cannes.

155
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The example I have here

156
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
is a chair that came out of the year in Bali --

157
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,

158
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
not being stuck behind

159
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
a single computer screen all day long

160
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and be here and there.

161
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Quite consciously, design projects

162
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that need an incredible amount of various techniques,

163
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
just basically to fight

164
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
straightforward adaptation.

165
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Being close to the content --

166
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that's the content really is close to my heart.

167
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This is a bus, or vehicle,

168
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
for a charity, for an NGO

169
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that wants to double the education budget in the United States --

170
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
carefully designed,

171
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses.

172
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Having end results -- things that come back from the printer well,

173
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
like this little business card for an animation company

174
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
called Sideshow

175
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
on lenticular foils.

176
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Working on projects

177
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that actually have visible impacts,

178
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
like a book for a deceased German artist

179
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
whose widow came to us

180
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with the requirement to make her late husband famous.

181
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It just came out six months ago,

182
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany.

183
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And I think that his widow

184
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is going to be very successful on her quest.

185
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And lately, to be involved in projects

186
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
where I know about 50 percent of the project

187
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
technique-wise

188
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the other 50 percent would be new.

189
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So in this case,

190
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it's an outside projection for Singapore

191
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
on these giant Times Square-like screens.

192
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I of course knew stuff, as a designer,

193
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
about typography,

194
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
even though we worked with those animals not so successfully.

195
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But I didn't quite know

196
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
all that much about movement or film.

197
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.

198
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But also because the content was very close.

199
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In this case, "Keeping a Diary

200
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Supports Personal Development" --

201
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I've been keeping a diary since I was 12.

202
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And I've found that it influenced my life and work

203
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in a very intriguing way.

204
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In this case also because

205
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it's part of one of the many sentiments

206
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that we build the whole series on --

207
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary.

208
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Thank you so much.

209
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Applause)

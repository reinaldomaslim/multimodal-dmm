1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But you have to have the right tools.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And similarly, she finds prototyping boards

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
really frustrating for her little hands.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So my wonderful student Sam and I

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of:

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Play-Doh.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And so we spent a summer

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
looking at different Play-Doh recipes.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And these recipes probably look really familiar

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to any of you who have made homemade play-dough --

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We have two favorite recipes --

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
one that has these ingredients

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and a second that had sugar instead of salt.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You see that really salty Play-Doh?

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Well, it conducts electricity.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And this is nothing new.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity,

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and high school physics teachers have used that for years.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But our homemade play-dough

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And that sugar dough?

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
than that salt dough.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So what does that mean?

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits --

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
can build on their own.

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Applause)

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And so I want to do a little demo for you.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So if I take this salt dough,

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I plug it in --

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
you can buy them at Radio Shack

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and pretty much anywhere else --

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we can actually then

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
light things up.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But if any of you have studied electrical engineering,

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we can also create a short circuit.

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
If I push these together, the light turns off.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
If I separate them again, I have some light.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Well now if I take that sugar dough,

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's like a wall to the electricity.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching,

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but if I stick that light back in,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I have light.

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor,

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
put some play-dough on it, stick it on

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and we have spinning.

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Applause)

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And once you have the basics,

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids.

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I plug in again the power to it.

64
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I can start plugging in lots of lights.

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And we can start talking about things like electrical load.

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
What happens if I put in lots of lights

68
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and then add a motor?

69
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It'll dim.

70
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We can even add microprocessors

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and have this as an input

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and create squishy sound music that we've done.

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You could do parallel and series circuits

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
for kids using this.

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So this is all in your home kitchen.

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes.

78
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves.

79
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.

80
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids,

81
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to a science researcher in the U.K.,

82
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and curriculum developers in Hawaii.

83
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh,

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.

85
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab

86
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or little kids as circuit designers,

87
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but maybe we should.

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Have fun. Thank you.

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Applause)

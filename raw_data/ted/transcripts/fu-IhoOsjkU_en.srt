1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You hear that this is the era of environment -- or biology, or information technology ...

2
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Well, it's the era of a lot of different things

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that we're in right now. But one thing for sure:

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
it's the era of change. There's more change going on

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.

6
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it

7
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
so that you really understand it.

8
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this.

9
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out --

10
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble

11
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past,

12
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change

13
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years,

15
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans

16
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times

17
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
since I was born. When you have a new baby,

18
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
by the time that kid gets out of high school

19
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.

20
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This is unprecedented, and it's big.

21
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part.

22
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that.

23
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
What I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets --

24
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just --

25
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc.,

26
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance?

27
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning,

28
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.

29
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle --

30
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets

31
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth

32
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation

33
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over.

34
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years:

35
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.

36
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans,

37
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods

38
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life --

39
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.

40
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, the third curve is information technology.

41
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density

42
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of information, but it has been pretty good for showing

43
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
a lot of other things about information technology --

44
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important

45
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve,

46
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.

47
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This is the size of the earth going through that same --

48
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

49
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
-- frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph.

50
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
There's no need to see the little detailed words on it.

51
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That first one is humans-versus-nature;

52
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we've won, there's no more gain. Human population.

53
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into,

54
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that's not a good one -- protecting natural creatures. Human population

55
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is going up; it's going to continue for quite a while.

56
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. --

57
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed,

58
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
transported, housed and so on. And the information technology,

59
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful

60
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?

61
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's just going up through the roof.

62
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible

63
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.

64
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So, that's the stage out of all this. I find,

65
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.

66
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable

67
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words,

68
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.

69
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable;

70
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
economically, it's achievable; politically,

71
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible.

72
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The institutions of the past with all their inertia

73
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there

74
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time

75
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual --

76
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and whatever else we devote ourselves to.

77
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills,

78
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school,

79
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which is putting information and dogma into them,

80
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue

81
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book,

82
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
think broadly or creative. They can be.

83
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you

84
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
for the things that are important in life

85
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or for the survival of civilization; they reward you

86
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff.

87
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We can't go into that today because there isn't time --

88
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future

89
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
there is an essential feature -- necessary, but not sufficient --

90
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things

91
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
with more efficiency using less energy, less material.

92
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power,

93
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential

94
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have

95
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.

96
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done.

97
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me

98
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in this direction in 1976 and 77,

99
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
winning the Kremer prize in aviation history,

100
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
followed by the Albatross. And we began

101
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
making various odd planes and creatures.

102
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.

103
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow

104
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job,

105
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.

106
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This was the full size of the original creature.

107
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We did things on land, in the air, on water --

108
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics

109
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same,

110
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
whether its land, air or water.

111
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane --

112
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
165 miles carrying a person from France to England

113
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part

114
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors --

115
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia.

116
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars,

117
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that

118
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact,

119
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them

120
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort

121
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
into turning it into a commercial product.

122
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
With that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape,

123
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which shows a little airplane for surveillance

124
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and moving to a giant airplane.

125
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance --

126
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example

127
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote

128
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble

129
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.

130
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.

131
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously,

132
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.

133
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The modern sailplane is superbly efficient.

134
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent.

135
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They are powered only by the energy

136
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
they can extract from the atmosphere --

137
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy.

138
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous

139
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown

140
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
over 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.

141
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Music)

142
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol

143
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that photovoltaic cells can produce real power

144
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and will be part of the world's energy future.

145
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England,

146
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
solely on the power of sunbeams,

147
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and established a basis for the Pathfinder.

148
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Music)

149
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology

150
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less --

151
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
gains that can help us attain a desirable balance

152
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
between technology and nature. The stakes are high

153
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
as we speed toward a challenging future.

154
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers

155
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew,

156
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
can and must do more with less -- much less."

157
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute,

158
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show

159
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii,

160
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it

161
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
after it had just flown to 71,530 feet --

162
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.

163
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun --

164
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there.

165
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.

166
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort,

167
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and with wonderful results like that flight.

168
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span --

169
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell

170
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night,

171
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time.

172
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Music)

173
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Ray Morgan's voice will come in here.

174
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
There he's the project manager. Anything they do

175
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ...

176
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
some things he showed as a celebration at the very end.

177
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.

178
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.

179
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality

180
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts --

181
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Music)

182
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
this is starting --

183
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.

184
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet

185
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
while the plane is flying. And it's exploring

186
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere,

187
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth

188
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and permits life on earth to be the success that it is --

189
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
probing that is very important. And also we consider it

190
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite,

191
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because it can stay right overhead for months at a time,

192
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.

193
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you.

194
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But now let's look at the other end.

195
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane

196
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
surveillance drone that Keenan has developed

197
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos

198
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams,

199
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here

200
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces --

201
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it,

202
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope,

203
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.

204
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So Matt Keenan, just any time you're --

205
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
all right

206
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
-- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure

207
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.

208
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it,

209
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
looking out of its camera.

210
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Matt Keenan: It's switched on.

211
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.

212
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
MK: Can you bring up the house lights?

213
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better

214
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and be able to fly the plane better.

215
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.

216
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Here we go.

217
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Applause)

218
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
PM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it --

219
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
there it goes.

220
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe

221
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps.

222
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
We get to do the classic.

223
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
All right.

224
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
If this hits you, it will not hurt you.

225
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Laughter)

226
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
OK.

227
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Applause)

228
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

229
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
(Applause)

230
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
But now, as they say in infomercials,

231
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
we have something much better for you, which we're working on:

232
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size.

233
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month,

234
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size

235
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly

236
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour

237
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
with just a little battery in it.

238
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
But there's a lot of technology going.

239
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things.

240
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
This one doesn't have the video in it,

241
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
but you get a little feel from what it can do.

242
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
OK, here we go.

243
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Laughter)

244
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
MK: Sorry.

245
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
OK.

246
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Applause)

247
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think --

248
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light.

249
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.

250
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
(Laughter)

251
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
But you're beginning to see what can be done.

252
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
We're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things

253
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
the size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA.

254
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Where all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know.

255
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things

256
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that are way beyond existing technology,

257
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.

258
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
You can do amazing things when you realize

259
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales,

260
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s --

261
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
but when you get down to the nature's realm,

262
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
nature has 200 million years of experience.

263
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake,

264
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
you don't leave any progeny.

265
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
We should have nothing but success stories from nature,

266
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
for you or for birds, and we're learning a lot

267
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
from its fascinating subjects.

268
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
In concluding, I want to get back to the big picture

269
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective.

270
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences

271
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and had it say what I wanted.

272
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted

273
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
a thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful

274
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species,

275
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --

276
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
have grown in population, technology and intelligence

277
0:17:55.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.

278
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom;

279
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?

280
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush.

281
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Every 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one --

282
0:18:14.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger.

283
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates

284
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans

285
0:18:25.33,000 --> 0:18:29,000
with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.

286
0:18:30.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set

287
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
with a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems,

288
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead -- I have no idea.

289
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there,

290
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast.

291
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
This is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it.

292
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years.

293
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Things are going on this decade, next decade;

294
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do.

295
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:11,000
And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be --

296
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age --

297
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning,

298
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:21,000
not a forecast. That was before --

299
0:19:21.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions

300
0:19:26.33,000 --> 0:19:29,000
of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder

301
0:19:30.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted?

302
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth

303
0:19:35.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based.

304
0:19:39.33,000 --> 0:19:44,000
And so where it all goes, I don't know.

305
0:19:45.33,000 --> 0:19:5,000
The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here

306
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:55,000
is an utterly impractical flight vehicle,

307
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:20:01,000
which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that --

308
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
rubber-band powered -- that we'll show you.

309
0:20:12.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.

310
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:27,000
PM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns

311
0:20:27.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram.

312
0:20:32.33,000 --> 0:20:37,000
The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.

313
0:20:38.33,000 --> 0:20:4,000
And if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you.

314
0:20:41.33,000 --> 0:20:44,000
But if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it.

315
0:20:44.33,000 --> 0:20:49,000
So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something.

316
0:20:49.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000
And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes.

317
0:20:55.33,000 --> 0:21:,000
We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.

318
0:21:00.33,000 --> 0:21:05,000
(Applause)

319
0:21:05.33,000 --> 0:21:08,000
And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been --

320
0:21:09.33,000 --> 0:21:15,000
(Laughter)

321
0:21:15.33,000 --> 0:21:21,000
(Applause)

322
0:21:21.33,000 --> 0:21:24,000
Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.

323
0:21:24.33,000 --> 0:21:25,000
We can probably get it down,

324
0:21:25.33,000 --> 0:21:28,000
but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there --

325
0:21:28.33,000 --> 0:21:29,000
(Laughter)

326
0:21:29.33,000 --> 0:21:32,000
-- than it ever had. And I wanted to make --

327
0:21:32.33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
(Applause)

328
0:21:35.33,000 --> 0:21:36,000
just --

329
0:21:36.33,000 --> 0:21:37,000
(Applause)

330
0:21:37.33,000 --> 0:21:43,000
But I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous;

331
0:21:43.33,000 --> 0:21:46,000
there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters

332
0:21:46.33,000 --> 0:21:52,000
like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago --

333
0:21:52.33,000 --> 0:21:54,000
there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor,

334
0:21:54.33,000 --> 0:21:56,000
there wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger,

335
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:21:58,000
there wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate

336
0:21:58.33,000 --> 0:22:01,000
on zero-emission vehicles in California.

337
0:22:01.33,000 --> 0:22:03,000
A lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time,

338
0:22:03.33,000 --> 0:22:06,000
probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time

339
0:22:06.33,000 --> 0:22:1,000
I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams,

340
0:22:10.33,000 --> 0:22:13,000
like they're trying to get in education systems.

341
0:22:13.33,000 --> 0:22:16,000
So I think that, as a symbol, it's important.

342
0:22:16.33,000 --> 0:22:19,000
And I believe that also is important. You can think of it

343
0:22:19.33,000 --> 0:22:26,000
as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED

344
0:22:26.33,000 --> 0:22:3,000
that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature,

345
0:22:31.33,000 --> 0:22:33,000
and puts it all together in things that are --

346
0:22:34.33,000 --> 0:22:36,000
that make this conference, I think, more important than any

347
0:22:36.33,000 --> 0:22:39,000
that's taken place in this country in this decade.

348
0:22:39.33,000 --> 0:22:4,000
Thank you. (Applause)

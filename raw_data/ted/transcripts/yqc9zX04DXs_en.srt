1
0:00:16.109,000 --> 0:00:18,000
First, a video.

2
0:00:24.657,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Yes, it is a scrambled egg.

3
0:00:29.411,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But as you look at it,

4
0:00:30.768,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy.

5
0:00:36.649,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Because you may notice that what's actually happening

6
0:00:40.011,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is that the egg is unscrambling itself.

7
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated.

8
0:00:44.983,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And now they're going to be poured back into the egg.

9
0:00:48.03,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And we all know in our heart of hearts

10
0:00:50.522,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that this is not the way the universe works.

11
0:00:54.696,000 --> 0:00:57,000
A scrambled egg is mush -- tasty mush -- but it's mush.

12
0:00:57.825,000 --> 0:00:59,000
An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing

13
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that can create even more sophisticated things,

14
0:01:02.523,000 --> 0:01:03,000
such as chickens.

15
0:01:04.332,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And we know in our heart of hearts

16
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity.

17
0:01:10.45,000 --> 0:01:12,000
In fact, this gut instinct

18
0:01:12.869,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics,

19
0:01:15.765,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy.

20
0:01:19.162,000 --> 0:01:2,000
What that says basically

21
0:01:20.945,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is that the general tendency of the universe

22
0:01:24.096,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is to move from order and structure

23
0:01:27.723,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to lack of order, lack of structure --

24
0:01:30.411,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in fact, to mush.

25
0:01:31.899,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And that's why that video feels a bit strange.

26
0:01:35.685,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And yet, look around us.

27
0:01:39.454,000 --> 0:01:42,000
What we see around us is staggering complexity.

28
0:01:43.549,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone,

29
0:01:46.862,000 --> 0:01:49,000
there are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded.

30
0:01:50.932,000 --> 0:01:53,000
That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth.

31
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals,

32
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
who are linked by trade, travel, and the Internet

33
0:02:02.669,000 --> 0:02:05,000
into a global system of stupendous complexity.

34
0:02:07.826,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So here's a great puzzle:

35
0:02:10.191,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics,

36
0:02:14.862,000 --> 0:02:15,000
how is it possible

37
0:02:16.69,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to generate the sort of complexity I've described,

38
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the sort of complexity represented by you and me

39
0:02:23.072,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and the convention center?

40
0:02:26.119,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Well, the answer seems to be,

41
0:02:28.096,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the universe can create complexity,

42
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but with great difficulty.

43
0:02:33.87,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In pockets,

44
0:02:34.991,000 --> 0:02:36,000
there appear what my colleague, Fred Spier,

45
0:02:37.332,000 --> 0:02:39,000
calls "Goldilocks conditions" --

46
0:02:39.498,000 --> 0:02:41,000
not too hot, not too cold,

47
0:02:41.573,000 --> 0:02:43,000
just right for the creation of complexity.

48
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And slightly more complex things appear.

49
0:02:46.551,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And where you have slightly more complex things,

50
0:02:48.814,000 --> 0:02:5,000
you can get slightly more complex things.

51
0:02:51.21,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And in this way, complexity builds stage by stage.

52
0:02:56.135,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Each stage is magical

53
0:02:58.437,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because it creates the impression of something utterly new

54
0:03:02.034,000 --> 0:03:04,000
appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe.

55
0:03:04.861,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments.

56
0:03:09.131,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And at each threshold, the going gets tougher.

57
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The complex things get more fragile,

58
0:03:15.526,000 --> 0:03:16,000
more vulnerable;

59
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent,

60
0:03:20.815,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and it's more difficult to create complexity.

61
0:03:24.728,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now, we, as extremely complex creatures,

62
0:03:28.056,000 --> 0:03:3,000
desperately need to know this story

63
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law,

64
0:03:34.942,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility.

65
0:03:40.745,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And that's the story that we tell in big history.

66
0:03:43.689,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But to do it, you have do something

67
0:03:45.42,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that may, at first sight, seem completely impossible.

68
0:03:48.149,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You have to survey the whole history of the universe.

69
0:03:52.748,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So let's do it.

70
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:56.193,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Let's begin by winding the timeline back

72
0:03:59.663,000 --> 0:04:01,000
13.7 billion years,

73
0:04:02.583,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to the beginning of time.

74
0:04:12.581,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Around us, there's nothing.

75
0:04:14.986,000 --> 0:04:16,000
There's not even time or space.

76
0:04:18.474,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Imagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can

77
0:04:22.196,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are.

78
0:04:25.992,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And then suddenly,

79
0:04:28.356,000 --> 0:04:29,000
bang!

80
0:04:29.388,000 --> 0:04:31,000
A universe appears, an entire universe.

81
0:04:31.619,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And we've crossed our first threshold.

82
0:04:33.499,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.

83
0:04:35.896,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's incredibly hot.

84
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It contains everything that's in today's universe,

85
0:04:39.809,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so you can imagine, it's busting.

86
0:04:41.627,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And it's expanding at incredible speed.

87
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And at first, it's just a blur,

88
0:04:46.197,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur.

89
0:04:49.743,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Within the first second,

90
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
energy itself shatters into distinct forces

91
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
including electromagnetism and gravity.

92
0:04:57.366,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And energy does something else quite magical:

93
0:04:59.818,000 --> 0:05:02,000
it congeals to form matter --

94
0:05:03.074,000 --> 0:05:05,000
quarks that will create protons

95
0:05:05.428,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and leptons that include electrons.

96
0:05:07.59,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And all of that happens in the first second.

97
0:05:09.717,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now we move forward 380,000 years.

98
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet.

99
0:05:17.931,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium.

100
0:05:23.877,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now I want to pause for a moment,

101
0:05:25.504,000 --> 0:05:27,000
380,000 years after the origins of the universe,

102
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage.

103
0:05:32.773,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We know above all that it was extremely simple.

104
0:05:35.718,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms,

105
0:05:39.541,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and they have no structure.

106
0:05:41.493,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They're really a sort of cosmic mush.

107
0:05:44.652,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But that's not completely true.

108
0:05:46.732,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Recent studies

109
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
by satellites such as the WMAP satellite

110
0:05:51.145,000 --> 0:05:52,000
have shown that, in fact,

111
0:05:52.746,000 --> 0:05:54,000
there are just tiny differences in that background.

112
0:05:55.519,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What you see here,

113
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler

114
0:06:01.59,000 --> 0:06:02,000
than the red areas.

115
0:06:03.006,000 --> 0:06:04,000
These are tiny differences,

116
0:06:04.403,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but it was enough for the universe to move on

117
0:06:06.697,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to the next stage of building complexity.

118
0:06:08.696,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And this is how it works.

119
0:06:10.895,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff.

120
0:06:15.817,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So where you get slightly denser areas,

121
0:06:18.159,000 --> 0:06:21,000
gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms.

122
0:06:22.1,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds.

123
0:06:25.674,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And each cloud is compacted,

124
0:06:27.5,000 --> 0:06:3,000
gravity gets more powerful as density increases,

125
0:06:30.54,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud,

126
0:06:33.658,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and then, at the center,

127
0:06:34.971,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the temperature crosses the threshold temperature

128
0:06:37.833,000 --> 0:06:38,000
of 10 million degrees,

129
0:06:39.423,000 --> 0:06:41,000
protons start to fuse,

130
0:06:41.852,000 --> 0:06:43,000
there's a huge release of energy,

131
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and --

132
0:06:45.717,000 --> 0:06:46,000
bam!

133
0:06:46.757,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We have our first stars.

134
0:06:48.938,000 --> 0:06:51,000
From about 200 million years after the Big Bang,

135
0:06:52.82,000 --> 0:06:55,000
stars begin to appear all through the universe,

136
0:06:56.251,000 --> 0:06:57,000
billions of them.

137
0:06:57.759,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And the universe is now significantly more interesting

138
0:07:00.639,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and more complex.

139
0:07:03.188,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions

140
0:07:06.328,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for crossing two new thresholds.

141
0:07:08.631,000 --> 0:07:1,000
When very large stars die,

142
0:07:11.234,000 --> 0:07:13,000
they create temperatures so high

143
0:07:13.579,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations,

144
0:07:17.236,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to form all the elements of the periodic table.

145
0:07:20.09,000 --> 0:07:22,000
If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,

146
0:07:22.41,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it was forged in a supernova explosion.

147
0:07:25.878,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So now the universe is chemically more complex.

148
0:07:29.101,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And in a chemically more complex universe,

149
0:07:31.49,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it's possible to make more things.

150
0:07:33.958,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And what starts happening is that, around young suns,

151
0:07:37.474,000 --> 0:07:38,000
young stars,

152
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
all these elements combine, they swirl around,

153
0:07:41.475,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the energy of the star stirs them around,

154
0:07:44.279,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they form particles, they form snowflakes, they form little dust motes,

155
0:07:49.028,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they form rocks, they form asteroids,

156
0:07:51.248,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and eventually, they form planets and moons.

157
0:07:53.867,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And that is how our solar system was formed,

158
0:07:56.841,000 --> 0:07:58,000
four and a half billion years ago.

159
0:08:00.453,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Rocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars

160
0:08:05.85,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because they contain a much greater diversity of materials.

161
0:08:08.636,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity.

162
0:08:12.931,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, the going gets tougher.

163
0:08:16.411,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile,

164
0:08:20.713,000 --> 0:08:21,000
significantly more vulnerable,

165
0:08:22.649,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but they're also much more creative

166
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and much more capable of generating further complexity.

167
0:08:28.606,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I'm talking, of course, about living organisms.

168
0:08:32.734,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Living organisms are created by chemistry.

169
0:08:34.901,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We are huge packages of chemicals.

170
0:08:38.115,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So, chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force.

171
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That operates over smaller scales than gravity,

172
0:08:43.523,000 --> 0:08:46,000
which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets.

173
0:08:48.033,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry?

174
0:08:50.874,000 --> 0:08:51,000
What are the Goldilocks conditions?

175
0:08:52.668,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Well, first, you need energy,

176
0:08:55.049,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but not too much.

177
0:08:56.665,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In the center of a star, there's so much energy

178
0:08:58.944,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again.

179
0:09:02.11,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But not too little.

180
0:09:03.642,000 --> 0:09:04,000
In intergalactic space,

181
0:09:04.897,000 --> 0:09:06,000
there's so little energy that atoms can't combine.

182
0:09:08.378,000 --> 0:09:09,000
What you want is just the right amount,

183
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and planets, it turns out, are just right,

184
0:09:12.284,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because they're close to stars, but not too close.

185
0:09:15.394,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You also need a great diversity of chemical elements,

186
0:09:19.013,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and you need liquids, such as water.

187
0:09:22.045,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Why?

188
0:09:23.116,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Well, in gases, atoms move past each other so fast

189
0:09:27.012,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that they can't hitch up.

190
0:09:28.95,000 --> 0:09:29,000
In solids,

191
0:09:30.696,000 --> 0:09:32,000
atoms are stuck together, they can't move.

192
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
In liquids,

193
0:09:35.002,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they can cruise and cuddle

194
0:09:38.064,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and link up to form molecules.

195
0:09:41.04,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions?

196
0:09:43.934,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Well, planets are great,

197
0:09:45.95,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and our early Earth was almost perfect.

198
0:09:50.037,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It was just the right distance from its star

199
0:09:52.109,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to contain huge oceans of liquid water.

200
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And deep beneath those oceans,

201
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
at cracks in the Earth's crust,

202
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
you've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth,

203
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and you've got a great diversity of elements.

204
0:10:03.411,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So at those deep oceanic vents,

205
0:10:05.981,000 --> 0:10:07,000
fantastic chemistry began to happen,

206
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations.

207
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But of course, life is more than just exotic chemistry.

208
0:10:17.054,000 --> 0:10:2,000
How do you stabilize those huge molecules

209
0:10:20.835,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that seem to be viable?

210
0:10:22.95,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Well, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick.

211
0:10:28.22,000 --> 0:10:3,000
You don't stabilize the individual;

212
0:10:30.779,000 --> 0:10:32,000
you stabilize the template,

213
0:10:32.906,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the thing that carries information,

214
0:10:35.035,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and you allow the template to copy itself.

215
0:10:37.276,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule

216
0:10:40.451,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that contains that information.

217
0:10:42.801,000 --> 0:10:44,000
You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA.

218
0:10:45.64,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Each rung contains information.

219
0:10:48.18,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So, DNA contains information about how to make living organisms.

220
0:10:53.315,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And DNA also copies itself.

221
0:10:55.263,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So, it copies itself

222
0:10:56.493,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and scatters the templates through the ocean.

223
0:10:59.199,000 --> 0:11:,000
So the information spreads.

224
0:11:01.017,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Notice that information has become part of our story.

225
0:11:04.137,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections.

226
0:11:07.806,000 --> 0:11:1,000
As it copies itself, once in every billion rungs,

227
0:11:11.758,000 --> 0:11:12,000
there tends to be an error.

228
0:11:13.527,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And what that means is that DNA is, in effect, learning.

229
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms

230
0:11:21.604,000 --> 0:11:22,000
because some of those errors work.

231
0:11:23.248,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So DNA's learning

232
0:11:24.47,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity.

233
0:11:27.728,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And we can see this happening over the last four billion years.

234
0:11:30.934,000 --> 0:11:32,000
For most of that time of life on Earth,

235
0:11:33.133,000 --> 0:11:35,000
living organisms have been relatively simple --

236
0:11:35.394,000 --> 0:11:36,000
single cells.

237
0:11:36.806,000 --> 0:11:39,000
But they had great diversity, and, inside, great complexity.

238
0:11:40.671,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Then from about 600 to 800 million years ago,

239
0:11:43.599,000 --> 0:11:45,000
multi-celled organisms appear.

240
0:11:45.714,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You get fungi, you get fish,

241
0:11:48.239,000 --> 0:11:49,000
you get plants,

242
0:11:49.778,000 --> 0:11:51,000
you get amphibia, you get reptiles,

243
0:11:52.513,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and then, of course, you get the dinosaurs.

244
0:11:55.999,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And occasionally, there are disasters.

245
0:11:59.586,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Sixty-five million years ago,

246
0:12:01.999,000 --> 0:12:02,000
an asteroid landed on Earth

247
0:12:03.987,000 --> 0:12:04,000
near the Yucatan Peninsula,

248
0:12:05.801,000 --> 0:12:07,000
creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war,

249
0:12:08.793,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and the dinosaurs were wiped out.

250
0:12:11.166,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Terrible news for the dinosaurs,

251
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but great news for our mammalian ancestors,

252
0:12:18.039,000 --> 0:12:19,000
who flourished

253
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.

254
0:12:22.941,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse

255
0:12:28.02,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that began 65 million years ago

256
0:12:30.38,000 --> 0:12:31,000
with the landing of an asteroid.

257
0:12:33.796,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.

258
0:12:36.534,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story.

259
0:12:40.906,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Let me explain why.

260
0:12:42.7,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We've seen that DNA learns in a sense,

261
0:12:45.755,000 --> 0:12:46,000
it accumulates information.

262
0:12:47.566,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But it is so slow.

263
0:12:50.128,000 --> 0:12:53,000
DNA accumulates information through random errors,

264
0:12:53.624,000 --> 0:12:55,000
some of which just happen to work.

265
0:12:56.49,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning:

266
0:12:59.148,000 --> 0:13:01,000
it had produced organisms with brains,

267
0:13:01.95,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and those organisms can learn in real time.

268
0:13:05.193,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They accumulate information, they learn.

269
0:13:07.543,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The sad thing is, when they die,

270
0:13:10.392,000 --> 0:13:11,000
the information dies with them.

271
0:13:12.479,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Now what makes humans different is human language.

272
0:13:16.49,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We are blessed with a language, a system of communication,

273
0:13:19.277,000 --> 0:13:21,000
so powerful and so precise

274
0:13:21.922,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that we can share what we've learned with such precision

275
0:13:25.104,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that it can accumulate in the collective memory.

276
0:13:28.017,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And that means

277
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
it can outlast the individuals who learned that information,

278
0:13:33.063,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and it can accumulate from generation to generation.

279
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And that's why, as a species, we're so creative and so powerful,

280
0:13:40.34,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and that's why we have a history.

281
0:13:43.015,000 --> 0:13:46,000
We seem to be the only species in four billion years

282
0:13:46.34,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to have this gift.

283
0:13:48.057,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I call this ability collective learning.

284
0:13:51.995,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's what makes us different.

285
0:13:53.686,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history.

286
0:13:57.949,000 --> 0:14:,000
We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa,

287
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but then you see humans migrating into new environments,

288
0:14:04.744,000 --> 0:14:06,000
into desert lands, into jungles,

289
0:14:06.918,000 --> 0:14:08,000
into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia --

290
0:14:09.378,000 --> 0:14:1,000
tough, tough environment --

291
0:14:10.847,000 --> 0:14:12,000
into the Americas, into Australasia.

292
0:14:13.204,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Each migration involved learning --

293
0:14:15.265,000 --> 0:14:17,000
learning new ways of exploiting the environment,

294
0:14:17.772,000 --> 0:14:19,000
new ways of dealing with their surroundings.

295
0:14:19.97,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Then 10,000 years ago,

296
0:14:21.81,000 --> 0:14:23,000
exploiting a sudden change in global climate

297
0:14:24.829,000 --> 0:14:25,000
with the end of the last ice age,

298
0:14:26.425,000 --> 0:14:27,000
humans learned to farm.

299
0:14:28.623,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Farming was an energy bonanza.

300
0:14:31.083,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And exploiting that energy, human populations multiplied.

301
0:14:34.934,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Human societies got larger, denser, more interconnected.

302
0:14:39.101,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And then from about 500 years ago,

303
0:14:42.476,000 --> 0:14:44,000
humans began to link up globally

304
0:14:44.539,000 --> 0:14:46,000
through shipping, through trains,

305
0:14:46.944,000 --> 0:14:48,000
through telegraph, through the Internet,

306
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
until now we seem to form a single global brain

307
0:14:54.475,000 --> 0:14:56,000
of almost seven billion individuals.

308
0:14:56.631,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And that brain is learning at warp speed.

309
0:15:00.572,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And in the last 200 years, something else has happened.

310
0:15:03.168,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We've stumbled on another energy bonanza

311
0:15:05.858,000 --> 0:15:06,000
in fossil fuels.

312
0:15:07.009,000 --> 0:15:09,000
So fossil fuels and collective learning together

313
0:15:09.736,000 --> 0:15:12,000
explain the staggering complexity we see around us.

314
0:15:16.505,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So --

315
0:15:18.668,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Here we are,

316
0:15:20.009,000 --> 0:15:21,000
back at the convention center.

317
0:15:21.557,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We've been on a journey, a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.

318
0:15:26.967,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I hope you agree this is a powerful story.

319
0:15:29.46,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role.

320
0:15:34.466,000 --> 0:15:36,000
But it also contains warnings.

321
0:15:37.474,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Collective learning is a very, very powerful force,

322
0:15:41.831,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it.

323
0:15:47.123,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England,

324
0:15:50.216,000 --> 0:15:52,000
living through the Cuban Missile Crisis.

325
0:15:52.847,000 --> 0:15:55,000
For a few days, the entire biosphere

326
0:15:56.482,000 --> 0:15:58,000
seemed to be on the verge of destruction.

327
0:15:59.474,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And the same weapons are still here,

328
0:16:02.663,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and they are still armed.

329
0:16:05.004,000 --> 0:16:08,000
If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us.

330
0:16:08.647,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate

331
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions

332
0:16:14.695,000 --> 0:16:16,000
that made it possible for human civilizations

333
0:16:16.947,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to flourish over the last 10,000 years.

334
0:16:20.633,000 --> 0:16:22,000
So what big history can do

335
0:16:22.933,000 --> 0:16:25,000
is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility

336
0:16:26.278,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and the dangers that face us,

337
0:16:28.226,000 --> 0:16:31,000
but it can also show us our power with collective learning.

338
0:16:32.586,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And now, finally --

339
0:16:35.657,000 --> 0:16:37,000
this is what I want.

340
0:16:39.448,000 --> 0:16:42,000
I want my grandson, Daniel,

341
0:16:42.504,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and his friends and his generation,

342
0:16:45.285,000 --> 0:16:46,000
throughout the world,

343
0:16:47.102,000 --> 0:16:49,000
to know the story of big history,

344
0:16:49.966,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and to know it so well

345
0:16:52.029,000 --> 0:16:55,000
that they understand both the challenges that face us

346
0:16:55.719,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and the opportunities that face us.

347
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And that's why a group of us

348
0:17:00.164,000 --> 0:17:03,000
are building a free, online syllabus

349
0:17:03.2,000 --> 0:17:04,000
in big history

350
0:17:04.542,000 --> 0:17:06,000
for high-school students throughout the world.

351
0:17:07.225,000 --> 0:17:09,000
We believe that big history

352
0:17:09.685,000 --> 0:17:11,000
will be a vital intellectual tool for them,

353
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
as Daniel and his generation

354
0:17:15.127,000 --> 0:17:17,000
face the huge challenges

355
0:17:17.499,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and also the huge opportunities

356
0:17:19.578,000 --> 0:17:22,000
ahead of them at this threshold moment

357
0:17:23.057,000 --> 0:17:26,000
in the history of our beautiful planet.

358
0:17:26.993,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I thank you for your attention.

359
0:17:28.565,000 --> 0:17:32,000
(Applause)

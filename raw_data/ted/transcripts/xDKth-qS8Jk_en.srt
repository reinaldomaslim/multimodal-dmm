1
0:00:12.958,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Do you feel trapped

2
0:00:14.667,000 --> 0:00:16,000
in a broken economic model?

3
0:00:17.083,000 --> 0:00:19,000
A model that's trashing the living world

4
0:00:19.75,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and threatens the lives of our descendants?

5
0:00:23.75,000 --> 0:00:26,000
A model that excludes billions of people

6
0:00:27.708,000 --> 0:00:3,000
while making a handful unimaginably rich?

7
0:00:31.708,000 --> 0:00:34,000
That sorts us into winners and losers,

8
0:00:34.875,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and then blames the losers for their misfortune?

9
0:00:39.417,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Welcome to neoliberalism,

10
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the zombie doctrine that never seems to die,

11
0:00:45.5,000 --> 0:00:48,000
however comprehensively it is discredited.

12
0:00:49.375,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now you might have imagined that the financial crisis of 2008

13
0:00:54.917,000 --> 0:00:57,000
would have led to the collapse of neoliberalism.

14
0:00:57.958,000 --> 0:01:,000
After all, it exposed its central features,

15
0:01:01.542,000 --> 0:01:05,000
which were deregulating business and finance,

16
0:01:06.292,000 --> 0:01:08,000
tearing down public protections,

17
0:01:08.833,000 --> 0:01:11,000
throwing us into extreme competition with each other,

18
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
as, well, just a little bit flawed.

19
0:01:15.667,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And intellectually, it did collapse.

20
0:01:19.792,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But still, it dominates our lives.

21
0:01:24.167,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Why?

22
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Well, I believe the answer is that we have not yet produced

23
0:01:30.167,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a new story with which to replace it.

24
0:01:35.125,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Stories are the means by which we navigate the world.

25
0:01:39.167,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals.

26
0:01:44.125,000 --> 0:01:47,000
When we want to make sense of something,

27
0:01:47.833,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the sense we seek is not scientific sense

28
0:01:52.083,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but narrative fidelity.

29
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Does what we are hearing reflect the way

30
0:01:58.208,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that we expect humans and the world to behave?

31
0:02:02.375,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Does it hang together?

32
0:02:04.5,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Does it progress

33
0:02:06.167,000 --> 0:02:08,000
as a story should progress?

34
0:02:10.458,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, we are creatures of narrative,

35
0:02:13.542,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and a string of facts and figures, however important facts and figures are --

36
0:02:19.583,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and, you know, I'm an empiricist, I believe in facts and figures --

37
0:02:22.792,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but those facts and figures have no power to displace a persuasive story.

38
0:02:29.833,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The only thing that can replace a story

39
0:02:34.583,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is a story.

40
0:02:36.292,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You cannot take away someone's story

41
0:02:38.792,000 --> 0:02:41,000
without giving them a new one.

42
0:02:41.875,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And it's not just stories in general that we are attuned to,

43
0:02:46.333,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but particular narrative structures.

44
0:02:49.875,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There are a number of basic plots that we use again and again,

45
0:02:55.292,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and in politics there is one basic plot

46
0:02:59.917,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which turns out to be tremendously powerful,

47
0:03:04.125,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and I call this "the restoration story."

48
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It goes as follows.

49
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Disorder afflicts the land,

50
0:03:13.542,000 --> 0:03:16,000
caused by powerful and nefarious forces

51
0:03:17.25,000 --> 0:03:19,000
working against the interests of humanity.

52
0:03:20.208,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But the hero will revolt against this disorder,

53
0:03:24.125,000 --> 0:03:26,000
fight those powerful forces,

54
0:03:26.292,000 --> 0:03:28,000
against the odds overthrow them

55
0:03:29.042,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and restore harmony to the land.

56
0:03:33.167,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You've heard this story before.

57
0:03:35.75,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's the Bible story.

58
0:03:37.375,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's the "Harry Potter" story.

59
0:03:39.5,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's the "Lord of the Rings" story.

60
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's the "Narnia" story.

61
0:03:44.583,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But it's also the story

62
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that has accompanied almost every political and religious transformation

63
0:03:52.375,000 --> 0:03:53,000
going back millennia.

64
0:03:54.125,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In fact, we could go as far as to say

65
0:03:56.917,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that without a powerful new restoration story,

66
0:04:02.125,000 --> 0:04:04,000
a political and religious transformation

67
0:04:05.083,000 --> 0:04:06,000
might not be able to happen.

68
0:04:07.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It's that important.

69
0:04:10.25,000 --> 0:04:14,000
After laissez-faire economics triggered the Great Depression,

70
0:04:15.208,000 --> 0:04:2,000
John Maynard Keynes sat down to write a new economics,

71
0:04:20.667,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and what he did was to tell a restoration story,

72
0:04:24.583,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and it went something like this.

73
0:04:27.75,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Disorder afflicts the land!

74
0:04:30.208,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:31.5,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces of the economic elite,

76
0:04:36.208,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which have captured the world's wealth.

77
0:04:39.833,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But the hero of the story,

78
0:04:42.208,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the enabling state, supported by working class and middle class people,

79
0:04:47.917,000 --> 0:04:49,000
will contest that disorder,

80
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:54,000
will fight those powerful forces by redistributing wealth,

81
0:04:54.583,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and through spending public money on public goods

82
0:04:58.292,000 --> 0:05:01,000
will generate income and jobs,

83
0:05:01.458,000 --> 0:05:04,000
restoring harmony to the land.

84
0:05:05.125,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now like all good restoration stories,

85
0:05:07.5,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this one resonated across the political spectrum.

86
0:05:11.042,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Democrats and Republicans, labor and conservatives,

87
0:05:14.958,000 --> 0:05:17,000
left and right all became, broadly, Keynesian.

88
0:05:19.708,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Then, when Keynesianism ran into trouble

89
0:05:22.25,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in the 1970s,

90
0:05:24.333,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the neoliberals, people like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman,

91
0:05:28.708,000 --> 0:05:31,000
came forward with their new restoration story,

92
0:05:32.083,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it went something like this.

93
0:05:34.917,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You'll never guess what's coming.

94
0:05:36.542,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:37.833,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Disorder afflicts the land!

96
0:05:40.667,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces

97
0:05:45.208,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of the overmighty state,

98
0:05:47.708,000 --> 0:05:51,000
whose collectivizing tendencies crush freedom and individualism

99
0:05:52.458,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and opportunity.

100
0:05:54.125,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But the hero of the story, the entrepreneur,

101
0:05:57.333,000 --> 0:06:,000
will fight those powerful forces,

102
0:06:00.625,000 --> 0:06:01,000
roll back the state,

103
0:06:02.333,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and through creating wealth and opportunity,

104
0:06:05.625,000 --> 0:06:08,000
restore harmony to the land.

105
0:06:08.917,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And that story also resonated across the political spectrum.

106
0:06:13.542,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and labor,

107
0:06:16.625,000 --> 0:06:19,000
they all became, broadly, neoliberal.

108
0:06:22.583,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Opposite stories

109
0:06:25.333,000 --> 0:06:28,000
with an identical narrative structure.

110
0:06:29.917,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Then, in 2008,

111
0:06:32.917,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the neoliberal story fell apart,

112
0:06:35.25,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and its opponents came forward with ...

113
0:06:41.083,000 --> 0:06:42,000
nothing.

114
0:06:42.667,000 --> 0:06:44,000
No new restoration story!

115
0:06:45.458,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The best they had to offer was a watered-down neoliberalism

116
0:06:48.958,000 --> 0:06:5,000
or a microwaved Keynesianism.

117
0:06:53.125,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And that is why we're stuck.

118
0:06:56.542,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Without that new story,

119
0:06:58.667,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we are stuck with the old failed story

120
0:07:01.958,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that keeps on failing.

121
0:07:04.833,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Despair is the state we fall into

122
0:07:08.5,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when our imagination fails.

123
0:07:11.5,000 --> 0:07:15,000
When we have no story that explains the present

124
0:07:15.667,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and describes the future,

125
0:07:18.083,000 --> 0:07:2,000
hope evaporates.

126
0:07:21.083,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Political failure is at heart

127
0:07:24.083,000 --> 0:07:26,000
a failure of imagination.

128
0:07:27.792,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Without a restoration story

129
0:07:30.875,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that can tell us where we need to go,

130
0:07:33.792,000 --> 0:07:35,000
nothing is going to change,

131
0:07:35.875,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but with such a restoration story,

132
0:07:38.708,000 --> 0:07:4,000
almost everything can change.

133
0:07:42.917,000 --> 0:07:44,000
The story we need to tell

134
0:07:45.667,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is a story which will appeal to as wide a range of people as possible,

135
0:07:49.333,000 --> 0:07:51,000
crossing political fault lines.

136
0:07:51.833,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It should resonate with deep needs and desires.

137
0:07:55.417,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It should be simple and intelligible,

138
0:07:58.625,000 --> 0:08:,000
and it should be grounded in reality.

139
0:08:01.417,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now, I admit that all of this sounds like a bit of a tall order.

140
0:08:06.542,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But I believe that in Western nations,

141
0:08:08.417,000 --> 0:08:11,000
there is actually a story like this

142
0:08:11.792,000 --> 0:08:12,000
waiting to be told.

143
0:08:14.833,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Over the past few years,

144
0:08:16.167,000 --> 0:08:19,000
there's been a fascinating convergence of findings

145
0:08:19.625,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in several different sciences,

146
0:08:21.292,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in psychology and anthropology and neuroscience and evolutionary biology,

147
0:08:26.375,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and they all tell us something pretty amazing:

148
0:08:30.083,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that human beings have got this massive capacity for altruism.

149
0:08:35.375,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Sure, we all have a bit of selfishness and greed inside us,

150
0:08:39.417,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but in most people, those are not our dominant values.

151
0:08:44.417,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And we also turn out to be the supreme cooperators.

152
0:08:48.667,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We survived the African savannas,

153
0:08:50.792,000 --> 0:08:55,000
despite being weaker and slower than our predators and most of our prey,

154
0:08:56.417,000 --> 0:09:01,000
by an amazing ability to engage in mutual aid,

155
0:09:01.708,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and that urge to cooperate has been hardwired into our minds

156
0:09:06.917,000 --> 0:09:08,000
through natural selection.

157
0:09:08.958,000 --> 0:09:12,000
These are the central, crucial facts about humankind:

158
0:09:13.833,000 --> 0:09:16,000
our amazing altruism and cooperation.

159
0:09:18.708,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But something has gone horribly wrong.

160
0:09:22.375,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Disorder afflicts the land.

161
0:09:24.625,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

162
0:09:27.25,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Our good nature has been thwarted by several forces,

163
0:09:30.333,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but I think the most powerful of them is the dominant political narrative

164
0:09:34.625,000 --> 0:09:35,000
of our times,

165
0:09:36.375,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which tells us that we should live in extreme individualism

166
0:09:42.667,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and competition with each other.

167
0:09:45.208,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It pushes us to fight each other, to fear and mistrust each other.

168
0:09:50.833,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It atomizes society.

169
0:09:52.542,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It weakens the social bonds that make our lives worth living.

170
0:09:58.042,000 --> 0:10:,000
And into that vacuum

171
0:10:01.042,000 --> 0:10:06,000
grow these violent, intolerant forces.

172
0:10:06.167,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We are a society of altruists,

173
0:10:10.042,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but we are governed by psychopaths.

174
0:10:12.25,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause)

175
0:10:21.125,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But it doesn't have to be like this.

176
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It really doesn't,

177
0:10:24.333,000 --> 0:10:28,000
because we have this incredible capacity for togetherness and belonging,

178
0:10:28.792,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and by invoking that capacity,

179
0:10:30.75,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we can recover those amazing components of our humanity:

180
0:10:35.917,000 --> 0:10:38,000
our altruism and cooperation.

181
0:10:39.083,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Where there is atomization, we can build a thriving civic life

182
0:10:44.25,000 --> 0:10:46,000
with a rich participatory culture.

183
0:10:47.25,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Where we find ourselves crushed between market and state,

184
0:10:51.333,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we can build an economics that respects both people and planet.

185
0:10:57.208,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And we can create this economics around that great neglected sphere,

186
0:11:02.583,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the commons.

187
0:11:03.958,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The commons is neither market nor state, capitalism nor communism,

188
0:11:08.417,000 --> 0:11:1,000
but it consists of three main elements:

189
0:11:10.833,000 --> 0:11:11,000
a particular resource;

190
0:11:12.708,000 --> 0:11:15,000
a particular community that manages that resource;

191
0:11:15.917,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and the rules and negotiations the community develops to manage it.

192
0:11:21.167,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Think of community broadband or community energy cooperatives

193
0:11:25.458,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or the shared land for growing fruit and vegetables

194
0:11:28.667,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that in Britain we call allotments.

195
0:11:31.458,000 --> 0:11:34,000
A common can't be sold, it can't be given away,

196
0:11:34.5,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and its benefits are shared equally among the members of the community.

197
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Where we have been ignored and exploited,

198
0:11:43.667,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we can revive our politics.

199
0:11:45.625,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We can recover democracy from the people who have captured it.

200
0:11:50.167,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We can use new rules and methods of elections

201
0:11:53.542,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to ensure that financial power never trumps democratic power again.

202
0:11:59.708,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Applause)

203
0:12:06.417,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Representative democracy should be tempered by participatory democracy

204
0:12:11.417,000 --> 0:12:13,000
so that we can refine our political choices,

205
0:12:14.292,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and that choice should be exercised as much as possible at the local level.

206
0:12:19.458,000 --> 0:12:24,000
If something can be decided locally, it shouldn't be determined nationally.

207
0:12:26.125,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And I call all this the politics of belonging.

208
0:12:31.358,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Now, I think this has got the potential to appeal

209
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
across quite a wide range of people,

210
0:12:37.667,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and the reason for this is that among the very few values

211
0:12:41.292,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that both left and right share

212
0:12:44.333,000 --> 0:12:47,000
are belonging and community.

213
0:12:47.708,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And we might mean slightly different things by them,

214
0:12:50.208,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but at least we start with some language in common.

215
0:12:53.25,000 --> 0:12:58,000
In fact, you can see a lot of politics as being a search for belonging.

216
0:12:58.375,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Even fascists seek community,

217
0:13:01.583,000 --> 0:13:04,000
albeit a frighteningly homogenous community

218
0:13:04.667,000 --> 0:13:06,000
where everyone looks the same and wears the same uniform

219
0:13:07.333,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and chants the same slogans.

220
0:13:09.917,000 --> 0:13:13,000
What we need to create is a community based on bridging networks,

221
0:13:14.375,000 --> 0:13:15,000
not bonding networks.

222
0:13:15.875,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Now a bonding network brings together people from a homogenous group,

223
0:13:20.292,000 --> 0:13:24,000
whereas a bridging network brings together people from different groups.

224
0:13:24.833,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And my belief is that if we create

225
0:13:26.833,000 --> 0:13:3,000
sufficiently rich and vibrant bridging communities,

226
0:13:31.542,000 --> 0:13:35,000
we can thwart the urge for people to burrow into the security

227
0:13:36.5,000 --> 0:13:38,000
of a homogenous bonding community

228
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
defending themselves against the other.

229
0:13:43.583,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So in summary,

230
0:13:45.583,000 --> 0:13:48,000
our new story could go something like this.

231
0:13:50.667,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Disorder afflicts the land!

232
0:13:53.083,000 --> 0:13:54,000
(Laughter)

233
0:13:54.125,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces

234
0:13:56.5,000 --> 0:14:,000
of people who say there's no such thing as society,

235
0:14:00.542,000 --> 0:14:03,000
who tell us that our highest purpose in life

236
0:14:03.917,000 --> 0:14:06,000
is to fight like stray dogs over a dustbin.

237
0:14:08.708,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But the heroes of the story, us,

238
0:14:11.75,000 --> 0:14:13,000
we'll revolt against this disorder.

239
0:14:14.458,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We will fight those nefarious forces by building rich, engaging,

240
0:14:20.083,000 --> 0:14:22,000
inclusive and generous communities,

241
0:14:22.792,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and, in doing so,

242
0:14:24.417,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we will restore harmony to the land.

243
0:14:27.125,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Applause)

244
0:14:34.625,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Now whether or not you feel this is the right story,

245
0:14:38.208,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I hope you'll agree that we need one.

246
0:14:40.625,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We need a new restoration story,

247
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:47,000
which is going to guide us out of the mess we're in,

248
0:14:47.125,000 --> 0:14:51,000
which tells us why we're in the mess and tells us how to get out of that mess.

249
0:14:52.542,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And that story, if we tell it right,

250
0:14:55.667,000 --> 0:14:59,000
will infect the minds of people across the political spectrum.

251
0:15:00.667,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Our task is to tell the story that lights the path to a better world.

252
0:15:06.458,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Thank you.

253
0:15:07.75,000 --> 0:15:1,000
(Applause)

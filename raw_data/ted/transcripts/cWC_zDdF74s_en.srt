0:00:16.219,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal

3
0:00:18.977,000 --> 0:00:21,000
started for me when I was 15 years old.

4
0:00:21.995,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.

5
0:00:24.516,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I started to feed them in the most traditional

6
0:00:26.899,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and environmentally friendly way.

7
0:00:28.87,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I went to my school kitchen, and I said,

8
0:00:31.195,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned

9
0:00:32.741,000 --> 0:00:32,000
their noses up at."

10
0:00:33.607,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I went to the local baker and took their stale bread.

11
0:00:36.271,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer

12
0:00:39.003,000 --> 0:00:4,000
who was throwing away potatoes because they were

13
0:00:40.841,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the wrong shape or size for supermarkets.

14
0:00:44.027,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This was great. My pigs turned that food waste

15
0:00:47.116,000 --> 0:00:49,000
into delicious pork. I sold that pork

16
0:00:49.773,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to my school friends' parents, and I made

17
0:00:51.76,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.

18
0:00:56.397,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs

19
0:00:59.279,000 --> 0:01:01,000
was in fact fit for human consumption,

20
0:01:01.662,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and that I was only scratching the surface,

21
0:01:03.931,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and that right the way up the food supply chain,

22
0:01:06.793,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes,

23
0:01:10.011,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.

24
0:01:13.271,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me

25
0:01:15.868,000 --> 0:01:16,000
about how much food they were wasting.

26
0:01:17.242,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food

27
0:01:19.726,000 --> 0:01:21,000
being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites,

28
0:01:22.477,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I thought, surely there is something more sensible

29
0:01:25.498,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to do with food than waste it.

30
0:01:28.665,000 --> 0:01:3,000
One morning, when I was feeding my pigs,

31
0:01:30.97,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf

32
0:01:34.657,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that used to crop up from time to time.

33
0:01:36.732,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I grabbed hold of it,

34
0:01:38.134,000 --> 0:01:41,000
sat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs. (Laughter)

35
0:01:41.68,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism,

36
0:01:44.8,000 --> 0:01:48,000
really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste,

37
0:01:49.055,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and the provision of the solution to food waste,

38
0:01:51.405,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which is simply to sit down and eat food,

39
0:01:54.059,000 --> 0:01:55,000
rather than throwing it away.

40
0:01:55.547,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That became, as it were, a way of confronting

41
0:01:58.826,000 --> 0:02:,000
large businesses in the business of wasting food,

42
0:02:01.813,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and exposing, most importantly, to the public,

43
0:02:04.334,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that when we're talking about food being thrown away,

44
0:02:06.504,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about

45
0:02:08.643,000 --> 0:02:1,000
stuff that's beyond the pale.

46
0:02:11.355,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted

47
0:02:13.471,000 --> 0:02:15,000
on a colossal scale.

48
0:02:16.009,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Eventually, I set about writing my book,

49
0:02:17.866,000 --> 0:02:19,000
really to demonstrate the extent of this problem

50
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:22,000
on a global scale. What this shows is

51
0:02:23.316,000 --> 0:02:26,000
a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level

52
0:02:26.795,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of food waste in each country in the world.

53
0:02:29.897,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist,

54
0:02:33.785,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find

55
0:02:36.267,000 --> 0:02:38,000
some proxy way of uncovering

56
0:02:38.42,000 --> 0:02:4,000
how much food was being wasted.

57
0:02:40.665,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So I took the food supply of every single country

58
0:02:43.221,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and I compared it to what was actually likely

59
0:02:46.263,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to be being consumed in each country.

60
0:02:48.295,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on

61
0:02:52.182,000 --> 0:02:54,000
levels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors

62
0:02:54.848,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that gives you an approximate guess

63
0:02:56.19,000 --> 0:02:59,000
as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths.

64
0:02:59.417,000 --> 0:03:01,000
That black line in the middle of that table

65
0:03:02.146,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is the likely level of consumption

66
0:03:05.142,000 --> 0:03:09,000
with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste.

67
0:03:09.504,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic

68
0:03:11.423,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that I think we can live in a waste-free world.

69
0:03:13.403,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But that black line shows what a food supply should be

70
0:03:17.276,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in a country if they allow for a good, stable, secure,

71
0:03:21.73,000 --> 0:03:24,000
nutritional diet for every person in that country.

72
0:03:25.479,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Any dot above that line, and you'll quickly notice that

73
0:03:27.886,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that includes most countries in the world,

74
0:03:30.587,000 --> 0:03:34,000
represents unnecessary surplus, and is likely to reflect

75
0:03:34.876,000 --> 0:03:36,000
levels of waste in each country.

76
0:03:37.498,000 --> 0:03:4,000
As a country gets richer, it invests more and more

77
0:03:40.767,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in getting more and more surplus

78
0:03:42.058,000 --> 0:03:44,000
into its shops and restaurants,

79
0:03:44.868,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and as you can see, most European

80
0:03:46.924,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and North American countries

81
0:03:48.336,000 --> 0:03:51,000
fall between 150 and 200 percent

82
0:03:51.476,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of the nutritional requirements of their populations.

83
0:03:54.856,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So a country like America has twice as much food

84
0:03:57.264,000 --> 0:03:59,000
on its shop shelves and in its restaurants

85
0:03:59.868,000 --> 0:04:02,000
than is actually required to feed the American people.

86
0:04:03.436,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But the thing that really struck me,

87
0:04:04.996,000 --> 0:04:08,000
when I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers,

88
0:04:09.211,000 --> 0:04:12,000
was that you can see how it levels off.

89
0:04:12.877,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark,

90
0:04:15.945,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and then they level off, and they don't really go on rising

91
0:04:19.233,000 --> 0:04:2,000
as you might expect.

92
0:04:20.779,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further

93
0:04:23.324,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to see if that was true or false.

94
0:04:25.609,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And that's what I came up with.

95
0:04:27.103,000 --> 0:04:28,000
If you include not just the food that ends up

96
0:04:29.03,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in shops and restaurants, but also the food

97
0:04:31.154,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that people feed to livestock,

98
0:04:33.31,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat

99
0:04:36.813,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce

100
0:04:39.294,000 --> 0:04:4,000
increasing amounts of meat and dairy products,

101
0:04:41.225,000 --> 0:04:42,000
what you find is that most rich countries

102
0:04:42.892,000 --> 0:04:46,000
have between three and four times the amount of food

103
0:04:47.215,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that their population needs to feed itself.

104
0:04:50.299,000 --> 0:04:53,000
A country like America has four times the amount of food

105
0:04:53.582,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that it needs.

106
0:04:56.544,000 --> 0:04:58,000
When people talk about the need to increase global

107
0:04:59.506,000 --> 0:05:01,000
food production to feed those nine billion people

108
0:05:02.166,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that are expected on the planet by 2050,

109
0:05:04.678,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I always think of these graphs.

110
0:05:06.399,000 --> 0:05:08,000
The fact is, we have an enormous buffer

111
0:05:09.35,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in rich countries between ourselves and hunger.

112
0:05:13.231,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.

113
0:05:17.907,000 --> 0:05:19,000
In many ways, this is a great success story

114
0:05:20.573,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses

115
0:05:24.712,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.

116
0:05:28.065,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It is a success story. It has been a success story.

117
0:05:31.622,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But what we have to recognize now is that we are

118
0:05:34.159,000 --> 0:05:37,000
reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear,

119
0:05:37.791,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and when we chop down forests, as we are every day,

120
0:05:40.428,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to grow more and more food,

121
0:05:41.776,000 --> 0:05:44,000
when we extract water from depleting water reserves,

122
0:05:45.524,000 --> 0:05:48,000
when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest

123
0:05:48.912,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to grow more and more food,

124
0:05:50.204,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and then we throw away so much of it,

125
0:05:53.055,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we have to think about what we can start saving.

126
0:05:55.991,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets

127
0:05:59.716,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that I often visit to

128
0:06:01.932,000 --> 0:06:05,000
inspect, if you like, what they're throwing away.

129
0:06:06.113,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst

130
0:06:08.516,000 --> 0:06:09,000
all the fruit and vegetables and everything else

131
0:06:10.143,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that was in there.

132
0:06:11.09,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today.

133
0:06:13.53,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits

134
0:06:15.965,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that I found in the bin represent the global food supply,

135
0:06:19.493,000 --> 0:06:2,000
okay? We start out with nine.

136
0:06:21.094,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That's what's in fields around the world every single year.

137
0:06:24.577,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The first biscuit we're going to lose

138
0:06:26.338,000 --> 0:06:27,000
before we even leave the farm.

139
0:06:28.097,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That's a problem primarily associated with

140
0:06:31.362,000 --> 0:06:32,000
developing work agriculture, whether it's

141
0:06:33.026,000 --> 0:06:35,000
a lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization,

142
0:06:35.531,000 --> 0:06:37,000
grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means

143
0:06:38.444,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.

144
0:06:42.193,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide

145
0:06:45.689,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.

146
0:06:49.429,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals,

147
0:06:54.273,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat,

148
0:06:58.448,000 --> 0:07:,000
so we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one

149
0:07:01.066,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in meat and dairy products.

150
0:07:03.3,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins.

151
0:07:06.884,000 --> 0:07:07,000
This is what most of us think of when we think

152
0:07:08.437,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of food waste, what ends up in the garbage,

153
0:07:10.948,000 --> 0:07:11,000
what ends up in supermarket bins,

154
0:07:12.796,000 --> 0:07:14,000
what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two,

155
0:07:15.526,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on.

156
0:07:19.284,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources,

157
0:07:23.083,000 --> 0:07:25,000
especially when you think of the billion hungry people

158
0:07:25.543,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that exist already in the world.

159
0:07:27.683,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Having gone through the data, I then needed

160
0:07:29.666,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to demonstrate where that food ends up.

161
0:07:33.344,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Where does it end up? We're used to seeing the stuff

162
0:07:34.963,000 --> 0:07:35,000
on our plates, but what about all the stuff

163
0:07:36.866,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that goes missing in between?

164
0:07:38.806,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Supermarkets are an easy place to start.

165
0:07:41.218,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is the result of my hobby,

166
0:07:43.809,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which is unofficial bin inspections. (Laughter)

167
0:07:48.285,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Strange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations

168
0:07:50.882,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores,

169
0:07:53.99,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back,

170
0:07:56.474,000 --> 0:07:58,000
opening up bins and having a look at what's inside.

171
0:07:59.03,000 --> 0:08:,000
But this is what you can see more or less on

172
0:08:00.99,000 --> 0:08:03,000
every street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.

173
0:08:04.502,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It represents a colossal waste of food,

174
0:08:07.568,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book

175
0:08:10.07,000 --> 0:08:13,000
was that this very evident abundance of waste

176
0:08:13.414,000 --> 0:08:15,000
was actually the tip of the iceberg.

177
0:08:16.358,000 --> 0:08:18,000
When you start going up the supply chain,

178
0:08:18.414,000 --> 0:08:2,000
you find where the real food waste is happening

179
0:08:21.4,000 --> 0:08:22,000
on a gargantuan scale.

180
0:08:23.387,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Can I have a show of hands

181
0:08:24.86,000 --> 0:08:28,000
if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house?

182
0:08:29.318,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Who lives in a household where that crust --

183
0:08:31.237,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that slice at the first and last end of each loaf --

184
0:08:34.43,000 --> 0:08:36,000
who lives in a household where it does get eaten?

185
0:08:36.874,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Okay, most people, not everyone, but most people,

186
0:08:39.241,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world,

187
0:08:41.697,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop

188
0:08:44.486,000 --> 0:08:46,000
anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches

189
0:08:46.722,000 --> 0:08:47,000
with crusts on it? (Laughter)

190
0:08:48.496,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I certainly haven't.

191
0:08:50.079,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go? (Laughter)

192
0:08:55.247,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This is the answer, unfortunately:

193
0:08:57.462,000 --> 0:08:58,000
13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of

194
0:08:59.374,000 --> 0:09:04,000
this one single factory every single day, day-fresh bread.

195
0:09:04.975,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In the same year that I visited this factory,

196
0:09:06.484,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I went to Pakistan, where people in 2008 were going hungry

197
0:09:10.934,000 --> 0:09:13,000
as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies.

198
0:09:14.711,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We contribute to that squeeze

199
0:09:16.895,000 --> 0:09:18,000
by depositing food in bins here in Britain

200
0:09:19.887,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and elsewhere in the world. We take food

201
0:09:22.094,000 --> 0:09:25,000
off the market shelves that hungry people depend on.

202
0:09:25.2,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Go one step up, and you get to farmers,

203
0:09:27.75,000 --> 0:09:29,000
who throw away sometimes a third or even more

204
0:09:29.91,000 --> 0:09:31,000
of their harvest because of cosmetic standards.

205
0:09:31.955,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This farmer, for example, has invested 16,000 pounds

206
0:09:34.878,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in growing spinach, not one leaf of which he harvested,

207
0:09:38.302,000 --> 0:09:4,000
because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it.

208
0:09:40.756,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect,

209
0:09:43.236,000 --> 0:09:44,000
all going for pigs.

210
0:09:44.769,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications,

211
0:09:48.807,000 --> 0:09:5,000
tomatoes in Tenerife,

212
0:09:50.823,000 --> 0:09:51,000
oranges in Florida,

213
0:09:52.628,000 --> 0:09:55,000
bananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year,

214
0:09:55.632,000 --> 0:09:57,000
all being discarded. This is one day's waste

215
0:09:58.047,000 --> 0:10:,000
from one banana plantation in Ecuador.

216
0:10:00.584,000 --> 0:10:02,000
All being discarded, perfectly edible,

217
0:10:02.792,000 --> 0:10:04,000
because they're the wrong shape or size.

218
0:10:05.28,000 --> 0:10:06,000
If we do that to fruit and vegetables,

219
0:10:06.86,000 --> 0:10:08,000
you bet we can do it to animals too.

220
0:10:09.675,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Liver, lungs, heads, tails,

221
0:10:12.414,000 --> 0:10:13,000
kidneys, testicles,

222
0:10:14.392,000 --> 0:10:15,000
all of these things which are traditional,

223
0:10:16.105,000 --> 0:10:18,000
delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy

224
0:10:18.92,000 --> 0:10:21,000
go to waste. Offal consumption has halved

225
0:10:22.416,000 --> 0:10:24,000
in Britain and America in the last 30 years.

226
0:10:24.951,000 --> 0:10:26,000
As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best,

227
0:10:27.591,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or is incinerated.

228
0:10:29.36,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China,

229
0:10:33.207,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is serving up his national dish.

230
0:10:35.122,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's called sheep's organs.

231
0:10:36.837,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's delicious, it's nutritious,

232
0:10:38.504,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and as I learned when I went to Kashgar,

233
0:10:40.912,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it symbolizes their taboo against food waste.

234
0:10:43.981,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I was sitting in a roadside cafe.

235
0:10:46.177,000 --> 0:10:48,000
A chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl,

236
0:10:48.781,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking

237
0:10:50.546,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and he started frowning into my bowl.

238
0:10:53.112,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken?

239
0:10:54.991,000 --> 0:10:55,000
How have I insulted my host?"

240
0:10:56.585,000 --> 0:10:57,000
He pointed at three grains of rice

241
0:10:58.323,000 --> 0:11:02,000
at the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean." (Laughter)

242
0:11:02.607,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world

243
0:11:04.519,000 --> 0:11:05,000
telling people to stop wasting food.

244
0:11:05.935,000 --> 0:11:1,000
This guy has thrashed me at my own game." (Laughter)

245
0:11:10.984,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people,

246
0:11:14.207,000 --> 0:11:19,000
do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources

247
0:11:19.243,000 --> 0:11:21,000
if we regard it as socially unacceptable

248
0:11:21.443,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to waste food on a colossal scale,

249
0:11:22.947,000 --> 0:11:24,000
if we make noise about it, tell corporations about it,

250
0:11:25.515,000 --> 0:11:27,000
tell governments we want to see an end to food waste,

251
0:11:28.135,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we do have the power to bring about that change.

252
0:11:30.631,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Fish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish

253
0:11:33.343,000 --> 0:11:36,000
are discarded at sea, they don't even get landed.

254
0:11:36.424,000 --> 0:11:38,000
In our homes, we've lost touch with food.

255
0:11:39.116,000 --> 0:11:41,000
This is an experiment I did on three lettuces.

256
0:11:42.033,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Who keeps lettuces in their fridge?

257
0:11:44.671,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Most people. The one on the left

258
0:11:48.247,000 --> 0:11:49,000
was kept in a fridge for 10 days.

259
0:11:49.7,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference.

260
0:11:51.919,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The one on the right I treated like cut flowers.

261
0:11:54.494,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It's a living organism, cut the slice off,

262
0:11:56.676,000 --> 0:11:57,000
stuck it in a vase of water,

263
0:11:58.119,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it was all right for another two weeks after this.

264
0:12:01.667,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Some food waste, as I said at the beginning,

265
0:12:03.626,000 --> 0:12:04,000
will inevitably arise, so the question is,

266
0:12:05.458,000 --> 0:12:07,000
what is the best thing to do with it?

267
0:12:07.656,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I answered that question when I was 15.

268
0:12:09.162,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago:

269
0:12:14.572,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We domesticated pigs

270
0:12:16.784,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to turn food waste back into food.

271
0:12:19.556,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal

272
0:12:23.287,000 --> 0:12:26,000
since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.

273
0:12:26.574,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's unscientific. It's unnecessary.

274
0:12:28.475,000 --> 0:12:3,000
If you cook food for pigs, just as if

275
0:12:31.158,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.

276
0:12:34.127,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It's also a massive saving of resources.

277
0:12:36.687,000 --> 0:12:38,000
At the moment, Europe depends on importing

278
0:12:39.582,000 --> 0:12:4,000
millions of tons of soy from South America,

279
0:12:41.248,000 --> 0:12:43,000
where its production contributes to global warming,

280
0:12:44.134,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to deforestation, to biodiversity loss,

281
0:12:46.734,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to feed livestock here in Europe.

282
0:12:49.181,000 --> 0:12:51,000
At the same time we throw away millions of tons

283
0:12:51.483,000 --> 0:12:54,000
of food waste which we could and should be feeding them.

284
0:12:54.702,000 --> 0:12:56,000
If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save

285
0:12:57.564,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that amount of carbon.

286
0:12:59.915,000 --> 0:13:02,000
If we feed our food waste which is the current

287
0:13:03.007,000 --> 0:13:05,000
government favorite way of getting rid of food waste,

288
0:13:05.302,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste

289
0:13:08.103,000 --> 0:13:1,000
into gas to produce electricity,

290
0:13:10.407,000 --> 0:13:13,000
you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide

291
0:13:14.14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.

292
0:13:16.622,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We knew that during the war. (Laughter)

293
0:13:19.882,000 --> 0:13:23,000
A silver lining: It has kicked off globally,

294
0:13:24.156,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the quest to tackle food waste.

295
0:13:25.926,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Feeding the 5,000 is an event I first organized in 2009.

296
0:13:29.78,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise

297
0:13:32.036,000 --> 0:13:33,000
would have been wasted.

298
0:13:33.434,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Since then, it's happened again in London,

299
0:13:35.734,000 --> 0:13:37,000
it's happening internationally, and across the country.

300
0:13:37.867,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It's a way of organizations coming together

301
0:13:40.21,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to celebrate food, to say the best thing to do with food

302
0:13:43.952,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it.

303
0:13:46.759,000 --> 0:13:48,000
For the sake of the planet we live on,

304
0:13:49.352,000 --> 0:13:52,000
for the sake of our children,

305
0:13:52.632,000 --> 0:13:53,000
for the sake of all the other

306
0:13:54.202,000 --> 0:13:56,000
organisms that share our planet with us,

307
0:13:56.65,000 --> 0:13:59,000
we are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land

308
0:13:59.691,000 --> 0:14:01,000
for food. At the moment, we are trashing our land

309
0:14:02.313,000 --> 0:14:04,000

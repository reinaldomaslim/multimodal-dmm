1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I heard those bars

2
0:00:16.36,000 --> 0:00:17,000
slam hard,

3
0:00:20.119,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I knew it was for real.

4
0:00:23.52,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I feel confused.

5
0:00:26.48,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I feel betrayed.

6
0:00:29.88,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I feel overwhelmed.

7
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I feel silenced.

8
0:00:37.76,000 --> 0:00:38,000
What just happened?

9
0:00:40.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
How could they send me here?

10
0:00:44.04,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I don't belong here.

11
0:00:47.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
How could they make such a huge mistake

12
0:00:51.28,000 --> 0:00:55,000
without any repercussions whatsoever to their actions?

13
0:00:57.08,000 --> 0:01:,000
I see large groups of women

14
0:01:00.52,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in tattered uniforms

15
0:01:02.88,000 --> 0:01:06,000
surrounded by huge walls and gates,

16
0:01:07.44,000 --> 0:01:1,000
enclosed by iron barbed wires,

17
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I get hit by an awful stench,

18
0:01:14.88,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I ask myself,

19
0:01:17.519,000 --> 0:01:18,000
how did I move

20
0:01:20.32,000 --> 0:01:24,000
from working in the respected financial banking sector,

21
0:01:26.12,000 --> 0:01:29,000
having worked so hard in school,

22
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to now being locked up

23
0:01:32.6,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in the largest correctional facility

24
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for women in Kenya?

25
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:41,000
My first night

26
0:01:41.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
at Langata Women Maximum Security Prison

27
0:01:45.84,000 --> 0:01:46,000
was the toughest.

28
0:01:48.4,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In January of 2009,

29
0:01:51.48,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I was informed that I had handled a fraudulent transaction unknowingly

30
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
at the bank where I worked.

31
0:01:58.68,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I was shocked, scared and terrified.

32
0:02:03.32,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I would lose a career that I loved passionately.

33
0:02:09.32,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But that was not the worst.

34
0:02:12.4,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It got even worse than I could have ever imagined.

35
0:02:17.92,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I got arrested,

36
0:02:20.44,000 --> 0:02:22,000
maliciously charged

37
0:02:22.6,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and prosecuted.

38
0:02:26.44,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The absurdity of it all was the arresting officer

39
0:02:31.04,000 --> 0:02:36,000
asking me to pay him 10,000 US dollars

40
0:02:36.2,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and the case would disappear.

41
0:02:39.84,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I refused.

42
0:02:42.56,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Two and a half years on,

43
0:02:45.32,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in and out of courts,

44
0:02:47.08,000 --> 0:02:5,000
fighting to prove my innocence.

45
0:02:50.56,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It was all over the media,

46
0:02:53.56,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in the newspapers, TV, radio.

47
0:02:57.72,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They came to me again.

48
0:03:00.12,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This time around, said to me,

49
0:03:03.6,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"If you give us 50,000 US dollars,

50
0:03:09.08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the judgement will be in your favor,"

51
0:03:13.48,000 --> 0:03:17,000
irrespective of the fact that there was no evidence whatsoever

52
0:03:18.48,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that I had any wrongdoing

53
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:22,000
on the charges that I was up against.

54
0:03:25.28,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I remember the events

55
0:03:27.76,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of my conviction

56
0:03:29.64,000 --> 0:03:31,000
six years ago

57
0:03:32.24,000 --> 0:03:33,000
as if it were yesterday.

58
0:03:35.32,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The cold, hard face of the judge

59
0:03:38.92,000 --> 0:03:4,000
as she pronounced my sentence

60
0:03:41.72,000 --> 0:03:43,000
on a cold Thursday morning

61
0:03:45.08,000 --> 0:03:47,000
for a crime that I hadn't committed.

62
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I remember holding

63
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
my three-month-old beautiful daughter

64
0:03:55.08,000 --> 0:03:57,000
whom I had just named Oma,

65
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:04:02,000
which in my dialect means "truth and justice,"

66
0:04:02.76,000 --> 0:04:06,000
as that was what I had longed so much for

67
0:04:07.64,000 --> 0:04:08,000
all this time.

68
0:04:09.96,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I dressed her in her favorite purple dress,

69
0:04:13.6,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and here she was, about to accompany me

70
0:04:17.84,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to serve this one-year sentence

71
0:04:20.6,000 --> 0:04:21,000
behind bars.

72
0:04:24.28,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The guards did not seem sensitive to the trauma

73
0:04:28.04,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that this experience was causing me.

74
0:04:32.44,000 --> 0:04:35,000
My dignity and humanity disappeared

75
0:04:37.32,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with the admission process.

76
0:04:41.84,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It involved me being searched for contrabands,

77
0:04:46.68,000 --> 0:04:49,000
changed from my ordinary clothes

78
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to the prison uniform,

79
0:04:51.92,000 --> 0:04:53,000
forced to squat on the ground,

80
0:04:55.8,000 --> 0:04:57,000
a posture that I soon came to learn

81
0:04:59.08,000 --> 0:05:01,000
would form the routine

82
0:05:01.96,000 --> 0:05:03,000
of the thousands of searches,

83
0:05:05.2,000 --> 0:05:06,000
number counts,

84
0:05:06.72,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that lay ahead of me.

85
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The women told me,

86
0:05:13.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"You'll adjust to this place.

87
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:17,000
You'll fit right in."

88
0:05:19.28,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I was no longer referred to as Teresa Njoroge.

89
0:05:23.36,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The number 415/11 was my new identity,

90
0:05:28.12,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and I soon learned that was the case with the other women

91
0:05:31.96,000 --> 0:05:33,000
who we were sharing this space with.

92
0:05:36.04,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And adjust I did to life on the inside:

93
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the prison food,

94
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the prison language,

95
0:05:45.92,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the prison life.

96
0:05:47.92,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Prison is certainly no fairytale world.

97
0:05:54.72,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What I didn't see come my way

98
0:05:57.36,000 --> 0:05:59,000
was the women and children

99
0:06:01.84,000 --> 0:06:05,000
whom we served time and shared space with,

100
0:06:07.56,000 --> 0:06:1,000
women who had been imprisoned

101
0:06:11.48,000 --> 0:06:14,000
for crimes of the system,

102
0:06:14.56,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the corruption that requires a fall guy,

103
0:06:20.24,000 --> 0:06:21,000
a scapegoat,

104
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so that the person who is responsible

105
0:06:25.04,000 --> 0:06:26,000
could go free,

106
0:06:27.6,000 --> 0:06:33,000
a broken system that routinely vilifies the vulnerable,

107
0:06:34.28,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the poorest amongst us,

108
0:06:36.6,000 --> 0:06:39,000
people who cannot afford to pay bail

109
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or bribes.

110
0:06:43.56,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And so we moved on.

111
0:06:46.76,000 --> 0:06:48,000
As I listened to story after story

112
0:06:49.72,000 --> 0:06:52,000
of these close to 700 women

113
0:06:52.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
during that one year in prison,

114
0:06:57.36,000 --> 0:07:,000
I soon realized that crime

115
0:07:01.28,000 --> 0:07:05,000
was not what had brought these women to prison,

116
0:07:06.48,000 --> 0:07:07,000
most of them,

117
0:07:08.48,000 --> 0:07:09,000
far from it.

118
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It had started with the education system,

119
0:07:16.8,000 --> 0:07:2,000
whose supply and quality is not equal for all;

120
0:07:22.28,000 --> 0:07:24,000
lack of economic opportunities

121
0:07:26.24,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that pushes these women to petty survival crimes;

122
0:07:31.12,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the health system,

123
0:07:33.28,000 --> 0:07:35,000
social justice system,

124
0:07:35.52,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the criminal justice system.

125
0:07:37.96,000 --> 0:07:39,000
If any of these women,

126
0:07:40.4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
who were mostly from poor backgrounds,

127
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:45,000
fall through the cracks

128
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in the already broken system,

129
0:07:49.08,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the bottom of that chasm is a prison,

130
0:07:52.88,000 --> 0:07:53,000
period.

131
0:07:56.44,000 --> 0:07:59,000
By the time I completed my one-year sentence

132
0:07:59.76,000 --> 0:08:01,000
at Langata Women Maximum Prison,

133
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I had a burning conviction

134
0:08:06.96,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to be part of the transformation

135
0:08:10.88,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to resolve the injustices

136
0:08:13.44,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that I had witnessed

137
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of women and girls

138
0:08:16.92,000 --> 0:08:18,000
who were caught up in a revolving door

139
0:08:19.72,000 --> 0:08:21,000
of a life in and out of prison

140
0:08:22.28,000 --> 0:08:23,000
due to poverty.

141
0:08:25.6,000 --> 0:08:26,000
After my release,

142
0:08:27.52,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I set up Clean Start.

143
0:08:30.32,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Clean Start is a social enterprise

144
0:08:33.84,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that seeks to give these women and girls

145
0:08:36.84,000 --> 0:08:37,000
a second chance.

146
0:08:39.2,000 --> 0:08:42,000
What we do is we build bridges for them.

147
0:08:42.92,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We go into the prisons, train them,

148
0:08:45.72,000 --> 0:08:48,000
give them skills, tools and support

149
0:08:48.799,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to enable them to be able to change their mindsets,

150
0:08:52.24,000 --> 0:08:54,000
their behaviors and their attitudes.

151
0:08:55.4,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We also build bridges into the prisons

152
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:,000
from the corporate sector --

153
0:09:01.84,000 --> 0:09:03,000
individuals, organizations

154
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that will partner with Clean Start

155
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to enable us to provide employment,

156
0:09:08.44,000 --> 0:09:1,000
places to call home,

157
0:09:10.52,000 --> 0:09:12,000
jobs, vocational training,

158
0:09:12.68,000 --> 0:09:14,000
for these women, girls,

159
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:16,000
boys and men,

160
0:09:16.48,000 --> 0:09:18,000
upon transition back into society.

161
0:09:20.96,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I never thought

162
0:09:23.44,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that one day

163
0:09:25.2,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I would be giving stories

164
0:09:27.12,000 --> 0:09:3,000
of the injustices that are so common

165
0:09:30.68,000 --> 0:09:32,000
within the criminal justice system,

166
0:09:34.36,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but here I am.

167
0:09:37.48,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Every time I go back to prison,

168
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I feel a little at home,

169
0:09:43.24,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but it is the daunting work

170
0:09:48.12,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to achieve the vision

171
0:09:50.08,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that keeps me awake at night,

172
0:09:54.08,000 --> 0:09:58,000
connecting the miles to Louisiana,

173
0:09:58.12,000 --> 0:10:03,000
which is deemed as the incarceration capital of the world,

174
0:10:04.24,000 --> 0:10:06,000
carrying with me stories

175
0:10:07.12,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of hundreds of women

176
0:10:09.44,000 --> 0:10:12,000
whom I have met within the prisons,

177
0:10:12.64,000 --> 0:10:16,000
some of whom are now embracing their second chances,

178
0:10:17.2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and others who are still on that bridge of life's journey.

179
0:10:24.56,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I embody a line

180
0:10:27.4,000 --> 0:10:29,000
from the great Maya Angelou.

181
0:10:31.04,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"I come as one,

182
0:10:33.6,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but I stand as 10,000."

183
0:10:37.12,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Applause)

184
0:10:45.64,000 --> 0:10:48,000
For my story is singular,

185
0:10:49.12,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but imagine with me

186
0:10:51.68,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the millions of people

187
0:10:55.2,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in prisons today,

188
0:10:58.28,000 --> 0:11:,000
yearning for freedom.

189
0:11:03.04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Three years post my conviction

190
0:11:07.24,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and two years post my release,

191
0:11:10.68,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I got cleared by the courts of appeal

192
0:11:13.68,000 --> 0:11:14,000
of any wrongdoing.

193
0:11:15.24,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

194
0:11:20.76,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Around the same time,

195
0:11:22.84,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I got blessed with my son,

196
0:11:25.04,000 --> 0:11:27,000
whom I named Uhuru,

197
0:11:27.32,000 --> 0:11:3,000
which in my dialect means "freedom."

198
0:11:30.4,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Applause)

199
0:11:34.48,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Because I had finally gotten the freedom

200
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that I so longed for.

201
0:11:40.72,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I come as one,

202
0:11:42.88,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but I stand as 10,000,

203
0:11:45.48,000 --> 0:11:49,000
encouraged by the hard-edged hope

204
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that thousands of us have come together

205
0:11:53.96,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to reform and transform the criminal justice system,

206
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
encouraged that we are doing our jobs

207
0:12:04.28,000 --> 0:12:06,000
as we are meant to do them.

208
0:12:07.12,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And let us keep doing them

209
0:12:09.52,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with no apology.

210
0:12:12.04,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Thank you.

211
0:12:13.28,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Applause)

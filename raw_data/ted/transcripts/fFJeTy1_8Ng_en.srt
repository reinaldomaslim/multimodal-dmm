1
0:00:13.875,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I am an architect.

2
0:00:16.083,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And this picture shows the city that I come from,

3
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Beijing, China.

4
0:00:21.958,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And old Beijing is like a very beautiful garden,

5
0:00:26.083,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you can see a lot of nature.

6
0:00:28.208,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When I was a kid,

7
0:00:29.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I learned to swim in this lake

8
0:00:31.958,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I climbed mountains every day after school.

9
0:00:35.208,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But after getting older,

10
0:00:37.125,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we built more and more modern buildings.

11
0:00:40.5,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And they all look the same.

12
0:00:42.375,000 --> 0:00:44,000
They all look like matchboxes.

13
0:00:47.083,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Why are modern buildings and cities full of these boxy shapes?

14
0:00:53.917,000 --> 0:00:55,000
In this photo, you actually see two cities.

15
0:00:56.125,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The one on the left is New York,

16
0:00:58.75,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and the one on the right is Tianjin, a Chinese city

17
0:01:02.625,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that's being constructed.

18
0:01:04.5,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And they have very similar skylines.

19
0:01:07.125,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Maybe they also follow the same principle.

20
0:01:10.833,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You know, competing for density,

21
0:01:12.417,000 --> 0:01:14,000
competing for more space,

22
0:01:14.5,000 --> 0:01:16,000
competing for efficiency.

23
0:01:18.292,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Therefore, modern architecture

24
0:01:20.792,000 --> 0:01:22,000
becomes a symbol of capital and power.

25
0:01:25.542,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Chinese cities are building a lot,

26
0:01:27.292,000 --> 0:01:28,000
they're also, you know,

27
0:01:29.083,000 --> 0:01:32,000
not only competing for this space and height,

28
0:01:32.708,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they're also learning a lot from North American urban strategies

29
0:01:37.958,000 --> 0:01:41,000
[and] also repeat a lot from city to city.

30
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So here, we call it 1,000 cities with one face.

31
0:01:46.708,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So as an architect in China,

32
0:01:48.375,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I have to ask myself, what can I do about it?

33
0:01:52.333,000 --> 0:01:55,000
One day, I was walking on a street,

34
0:01:55.542,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I saw people selling fish.

35
0:01:57.667,000 --> 0:02:,000
And they put the fish in this cubic fish tank.

36
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So I was asking the same question,

37
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
why a cubic space for fish?

38
0:02:05.708,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Do they like cubic space?

39
0:02:08.042,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:09.083,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Obviously not.

41
0:02:10.667,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So maybe the cubic space, cubic architecture,

42
0:02:14.542,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is cheaper, is easier to make.

43
0:02:18.292,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So, I did this small research,

44
0:02:21.25,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I put a camera and I tried to observe how fish behave

45
0:02:26.208,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in this cubic space.

46
0:02:28.375,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And then I found they probably weren't happy.

47
0:02:33.375,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The cubic space wasn't the perfect home for them,

48
0:02:35.792,000 --> 0:02:38,000
so I decided to design a new fish tank for them.

49
0:02:38.958,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I think it should be more organic,

50
0:02:41.667,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it should be a more fluid space inside.

51
0:02:45.792,000 --> 0:02:48,000
More complex interiors.

52
0:02:51.25,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I think they should feel happier living in this space,

53
0:02:54.875,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but I wouldn't know because they don't talk to me.

54
0:02:58,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:59.917,000 --> 0:03:,000
But one year after,

56
0:03:01.667,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we got this opportunity to design this real building for humans.

57
0:03:07.083,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This is actually a pair of towers

58
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that we built in Mississauga, a city outside Toronto.

59
0:03:14.792,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And people call this Marilyn Monroe Towers --

60
0:03:17.542,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:18.625,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because of its curvature.

62
0:03:22.667,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And the idea was to build a tower,

63
0:03:25.458,000 --> 0:03:29,000
high-rise, residential tower, but not a box.

64
0:03:30.292,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's more inspired by nature,

65
0:03:32.125,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with the sunshine and wind dynamics.

66
0:03:37.583,000 --> 0:03:4,000
After we finished designing the first tower,

67
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
they told us, you know,

68
0:03:44.625,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"You don't have to design the second one,

69
0:03:46.667,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you just repeat the same design,

70
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we pay you twice."

71
0:03:52.833,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But I said, "You cannot have two Marilyn Monroes standing there."

72
0:03:57.917,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And nature never repeats itself,

73
0:04:00.333,000 --> 0:04:05,000
so now we have two buildings that can dance together.

74
0:04:08.708,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So I have this question for myself.

75
0:04:12.875,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You know, why, in the modern city,

76
0:04:14.792,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we often think architecture is a machine, is a box?

77
0:04:19.625,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So here, I want to see how people looked at nature in the past.

78
0:04:24.75,000 --> 0:04:26,000
By looking into this Chinese traditional painting,

79
0:04:27.5,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I found that they often mixed

80
0:04:31.333,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the nature and the artificial, man-made, in a very dramatic way,

81
0:04:37.583,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so they create this emotional scenery.

82
0:04:40.958,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So in the modern city, my question is:

83
0:04:43.875,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Is there a way that we don't separate buildings and nature,

84
0:04:48.083,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but combine them?

85
0:04:50.667,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So there's another project that we built in China.

86
0:04:54.292,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's a quite large residential complex.

87
0:04:58.083,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And it's located in a very beautiful nature setting.

88
0:05:02.542,000 --> 0:05:04,000
To be honest, the first time when I visited the site,

89
0:05:05.292,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it was too beautiful.

90
0:05:07.083,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And I almost decided to reject the project

91
0:05:11.292,000 --> 0:05:16,000
because you feel as a criminal to do anything there.

92
0:05:18.792,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I don't want to become a criminal.

93
0:05:21.5,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But my second thought was,

94
0:05:23.667,000 --> 0:05:24,000
if I didn't do it,

95
0:05:25.333,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they would just put, you know, standard urban towers there, anyway.

96
0:05:29.667,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And that would be a pity.

97
0:05:32.333,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So I decided I had to give it a try.

98
0:05:35.833,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So the way we did that was

99
0:05:38.167,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we took the contour lines from the existing mountains,

100
0:05:41.708,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and we took those lines and then translated them into a building.

101
0:05:45.792,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So those towers are actually taking the shapes

102
0:05:48.292,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and geometries from the nature.

103
0:05:50.542,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So each building has a different shape,

104
0:05:52.542,000 --> 0:05:54,000
a different size, different height.

105
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And they become the extension of the nature

106
0:05:59.042,000 --> 0:06:01,000
[where] they're situated.

107
0:06:01.458,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And you know,

108
0:06:03.833,000 --> 0:06:05,000
people think we use computer sometimes

109
0:06:06.083,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to design this kind of architecture,

110
0:06:08.417,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but I actually use a lot of hand sketch,

111
0:06:11.125,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because I like the randomness in the hand sketch.

112
0:06:16.167,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And they can carry sort of emotions

113
0:06:19.833,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that cannot be made by computers.

114
0:06:24.542,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Architecture and humans and nature can coexist together

115
0:06:30.375,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and are having a good relationship in this photo.

116
0:06:33.75,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Actually this guy in the photo is one of the architects on our team.

117
0:06:38.5,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I think he's been enjoying the beautiful nature scenery,

118
0:06:44.75,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and feeling relieved that he is not part of the criminals --

119
0:06:49.958,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:51.5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in the end.

121
0:06:53.875,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Back to the city,

122
0:06:55.167,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in Beijing, we were asked to design these urban towers.

123
0:07:00.292,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And I made this model.

124
0:07:01.875,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It's an architecture model,

125
0:07:04.167,000 --> 0:07:07,000
looks like a minimountain and minivalleys.

126
0:07:07.958,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I put this model on my table, and I watered it every day.

127
0:07:11.833,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And years later, we completed this building.

128
0:07:16.875,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And you can see how my hand sketch

129
0:07:20.583,000 --> 0:07:22,000
is being translated into the real building.

130
0:07:23.208,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And they look quite similar.

131
0:07:26.125,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It looks like a black mountain.

132
0:07:27.792,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And this is how this building is situated in the city.

133
0:07:32.583,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's on the edge of this beautiful park.

134
0:07:35.875,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's different, very different from the surrounding buildings,

135
0:07:38.833,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because other buildings are trying to build a wall around the nature.

136
0:07:43.75,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But what we're trying to do here

137
0:07:45.5,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is to make the building itself as a part of nature,

138
0:07:50.042,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so we can extend the nature from the park into the city.

139
0:07:54.25,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So that was the idea.

140
0:07:57.833,000 --> 0:08:,000
A Chinese art critic drew this painting.

141
0:08:01.583,000 --> 0:08:03,000
He put our building in this painting.

142
0:08:05.583,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Can you see there's a black, tiny mountain?

143
0:08:08.708,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That looks very fit into this painting.

144
0:08:14.667,000 --> 0:08:17,000
However, in this reality,

145
0:08:18.208,000 --> 0:08:2,000
our design was being challenged

146
0:08:20.542,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that it looks so different from the surroundings.

147
0:08:23.583,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And they asked me to modify my design,

148
0:08:25.917,000 --> 0:08:27,000
either color or shape,

149
0:08:28.333,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to make the building fit the context better.

150
0:08:33.75,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So my question was,

151
0:08:35.542,000 --> 0:08:41,000
why it fits this traditional, you know, natural context,

152
0:08:42.125,000 --> 0:08:43,000
better than the reality?

153
0:08:43.75,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Maybe there's something wrong with the reality.

154
0:08:47.125,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Something wrong with the context.

155
0:08:50.208,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In the very northern part of China,

156
0:08:52.542,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we also built this opera house.

157
0:08:55.375,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It's an opera house next to the river,

158
0:08:58.5,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in the wetland park.

159
0:09:00.292,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So we decided to make this building part of the surrounding landscape

160
0:09:05.167,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and merge into the horizon.

161
0:09:09.417,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The building literally looks like a snow mountain.

162
0:09:12.042,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And people can walk on the building.

163
0:09:16.75,000 --> 0:09:18,000
During the day or when there's no opera,

164
0:09:19.292,000 --> 0:09:21,000
people come here, they can enjoy the views,

165
0:09:22.083,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and they can continue their journey from the park

166
0:09:24.792,000 --> 0:09:25,000
onto the building.

167
0:09:27.375,000 --> 0:09:28,000
When they reach the rooftop,

168
0:09:29.125,000 --> 0:09:32,000
there's an amphitheater that's framing the sky,

169
0:09:32.25,000 --> 0:09:34,000
where they can sing to the sky.

170
0:09:36.708,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Inside the opera,

171
0:09:38.417,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we have this lobby with a lot of natural light,

172
0:09:40.875,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and they can also enjoy this semi-indoor-outdoor space,

173
0:09:45.167,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and they can see the beautiful view around them.

174
0:09:50.792,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I've been building several mountains,

175
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and here I'm trying to show you

176
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
one building that I think looks like a cloud.

177
0:09:58.458,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's the Lucas Museum of Narrative Arts

178
0:10:01.083,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that's being constructed in the city of Los Angeles.

179
0:10:04.875,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's a museum created by George Lucas,

180
0:10:10.792,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the creator of the "Star Wars" movies.

181
0:10:14.375,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Why a building that looks like a cloud?

182
0:10:17.042,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Because I think, I imagine, the cloud is mysterious.

183
0:10:22.25,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It's nature.

184
0:10:24.875,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's surreal when this natural element landed in the city.

185
0:10:30.542,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And it makes you feel curious about it,

186
0:10:33.708,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and you want to explore it.

187
0:10:37.5,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So that's how the building landed on earth.

188
0:10:42.083,000 --> 0:10:43,000
By lifting this museum,

189
0:10:43.5,000 --> 0:10:46,000
making it float above the ground,

190
0:10:46.667,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we can free up a lot of landscape and space underneath the building.

191
0:10:50.792,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And then we can, at the same time,

192
0:10:52.542,000 --> 0:10:54,000
create this roof garden above the building

193
0:10:54.792,000 --> 0:10:58,000
where you can visit and enjoy the view.

194
0:10:58.958,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This museum will be completed in the year 2022,

195
0:11:02.333,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and you're all invited when it's completed.

196
0:11:09.167,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So after building all these mountains and clouds,

197
0:11:13.042,000 --> 0:11:15,000
now we're building these volcanoes

198
0:11:15.917,000 --> 0:11:16,000
back in China.

199
0:11:17.208,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This is actually a huge sports park

200
0:11:20.292,000 --> 0:11:22,000
with four stadiums in it,

201
0:11:22.708,000 --> 0:11:27,000
with one football stadium [with] 40,000 seats in there.

202
0:11:30.042,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So it's a very large project.

203
0:11:32.792,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And you see from this photo,

204
0:11:35.042,000 --> 0:11:39,000
you can hardly tell where there's building and where there's landscape.

205
0:11:39.375,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So the building becomes a landscape.

206
0:11:41.5,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Even becomes a land art,

207
0:11:43.333,000 --> 0:11:45,000
where people can walk around the building,

208
0:11:45.833,000 --> 0:11:46,000
they can climb this building

209
0:11:47.792,000 --> 0:11:51,000
as they're wandering in this volcano park.

210
0:11:54.25,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And this rendering shows one of the spaces in those volcanoes.

211
0:11:58.75,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This is actually a swimming pool

212
0:12:01.875,000 --> 0:12:03,000
with natural light coming from above.

213
0:12:06.167,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So, what we're trying to create

214
0:12:08.917,000 --> 0:12:11,000
actually is an environment that blurs the boundary

215
0:12:12.375,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in between architecture and nature.

216
0:12:15.333,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So architecture is no longer a functional machine for living.

217
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It also reflects the nature around us.

218
0:12:23.167,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It also reflects our soul and spirit.

219
0:12:27.5,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So, as an architect, I don't think

220
0:12:30.333,000 --> 0:12:34,000
in the future we should repeat those soulless matchboxes anymore.

221
0:12:35.333,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I think what I'm looking for is the opportunity

222
0:12:38.792,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to create a future

223
0:12:40.917,000 --> 0:12:43,000
with harmony in between humans and nature.

224
0:12:44.833,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Thank you very much.

225
0:12:46.208,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Applause)

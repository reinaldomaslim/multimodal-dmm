1
0:00:12.958,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So when I was in Morocco,

2
0:00:15.158,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in Casablanca, not so long ago,

3
0:00:17.692,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza.

4
0:00:22.168,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Faiza showed me photos of her infant son

5
0:00:25.505,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and she told me the story of his conception, pregnancy, and delivery.

6
0:00:31.64,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It was a remarkable tale,

7
0:00:33.6,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but Faiza saved the best for last.

8
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"You know, I am a virgin," she told me.

9
0:00:40.85,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"I have two medical certificates to prove it."

10
0:00:45.254,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This is the modern Middle East,

11
0:00:47.878,000 --> 0:00:49,000
where two millennia after the coming of Christ,

12
0:00:50.51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
virgin births are still a fact of life.

13
0:00:54.738,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard over the years, traveling across the Arab region

14
0:01:00.395,000 --> 0:01:03,000
talking to people about sex.

15
0:01:03.683,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now, I know this might sound like a dream job,

16
0:01:06.899,000 --> 0:01:09,000
or possibly a highly dubious occupation,

17
0:01:10.167,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but for me, it's something else altogether.

18
0:01:13.523,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim.

19
0:01:16.111,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots.

20
0:01:19.902,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Like so many who straddle East and West,

21
0:01:22.536,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I've been drawn, over the years, to try to better understand my origins.

22
0:01:27.459,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That I chose to look at sex comes from my background in HIV/AIDS,

23
0:01:31.579,000 --> 0:01:35,000
as a writer and a researcher and an activist.

24
0:01:35.666,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa,

25
0:01:40.79,000 --> 0:01:46,000
which is one of only two regions in the world where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise.

26
0:01:47.335,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens

27
0:01:50.376,000 --> 0:01:52,000
with which to study any society,

28
0:01:53.1,000 --> 0:01:55,000
because what happens in our intimate lives

29
0:01:55.609,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is reflected by forces on a bigger stage:

30
0:01:59.783,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in politics and economics, in religion and tradition, in gender and generations.

31
0:02:05.857,000 --> 0:02:08,000
As I found, if you really want to know a people,

32
0:02:09.144,000 --> 0:02:13,000
you start by looking inside their bedrooms.

33
0:02:13.668,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.

34
0:02:17.86,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But running across it are three red lines --

35
0:02:20.521,000 --> 0:02:25,000
these are topics you are not supposed to challenge in word or deed.

36
0:02:25.735,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The first of these is politics.

37
0:02:28.15,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But the Arab Spring has changed all that,

38
0:02:30.578,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in uprisings which have blossomed across the region since 2011.

39
0:02:35.6,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now while those in power, old and new,

40
0:02:38.461,000 --> 0:02:4,000
continue to cling to business as usual,

41
0:02:41.263,000 --> 0:02:43,000
millions are still pushing back,

42
0:02:43.869,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life.

43
0:02:48.984,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That second red line is religion.

44
0:02:52.164,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But now religion and politics are connected,

45
0:02:54.995,000 --> 0:02:57,000
with the rise of such groups as the Muslim Brotherhood.

46
0:02:58.139,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And some people, at least, are starting to ask questions

47
0:03:01.599,000 --> 0:03:06,000
about the role of Islam in public and private life.

48
0:03:06.667,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You know, as for that third red line, that off-limits subject,

49
0:03:10.418,000 --> 0:03:11,000
what do you think it might be?

50
0:03:12.196,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Audience: Sex.

51
0:03:13.258,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Shereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you.

52
0:03:14.558,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Audience: Sex.

53
0:03:15.414,000 --> 0:03:16,000
SEF: Again, please don't be shy.

54
0:03:17.036,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Audience: Sex.

55
0:03:18.088,000 --> 0:03:25,000
SEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter)

56
0:03:25.145,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Across the Arab region, the only accepted context for sex is marriage --

57
0:03:31.353,000 --> 0:03:34,000
approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion

58
0:03:35.131,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and registered by the state.

59
0:03:37.671,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Marriage is your ticket to adulthood.

60
0:03:40.554,000 --> 0:03:43,000
If you don't tie the knot, you can't move out of your parents' place,

61
0:03:44.379,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and you're not supposed to be having sex,

62
0:03:46.68,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and you're definitely not supposed to be having children.

63
0:03:49.827,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress

64
0:03:53.193,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which resists any assault, any alternative.

65
0:03:57.658,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo

66
0:04:01.666,000 --> 0:04:05,000
against premarital sex, against condoms,

67
0:04:06.639,000 --> 0:04:08,000
against abortion, against homosexuality,

68
0:04:09.583,000 --> 0:04:11,000
you name it.

69
0:04:11.754,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Faiza was living proof of this.

70
0:04:14.978,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking.

71
0:04:19.259,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity,

72
0:04:24.582,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in a patriarchy, boys will be boys.

73
0:04:27.886,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Men have sex before marriage,

74
0:04:29.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and people more or less turn a blind eye.

75
0:04:33.629,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Not so for women,

76
0:04:35.845,000 --> 0:04:38,000
who are expected to be virgins on their wedding night --

77
0:04:38.889,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that is, to turn up with your hymen intact.

78
0:04:43.139,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is not a question of individual concern,

79
0:04:46.814,000 --> 0:04:51,000
this is a matter of family honor, and in particular, men's honor.

80
0:04:51.956,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And so women and their relatives

81
0:04:53.714,000 --> 0:04:57,000
will go to great lengths to preserve this tiny piece of anatomy --

82
0:04:58.073,000 --> 0:05:,000
from female genital mutilation,

83
0:05:00.278,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery.

84
0:05:04.639,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Faiza chose a different route:

85
0:05:07.645,000 --> 0:05:09,000
non-vaginal sex.

86
0:05:10.028,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Only she became pregnant all the same.

87
0:05:12.637,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But Faiza didn't actually realize this,

88
0:05:15.377,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because there's so little sexuality education in schools,

89
0:05:19.152,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and so little communication in the family.

90
0:05:23.174,000 --> 0:05:25,000
When her condition became hard to hide,

91
0:05:25.929,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Faiza's mother helped her flee her father and brothers.

92
0:05:30.376,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This is because honor killings are a real threat

93
0:05:33.397,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for untold numbers of women in the Arab region.

94
0:05:37.171,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at a hospital in Casablanca,

95
0:05:42.221,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the man who offered to help her,

96
0:05:44.898,000 --> 0:05:47,000
instead tried to rape her.

97
0:05:50.35,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Sadly, Faiza is not alone.

98
0:05:53.459,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In Egypt, where my research is focused,

99
0:05:55.245,000 --> 0:06:,000
I have seen plenty of trouble in and out of the citadel.

100
0:06:00.843,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There are legions of young men

101
0:06:04.182,000 --> 0:06:06,000
who can't afford to get married,

102
0:06:06.289,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because marriage has become a very expensive proposition.

103
0:06:09.713,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life,

104
0:06:13.272,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but they can't find jobs.

105
0:06:15.576,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This is one of the major drivers of the recent uprisings,

106
0:06:18.75,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and it is one of the reasons for the rising age of marriage

107
0:06:21.915,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in much of the Arab region.

108
0:06:24.946,000 --> 0:06:26,000
There are career women who want to get married,

109
0:06:27.721,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but can't find a husband,

110
0:06:29.319,000 --> 0:06:32,000
because they defy gender expectations,

111
0:06:32.504,000 --> 0:06:35,000
or as one young female doctor in Tunisia put it to me,

112
0:06:36.291,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"The women, they are becoming more and more open.

113
0:06:38.998,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage."

114
0:06:44.801,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And then there are men and women who cross the heterosexual line,

115
0:06:48.691,000 --> 0:06:49,000
who have sex with their own sex,

116
0:06:50.593,000 --> 0:06:53,000
or who have a different gender identity.

117
0:06:53.602,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities,

118
0:06:57.555,000 --> 0:06:59,000
even their appearance.

119
0:06:59.613,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And they face a daily struggle with social stigma,

120
0:07:03.448,000 --> 0:07:04,000
with family despair,

121
0:07:05.083,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and with religious fire and brimstone.

122
0:07:09.251,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, it's not as if it's all rosy in the marital bed either.

123
0:07:13.449,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Couples who are looking for greater happiness,

124
0:07:15.975,000 --> 0:07:17,000
greater sexual happiness in their married lives,

125
0:07:18.614,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but are at a loss of how to achieve it,

126
0:07:20.973,000 --> 0:07:24,000
especially wives, who are afraid of being seen as bad women

127
0:07:25.495,000 --> 0:07:28,000
if they show some spark in the bedroom.

128
0:07:28.699,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And then there are those whose marriages

129
0:07:30.623,000 --> 0:07:33,000
are actually a veil for prostitution.

130
0:07:33.729,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They have been sold by their families,

131
0:07:35.887,000 --> 0:07:37,000
often to wealthy Arab tourists.

132
0:07:38.768,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is just one face of a booming sex trade across the Arab region.

133
0:07:44.369,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Now raise your hand if any of this is sounding familiar to you,

134
0:07:48.557,000 --> 0:07:51,000
from your part of the world.

135
0:07:52.527,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups.

136
0:07:58.537,000 --> 0:08:,000
And although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report

137
0:08:01.507,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to tell us exactly what's happening inside bedrooms across the Arab region,

138
0:08:05.92,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's pretty clear that something is not right.

139
0:08:09.863,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Double standards for men and women,

140
0:08:12.551,000 --> 0:08:15,000
sex as a source of shame,

141
0:08:15.81,000 --> 0:08:19,000
family control limiting individual choices,

142
0:08:19.961,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and a vast gulf between appearance and reality:

143
0:08:23.708,000 --> 0:08:24,000
what people are doing

144
0:08:25.294,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and what they're willing to admit to,

145
0:08:27.639,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and a general reluctance to move beyond private whispers

146
0:08:31.615,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to a serious and sustained public discussion.

147
0:08:35.703,000 --> 0:08:38,000
As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me,

148
0:08:39.192,000 --> 0:08:42,000
"Here, sex is the opposite of sport.

149
0:08:42.517,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Football, everybody talks about it,

150
0:08:44.683,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but hardly anyone plays.

151
0:08:46.653,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But sex, everybody is doing it,

152
0:08:48.626,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but nobody wants to talk about it." (Laughter)

153
0:08:52.775,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Music) (In Arabic)

154
0:09:03.348,000 --> 0:09:05,000
SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice,

155
0:09:06.007,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which if you follow it, will make you happy in life.

156
0:09:10.101,000 --> 0:09:12,000
When your husband reaches out to you,

157
0:09:12.476,000 --> 0:09:14,000
when he seizes a part of your body,

158
0:09:15.288,000 --> 0:09:18,000
sigh deeply and look at him lustily.

159
0:09:18.654,000 --> 0:09:2,000
When he penetrates you with his penis,

160
0:09:21.177,000 --> 0:09:26,000
try to talk flirtatiously and move yourself in harmony with him.

161
0:09:26.47,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Hot stuff!

162
0:09:27.928,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And it might sound that these handy hints

163
0:09:29.922,000 --> 0:09:32,000
come from "The Joy of Sex" or YouPorn.

164
0:09:33.033,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But in fact, they come from a 10th-century Arabic book

165
0:09:36.885,000 --> 0:09:38,000
called "The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,"

166
0:09:39.217,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia,

167
0:09:43.365,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and everything in between.

168
0:09:46.438,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The Encyclopedia is just one in a long line of Arabic erotica,

169
0:09:50.496,000 --> 0:09:53,000
much of it written by religious scholars.

170
0:09:53.725,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad,

171
0:09:56.086,000 --> 0:09:58,000
there is a rich tradition in Islam

172
0:09:58.503,000 --> 0:10:,000
of talking frankly about sex:

173
0:10:01.083,000 --> 0:10:04,000
not just its problems, but also its pleasures,

174
0:10:04.378,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and not just for men, but also for women.

175
0:10:08.953,000 --> 0:10:13,000
A thousand years ago, we used to have whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic.

176
0:10:14.82,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature,

177
0:10:18.973,000 --> 0:10:21,000
position and preference, a body of language

178
0:10:22.565,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that was rich enough to make up the body of the woman you see on this page.

179
0:10:29.096,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Today, this history is largely unknown in the Arab region.

180
0:10:32.699,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Even by educated people, who often feel more comfortable talking about sex

181
0:10:37.503,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue.

182
0:10:42.481,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Today's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America

183
0:10:46.204,000 --> 0:10:48,000
on the brink of the sexual revolution.

184
0:10:48.937,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But while the West has opened on sex,

185
0:10:51.985,000 --> 0:10:57,000
what we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction.

186
0:10:58.618,000 --> 0:11:,000
In Egypt and many of its neighbors,

187
0:11:00.873,000 --> 0:11:02,000
this closing down is part of a wider closing

188
0:11:03.75,000 --> 0:11:06,000
in political, social and cultural thought.

189
0:11:07.333,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And it is the product of a complex historical process,

190
0:11:11.389,000 --> 0:11:14,000
one which has gained ground with the rise of Islamic conservatism

191
0:11:15.182,000 --> 0:11:18,000
since the late 1970s.

192
0:11:18.183,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"Just say no" is what conservatives around the world

193
0:11:21.858,000 --> 0:11:25,000
say to any challenge to the sexual status quo.

194
0:11:26.32,000 --> 0:11:3,000
In the Arab region, they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy

195
0:11:30.606,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values.

196
0:11:34.908,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But what's really at stake here

197
0:11:36.907,000 --> 0:11:39,000
is one of their most powerful tools of control:

198
0:11:40.801,000 --> 0:11:44,000
sex wrapped up in religion.

199
0:11:44.958,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But history shows us that even as recently

200
0:11:48.103,000 --> 0:11:5,000
as our fathers' and grandfathers' day,

201
0:11:51.012,000 --> 0:11:53,000
there have been times of greater pragmatism,

202
0:11:53.961,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and tolerance, and a willingness to consider other interpretations:

203
0:11:59.481,000 --> 0:12:05,000
be it abortion, or masturbation, or even the incendiary topic of homosexuality.

204
0:12:06.4,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It is not black and white, as conservatives would have us believe.

205
0:12:11.266,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In these, as in so many other matters,

206
0:12:14.473,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray.

207
0:12:17.894,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Laughter)

208
0:12:20.308,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Over my travels,

209
0:12:21.457,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I've met men and women across the Arab region

210
0:12:24.065,000 --> 0:12:26,000
who've been exploring that spectrum --

211
0:12:27.058,000 --> 0:12:29,000
sexologists who are trying to help couples

212
0:12:29.762,000 --> 0:12:32,000
find greater happiness in their marriages,

213
0:12:33.684,000 --> 0:12:38,000
innovators who are managing to get sexuality education into schools,

214
0:12:39.366,000 --> 0:12:41,000
small groups of men and women,

215
0:12:41.733,000 --> 0:12:43,000
lesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual,

216
0:12:44.449,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who are reaching out to their peers

217
0:12:46.13,000 --> 0:12:5,000
with online initiatives and real-world support.

218
0:12:50.788,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Women, and increasingly men, who are starting to speak out

219
0:12:54.751,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and push back against sexual violence

220
0:12:57.837,000 --> 0:13:,000
on the streets and in the home.

221
0:13:01.393,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV

222
0:13:06.126,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and other occupational hazards,

223
0:13:08.993,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza

224
0:13:12.921,000 --> 0:13:17,000
find a place in society, and critically, stay with their kids.

225
0:13:18.702,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Now these efforts are small, they're often underfunded,

226
0:13:22.113,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and they face formidable opposition.

227
0:13:25.416,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But I am optimistic that, in the long run,

228
0:13:28.944,000 --> 0:13:31,000
times are changing, and they and their ideas

229
0:13:32.321,000 --> 0:13:33,000
will gain ground.

230
0:13:34.25,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation,

231
0:13:39.902,000 --> 0:13:42,000
beating or indeed baring of breasts,

232
0:13:43.289,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but rather through negotiation.

233
0:13:45.754,000 --> 0:13:48,000
What we're talking here is not about a sexual revolution,

234
0:13:49.424,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but a sexual evolution, learning from other parts of the world,

235
0:13:53.898,000 --> 0:13:55,000
adapting to local conditions,

236
0:13:56.274,000 --> 0:14:01,000
forging our own path, not following one blazed by another.

237
0:14:02.161,000 --> 0:14:08,000
That path, I hope, will one day lead us to the right to control our own bodies,

238
0:14:08.604,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and to access the information and services we need

239
0:14:11.674,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives.

240
0:14:16.078,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The right to express our ideas freely,

241
0:14:18.648,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to marry whom we choose, to choose our own partners,

242
0:14:23.303,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to be sexually active or not, to decide whether to have children and when,

243
0:14:28.155,000 --> 0:14:34,000
all this without violence or force or discrimination.

244
0:14:34.534,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Now we are very far from this across the Arab region,

245
0:14:37.938,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and so much needs to change:

246
0:14:41.045,000 --> 0:14:44,000
law, education, media, the economy,

247
0:14:44.973,000 --> 0:14:46,000
the list goes on and on,

248
0:14:47.846,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and it is the work of a generation, at least.

249
0:14:52.164,000 --> 0:14:55,000
But it begins with a journey that I myself have made,

250
0:14:55.326,000 --> 0:14:57,000
asking hard questions of received wisdoms

251
0:14:58.295,000 --> 0:14:59,000
in sexual life.

252
0:15:00.103,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith,

253
0:15:04.616,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and my appreciation of local histories and cultures

254
0:15:08.134,000 --> 0:15:13,000
by showing me possibilities where I once only saw absolutes.

255
0:15:13.929,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Now given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region,

256
0:15:17.386,000 --> 0:15:2,000
talking about sex, challenging the taboos,

257
0:15:20.463,000 --> 0:15:25,000
seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury.

258
0:15:25.799,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But at this critical moment in history,

259
0:15:28.591,000 --> 0:15:32,000
if we do not anchor freedom and justice,

260
0:15:32.969,000 --> 0:15:33,000
dignity and equality,

261
0:15:34.601,000 --> 0:15:39,000
privacy and autonomy in our personal lives, in our sexual lives,

262
0:15:39.843,000 --> 0:15:43,000
we will find it very hard to achieve in public life.

263
0:15:44.144,000 --> 0:15:5,000
The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows, and that is true for us all.

264
0:15:50.899,000 --> 0:15:53,000
no matter where we live and love.

265
0:15:54.31,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Thank you.

266
0:15:55.826,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.653,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Hi. So today, I'd like to share some works in progress.

2
0:00:15.953,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Since we are still realizing these works,

3
0:00:18.17,000 --> 0:00:19,000
we are largely working within the realm

4
0:00:19.921,000 --> 0:00:21,000
of intuition and mystery, still.

5
0:00:22.026,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So I'm going to try and describe

6
0:00:23.789,000 --> 0:00:25,000
some of the experiences that we're looking for

7
0:00:25.916,000 --> 0:00:26,000
through each of the works.

8
0:00:27.639,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.

9
0:00:30.945,000 --> 0:00:32,000
A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room,

10
0:00:33.94,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and catches a glimpse of these panels

11
0:00:36.332,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in a messy composition on the wall.

12
0:00:38.507,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Within seconds, as if the panels have noticed

13
0:00:41.059,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the presence of the viewer,

14
0:00:42.684,000 --> 0:00:45,000
they appear to panic and sort of get into

15
0:00:45.728,000 --> 0:00:46,000
a strict symmetry.

16
0:00:47.242,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:48.985,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So this is the sketch of the two states.

18
0:00:51.133,000 --> 0:00:53,000
One is total chaos. The other is absolute order.

19
0:00:53.791,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And we were interested in seeing how little change

20
0:00:56.142,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it takes to move from one state to the other state.

21
0:00:59.798,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions.

22
0:01:03.528,000 --> 0:01:05,000
One is the altar tablets of the 15th century,

23
0:01:06.081,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and the other is about 100 years ago,

24
0:01:08.315,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Malevich's abstract compositions.

25
0:01:11.271,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So I'm just going to take you to a video.

26
0:01:13.287,000 --> 0:01:14,000
To give you a sense of scale,

27
0:01:14.66,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the largest panel is about two meters high.

28
0:01:16.875,000 --> 0:01:18,000
That's about this much. And the smallest one is an A4.

29
0:01:19.693,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So a viewer enters the space,

30
0:01:21.905,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and they snap to attention.

31
0:01:24.001,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And after a while, if the viewer continues

32
0:01:25.989,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to remain in the space,

33
0:01:27.717,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the panels will sort of become immune

34
0:01:29.705,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to the presence of the viewer

35
0:01:31.418,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and become lax and autonomous again,

36
0:01:34.453,000 --> 0:01:37,000
until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement,

37
0:01:37.828,000 --> 0:01:39,000
when they will again snap to attention.

38
0:01:40.527,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:42.006,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So here it appears as if it's the viewer

40
0:01:44.405,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels,

41
0:01:47.65,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but it could also be the other way around,

42
0:01:49.675,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that the panels are so stuck within

43
0:01:52.019,000 --> 0:01:53,000
their preconditioned behaviors

44
0:01:54.013,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant.

45
0:01:59.541,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So this brings me to a quieter, small work

46
0:02:02.039,000 --> 0:02:03,000
called Handheld.

47
0:02:03.608,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The viewer sees a piece of paper

48
0:02:05.342,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that's mounted on the far end of the wall,

49
0:02:07.812,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank

50
0:02:10.44,000 --> 0:02:12,000
A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,

51
0:02:12.712,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that's held on either side

52
0:02:14.029,000 --> 0:02:15,000
by two small hands

53
0:02:15.97,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that appear to be carved with a great deal

54
0:02:18.237,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of attention and care from a small block of wood.

55
0:02:21.71,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture

56
0:02:24.706,000 --> 0:02:26,000
is sort of moving very slightly,

57
0:02:27.168,000 --> 0:02:28,000
as if these two hands are trying

58
0:02:29.029,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to hold the paper very still

59
0:02:30.531,000 --> 0:02:32,000
for a long period of time,

60
0:02:32.71,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and somehow are not managing to.

61
0:02:35.645,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So this instability in the movement

62
0:02:37.618,000 --> 0:02:4,000
very closely resembles the unsteady nature

63
0:02:41.136,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of images seen through a handheld camera.

64
0:02:43.698,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.

65
0:02:46.386,000 --> 0:02:47,000
One is through a still camera

66
0:02:47.806,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the other is through a handheld camera.

67
0:02:49.884,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And you immediately see how the unsteady nature

68
0:02:52.485,000 --> 0:02:55,000
of the video suggests the presence

69
0:02:55.544,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of an observer and a subjective point of view.

70
0:02:58.031,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So we've just removed the camera

71
0:02:59.86,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and transferred that movement onto the panel.

72
0:03:02.141,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So here's a video.

73
0:03:03.674,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet.

74
0:03:06.113,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But to us, we're sort of trying to evoke

75
0:03:08.86,000 --> 0:03:11,000
a self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person

76
0:03:12.399,000 --> 0:03:13,000
with outstretched arms

77
0:03:13.99,000 --> 0:03:15,000
behind this enormous piece of paper.

78
0:03:16.492,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That sort of likens it to the amount of strain

79
0:03:19.077,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to be at the service of the observer and present

80
0:03:21.381,000 --> 0:03:24,000
this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer

81
0:03:24.631,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in front of them.

82
0:03:27.394,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The next work is Decoy.

83
0:03:29.554,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This is a cardboard model, so the object

84
0:03:31.342,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is about as tall as I am.

85
0:03:33.246,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It has a rounded body, two arms,

86
0:03:35.135,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and a very tall, head-like antenna,

87
0:03:37.346,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself.

88
0:03:41.243,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So when a viewer passes by,

89
0:03:43.029,000 --> 0:03:45,000
it sort of tilts from side to side,

90
0:03:45.844,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and moves its arms more and more frantically

91
0:03:48.017,000 --> 0:03:51,000
as the person gets closer.

92
0:03:51.384,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So here is the first test scenario.

93
0:03:53.908,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You see the two movements integrated,

94
0:03:55.797,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and the object seems to be employing

95
0:03:57.786,000 --> 0:04:02,000
its entire being in this expression of desperation.

96
0:04:02.858,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention,

97
0:04:05.522,000 --> 0:04:09,000
it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.

98
0:04:09.594,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:12.708,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.

100
0:04:15.74,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It appears to be mass-manufactured

101
0:04:17.857,000 --> 0:04:18,000
like it came out of a factory

102
0:04:19.559,000 --> 0:04:21,000
like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.

103
0:04:21.836,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Because we are always working

104
0:04:23.339,000 --> 0:04:24,000
from a very personal space,

105
0:04:24.747,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we like how this consumer aesthetic

106
0:04:27.174,000 --> 0:04:29,000
sort of depersonalizes the object

107
0:04:29.246,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and gives us a bit of distance

108
0:04:30.977,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in its appearance, at least.

109
0:04:32.897,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And so to us this is a kind of sinister being

110
0:04:35.237,000 --> 0:04:37,000
which is trying to distract you from the things

111
0:04:37.356,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that actually need your attention,

112
0:04:38.951,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.

113
0:04:43.725,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The next work is an object,

114
0:04:45.897,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that's also a kind of sound instrument.

115
0:04:48.321,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In the shape of an amphitheater

116
0:04:50.108,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that's scaled to the size of an audience

117
0:04:52.048,000 --> 0:04:54,000
as perceived from somebody from the stage.

118
0:04:54.114,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So from where I'm standing,

119
0:04:55.728,000 --> 0:04:56,000
each of you appears to be this big,

120
0:04:57.39,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and the audience sort of takes the entire

121
0:04:59.443,000 --> 0:05:01,000
field of my vision.

122
0:05:01.456,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures.

123
0:05:05.418,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They're mechanically enabled to clap

124
0:05:07.604,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of their own free will.

125
0:05:09.374,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This means that each of them can decide

126
0:05:11.407,000 --> 0:05:12,000
if and when they want to clap,

127
0:05:12.987,000 --> 0:05:13,000
how hard, for how long,

128
0:05:14.619,000 --> 0:05:17,000
how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others,

129
0:05:18.306,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and if they want to contribute to innovation.

130
0:05:22.286,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So when the viewer steps in front of the audience,

131
0:05:24.803,000 --> 0:05:25,000
there will be a response.

132
0:05:26.487,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It could be a few claps or a strong applause,

133
0:05:29.085,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and then nothing happens until the viewer

134
0:05:31.269,000 --> 0:05:34,000
leaves the stage, and again the audience will respond.

135
0:05:34.345,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It could be anything from a few feeble claps

136
0:05:36.67,000 --> 0:05:37,000
from members in the audience,

137
0:05:38.352,000 --> 0:05:42,000
or it could be a very loud ovation.

138
0:05:42.68,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So to us, I think we're really looking

139
0:05:44.642,000 --> 0:05:46,000
at an audience as its own object

140
0:05:46.939,000 --> 0:05:47,000
or its own organism

141
0:05:48.655,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,

142
0:05:52.405,000 --> 0:05:53,000
an instrument.

143
0:05:53.785,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So the viewer can play it

144
0:05:55.541,000 --> 0:05:57,000
by eliciting quite complex and varied,

145
0:05:57.977,000 --> 0:05:59,000
nuanced musical or sound patterns,

146
0:06:00.673,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but cannot really provoke the audience

147
0:06:02.949,000 --> 0:06:04,000
into any particular kind of response.

148
0:06:05.337,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness

149
0:06:08.081,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and uneasiness involved.

150
0:06:10.322,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.

151
0:06:14.431,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So here if you see we're quite excited about

152
0:06:16.551,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the image of the head splitting to form the two hands.

153
0:06:20.373,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So here's a small visual animation,

154
0:06:22.284,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing

155
0:06:26.616,000 --> 0:06:28,000
against each other to kind of make sense

156
0:06:28.643,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of the duality and the tension.

157
0:06:31.178,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And here is a prototype.

158
0:06:33.746,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.

159
0:06:38.548,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Okay, this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners.

160
0:06:41.551,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It comes out of the idea of a window.

161
0:06:44.07,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This is an actual window in our studio,

162
0:06:46.381,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and as you can see, it's made up of three

163
0:06:48.299,000 --> 0:06:5,000
different thicknesses of wooden sections.

164
0:06:50.581,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So we used the same window vocabulary

165
0:06:52.854,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to construct our own frame or grid

166
0:06:55.681,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that's suspended in the room and that can

167
0:06:57.623,000 --> 0:06:58,000
be viewed from two sides.

168
0:06:59.436,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.

169
0:07:02.41,000 --> 0:07:04,000
They're also made up of three different sizes,

170
0:07:04.975,000 --> 0:07:06,000
as if to suggest a kind of perspective

171
0:07:07.401,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or landscape on the single plain.

172
0:07:10.112,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Each of these figures can also run backward

173
0:07:12.557,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and forward in the track

174
0:07:14.122,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and hide behind two adjacent tracks.

175
0:07:17.679,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So in contrast to this very tight grid,

176
0:07:19.789,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we wanted to give these figures a very comical

177
0:07:22.21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and slapstick-like quality,

178
0:07:24.299,000 --> 0:07:25,000
as if a puppeteer has taken them

179
0:07:26.138,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and physically animated them down the path.

180
0:07:28.879,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So we like the idea of these figures

181
0:07:31.159,000 --> 0:07:32,000
sort of skipping along

182
0:07:32.695,000 --> 0:07:34,000
like they're oblivious and carefree

183
0:07:34.783,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and happy-go-lucky and content,

184
0:07:37.331,000 --> 0:07:4,000
until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer

185
0:07:40.531,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and they will hide behind the fastest wall.

186
0:07:44.799,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So to us, this work also presents its own contradiction.

187
0:07:48.633,000 --> 0:07:49,000
These figures are sort of entrapped

188
0:07:50.457,000 --> 0:07:52,000
within this very strong grid,

189
0:07:52.604,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which is like a prison, but also a fortress,

190
0:07:55.36,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because it allows them to be oblivious

191
0:07:57.294,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and naive and carefree and quite oblivious

192
0:07:59.999,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of the external world.

193
0:08:02.568,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So all these real life qualities that I talk about

194
0:08:05.373,000 --> 0:08:07,000
are sort of translated to a very specific

195
0:08:07.655,000 --> 0:08:08,000
technical configuration,

196
0:08:09.416,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and we were very lucky to collaborate

197
0:08:11.459,000 --> 0:08:14,000
with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.

198
0:08:14.627,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So you see they extracted the motion cogs

199
0:08:16.892,000 --> 0:08:18,000
from our animations and created a wiggle

200
0:08:18.982,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that integrated the head-bobbing movement

201
0:08:20.936,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and the back-and-forth movement.

202
0:08:22.704,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So it's really quite small.

203
0:08:24.226,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.

204
0:08:26.518,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So imagine our excitement when we saw it

205
0:08:28.329,000 --> 0:08:31,000
really working in the studio, and here it is.

206
0:08:33.622,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

207
0:08:37.259,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Thank you.

208
0:08:38.807,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Applause)

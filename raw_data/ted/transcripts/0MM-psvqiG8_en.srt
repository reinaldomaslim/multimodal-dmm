1
0:00:12.39,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I coined my own definition of success in 1934,

2
0:00:16.786,000 --> 0:00:18,000
when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend, Indiana,

3
0:00:19.747,000 --> 0:00:23,000
being a little bit disappointed, and [disillusioned] perhaps,

4
0:00:24.531,000 --> 0:00:28,000
by the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes

5
0:00:28.602,000 --> 0:00:31,000
expected their youngsters to get an A or a B.

6
0:00:32.475,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They thought a C was all right for the neighbors' children,

7
0:00:35.396,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because they were all average.

8
0:00:37.387,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But they weren't satisfied when their own --

9
0:00:39.546,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it would make the teacher feel that they had failed, or the youngster had failed.

10
0:00:43.538,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And that's not right.

11
0:00:44.745,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The good Lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal

12
0:00:47.762,000 --> 0:00:48,000
as far as intelligence is concerned,

13
0:00:49.523,000 --> 0:00:51,000
any more than we're equal for size, appearance.

14
0:00:52.022,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Not everybody could earn an A or a B, and I didn't like that way of judging,

15
0:00:55.731,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I did know how the alumni of various schools

16
0:00:59.864,000 --> 0:01:02,000
back in the '30s judged coaches and athletic teams.

17
0:01:03.523,000 --> 0:01:08,000
If you won them all, you were considered to be reasonably successful --

18
0:01:08.573,000 --> 0:01:09,000
not completely.

19
0:01:09.751,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Because I found out --

20
0:01:11.148,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game.

21
0:01:14.535,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But it seemed that we didn't win each individual game

22
0:01:17.058,000 --> 0:01:2,000
by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted --

23
0:01:21.048,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And quite frequently I really felt that they had backed up their predictions

25
0:01:27.756,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in a more materialistic manner.

26
0:01:30.335,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:31.517,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But that was true back in the 30s, so I understood that.

28
0:01:34.763,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But I didn't like it, I didn't agree with it.

29
0:01:36.947,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I wanted to come up with something I hoped could make me a better teacher,

30
0:01:40.51,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and give the youngsters under my supervision,

31
0:01:42.654,000 --> 0:01:44,000
be it in athletics or the English classroom,

32
0:01:44.796,000 --> 0:01:45,000
something to which to aspire,

33
0:01:46.286,000 --> 0:01:49,000
other than just a higher mark in the classroom,

34
0:01:49.853,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or more points in some athletic contest.

35
0:01:52.507,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I thought about that for quite a spell,

36
0:01:54.894,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I wanted to come up with my own definition.

37
0:01:57.139,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I thought that might help.

38
0:01:58.708,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it,

39
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
as the accumulation of material possessions

40
0:02:03.232,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or the attainment of a position of power or prestige, or something of that sort,

41
0:02:07.613,000 --> 0:02:08,000
worthy accomplishments perhaps,

42
0:02:09.549,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but in my opinion, not necessarily indicative of success.

43
0:02:13.059,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So I wanted to come up with something of my own.

44
0:02:15.47,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I recalled --

45
0:02:17.357,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana,

46
0:02:19.708,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers

47
0:02:21.717,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that you should never try to be better than someone else.

48
0:02:25.04,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I'm sure at the time he did that, I didn't -- it didn't --

49
0:02:28.509,000 --> 0:02:31,000
well, somewhere, I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind,

50
0:02:31.683,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it popped out years later.

51
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Never try to be better than someone else,

52
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
always learn from others.

53
0:02:36.637,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Never cease trying to be the best you can be --

54
0:02:39.034,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that's under your control.

55
0:02:40.675,000 --> 0:02:42,000
If you get too engrossed and involved and concerned

56
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in regard to the things over which you have no control,

57
0:02:45.804,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it will adversely affect the things over which you have control.

58
0:02:49.543,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Then I ran across this simple verse that said,

59
0:02:52.044,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"At God's footstool to confess,

60
0:02:54.061,000 --> 0:02:56,000
a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.

61
0:02:56.408,000 --> 0:02:57,000
'I failed!' he cried.

62
0:02:58.066,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The Master said, 'Thou didst thy best, that is success.'"

63
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
From those things, and one other perhaps,

64
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I coined my own definition of success, which is:

65
0:03:06.937,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction

66
0:03:10.247,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable.

67
0:03:14.01,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I believe that's true.

68
0:03:15.318,000 --> 0:03:17,000
If you make the effort to do the best of which you're capable,

69
0:03:18.269,000 --> 0:03:2,000
trying to improve the situation that exists for you,

70
0:03:20.926,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I think that's success,

71
0:03:22.103,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I don't think others can judge that;

72
0:03:24.112,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it's like character and reputation --

73
0:03:25.911,000 --> 0:03:27,000
your reputation is what you're perceived to be;

74
0:03:28.786,000 --> 0:03:29,000
your character is what you really are.

75
0:03:30.668,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And I think that character is much more important

76
0:03:33.866,000 --> 0:03:34,000
than what you are perceived to be.

77
0:03:35.66,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You'd hope they'd both be good,

78
0:03:37.438,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but they won't necessarily be the same.

79
0:03:40.159,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Well, that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters.

80
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I ran across other things.

81
0:03:45.636,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I love to teach, and it was mentioned by the previous speaker

82
0:03:50.77,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that I enjoy poetry, and I dabble in it a bit, and love it.

83
0:03:53.945,000 --> 0:03:55,000
There are some things that helped me, I think,

84
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
be better than I would have been.

85
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I know I'm not what I ought to be, what I should be,

86
0:04:00.554,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but I think I'm better than I would have been

87
0:04:02.711,000 --> 0:04:03,000
if I hadn't run across certain things.

88
0:04:04.645,000 --> 0:04:07,000
One was just a little verse that said,

89
0:04:08.495,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"No written word, no spoken plea

90
0:04:12.571,000 --> 0:04:14,000
can teach our youth what they should be;

91
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
nor all the books on all the shelves --

92
0:04:17.566,000 --> 0:04:19,000
it's what the teachers are themselves."

93
0:04:19.818,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That made an impression on me in the 1930s.

94
0:04:23.635,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And I tried to use that more or less in my teaching,

95
0:04:27.934,000 --> 0:04:31,000
whether it be in sports, or whether it be in the English classroom.

96
0:04:32.53,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow.

97
0:04:38.358,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Maybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night,

98
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
by coal oil lamp --

99
0:04:43.342,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we didn't have electricity in our farm home.

100
0:04:47.035,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And Dad would read poetry to us. So I always liked it.

101
0:04:49.622,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And about the same time I ran across this one verse,

102
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I ran across another one.

103
0:04:53.851,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Someone asked a lady teacher why she taught,

104
0:04:57.691,000 --> 0:05:,000
and after some time, she said she wanted to think about that.

105
0:05:00.755,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Then she came up and said,

106
0:05:02.659,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"They ask me why I teach, and I reply,

107
0:05:05.572,000 --> 0:05:07,000
'Where could I find such splendid company?'

108
0:05:08.096,000 --> 0:05:11,000
There sits a statesman, strong, unbiased, wise;

109
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.

110
0:05:13.882,000 --> 0:05:16,000
A doctor sits beside him, whose quick, steady hand may mend a bone,

111
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or stem the life-blood's flow.

112
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And there a builder; upward rise the arch of a church he builds,

113
0:05:23.232,000 --> 0:05:25,000
wherein that minister may speak the word of God,

114
0:05:25.692,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ.

115
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And all about, a gathering of teachers,

116
0:05:30.159,000 --> 0:05:32,000
farmers, merchants, laborers --

117
0:05:32.501,000 --> 0:05:33,000
those who work and vote and build

118
0:05:34.177,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and plan and pray into a great tomorrow.

119
0:05:36.572,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And I may say, I may not see the church,

120
0:05:39.914,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or hear the word, or eat the food their hands may grow,

121
0:05:42.756,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but yet again I may;

122
0:05:44.017,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And later I may say,

123
0:05:45.192,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I knew him once, and he was weak, or strong, or bold or proud or gay.

124
0:05:49.271,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I knew him once, but then he was a boy.

125
0:05:51.64,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They ask me why I teach and I reply,

126
0:05:53.934,000 --> 0:05:55,000
'Where could I find such splendid company?'"

127
0:05:56.608,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I believe the teaching profession --

128
0:05:58.56,000 --> 0:06:,000
it's true, you have so many youngsters,

129
0:06:00.646,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and I've got to think of my youngsters at UCLA --

130
0:06:03.059,000 --> 0:06:07,000
30-some attorneys, 11 dentists and doctors,

131
0:06:07.895,000 --> 0:06:1,000
many, many teachers and other professions.

132
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And that gives you a great deal of pleasure,

133
0:06:14.982,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to see them go on.

134
0:06:16.61,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education,

135
0:06:20.698,000 --> 0:06:23,000
number one; basketball was second, because it was paying their way,

136
0:06:23.926,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and they do need a little time for social activities,

137
0:06:26.457,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two,

138
0:06:30.068,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and you're not going to have any very long.

139
0:06:32.421,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So that was the idea that I tried to get across

140
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to the youngsters under my supervision.

141
0:06:39.611,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I had three rules, pretty much,

142
0:06:41.441,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that I stuck with practically all the time.

143
0:06:43.786,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA, and I decided they were very important.

144
0:06:47.738,000 --> 0:06:5,000
One was "Never be late."

145
0:06:51.662,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Later on I said certain things --

146
0:06:55.931,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the players, if we were leaving for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.

147
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
There was a time when I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties.

148
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Then I saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks,

149
0:07:11.969,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and thought, it's not right for me to keep this other [rule] so I let them just --

150
0:07:15.96,000 --> 0:07:16,000
they had to be neat and clean.

151
0:07:17.564,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of, Bill Walton.

152
0:07:22.217,000 --> 0:07:25,000
He came to catch the bus; we were leaving for somewhere to play.

153
0:07:25.934,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And he wasn't clean and neat, so I wouldn't let him go.

154
0:07:29.288,000 --> 0:07:3,000
He couldn't get on the bus,

155
0:07:30.696,000 --> 0:07:31,000
he had to go home and get cleaned up

156
0:07:32.63,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to get to the airport.

157
0:07:34.781,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So I was a stickler for that. I believed in that.

158
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I believe in time; very important.

159
0:07:39.068,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I believe you should be on time, but I felt at practice, for example --

160
0:07:42.74,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we start on time, we close on time.

161
0:07:44.78,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The youngsters didn't have to feel that we were going to keep them over.

162
0:07:48.201,000 --> 0:07:5,000
When I speak at coaching clinics, I often tell young coaches --

163
0:07:51.217,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and at coaching clinics, more or less,

164
0:07:53.381,000 --> 0:07:55,000
they'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession.

165
0:07:56.389,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Most of them are young, you know, and probably newly-married.

166
0:07:59.897,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And I tell them, "Don't run practices late,

167
0:08:02.936,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because you'll go home in a bad mood,

168
0:08:04.989,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and that's not good, for a young married man to go home in a bad mood.

169
0:08:08.361,000 --> 0:08:1,000
When you get older, it doesn't make any difference, but --"

170
0:08:11.352,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So I did believe: on time.

172
0:08:16.451,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I believe starting on time, and I believe closing on time.

173
0:08:19.6,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And another one I had was, not one word of profanity.

174
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
One word of profanity, and you are out of here for the day.

175
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
If I see it in a game, you're going to come out and sit on the bench.

176
0:08:30.47,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And the third one was, never criticize a teammate.

177
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that.

178
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
That's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.

179
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Not like the coaches today, for gracious sakes, no.

180
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's a little different than it was in my day.

181
0:08:46.572,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Those were three things that I stuck with pretty closely all the time.

182
0:08:51.277,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And those actually came from my dad.

183
0:08:53.919,000 --> 0:08:57,000
That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time.

184
0:08:58.84,000 --> 0:09:,000
I came up with a pyramid eventually,

185
0:09:01.738,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that I don't have the time to go on that.

186
0:09:04.468,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But that helped me, I think, become a better teacher.

187
0:09:07.722,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's something like this:

188
0:09:09.667,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And I had blocks in the pyramid,

189
0:09:11.889,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm,

190
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
working hard and enjoying what you're doing,

191
0:09:17.28,000 --> 0:09:18,000
coming up to the apex,

192
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
according to my definition of success.

193
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And right at the top, faith and patience.

194
0:09:24.517,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And I say to you, in whatever you're doing,

195
0:09:26.946,000 --> 0:09:27,000
you must be patient.

196
0:09:28.13,000 --> 0:09:31,000
You have to have patience to -- we want things to happen.

197
0:09:31.904,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We talk about our youth being impatient a lot, and they are.

198
0:09:35.999,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They want to change everything. They think all change is progress.

199
0:09:39.165,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And we get a little older -- we sort of let things go.

200
0:09:41.76,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And we forget there is no progress without change.

201
0:09:44.395,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So you must have patience,

202
0:09:45.809,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and I believe that we must have faith.

203
0:09:47.819,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I believe that we must believe, truly believe.

204
0:09:50.478,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Not just give it word service,

205
0:09:52.462,000 --> 0:09:54,000
believe that things will work out as they should,

206
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
providing we do what we should.

207
0:09:57.498,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I think our tendency is to hope things will turn out the way we want them to

208
0:10:02.191,000 --> 0:10:03,000
much of the time,

209
0:10:03.478,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but we don't do the things that are necessary

210
0:10:06.841,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to make those things become reality.

211
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I worked on this for some 14 years,

212
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and I think it helped me become a better teacher.

213
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But it all revolved around that original definition of success.

214
0:10:19.338,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You know, a number of years ago,

215
0:10:21.407,000 --> 0:10:24,000
there was a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty.

216
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.

217
0:10:28.771,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I'd never seen that before, but he did.

218
0:10:30.706,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Big league baseball players --

219
0:10:32.547,000 --> 0:10:34,000
they're very perceptive about those things,

220
0:10:34.642,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and they noticed he had only one 'i' in his name.

221
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
You'd be surprised how many also told him

222
0:10:40.808,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that that was one more than he had in his head

223
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
at various times.

224
0:10:44.341,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

225
0:10:46.113,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But he wrote something where I think he did

226
0:10:48.183,000 --> 0:10:49,000
what I tried to do in this pyramid.

227
0:10:49.923,000 --> 0:10:51,000
He called it "The Road Ahead, or the Road Behind."

228
0:10:52.35,000 --> 0:10:55,000
He said, "Sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce them and insist

229
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
the only reason we can't win, is the Fates themselves have missed.

230
0:11:00.373,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Yet there lives on the ancient claim:

231
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
we win or lose within ourselves.

232
0:11:03.913,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow's game.

233
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
You and I know deeper down, there's always a chance to win the crown.

234
0:11:10.47,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But when we fail to give our best,

235
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we simply haven't met the test, of giving all and saving none

236
0:11:15.263,000 --> 0:11:16,000
until the game is really won;

237
0:11:17.01,000 --> 0:11:19,000
of showing what is meant by grit;

238
0:11:19.428,000 --> 0:11:21,000
of playing through when others quit;

239
0:11:21.532,000 --> 0:11:22,000
of playing through, not letting up.

240
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's bearing down that wins the cup.

241
0:11:25.023,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Of dreaming there's a goal ahead; of hoping when our dreams are dead;

242
0:11:28.404,000 --> 0:11:31,000
of praying when our hopes have fled; yet losing, not afraid to fall,

243
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
if, bravely, we have given all.

244
0:11:33.995,000 --> 0:11:36,000
For who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span.

245
0:11:37.874,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Giving all, it seems to me, is not so far from victory.

246
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And so the Fates are seldom wrong, no matter how they twist and wind.

247
0:11:45.47,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It's you and I who make our fates --

248
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind."

249
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us:

250
0:11:55.709,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Don't whine. Don't complain. Don't make excuses.

251
0:11:58.826,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Just get out there,

252
0:12:00.088,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and whatever you're doing, do it to the best of your ability.

253
0:12:02.992,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And no one can do more than that.

254
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I tried to get across, too, that --

255
0:12:08.065,000 --> 0:12:11,000
my opponents will tell you -- you never heard me mention winning.

256
0:12:11.169,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Never mention winning.

257
0:12:12.722,000 --> 0:12:17,000
My idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game,

258
0:12:18.324,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and you can win when you're outscored.

259
0:12:20.514,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I've felt that way on certain occasions, at various times.

260
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And I just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game.

261
0:12:29.47,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I used to say that when a game is over,

262
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome,

263
0:12:34.565,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I hope they couldn't tell by your actions

264
0:12:37.621,000 --> 0:12:42,000
whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you.

265
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
That's what really matters:

266
0:12:44.731,000 --> 0:12:47,000
if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly,

267
0:12:48.515,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the results will be about what they should be.

268
0:12:51.226,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Not necessarily what you'd want them to be but they'll be about what they should;

269
0:12:55.13,000 --> 0:12:57,000
only you will know whether you can do that.

270
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
And that's what I wanted from them more than anything else.

271
0:13:00.832,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And as time went by, and I learned more about other things,

272
0:13:03.634,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I think it worked a little better,

273
0:13:05.515,000 --> 0:13:06,000
as far as the results.

274
0:13:07.182,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things,

275
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and not the end itself.

276
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I believe it was one great philosopher who said --

277
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
no, no -- Cervantes.

278
0:13:22.122,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Cervantes said, "The journey is better than the end."

279
0:13:27.398,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And I like that.

280
0:13:29.231,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I think that it is -- it's getting there.

281
0:13:31.486,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Sometimes when you get there, there's almost a let down.

282
0:13:34.201,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But it's the getting there that's the fun.

283
0:13:36.249,000 --> 0:13:4,000
As a basketball coach at UCLA, I liked our practices to be the journey,

284
0:13:41.027,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and the game would be the end, the end result.

285
0:13:44.341,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play,

286
0:13:47.523,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and see whether I'd done a decent job during the week.

287
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
There again, it's getting the players to get that self-satisfaction,

288
0:13:55.767,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable.

289
0:14:04.667,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Sometimes I'm asked who was the best player I had, or the best teams.

290
0:14:09.517,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I can never answer that.

291
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
As far as the individuals are concerned --

292
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I was asked one time about that,

293
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and they said,

294
0:14:19.352,000 --> 0:14:23,000
"Suppose that you, in some way, could make the perfect player.

295
0:14:24.191,000 --> 0:14:25,000
What would you want?"

296
0:14:25.375,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And I said, "Well, I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA:

297
0:14:28.375,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to get an education, he was a good student,

298
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
really knew why he was there in the first place.

299
0:14:33.684,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But I'd want one that could play, too.

300
0:14:35.574,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I'd want one to realize that defense usually wins championships,

301
0:14:39.763,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and who would work hard on defense.

302
0:14:41.858,000 --> 0:14:43,000
But I'd want one who would play offense, too.

303
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I'd want him to be unselfish,

304
0:14:46.461,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time.

305
0:14:49.628,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And I'd want one that could pass and would pass.

306
0:14:52.764,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Laughter)

307
0:14:53.985,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I've had some that could and wouldn't,

308
0:14:55.929,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and I've had some that would and could.

309
0:14:58.055,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Laughter)

310
0:14:59.714,000 --> 0:15:,000
So, yeah, I'd want that.

311
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside.

312
0:15:04.961,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I wanted them to be good inside too.

313
0:15:07.342,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Laughter)

314
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends, too.

315
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Why not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.

316
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
He had the qualifications.

317
0:15:19.056,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Not the only one, but he was one that I used in that particular category,

318
0:15:23.787,000 --> 0:15:25,000
because I think he made the effort to become the best.

319
0:15:26.795,000 --> 0:15:27,000
There was a couple.

320
0:15:27.985,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I mention in my book, "They Call Me Coach,"

321
0:15:30.955,000 --> 0:15:32,000
two players that gave me great satisfaction,

322
0:15:33.28,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that came as close as I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential:

323
0:15:37.026,000 --> 0:15:39,000
one was Conrad Burke, and one was Doug McIntosh.

324
0:15:39.445,000 --> 0:15:42,000
When I saw them as freshmen, on our freshmen team --

325
0:15:42.963,000 --> 0:15:44,000
freshmen couldn't play varsity when I taught.

326
0:15:45.837,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I thought, "Oh gracious, if these two players, either one of them" --

327
0:15:49.161,000 --> 0:15:52,000
they were different years, but I thought about each one at the time he was there --

328
0:15:53.137,000 --> 0:15:54,000
"Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,

329
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
our varsity must be pretty miserable, if he's good enough to make it."

330
0:15:58.94,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And you know, one of them was a starting player for a season and a half.

331
0:16:04.895,000 --> 0:16:09,000
The other one, his next year, played 32 minutes in a national championship game,

332
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Did a tremendous job for us.

333
0:16:11.889,000 --> 0:16:14,000
The next year, he was a starting player on the national championship team,

334
0:16:15.788,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and here I thought he'd never play a minute, when he was --

335
0:16:18.994,000 --> 0:16:22,000
so those are the things that give you great joy,

336
0:16:23.695,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and great satisfaction to see.

337
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well.

338
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But they had outstanding shooting percentages,

339
0:16:30.375,000 --> 0:16:32,000
because they didn't force it.

340
0:16:32.636,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And neither one could jump very well,

341
0:16:35.342,000 --> 0:16:38,000
but they kept good position, and so they did well rebounding.

342
0:16:38.786,000 --> 0:16:41,000
They remembered that every shot that's taken, they assumed would be missed.

343
0:16:42.494,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I've had too many stand around and wait to see if it's missed,

344
0:16:45.452,000 --> 0:16:49,000
then they go and it's too late, somebody else is in there ahead of them.

345
0:16:50.113,000 --> 0:16:52,000
They weren't very quick, but they played good position,

346
0:16:52.751,000 --> 0:16:53,000
kept in good balance.

347
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And so they played pretty good defense for us.

348
0:16:56.715,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So they had qualities that -- they came close to --

349
0:16:59.892,000 --> 0:17:02,000
as close to reaching possibly their full potential

350
0:17:03.333,000 --> 0:17:05,000
as any players I ever had.

351
0:17:05.626,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So I consider them to be as successful as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,

352
0:17:12.127,000 --> 0:17:13,000
or many of the others that we had;

353
0:17:13.88,000 --> 0:17:16,000
there were some outstanding players.

354
0:17:18.777,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Have I rambled enough?

355
0:17:20.866,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I was told that when he makes his appearance, I was supposed to shut up.

356
0:17:25.017,000 --> 0:17:26,000
(Laughter)

357
0:17:26.311,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Applause)

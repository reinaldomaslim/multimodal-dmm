1
0:00:13.646,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is Sian Ka'an.

2
0:00:16.145,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Just south of Tulum on Mexico's Caribbean coast,

3
0:00:19.688,000 --> 0:00:21,000
it's a federally protected reserve,

4
0:00:22.065,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a UNESCO World Heritage Site

5
0:00:24.228,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet.

6
0:00:27.157,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But when I first visited in 2010,

7
0:00:29.162,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was horrified and completely confused

8
0:00:32.118,000 --> 0:00:34,000
as to why the beach was covered in trash.

9
0:00:34.589,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I soon realized that it was floating in from all over the world.

10
0:00:39.432,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I've since returned, after that first journey,

11
0:00:41.832,000 --> 0:00:42,000
several times a year

12
0:00:43.253,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to visit Sian Ka'an, to the country of my birth,

13
0:00:45.741,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to work with this trash.

14
0:00:47.225,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And so far,

15
0:00:48.407,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we've documented garbage from 58 different countries and territories

16
0:00:52.853,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on six continents,

17
0:00:54.454,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all washing ashore in this paradise in Mexico.

18
0:00:58.363,000 --> 0:01:,000
Although I can never know where a product was dropped,

19
0:01:01.001,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I can, at times, based on the label, know where something was made.

20
0:01:04.982,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In red, you see all of the countries represented by their trash

21
0:01:08.902,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in Sian Ka'an.

22
0:01:11.65,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Such as these Haitian butter containers in all shapes and sizes,

23
0:01:15.627,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Jamaican water bottles.

24
0:01:17.215,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Not surprisingly, a lot of the stuff is from neighboring Caribbean countries,

25
0:01:20.913,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but the stuff is from everywhere.

26
0:01:22.527,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Here's a sampling of international water bottles.

27
0:01:24.933,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And one of the ironies is that a lot of what I'm finding

28
0:01:28.08,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are products for cleaning and beautification,

29
0:01:31.829,000 --> 0:01:33,000
such as this item from the United States,

30
0:01:34.531,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which is actually made to protect your plastic,

31
0:01:37.385,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:38.911,000 --> 0:01:4,000
shampoo from South Korea,

33
0:01:41.296,000 --> 0:01:42,000
bleach from Costa Rica

34
0:01:42.858,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and a Norwegian toilet cleaner.

35
0:01:44.848,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And it's items that are all very familiar to us,

36
0:01:47.465,000 --> 0:01:5,000
or at least I hope you're familiar with these toothbrushes.

37
0:01:50.89,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:52.601,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Kitchen utensils.

39
0:01:55.552,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Toys.

40
0:01:58.09,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'm also finding evidence of burning plastic trash,

41
0:02:01.715,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which releases cancer-causing fumes into the air.

42
0:02:04.958,000 --> 0:02:06,000
People ask what's the most interesting item that I've found,

43
0:02:07.845,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and that's by far this prosthetic leg.

44
0:02:11.396,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And in the background, if you can see that blue little bottle cap,

45
0:02:14.554,000 --> 0:02:15,000
at the time that I found it,

46
0:02:15.952,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it was actually the home to this little hermit crab.

47
0:02:18.535,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This guy is so cute.

48
0:02:19.854,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:23.38,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:26.235,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And it's these fascinating objects,

51
0:02:29.562,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but also horrifying objects,

52
0:02:31.774,000 --> 0:02:32,000
each with their own history,

53
0:02:33.319,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that I use to make my ephemeral, environmental artworks.

54
0:02:37.456,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And it all started with this image in February of 2010,

55
0:02:40.276,000 --> 0:02:41,000
when I first visited Sian Ka'an.

56
0:02:41.917,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I noticed that blue was the most prevalent color among the plastic.

57
0:02:45.792,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Purple is actually the most rare color. It's kind of like gold to me.

58
0:02:49.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But blue is the most prevalent,

59
0:02:50.643,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and so I gathered some of the blues

60
0:02:52.361,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and made this little arrangement in front of the blue sky

61
0:02:55.079,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and blue Caribbean waters.

62
0:02:56.989,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And when I took a photograph and looked at the test shot,

63
0:02:59.71,000 --> 0:03:01,000
it was like a lightning bolt hit me in that moment,

64
0:03:02.532,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I knew I was going to have to come back

65
0:03:04.586,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to create a whole series of installations on location

66
0:03:08.138,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and photograph them.

67
0:03:09.786,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So this turned out to be a sketch

68
0:03:11.672,000 --> 0:03:15,000
for a work that I completed three years later.

69
0:03:15.763,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I had no idea that almost 10 years later,

70
0:03:18.141,000 --> 0:03:2,000
almost a decade later, I'd still be working on it.

71
0:03:20.883,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But the problem persists.

72
0:03:23.242,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So I'm going to show you some of the images

73
0:03:25.306,000 --> 0:03:29,000
from the series that I called "Washed Up: Transforming a Trashed Landscape."

74
0:03:29.996,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Please keep in mind that I do not paint the garbage.

75
0:03:33.319,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I'm collecting it and organizing it by color

76
0:03:35.537,000 --> 0:03:37,000
on the same beaches where I find it.

77
0:03:46.381,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This is my precious trash pile as seen in 2015

78
0:03:50.354,000 --> 0:03:53,000
after putting on a first edition of the "Museo de la Basura,"

79
0:03:53.873,000 --> 0:03:54,000
or "Museum of Garbage."

80
0:03:56.409,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's fully my intention to care for this garbage,

81
0:03:59.546,000 --> 0:04:,000
to exalt it,

82
0:04:00.725,000 --> 0:04:01,000
put it on a pedestal

83
0:04:01.9,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and to curate it.

84
0:04:03.251,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We have all seen devastating images

85
0:04:05.734,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of animals dying with plastic in their bellies.

86
0:04:08.121,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And it's so important for us to really see those

87
0:04:10.946,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and to take those in.

88
0:04:12.375,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But it's by making aesthetic -- some might say beautiful -- arrangements

89
0:04:16.163,000 --> 0:04:17,000
out of the world's waste,

90
0:04:17.646,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that I'm trying to hook the viewer

91
0:04:20.324,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to draw in those that might be numb to the horrors of the world

92
0:04:23.595,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and give them a different way to understand what's happening.

93
0:04:27.483,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Some have described the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

94
0:04:30.02,000 --> 0:04:32,000
as an island twice the size of Texas,

95
0:04:32.179,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but I've been told that it's hard to see

96
0:04:34.194,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because it's more like a smog.

97
0:04:36.173,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So through my artwork,

98
0:04:37.83,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I attempt to depict the reality of what's happening with our environment

99
0:04:41.762,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and to make the invisible visible.

100
0:04:44.57,000 --> 0:04:46,000
My key question at first, after starting the project,

101
0:04:47.105,000 --> 0:04:49,000
was, "What do I do with the garbage when I'm done?"

102
0:04:49.568,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I was told by some that it could be damaged goods

103
0:04:53.764,000 --> 0:04:56,000
after traveling across the ocean and being exposed to the elements,

104
0:04:57.29,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that it could become degraded and potentially ruin a batch of recycling.

105
0:05:02.007,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The landfill was not a happy resting place, either.

106
0:05:06.074,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And then finally, it dawned on me,

107
0:05:07.781,000 --> 0:05:1,000
after all of the effort by me and all of the people who have helped me

108
0:05:11.512,000 --> 0:05:13,000
collect and organize and clean this trash,

109
0:05:14.269,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that I should keep it.

110
0:05:15.826,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And so that's the plan,

111
0:05:18.211,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to use it and to reuse it endlessly

112
0:05:20.899,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to make more artwork

113
0:05:22.42,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and to engage communities in environmental art-making.

114
0:05:27.111,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This is an example of a community-based artwork that we did last year

115
0:05:30.869,000 --> 0:05:33,000
with the local youth of Punta Allen in Sian Ka'an.

116
0:05:34.446,000 --> 0:05:37,000
A key part of the community work are the beach cleans

117
0:05:38.096,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and education programming.

118
0:05:39.938,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And as this community around the project grows

119
0:05:42.495,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and as my trash collection grows,

120
0:05:44.621,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I really believe that the impact will as well.

121
0:05:48.031,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And so, over the years,

122
0:05:49.321,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I've become a little obsessed with my trash collection.

123
0:05:53.378,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I pack it into suitcases and travel with it.

124
0:05:57.137,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I take it on vacation with me.

125
0:05:59.276,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:00.697,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And in the latest work,

127
0:06:02.61,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I've begun to break the two-dimensional plane of the photograph.

128
0:06:06.805,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I'm really excited about this new work.

129
0:06:08.932,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I see these as living artworks

130
0:06:11.76,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that will morph and grow over time.

131
0:06:14.716,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Although my greatest wish is that I run out of the raw material

132
0:06:18.72,000 --> 0:06:19,000
for this work,

133
0:06:20.12,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we're not there yet.

134
0:06:21.423,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So in the next phase of the project,

135
0:06:23.293,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I plan on continuing the community work

136
0:06:25.722,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and making my own work at a much larger scale,

137
0:06:28.27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
because the problem is massive.

138
0:06:31.93,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Eight million tons of plastic waste enter our oceans every year,

139
0:06:38.267,000 --> 0:06:39,000
destroying ecosystems.

140
0:06:40.504,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Right now, as I speak, there's literally an oil spill of plastic happening.

141
0:06:46.17,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I see this project as a plea for help and a call to action.

142
0:06:52.068,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Our health and future is inextricably linked

143
0:06:54.869,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to that of our oceans.

144
0:06:56.153,000 --> 0:07:,000
I call the project "Washed Up: Transforming a Trashed Landscape,"

145
0:07:00.557,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but it's actually transformed me

146
0:07:02.415,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and made me rethink my own behaviors and consumption.

147
0:07:05.748,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And if it can help anybody else gain more awareness,

148
0:07:08.998,000 --> 0:07:09,000
then it will have been worthwhile.

149
0:07:10.96,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Thank you so much.

150
0:07:12.135,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Applause)

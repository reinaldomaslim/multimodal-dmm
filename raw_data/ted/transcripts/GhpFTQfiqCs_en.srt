1
0:00:13.478,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Francesca Fedeli: Ciao.

2
0:00:15.375,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So he's Mario. He's our son.

3
0:00:18.931,000 --> 0:00:2,000
He was born two and a half years ago,

4
0:00:21.79,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I had a pretty tough pregnancy

5
0:00:25.003,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because I had to stay still in a bed for, like, eight months.

6
0:00:29.153,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But in the end everything seemed to be under control.

7
0:00:32.212,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So he got the right weight at birth.

8
0:00:35.066,000 --> 0:00:37,000
He got the right Apgar index.

9
0:00:37.213,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So we were pretty reassured by this.

10
0:00:40.298,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But at the end, 10 days later after he was born,

11
0:00:47.15,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we discovered that he had a stroke.

12
0:00:49.697,000 --> 0:00:5,000
As you might know,

13
0:00:51.567,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a stroke is a brain injury.

14
0:00:54.133,000 --> 0:00:56,000
A perinatal stroke could be something

15
0:00:56.843,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy

16
0:01:00.758,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or just suddenly after the birth,

17
0:01:03.35,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and in his case, as you can see,

18
0:01:06.247,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the right part of his brain has gone.

19
0:01:10.439,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body

20
0:01:15.93,000 --> 0:01:18,000
could be the fact that he couldn't be able to control

21
0:01:19.174,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the left side of his body.

22
0:01:21.95,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Just imagine, if you have a computer and a printer

23
0:01:25.775,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and you want to transmit, to input to print out a document,

24
0:01:29.964,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but the printer doesn't have the right drives,

25
0:01:33.408,000 --> 0:01:35,000
so the same is for Mario.

26
0:01:36.192,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's just like, he would like to move his left side

27
0:01:39.212,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of his body, but he's not able to transmit the right input

28
0:01:43.155,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to move his left arm and left leg.

29
0:01:48.035,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So life had to change.

30
0:01:50.277,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We needed to change our schedule.

31
0:01:52.316,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We needed to change the impact that this birth had

32
0:01:58.227,000 --> 0:02:,000
on our life.

33
0:02:00.938,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Roberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine,

34
0:02:02.94,000 --> 0:02:04,000
unfortunately, we were not ready.

35
0:02:05.236,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities,

36
0:02:09.291,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and as many questions as possible started

37
0:02:11.378,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to come to our minds.

38
0:02:13.31,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And that has been really a tough time.

39
0:02:16.339,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Questions, some basics, like, you know,

40
0:02:18.636,000 --> 0:02:2,000
why did this happen to us?

41
0:02:20.816,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And what went wrong?

42
0:02:22.811,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Some more tough, like, really,

43
0:02:25.314,000 --> 0:02:26,000
what will be the impact on Mario's life?

44
0:02:27.021,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I mean, at the end, will he be able to work?

45
0:02:29.141,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Will he be able to be normal?

46
0:02:30.595,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And, you know, as a parent, especially for the first time,

47
0:02:33.82,000 --> 0:02:36,000
why is he not going to be better than us?

48
0:02:37.262,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And this, indeed, really is tough to say,

49
0:02:40.54,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but a few months later, we realized that

50
0:02:43.328,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we were really feeling like a failure.

51
0:02:46.588,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I mean, the only real product of our life,

52
0:02:49.609,000 --> 0:02:5,000
at the end, was a failure.

53
0:02:51.449,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And you know, it was not a failure for ourselves in itself,

54
0:02:57.375,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but it was a failure that will impact his full life.

55
0:03:02.113,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Honestly, we went down.

56
0:03:03.887,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I mean we went really down, but at the end,

57
0:03:07.422,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we started to look at him,

58
0:03:09.316,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and we said, we have to react.

59
0:03:11.565,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So immediately, as Francesca said, we changed our life.

60
0:03:14.443,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We started physiotherapy, we started the rehabilitation,

61
0:03:17.9,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and one of the paths that we were following

62
0:03:19.972,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot.

63
0:03:22.977,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Basically, we spent months doing this with Mario.

64
0:03:26.768,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You have an object, and we showed him

65
0:03:29.613,000 --> 0:03:3,000
how to grab the object.

66
0:03:31.634,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, the theory of mirror neurons simply says

67
0:03:34.218,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that in your brains, exactly now, as you watch me doing this,

68
0:03:38.39,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you are activating exactly the same neurons

69
0:03:40.9,000 --> 0:03:43,000
as if you do the actions.

70
0:03:44.137,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation.

71
0:03:48.133,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But one day we found that Mario

72
0:03:51.985,000 --> 0:03:54,000
was not looking at our hand.

73
0:03:55.36,000 --> 0:03:57,000
He was looking at us.

74
0:03:57.934,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We were his mirror.

75
0:04:00.129,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the problem, as you might feel,

76
0:04:02.177,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is that we were down, we were depressed,

77
0:04:04.622,000 --> 0:04:06,000
we were looking at him as a problem,

78
0:04:06.994,000 --> 0:04:1,000
not as a son, not from a positive perspective.

79
0:04:11.499,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And that day really changed our perspective.

80
0:04:14.739,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We realized that we had to become

81
0:04:18.059,000 --> 0:04:2,000
a better mirror for Mario.

82
0:04:20.626,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We restarted from our strengths,

83
0:04:22.714,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and at the same time we restarted from his strengths.

84
0:04:26.417,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We stopped looking at him as a problem,

85
0:04:29.115,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve.

86
0:04:33.515,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And really, this was the change,

87
0:04:36.073,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and from our side, we said,

88
0:04:39.232,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario?"

89
0:04:42.379,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And we started from our passions.

90
0:04:43.975,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I mean, at the end, my wife and myself

91
0:04:45.809,000 --> 0:04:46,000
are quite different,

92
0:04:47.033,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but we have many things in common.

93
0:04:49.121,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We love to travel, we love music,

94
0:04:51.343,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we love to be in places like this,

95
0:04:53.184,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and we started to bring Mario with us

96
0:04:55.269,000 --> 0:04:59,000
just to show to him the best things that we can show to him.

97
0:04:59.967,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This short video is from last week.

98
0:05:05.168,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I am not saying --

99
0:05:06.773,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Applause) —

100
0:05:08.618,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message,

101
0:05:11.262,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because we are just at the beginning of the path.

102
0:05:13.811,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But we want to share what was the key learning,

103
0:05:17.433,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the key learning that Mario drove to us,

104
0:05:19.715,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and it is to consider what you have as a gift

105
0:05:22.059,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and not only what you miss,

106
0:05:26.747,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity.

107
0:05:30.94,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And this is the message that we want to share with you.

108
0:05:33.584,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This is why we are here.

109
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Mario!

110
0:05:39.235,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And this is why --

111
0:05:40.998,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Applause) —

112
0:05:45.6,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And this is why

113
0:05:50.822,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him.

114
0:05:56.308,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we thank you so much, all of you.

115
0:05:59.242,000 --> 0:06:01,000
FF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye.

116
0:06:01.365,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

117
0:06:05.202,000 --> 0:06:09,000
FF: Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.736,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I bring you greetings

2
0:00:14.294,000 --> 0:00:16,000
from the 52nd-freest nation on earth.

3
0:00:18.084,000 --> 0:00:22,000
As an American, it irritates me that my nation keeps sinking

4
0:00:22.793,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the annual rankings published by Freedom House.

5
0:00:25.667,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm the son of immigrants.

6
0:00:27.423,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My parents were born in China during war and revolution,

7
0:00:30.786,000 --> 0:00:32,000
went to Taiwan and then came to the United States,

8
0:00:33.786,000 --> 0:00:34,000
which means all my life,

9
0:00:35.36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've been acutely aware just how fragile an inheritance freedom truly is.

10
0:00:41.364,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That's why I spend my time teaching, preaching and practicing democracy.

11
0:00:46.76,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I have no illusions.

12
0:00:48.626,000 --> 0:00:49,000
All around the world now,

13
0:00:49.912,000 --> 0:00:51,000
people are doubting whether democracy can deliver.

14
0:00:53.276,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Autocrats and demagogues seem emboldened,

15
0:00:55.738,000 --> 0:00:56,000
even cocky.

16
0:00:57.261,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The free world feels leaderless.

17
0:01:00.086,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And yet, I remain hopeful.

18
0:01:03.406,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I don't mean optimistic.

19
0:01:05.393,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Optimism is for spectators.

20
0:01:07.515,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Hope implies agency.

21
0:01:09.976,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It says I have a hand in the outcome.

22
0:01:12.301,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Democratic hope requires faith

23
0:01:14.762,000 --> 0:01:17,000
not in a strongman or a charismatic savior

24
0:01:18.078,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but in each other,

25
0:01:20.081,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and it forces us to ask: How can we become worthy of such faith?

26
0:01:26.885,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I believe we are at a moment of moral awakening,

27
0:01:30.027,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the kind that comes when old certainties collapse.

28
0:01:33.496,000 --> 0:01:36,000
At the heart of that awakening is what I call "civic religion."

29
0:01:38.31,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And today, I want to talk about what civic religion is,

30
0:01:42.349,000 --> 0:01:43,000
how we practice it,

31
0:01:43.976,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and why it matters now more than ever.

32
0:01:46.46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Let me start with the what.

33
0:01:48.932,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I define civic religion as a system of shared beliefs and collective practices

34
0:01:54.125,000 --> 0:01:57,000
by which the members of a self-governing community

35
0:01:57.836,000 --> 0:01:58,000
choose to live like citizens.

36
0:02:00.643,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, when I say "citizen" here, I'm not referring to papers or passports.

37
0:02:04.287,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I'm talking about a deeper, broader, ethical conception

38
0:02:07.528,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of being a contributor to community, a member of the body.

39
0:02:12.12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
To speak of civic religion as religion is not poetic license.

40
0:02:16.626,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That's because democracy

41
0:02:17.801,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is one of the most faith-fueled human activities there is.

42
0:02:21.84,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Democracy works only when enough of us believe democracy works.

43
0:02:26.611,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It is at once a gamble and a miracle.

44
0:02:30.437,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Its legitimacy comes not from the outer frame of constitutional rules,

45
0:02:35.474,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but from the inner workings of civic spirit.

46
0:02:39.633,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Civic religion, like any religion,

47
0:02:42.03,000 --> 0:02:46,000
contains a sacred creed, sacred deeds and sacred rituals.

48
0:02:47.055,000 --> 0:02:51,000
My creed includes words like "equal protection of the laws"

49
0:02:51.828,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and "we the people."

50
0:02:53.713,000 --> 0:02:57,000
My roll call of hallowed deeds includes abolition, women's suffrage,

51
0:02:58.27,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the civil rights movement,

52
0:02:59.894,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the Allied landing at Normandy,

53
0:03:02.232,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the fall of the Berlin Wall.

54
0:03:04.655,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I have a new civic ritual that I'll tell you about in a moment.

55
0:03:09.337,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Wherever on earth you're from,

56
0:03:11.225,000 --> 0:03:15,000
you can find or make your own set of creed, deed and ritual.

57
0:03:16.423,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The practice of civic religion is not about worship of the state

58
0:03:20.697,000 --> 0:03:22,000
or obedience to a ruling party.

59
0:03:23.103,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It is about commitment to one another

60
0:03:24.957,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and our common ideals.

61
0:03:26.943,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And the sacredness of civic religion is not about divinity or the supernatural.

62
0:03:32.572,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It is about a group of unlike people

63
0:03:35.342,000 --> 0:03:38,000
speaking into being our alikeness,

64
0:03:38.464,000 --> 0:03:39,000
our groupness.

65
0:03:41.293,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Perhaps now you're getting a little worried

66
0:03:43.353,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that I'm trying to sell you on a cult.

67
0:03:45.503,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Relax, I'm not.

68
0:03:47.381,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I don't need to sell you.

69
0:03:49.172,000 --> 0:03:52,000
As a human, you are always in the market for a cult,

70
0:03:52.888,000 --> 0:03:54,000
for some variety of religious experience.

71
0:03:55.735,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We are wired to seek cosmological explanations,

72
0:03:59.096,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to sacralize beliefs that unite us in transcendent purpose.

73
0:04:03.556,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Humans make religion because humans make groups.

74
0:04:07.262,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The only choice we have is whether to activate that groupness for good.

75
0:04:12.204,000 --> 0:04:15,000
If you are a devout person, you know this.

76
0:04:15.294,000 --> 0:04:16,000
If you are not,

77
0:04:16.95,000 --> 0:04:17,000
if you no longer go to prayer services

78
0:04:18.816,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or never did,

79
0:04:20.504,000 --> 0:04:23,000
then perhaps you'll say that yoga is your religion,

80
0:04:24.303,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or Premier League football,

81
0:04:26.863,000 --> 0:04:28,000
or knitting, or coding or TED Talks.

82
0:04:30.95,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But whether you believe in a God or in the absence of gods,

83
0:04:35.463,000 --> 0:04:38,000
civic religion does not require you to renounce your beliefs.

84
0:04:39.265,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It requires you only to show up as a citizen.

85
0:04:43.578,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that brings me to my second topic:

86
0:04:46.099,000 --> 0:04:48,000
how we can practice civic religion productively.

87
0:04:50.293,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Let me tell you now about that new civic ritual.

88
0:04:52.977,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's called "Civic Saturday,"

89
0:04:54.922,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and it follows the arc of a faith gathering.

90
0:04:57.724,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We sing together,

91
0:04:59.089,000 --> 0:05:02,000
we turn to the strangers next to us to discuss a common question,

92
0:05:04.199,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we hear poetry and scripture,

93
0:05:06.366,000 --> 0:05:08,000
there's a sermon that ties those texts

94
0:05:09.2,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to the ethical choices and controversies of our time,

95
0:05:12.889,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but the song and scripture and the sermon

96
0:05:15.405,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are not from church or synagogue or mosque.

97
0:05:18.082,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They are civic,

98
0:05:19.478,000 --> 0:05:21,000
drawn from our shared civic ideals

99
0:05:21.656,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and a shared history of claiming and contesting those ideals.

100
0:05:27.016,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Afterwards, we form up in circles to organize rallies, register voters,

101
0:05:32.557,000 --> 0:05:34,000
join new clubs, make new friends.

102
0:05:36.243,000 --> 0:05:38,000
My colleagues and I started organizing Civic Saturdays

103
0:05:39.101,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in Seattle in 2016.

104
0:05:41.425,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Since then, they have spread across the continent.

105
0:05:44.315,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Sometimes hundreds attend, sometimes dozens.

106
0:05:47.581,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They happen in libraries and community centers

107
0:05:50.284,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and coworking spaces,

108
0:05:51.658,000 --> 0:05:53,000
under festive tents and inside great halls.

109
0:05:55.114,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There's nothing high-tech about this social technology.

110
0:05:59.115,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It speaks to a basic human yearning for face-to-face fellowship.

111
0:06:04.374,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It draws young and old, left and right,

112
0:06:07.951,000 --> 0:06:09,000
poor and rich, churched and unchurched,

113
0:06:10.777,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of all races.

114
0:06:13.13,000 --> 0:06:17,000
When you come to a Civic Saturday and are invited to discuss a question

115
0:06:18.102,000 --> 0:06:2,000
like "Who are you responsible for?"

116
0:06:20.329,000 --> 0:06:26,000
or "What are you willing to risk or to give up for your community?"

117
0:06:27.363,000 --> 0:06:29,000
When that happens, something moves.

118
0:06:29.427,000 --> 0:06:3,000
You are moved.

119
0:06:31.298,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You start telling your story.

120
0:06:33.12,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We start actually seeing one another.

121
0:06:35.83,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You realize that homelessness, gun violence, gentrification,

122
0:06:40.135,000 --> 0:06:43,000
terrible traffic, mistrust of newcomers, fake news --

123
0:06:43.617,000 --> 0:06:45,000
these things aren't someone else's problem,

124
0:06:46.048,000 --> 0:06:49,000
they are the aggregation of your own habits and omissions.

125
0:06:50.319,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Society becomes how you behave.

126
0:06:55.484,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We are never asked to reflect on the content of our citizenship.

127
0:07:01.244,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Most of us are never invited to do more or to be more,

128
0:07:06.968,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and most of us have no idea how much we crave that invitation.

129
0:07:13.014,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We've since created a civic seminary

130
0:07:15.334,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to start training people from all over to lead Civic Saturday gatherings

131
0:07:19.127,000 --> 0:07:2,000
on their own, in their own towns.

132
0:07:21.865,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In the community of Athens, Tennessee,

133
0:07:24.251,000 --> 0:07:26,000
a feisty leader named Whitney Kimball Coe

134
0:07:26.856,000 --> 0:07:28,000
leads hers in an art and framing shop

135
0:07:29.333,000 --> 0:07:31,000
with a youth choir and lots of little flags.

136
0:07:32.205,000 --> 0:07:34,000
A young activist named Berto Aguayo

137
0:07:34.439,000 --> 0:07:36,000
led his Civic Saturday on a street corner

138
0:07:36.908,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in the Back of the Yards neighborhood of Chicago.

139
0:07:39.895,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Berto was once involved with gangs.

140
0:07:42.186,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, he's keeping the peace

141
0:07:44.702,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and organizing political campaigns.

142
0:07:47.705,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In Honolulu, Rafael Bergstrom,

143
0:07:50.525,000 --> 0:07:54,000
a former pro baseball player turned photographer and conservationist,

144
0:07:55.188,000 --> 0:07:57,000
leads his under the banner "Civics IS Sexy."

145
0:07:58.793,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It is.

146
0:07:59.968,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

147
0:08:02.615,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Sometimes I'm asked, even by our seminarians:

148
0:08:05.03,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"Isn't it dangerous to use religious language?

149
0:08:07.978,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Won't that just make our politics even more dogmatic and self-righteous?"

150
0:08:12.382,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But this view assumes that all religion is fanatical fundamentalism.

151
0:08:16.99,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It is not.

152
0:08:18.767,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Religion is also moral discernment,

153
0:08:22.625,000 --> 0:08:23,000
an embrace of doubt,

154
0:08:24.581,000 --> 0:08:27,000
a commitment to detach from self and serve others,

155
0:08:28.118,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a challenge to repair the world.

156
0:08:31.057,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In this sense, politics could stand to be a little more like religion,

157
0:08:35.382,000 --> 0:08:36,000
not less.

158
0:08:37.747,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Thus, my final topic today:

159
0:08:40.32,000 --> 0:08:42,000
why civic religion matters now.

160
0:08:43.544,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I want to offer two reasons.

161
0:08:45.493,000 --> 0:08:48,000
One is to counter the culture of hyperindividualism.

162
0:08:50.193,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Every message we get from every screen and surface

163
0:08:53.4,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of the modern marketplace

164
0:08:55.262,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is that each of us is on our own,

165
0:08:57.067,000 --> 0:08:58,000
a free agent,

166
0:08:58.645,000 --> 0:09:,000
free to manage our own brands,

167
0:09:00.909,000 --> 0:09:01,000
free to live under bridges,

168
0:09:02.941,000 --> 0:09:03,000
free to have side hustles,

169
0:09:04.961,000 --> 0:09:06,000
free to die alone without insurance.

170
0:09:08.027,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Market liberalism tells us we are masters beholden to none,

171
0:09:12.029,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but then it enslaves us

172
0:09:15.163,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in the awful isolation of consumerism and status anxiety.

173
0:09:19.005,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Audience) Yeah!

174
0:09:20.211,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Millions of us are on to the con now.

175
0:09:23.245,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We are realizing now

176
0:09:26.248,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that a free-for-all is not the same as freedom for all.

177
0:09:29.777,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Applause)

178
0:09:35.671,000 --> 0:09:37,000
What truly makes us free is being bound to others

179
0:09:38.432,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in mutual aid and obligation,

180
0:09:40.54,000 --> 0:09:44,000
having to work things out the best we can in our neighborhoods and towns,

181
0:09:44.941,000 --> 0:09:46,000
as if our fates were entwined --

182
0:09:47.06,000 --> 0:09:48,000
because they are --

183
0:09:48.47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
as if we could not secede from one another,

184
0:09:51.067,000 --> 0:09:52,000
because, in the end, we cannot.

185
0:09:53.793,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Binding ourselves this way actually liberates us.

186
0:09:57.64,000 --> 0:10:,000
It reveals that we are equal in dignity.

187
0:10:01.057,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It reminds us that rights come with responsibilities.

188
0:10:05.201,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It reminds us, in fact,

189
0:10:06.741,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that rights properly understood are responsibilities.

190
0:10:12.13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The second reason why civic religion matters now

191
0:10:15.266,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is that it offers the healthiest possible story of us and them.

192
0:10:20.536,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We talk about identity politics today as if it were something new,

193
0:10:26.885,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but it's not.

194
0:10:29.038,000 --> 0:10:31,000
All politics is identity politics,

195
0:10:31.167,000 --> 0:10:34,000
a never-ending struggle to define who truly belongs.

196
0:10:35.379,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Instead of noxious myths of blood and soil that mark some as forever outsiders,

197
0:10:40.8,000 --> 0:10:43,000
civic religion offers everyone a path to belonging

198
0:10:44.569,000 --> 0:10:48,000
based only a universal creed of contribution, participation,

199
0:10:49.298,000 --> 0:10:5,000
inclusion.

200
0:10:51.079,000 --> 0:10:55,000
In civic religion, the "us" is those who wish to serve,

201
0:10:56.018,000 --> 0:10:59,000
volunteer, vote, listen, learn, empathize, argue better,

202
0:11:00.024,000 --> 0:11:02,000
circulate power rather than hoard it.

203
0:11:02.788,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The "them" is those who don't.

204
0:11:06.25,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It is possible to judge the them harshly,

205
0:11:09.424,000 --> 0:11:1,000
but it isn't necessary,

206
0:11:11.4,000 --> 0:11:15,000
for at any time, one of them can become one of us,

207
0:11:15.973,000 --> 0:11:17,000
simply by choosing to live like a citizen.

208
0:11:19.836,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So let's welcome them in.

209
0:11:22.027,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Whitney and Berto and Rafael are gifted welcomers.

210
0:11:26.598,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Each has a distinctive, locally rooted way

211
0:11:29.716,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to make faith in democracy relatable to others.

212
0:11:33.494,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Their slang might be Appalachian or South Side or Hawaiian.

213
0:11:37.069,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Their message is the same:

214
0:11:38.974,000 --> 0:11:42,000
civic love, civic spirit, civic responsibility.

215
0:11:44.822,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Now you might think that all this civic religion stuff

216
0:11:47.419,000 --> 0:11:5,000
is just for overzealous second-generation Americans like me.

217
0:11:52.045,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But actually, it is for anyone, anywhere,

218
0:11:54.856,000 --> 0:11:56,000
who wants to kindle the bonds of trust,

219
0:11:57.138,000 --> 0:11:59,000
affection and joint action

220
0:11:59.738,000 --> 0:12:,000
needed to govern ourselves in freedom.

221
0:12:02.851,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now maybe Civic Saturdays aren't for you.

222
0:12:05.416,000 --> 0:12:06,000
That's OK.

223
0:12:06.865,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Find your own ways to foster civic habits of the heart.

224
0:12:12.36,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Many forms of beloved civic community are thriving now,

225
0:12:15.615,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in this age of awakening.

226
0:12:17.441,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Groups like Community Organizing Japan,

227
0:12:19.963,000 --> 0:12:22,000
which uses creative performative rituals of storytelling

228
0:12:23.313,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to promote equality for women.

229
0:12:26.075,000 --> 0:12:28,000
In Iceland, civil confirmations,

230
0:12:28.774,000 --> 0:12:29,000
where young people are led by an elder

231
0:12:30.795,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to learn the history and civic traditions of their society,

232
0:12:34.148,000 --> 0:12:36,000
culminating in a rite-of-passage ceremony

233
0:12:37.048,000 --> 0:12:38,000
akin to church confirmation.

234
0:12:39.984,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Ben Franklin Circles in the United States,

235
0:12:42.438,000 --> 0:12:43,000
where friends meet monthly

236
0:12:44.428,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to discuss and reflect upon the virtues that Franklin codified

237
0:12:48.017,000 --> 0:12:49,000
in his autobiography,

238
0:12:49.951,000 --> 0:12:52,000
like justice and gratitude and forgiveness.

239
0:12:55.394,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I know civic religion is not enough

240
0:12:57.903,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to remedy the radical inequities of our age.

241
0:13:01.022,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We need power for that.

242
0:13:03.323,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But power without character is a cure worse than the disease.

243
0:13:08.393,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I know civic religion alone can't fix corrupt institutions,

244
0:13:13.243,000 --> 0:13:17,000
but institutional reforms without new norms will not last.

245
0:13:18.375,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Culture is upstream of law.

246
0:13:20.519,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Spirit is upstream of policy.

247
0:13:23.001,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The soul is upstream of the state.

248
0:13:25.971,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We cannot unpollute our politics if we clean only downstream.

249
0:13:30.591,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We must get to the source.

250
0:13:32.846,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The source is our values,

251
0:13:35.752,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and on the topic of values, my advice is simple: have some.

252
0:13:40.556,000 --> 0:13:42,000
(Laughter)

253
0:13:42.999,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

254
0:13:47.528,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Make sure those values are prosocial.

255
0:13:49.98,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Put them into practice,

256
0:13:51.67,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and do so in the company of others,

257
0:13:53.902,000 --> 0:13:56,000
with a structure of creed, deed and joyful ritual

258
0:13:57.744,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that'll keep all of you coming back.

259
0:14:01.067,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Those of us who believe in democracy and believe it is still possible,

260
0:14:04.911,000 --> 0:14:06,000
we have the burden of proving it.

261
0:14:07.262,000 --> 0:14:1,000
But remember, it is no burden at all

262
0:14:10.423,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to be in a community where you are seen as fully human,

263
0:14:13.793,000 --> 0:14:15,000
where you have a say in the things that affect you,

264
0:14:16.241,000 --> 0:14:18,000
where you don't need to be connected to be respected.

265
0:14:19.884,000 --> 0:14:2,000
That is called a blessing,

266
0:14:22.171,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and it is available to all who believe.

267
0:14:25.434,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Thank you.

268
0:14:26.609,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Applause)

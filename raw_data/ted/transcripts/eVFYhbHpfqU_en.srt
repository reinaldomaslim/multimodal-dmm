1
0:00:12.423,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Do you remember these glow-in-the-dark little stars

2
0:00:14.997,000 --> 0:00:16,000
which you had on the ceiling when you were a boy or a girl?

3
0:00:17.911,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Yes?

4
0:00:19.145,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It is light.

5
0:00:20.365,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It is pure light.

6
0:00:21.573,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I think I stared at them way too long

7
0:00:23.499,000 --> 0:00:24,000
when I was a five-year-old, you know?

8
0:00:25.296,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's so beautiful:

9
0:00:26.544,000 --> 0:00:28,000
no energy bill, no maintenance.

10
0:00:29.325,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It is there.

11
0:00:30.553,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So two years ago, we went back to the lab,

12
0:00:32.634,000 --> 0:00:34,000
making it more durable, more light-emitting,

13
0:00:34.956,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with the experts.

14
0:00:36.36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And at the same time, we got a request from this guy --

15
0:00:40.065,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Van Gogh, the famous Van Gogh Foundation --

16
0:00:42.667,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who wanted to celebrate his 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.

17
0:00:47.052,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And they came to me and asked,

18
0:00:48.941,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"Can you make a place where he feels more alive again

19
0:00:52.766,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in the Netherlands?"

20
0:00:53.996,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I liked that question a lot,

21
0:00:55.574,000 --> 0:00:56,000
so in way,

22
0:00:56.752,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we sort of started to connect these two different worlds.

23
0:01:00.847,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This is how my brain works,

24
0:01:02.168,000 --> 0:01:03,000
by the way.

25
0:01:03.342,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:04.417,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I would love to keep on doing this for an hour,

27
0:01:06.652,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but OK --

28
0:01:07.827,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:08.859,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And this is the result that we made:

30
0:01:10.661,000 --> 0:01:12,000
a bicycle path which charges at daytime via the sun

31
0:01:13.407,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and glows at night, up to eight hours.

32
0:01:15.553,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Applause)

33
0:01:16.805,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Thank you.

34
0:01:18.155,000 --> 0:01:22,000
... hinting towards a future which should be energy friendly

35
0:01:22.546,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and linking up the local grounds

36
0:01:24.266,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as Van Gogh literally walked and lived there in 1883.

37
0:01:27.717,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And you can go there every night for free, no ticket needed.

38
0:01:31.048,000 --> 0:01:34,000
People experience the beauty of cycling through the starry night,

39
0:01:34.278,000 --> 0:01:36,000
thinking about green energy and safety.

40
0:01:36.327,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I want to create places where people feel connected again.

41
0:01:40.586,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And it was somehow great to make these projects happen

42
0:01:43.698,000 --> 0:01:45,000
with the industry, with the infrastructure companies.

43
0:01:46.568,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So when these sheikhs of Qatar started to call:

44
0:01:48.881,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"How much for 10 kilometers?"

45
0:01:50.406,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

46
0:01:51.445,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Yeah, really, that's a weird call you're going to get.

47
0:01:54.181,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But it's fascinating

48
0:01:55.365,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that this is not just a sort of one-off, nice-to-have special.

49
0:01:58.797,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I think this kind of creative thinking, these kinds of connections --

50
0:02:02.244,000 --> 0:02:03,000
it's the new economy.

51
0:02:03.452,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The World Economic Forum, the think tank in Geneva,

52
0:02:06.223,000 --> 0:02:08,000
did an interview with a lot of smart people

53
0:02:08.646,000 --> 0:02:09,000
all around the world,

54
0:02:09.826,000 --> 0:02:13,000
asking, "What are the top 10 skills you and I need to become successful?"

55
0:02:14.672,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And what is interesting, what you see here:

56
0:02:17.016,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it's not about money

57
0:02:19.579,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or being really good in C++,

58
0:02:22.504,000 --> 0:02:25,000
although these are great skills to have, I have to admit.

59
0:02:25.545,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But look at number three, creativity;

60
0:02:27.925,000 --> 0:02:29,000
number two, critical thinking;

61
0:02:30.161,000 --> 0:02:33,000
number one, complex problem-solving --

62
0:02:33.285,000 --> 0:02:37,000
all the things a robot or a computer is really bad at.

63
0:02:38.482,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And this makes me very optimistic, very hopeful for the new world,

64
0:02:42.159,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that as we will live in this hyper-technological world,

65
0:02:45.059,000 --> 0:02:46,000
our human skills --

66
0:02:46.525,000 --> 0:02:47,000
our desire for empathy,

67
0:02:47.893,000 --> 0:02:49,000
our desire for curiosity,

68
0:02:50.183,000 --> 0:02:51,000
our desire for beauty --

69
0:02:51.922,000 --> 0:02:52,000
will be more appreciated again,

70
0:02:53.68,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and we will live in a world where creativity is our true capital.

71
0:02:58.604,000 --> 0:03:,000
And a creative process like that --

72
0:03:01.087,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I don't know how it works for you,

73
0:03:02.81,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but in my brain, it always starts with a question:

74
0:03:05.525,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Why?

75
0:03:07.704,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Why does a jellyfish emit light?

76
0:03:10.251,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Or a firefly?

77
0:03:11.63,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Or why do be accept pollution?

78
0:03:13.9,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This is from my room in Beijing three years ago.

79
0:03:16.173,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Left image is a good day -- Saturday.

80
0:03:18.341,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I can see the cars and the people, the birds;

81
0:03:20.586,000 --> 0:03:22,000
life is OK in a dense urban city.

82
0:03:23.202,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And on the right image --

83
0:03:25.058,000 --> 0:03:26,000
holy moly.

84
0:03:26.882,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Pollution -- complete layers.

85
0:03:28.919,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I couldn't even see the other side of the city.

86
0:03:31.651,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And this image made me really sad.

87
0:03:33.511,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is not the bright future we envision here at TED --

88
0:03:36.584,000 --> 0:03:37,000
this is the horror.

89
0:03:37.781,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We live five to six years shorter;

90
0:03:39.556,000 --> 0:03:41,000
children have lung cancer when they're six years old.

91
0:03:42.648,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And so in a weird, beautiful way,

92
0:03:45.158,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I, at that moment, became inspired by Beijing smog.

93
0:03:49.669,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And the governments all around the world are fighting their war on smog,

94
0:03:53.176,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but I wanted to make something within the now.

95
0:03:55.838,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So we decided to build the largest smog vacuum cleaner

96
0:03:59.66,000 --> 0:04:,000
in the world.

97
0:04:01.095,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It sucks up polluted air, cleans it

98
0:04:03.068,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and then releases it.

99
0:04:04.516,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And we built the first one.

100
0:04:06.685,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So it sucks up 30,000 cubic meters per hour,

101
0:04:09.346,000 --> 0:04:12,000
cleans it on the nano level -- the PM2.5, PM10 particles --

102
0:04:13.157,000 --> 0:04:14,000
using very little electricity,

103
0:04:15.156,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and then releases the clean air,

104
0:04:17.647,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so we have parks, playgrounds, which are 55 to 75 percent more clean

105
0:04:23.124,000 --> 0:04:24,000
than the rest of the city.

106
0:04:24.715,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Applause)

107
0:04:26.408,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Yes!

108
0:04:27.86,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Applause)

109
0:04:29.401,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And every month or so,

110
0:04:32.322,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it opens like a spaceship --

111
0:04:36.237,000 --> 0:04:38,000
like a Marilyn Monroe with the -- well, you know what.

112
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Anyway.

113
0:04:40.134,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

114
0:04:41.234,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So this ...

115
0:04:42.708,000 --> 0:04:43,000
this is the stuff we are capturing.

116
0:04:45.13,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is Beijing smog.

117
0:04:47.58,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This is in our lungs right now.

118
0:04:49.222,000 --> 0:04:52,000
If you live next to a highway, it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day.

119
0:04:52.668,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Are we insane?

120
0:04:53.842,000 --> 0:04:54,000
When did we say yes to that?

121
0:04:55.848,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And we had buckets of this disgusting material

122
0:04:59.115,000 --> 0:05:,000
in our studio,

123
0:05:00.683,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and on a Monday morning, we were discussing, we were like,

124
0:05:03.516,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"Shit, what should we do with it? Should we throw it away?"

125
0:05:06.39,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Like, "Help!"

126
0:05:07.569,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And then we realized: no, no, no, no, no --

127
0:05:09.754,000 --> 0:05:1,000
waste should not exist.

128
0:05:10.97,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Waste for the one should be food for the other.

129
0:05:14.17,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So, here, maybe show it around.

130
0:05:16.69,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Do not put this in your coffee.

131
0:05:18.277,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:19.312,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And we realized that 42 percent is made out of carbon,

133
0:05:22.347,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and carbon, of course, under high pressure,

134
0:05:24.539,000 --> 0:05:25,000
you get ...

135
0:05:26.691,000 --> 0:05:27,000
diamonds.

136
0:05:28.119,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, inspired by that, we compress it for 30 minutes --

137
0:05:32.274,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Cracking sound)

138
0:05:33.385,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and make smog-free rings.

139
0:05:35.489,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

140
0:05:36.536,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And so by sharing -- yeah, really!

141
0:05:38.536,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And so by sharing a ring,

142
0:05:40.198,000 --> 0:05:42,000
you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air

143
0:05:42.828,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to the city the tower is in.

144
0:05:44.517,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause)

145
0:05:45.553,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I have one here --

146
0:05:46.807,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Applause)

147
0:05:48.011,000 --> 0:05:5,000
A little floating cube.

148
0:05:51.983,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I will give one to you.

149
0:05:53.157,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I'm not going to propose, don't worry.

150
0:05:55.411,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

151
0:05:56.723,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Are we good?

152
0:05:57.912,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You can show it around.

153
0:05:59.178,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And we put this online -- Kickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.

154
0:06:02.612,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And people started to preorder it,

155
0:06:04.425,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but more importantly, they started to prepay it.

156
0:06:07.279,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So the finance we made with the jewelry helped us to realize,

157
0:06:10.672,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to build the first tower.

158
0:06:12.693,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And that's powerful.

159
0:06:13.867,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So the waste the activator, it was the enabler.

160
0:06:16.528,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Also, the feedback from the community --

161
0:06:18.562,000 --> 0:06:19,000
this is a wedding couple from India,

162
0:06:20.402,000 --> 0:06:22,000
where he proposed to her with the smog-free ring

163
0:06:22.887,000 --> 0:06:23,000
as a sign of true beauty,

164
0:06:24.184,000 --> 0:06:25,000
as a sign of hope.

165
0:06:26.077,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And she said yes.

166
0:06:27.939,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

167
0:06:29.678,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I love this image so much for a lot of different reasons.

168
0:06:33.185,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

169
0:06:34.436,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And right now, the project is touring through China,

170
0:06:37.155,000 --> 0:06:39,000
actually with the support of China's central government.

171
0:06:40.051,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So the first goal is to create local clean-air parks,

172
0:06:43.168,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and that works already quite well --

173
0:06:45.192,000 --> 0:06:47,000
55, 75 percent more clean.

174
0:06:47.476,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And at the same time,

175
0:06:48.849,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we team up with the NGOs,

176
0:06:50.27,000 --> 0:06:51,000
with the governors,

177
0:06:51.458,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with the students,

178
0:06:52.682,000 --> 0:06:53,000
with the tech people,

179
0:06:53.857,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to say, "Hey, what do we need to do to make a whole city smog-free?"

180
0:06:57.236,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's about the dream of clean air.

181
0:06:59.043,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We do workshops. New ideas pop up.

182
0:07:01.313,000 --> 0:07:03,000
These are smog-free bicycles which -- I'm Dutch, yes? --

183
0:07:04.131,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I have this "bicycle DNA" inside of me somewhere.

184
0:07:06.594,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And so it sucks up polluted air,

185
0:07:08.268,000 --> 0:07:09,000
it cleans it and releases it,

186
0:07:09.851,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in the fight against the car,

187
0:07:11.368,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in the celebration of the bicycle.

188
0:07:13.273,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And so right now, we're working on a sort of "package deal," so to speak,

189
0:07:17.458,000 --> 0:07:2,000
where we say, "Smog-free towers, smog-free rings."

190
0:07:20.736,000 --> 0:07:22,000
We go to the mayors or the governors of this world,

191
0:07:23.256,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and say, "We can guarantee a short-term reduction of pollution

192
0:07:27.383,000 --> 0:07:29,000
between 20 and 40 percent.

193
0:07:29.49,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Please sign here right now."

194
0:07:31.411,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Yes?

195
0:07:32.586,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Applause)

196
0:07:34.337,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Thank you.

197
0:07:35.511,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Applause)

198
0:07:37.365,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So it's all about connecting new technology with creative thinking.

199
0:07:42.316,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And if you start thinking about that,

200
0:07:44.282,000 --> 0:07:46,000
there is so much you can imagine,

201
0:07:46.467,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so much more you can do.

202
0:07:48.014,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We worked on dance floors which produce electricity

203
0:07:51.349,000 --> 0:07:52,000
when you dance on them.

204
0:07:52.632,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We did the design for that -- 2008.

205
0:07:55.134,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So it moves eight or nine millimeters,

206
0:07:57.153,000 --> 0:07:58,000
produces 25 watts.

207
0:07:58.855,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The electricity that we generate is used for the lighting or the DJ booth.

208
0:08:02.876,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So some of the sustainability is about doing more,

209
0:08:05.564,000 --> 0:08:06,000
not about doing less.

210
0:08:07.251,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But also on a larger scale,

211
0:08:08.761,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the Netherlands, where I'm from, we live below sea level.

212
0:08:12.234,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So because of these beauties --

213
0:08:14.536,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers, built by hand in 1932 --

214
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we live with the water,

215
0:08:21.791,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we fight with the water,

216
0:08:23.345,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we try to find harmony,

217
0:08:25.515,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but sometimes we forget.

218
0:08:27.983,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And therefore, we made "Waterlicht,"

219
0:08:29.95,000 --> 0:08:31,000
a combination of LEDs and lenses,

220
0:08:32.194,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which show how high the water level would be --

221
0:08:34.832,000 --> 0:08:35,000
global change --

222
0:08:36.679,000 --> 0:08:37,000
if we stop.

223
0:08:38.228,000 --> 0:08:4,000
If, today, we all go home and we say,

224
0:08:40.953,000 --> 0:08:42,000
"Oh, whatever, somebody else will do it for us,"

225
0:08:43.398,000 --> 0:08:45,000
or we'll wait for government or whomever.

226
0:08:45.442,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You know, we're not going to do that.

227
0:08:47.332,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It goes wrong.

228
0:08:48.515,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And we placed this in public spaces all around the world.

229
0:08:51.255,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Thousands of people showed up.

230
0:08:52.87,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Applause)

231
0:08:54.142,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Thank you.

232
0:08:55.937,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You're too nice, you're too nice. That's not good for a designer.

233
0:08:59.522,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So thousands of people showed up,

234
0:09:01.546,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and some, actually, were scared.

235
0:09:03.34,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And they left; they experienced the floods in 1953.

236
0:09:06.705,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And others were mesmerized.

237
0:09:08.121,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Can we make floating cities?

238
0:09:09.964,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Can we generate electricity from the change in tides?

239
0:09:13.864,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So I think it's so important to make experiences --

240
0:09:16.839,000 --> 0:09:17,000
collective experiences --

241
0:09:18.397,000 --> 0:09:21,000
where people feel connected with a vision, with a future

242
0:09:22.075,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and trigger what is possible.

243
0:09:24.642,000 --> 0:09:25,000
At the same time,

244
0:09:26.036,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you know, these kinds of things -- they're not easy, yes?

245
0:09:30.554,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It's a struggle.

246
0:09:31.832,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And what I experienced in my life

247
0:09:33.522,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is that a lot of people say they want innovation,

248
0:09:35.945,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and they want the next and the new, the future.

249
0:09:38.567,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But the moment you present a new idea,

250
0:09:41.628,000 --> 0:09:45,000
there's this weird tendency to reply to every new idea

251
0:09:46.038,000 --> 0:09:48,000
starting with two words.

252
0:09:49.288,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Which are?

253
0:09:50.494,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Audience guesses)

254
0:09:51.864,000 --> 0:09:53,000
No, not "How much?" It's more annoying.

255
0:09:54.07,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

256
0:09:55.102,000 --> 0:09:56,000
What is it, guys?

257
0:09:56.279,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Or you're really blessed people? That's really good.

258
0:09:58.844,000 --> 0:09:59,000
"Yes, but." Very good.

259
0:10:00.064,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"Yes, but: it's too expensive, it's too cheap, it's too fast, it's too slow,

260
0:10:03.78,000 --> 0:10:06,000
it's too beautiful, it's too ugly, it cannot be done, it already exists."

261
0:10:07.287,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I heard everything about the same project

262
0:10:09.398,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in the same week.

263
0:10:10.582,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And I got really, really annoyed.

264
0:10:12.535,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I got a bit of gray hair, started to dress in black like a true architect.

265
0:10:16.797,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Laughter)

266
0:10:19.269,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And one morning I woke up and I said, "Daan, stop.

267
0:10:22.751,000 --> 0:10:23,000
This is dragging you down.

268
0:10:24.126,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You have to do something with this.

269
0:10:25.905,000 --> 0:10:27,000
You have to use it as an ingredient, as a component."

270
0:10:28.624,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And so we decided to build,

271
0:10:30.613,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to realize the famous "Yes, but" chair.

272
0:10:34.62,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Laughter)

273
0:10:38.281,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And this is an existing chair by Friso Kramer, a Dutch design.

274
0:10:41.659,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But we gave it a little "update,"

275
0:10:44.467,000 --> 0:10:46,000
a little "hack," so to speak.

276
0:10:46.822,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We placed a little voice-recognition element right here.

277
0:10:50.92,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So the moment you sit on that chair,

278
0:10:53.741,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and you say those two horrible,

279
0:10:57.051,000 --> 0:11:01,000
creative-destructive, annoying little words --

280
0:11:01.525,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Laughter)

281
0:11:02.64,000 --> 0:11:03,000
you get a short --

282
0:11:04.319,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

283
0:11:05.966,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but pretty intense

284
0:11:07.563,000 --> 0:11:09,000
little shock on the back side of your bottom.

285
0:11:10.402,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Laughter)

286
0:11:11.583,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Applause)

287
0:11:12.996,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And --

288
0:11:14.191,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Applause)

289
0:11:15.243,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and that works; yeah, that works.

290
0:11:17.065,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Some clients have left us, they got really mad.

291
0:11:19.864,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Fortunately, the good ones have stayed.

292
0:11:21.869,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And, of course, we also apply it to ourselves.

293
0:11:24.28,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But ladies and gentlemen, let's not be afraid.

294
0:11:27.45,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Let's be curious, yes?

295
0:11:29.245,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And, you know, walking through TED in these days

296
0:11:31.787,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and hearing the other speakers

297
0:11:33.51,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and feeling the energy of the crowd,

298
0:11:35.954,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I was remembering this quote of the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan,

299
0:11:40.277,000 --> 0:11:42,000
who once famously said,

300
0:11:42.316,000 --> 0:11:43,000
"On spacecraft earth,

301
0:11:44.219,000 --> 0:11:45,000
there are no passengers.

302
0:11:45.759,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We are all crew."

303
0:11:48.846,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And I think this so beautiful.

304
0:11:51.088,000 --> 0:11:52,000
This is so beautiful!

305
0:11:52.564,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We're not just consumers; we're makers:

306
0:11:54.834,000 --> 0:11:55,000
we make decisions,

307
0:11:56.064,000 --> 0:11:57,000
we make new inventions,

308
0:11:57.259,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we make new dreams.

309
0:11:58.896,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I think

310
0:12:00.081,000 --> 0:12:04,000
if we start implementing that kind of thinking even more

311
0:12:04.17,000 --> 0:12:05,000
within today,

312
0:12:06.371,000 --> 0:12:08,000
there's still a whole new world to be explored.

313
0:12:10.365,000 --> 0:12:11,000
All right, thank you.

314
0:12:11.823,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Applause)

315
0:12:13.975,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Thank you.

316
0:12:15.149,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Applause)

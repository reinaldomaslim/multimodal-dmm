2
0:00:15.917,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Some years ago, I set out to try to understand

3
0:00:18.419,000 --> 0:00:2,000
if there was a possibility to develop biofuels

4
0:00:21.147,000 --> 0:00:25,000
on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels

5
0:00:25.849,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but not compete with agriculture for water,

6
0:00:29.533,000 --> 0:00:31,000
fertilizer or land.

7
0:00:31.971,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So here's what I came up with.

8
0:00:33.501,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it

9
0:00:35.109,000 --> 0:00:37,000
just underwater, and we fill it with wastewater

10
0:00:37.387,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and some form of microalgae that produces oil,

11
0:00:40.515,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and we make it out of some kind of flexible material

12
0:00:42.675,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that moves with waves underwater,

13
0:00:44.747,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and the system that we're going to build, of course,

14
0:00:46.787,000 --> 0:00:48,000
will use solar energy to grow the algae,

15
0:00:49.107,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and they use CO2, which is good,

16
0:00:51.318,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and they produce oxygen as they grow.

17
0:00:53.683,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The algae that grow are in a container that

18
0:00:57.347,000 --> 0:00:59,000
distributes the heat to the surrounding water,

19
0:01:00.139,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and you can harvest them and make biofuels

20
0:01:02.403,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed,

21
0:01:05.083,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and of course you'd have to make a large area of this,

22
0:01:07.923,000 --> 0:01:09,000
so you'd have to worry about other stakeholders

23
0:01:10.475,000 --> 0:01:14,000
like fishermen and ships and such things, but hey,

24
0:01:14.667,000 --> 0:01:16,000
we're talking about biofuels,

25
0:01:16.93,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and we know the importance of potentially getting

26
0:01:19.132,000 --> 0:01:21,000
an alternative liquid fuel.

27
0:01:21.611,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Why are we talking about microalgae?

28
0:01:24.292,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Here you see a graph showing you the different types

29
0:01:27.979,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of crops that are being considered for making biofuels,

30
0:01:31.831,000 --> 0:01:33,000
so you can see some things like soybean,

31
0:01:34.394,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which makes 50 gallons per acre per year,

32
0:01:36.711,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and that

33
0:01:41.768,000 --> 0:01:45,000
tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute.

34
0:01:46.262,000 --> 0:01:48,000
That is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000

35
0:01:48.793,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and 5,000 gallons per acre per year,

36
0:01:51.585,000 --> 0:01:54,000
compared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.

37
0:01:54.937,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro --

38
0:01:58.201,000 --> 0:02:,000
that is, they're extremely small, as you can see here

39
0:02:00.649,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a picture of those single-celled organisms

40
0:02:03.617,000 --> 0:02:05,000
compared to a human hair.

41
0:02:05.927,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Those small organisms have been around

42
0:02:08.753,000 --> 0:02:1,000
for millions of years and there's thousands

43
0:02:10.793,000 --> 0:02:12,000
of different species of microalgae in the world,

44
0:02:13.017,000 --> 0:02:16,000
some of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet,

45
0:02:16.041,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.

46
0:02:19.233,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, why do we want to do this offshore?

47
0:02:22.521,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because

48
0:02:25.369,000 --> 0:02:29,000
if you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice,

49
0:02:29.965,000 --> 0:02:31,000
because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested,

50
0:02:32.764,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and if you look at where most of the waste water

51
0:02:34.675,000 --> 0:02:37,000
treatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.

52
0:02:38.244,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 miles

53
0:02:41.927,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of sewer pipes under the city already,

54
0:02:44.582,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and it releases its waste water offshore.

55
0:02:48.558,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So different cities around the world treat their waste water

56
0:02:52.47,000 --> 0:02:54,000
differently. Some cities process it.

57
0:02:54.838,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Some cities just release the water.

58
0:02:56.484,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But in all cases, the water that's released is

59
0:02:59.142,000 --> 0:03:01,000
perfectly adequate for growing microalgae.

60
0:03:02.102,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So let's envision what the system might look like.

61
0:03:03.767,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We call it OMEGA, which is an acronym for

62
0:03:05.869,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.

63
0:03:10.3,000 --> 0:03:12,000
At NASA, you have to have good acronyms.

64
0:03:12.852,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.

65
0:03:15.695,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We put waste water and some source of CO2

66
0:03:19.415,000 --> 0:03:22,000
into our floating structure,

67
0:03:22.462,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow,

68
0:03:26.103,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off

69
0:03:28.821,000 --> 0:03:3,000
into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.

70
0:03:31.431,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They of course use solar energy to grow,

71
0:03:33.759,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and the wave energy on the surface provides energy

72
0:03:36.31,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for mixing the algae, and the temperature

73
0:03:38.614,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is controlled by the surrounding water temperature.

74
0:03:41.174,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned,

75
0:03:44.528,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and

76
0:03:47.816,000 --> 0:03:5,000
other bi-algal products of interest.

77
0:03:51.257,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And the system is contained. What do I mean by that?

78
0:03:54.674,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It's modular. Let's say something happens that's

79
0:03:56.8,000 --> 0:03:58,000
totally unexpected to one of the modules.

80
0:03:58.994,000 --> 0:04:,000
It leaks. It's struck by lightning.

81
0:04:01.193,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The waste water that leaks out is water that already now

82
0:04:03.802,000 --> 0:04:05,000
goes into that coastal environment, and

83
0:04:06.19,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the algae that leak out are biodegradable,

84
0:04:08.438,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and because they're living in waste water,

85
0:04:09.524,000 --> 0:04:12,000
they're fresh water algae, which means they can't

86
0:04:12.593,000 --> 0:04:13,000
live in salt water, so they die.

87
0:04:14.39,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of

88
0:04:16.55,000 --> 0:04:18,000
well-known plastic that we have good experience with, and

89
0:04:19.182,000 --> 0:04:23,000
we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.

90
0:04:24.033,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about

91
0:04:27.605,000 --> 0:04:29,000
this system that I'm showing you, and that is to say

92
0:04:30.082,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water,

93
0:04:32.916,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which is also going to be an issue in the future,

94
0:04:35.282,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and we're working on methods now

95
0:04:37.119,000 --> 0:04:39,000
for recovering the waste water.

96
0:04:39.641,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The other thing to consider is the structure itself.

97
0:04:42.433,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It provides a surface for things in the ocean,

98
0:04:45.484,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and this surface, which is covered by seaweeds

99
0:04:48.727,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and other organisms in the ocean,

100
0:04:51.221,000 --> 0:04:54,000
will become enhanced marine habitat

101
0:04:55.208,000 --> 0:04:56,000
so it increases biodiversity.

102
0:04:56.871,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And finally, because it's an offshore structure,

103
0:04:58.871,000 --> 0:05:,000
we can think in terms of how it might contribute

104
0:05:01.773,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to an aquaculture activity offshore.

105
0:05:05.527,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So you're probably thinking, "Gee, this sounds

106
0:05:07.116,000 --> 0:05:11,000
like a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real?"

107
0:05:11.687,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Well, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz

108
0:05:15.502,000 --> 0:05:18,000
at the California Fish and Game facility,

109
0:05:18.664,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks

110
0:05:21.713,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to test some of these ideas.

111
0:05:23.436,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We also set up experiments in San Francisco

112
0:05:26.058,000 --> 0:05:28,000
at one of the three waste water treatment plants,

113
0:05:28.889,000 --> 0:05:3,000
again a facility to test ideas.

114
0:05:31.385,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And finally, we wanted to see where we could look at

115
0:05:34.689,000 --> 0:05:36,000
what the impact of this structure would be

116
0:05:37.393,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in the marine environment, and we set up a field site

117
0:05:41.05,000 --> 0:05:43,000
at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab

118
0:05:43.513,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor

119
0:05:45.873,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to see what impact this would have on marine organisms.

120
0:05:50.719,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.

121
0:05:53.809,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It was a place where we were growing algae

122
0:05:56.707,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and welding plastic and building tools

123
0:05:59.372,000 --> 0:06:,000
and making a lot of mistakes,

124
0:06:00.895,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or, as Edison said, we were

125
0:06:02.826,000 --> 0:06:05,000
finding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.

126
0:06:06.276,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools

127
0:06:10.522,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that allowed us to get into the lives of algae

128
0:06:13.954,000 --> 0:06:14,000
so that we could monitor the way they grow,

129
0:06:15.676,000 --> 0:06:17,000
what makes them happy, how do we make sure that

130
0:06:18.378,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.

131
0:06:22.28,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So the most important feature that we needed to develop were these

132
0:06:25.369,000 --> 0:06:27,000
so-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.

133
0:06:28.097,000 --> 0:06:29,000
These were the structures that would be floating at the

134
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:32,000
surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material

135
0:06:32.865,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lots

136
0:06:35.522,000 --> 0:06:38,000
of designs, most of which were horrible failures,

137
0:06:38.651,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and when we finally got to a design that worked,

138
0:06:40.986,000 --> 0:06:42,000
at about 30 gallons, we scaled it up

139
0:06:43.273,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to 450 gallons in San Francisco.

140
0:06:46.889,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So let me show you how the system works.

141
0:06:49.083,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it,

142
0:06:52.795,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and we circulate it through this floating structure,

143
0:06:55.501,000 --> 0:06:57,000
this tubular, flexible plastic structure,

144
0:06:58.233,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and it circulates through this thing,

145
0:06:59.726,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and there's sunlight of course, it's at the surface,

146
0:07:02.438,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and the algae grow on the nutrients.

147
0:07:04.843,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.

148
0:07:07.265,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2,

149
0:07:10.522,000 --> 0:07:1,000
as we would.

150
0:07:11.361,000 --> 0:07:13,000
They suffocate because they produce oxygen, and they

151
0:07:14.02,000 --> 0:07:16,000
don't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produce

152
0:07:16.196,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is problematic, and they use up all the CO2.

153
0:07:19.3,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could

154
0:07:21.732,000 --> 0:07:24,000
remove the oxygen, which we did by building this column

155
0:07:24.961,000 --> 0:07:25,000
which circulated some of the water,

156
0:07:26.438,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the system

157
0:07:29.808,000 --> 0:07:31,000
before we recirculated the water.

158
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And what you see here is the prototype,

159
0:07:33.964,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which was the first attempt at building this type of column.

160
0:07:37.762,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The larger column that we then installed in San Francisco

161
0:07:40.202,000 --> 0:07:41,000
in the installed system.

162
0:07:41.83,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So the column actually had another very nice feature,

163
0:07:45.228,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and that is the algae settle in the column,

164
0:07:48.345,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass

165
0:07:51.919,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in a context where we could easily harvest it.

166
0:07:54.886,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So we would remove the algaes that concentrated

167
0:07:57.661,000 --> 0:07:59,000
in the bottom of this column, and then we could

168
0:08:00.229,000 --> 0:08:03,000
harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae

169
0:08:04.052,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to the surface and can skim it off with a net.

170
0:08:07.948,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact

171
0:08:11.585,000 --> 0:08:13,000
of this system in the marine environment,

172
0:08:14.516,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site

173
0:08:17.996,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in Moss Landing Marine Lab.

174
0:08:20.236,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Well, we found of course that this material became

175
0:08:23.076,000 --> 0:08:25,000
overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop

176
0:08:25.988,000 --> 0:08:27,000
a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how

177
0:08:28.396,000 --> 0:08:3,000
seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you

178
0:08:31.333,000 --> 0:08:34,000
see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting,

179
0:08:34.356,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and would periodically work its way across this little

180
0:08:37.46,000 --> 0:08:39,000
floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy

181
0:08:40.348,000 --> 0:08:42,000
or train him to be able to clean the surface

182
0:08:42.437,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of these things, but that's for the future.

183
0:08:44.844,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now really what we were doing,

184
0:08:46.165,000 --> 0:08:47,000
we were working in four areas.

185
0:08:47.937,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Our research covered the biology of the system,

186
0:08:50.82,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which included studying the way algae grew,

187
0:08:52.988,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.

188
0:08:56.637,000 --> 0:08:58,000
We did engineering to understand what we would need

189
0:08:58.816,000 --> 0:09:,000
to be able to do to build this structure,

190
0:09:01.109,000 --> 0:09:03,000
not only on the small scale, but how we would build it

191
0:09:03.812,000 --> 0:09:06,000
on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.

192
0:09:07.128,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals

193
0:09:10.328,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and looked at basically the environmental impact

194
0:09:12.857,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of the system, and finally we looked at the economics,

195
0:09:16.008,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and what I mean by economics is,

196
0:09:17.655,000 --> 0:09:2,000
what is the energy required to run the system?

197
0:09:20.76,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Do you get more energy out of the system

198
0:09:22.182,000 --> 0:09:23,000
than you have to put into the system

199
0:09:23.763,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to be able to make the system run?

200
0:09:25.776,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And what about operating costs?

201
0:09:27.522,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And what about capital costs?

202
0:09:29.58,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And what about, just, the whole economic structure?

203
0:09:33.738,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy,

204
0:09:36.456,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and there's lots more work to do in all four

205
0:09:39.016,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of those areas to be able to really make the system work.

206
0:09:42.608,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you

207
0:09:45.528,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the artist's conception of how this system might look

208
0:09:49.03,000 --> 0:09:51,000
if we find ourselves in a protected bay

209
0:09:51.71,000 --> 0:09:54,000
somewhere in the world, and we have in the background

210
0:09:54.894,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in this image, the waste water treatment plant

211
0:09:57.662,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and a source of flue gas for the CO2,

212
0:10:00.535,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but when you do the economics of this system,

213
0:10:03.27,000 --> 0:10:06,000
you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.

214
0:10:06.342,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water,

215
0:10:10.912,000 --> 0:10:13,000
sequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels

216
0:10:14.64,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or wave energy or even wind energy,

217
0:10:18.12,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and if you start thinking in terms of

218
0:10:19.391,000 --> 0:10:22,000
integrating all of these different activities,

219
0:10:22.432,000 --> 0:10:26,000
you could also include in such a facility aquaculture.

220
0:10:27.079,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture

221
0:10:30.007,000 --> 0:10:32,000
where we're growing mussels or scallops.

222
0:10:32.101,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We'd be growing oysters and things

223
0:10:35.093,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that would be producing high value products and food,

224
0:10:37.931,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and this would be a market driver as we build the system

225
0:10:40.701,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to larger and larger scales so that it becomes, ultimately,

226
0:10:44.015,000 --> 0:10:49,000
competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels.

227
0:10:49.816,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So there's always a big question that comes up,

228
0:10:52.513,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation

229
0:10:55.857,000 --> 0:10:57,000
right now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.

230
0:10:58.846,000 --> 0:11:,000
What are we going to do with all this plastic that we're

231
0:11:01.563,000 --> 0:11:03,000
going to need to use in our marine environment?

232
0:11:04.304,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Well, I don't know if you know about this,

233
0:11:05.822,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but in California, there's a huge amount of plastic

234
0:11:08.584,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch,

235
0:11:11.929,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses

236
0:11:15.153,000 --> 0:11:17,000
right along the surface of the soil, and this provides

237
0:11:17.904,000 --> 0:11:2,000
warming the soil to increase the growing season,

238
0:11:21.162,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it allows us to control weeds,

239
0:11:23.705,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.

240
0:11:27.297,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So the OMEGA system will be part

241
0:11:29.61,000 --> 0:11:32,000
of this type of an outcome, and that when we're finished

242
0:11:32.689,000 --> 0:11:34,000
using it in the marine environment, we'll be using it,

243
0:11:35.378,000 --> 0:11:37,000
hopefully, on fields.

244
0:11:37.931,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Where are we going to put this,

245
0:11:39.251,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and what will it look like offshore?

246
0:11:41.762,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.

247
0:11:44.753,000 --> 0:11:46,000
San Francisco produces 65 million gallons a day

248
0:11:47.433,000 --> 0:11:49,000
of waste water. If we imagine a five-day retention time

249
0:11:50.193,000 --> 0:11:52,000
for this system, we'd need 325 million gallons

250
0:11:52.562,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acres

251
0:11:56.588,000 --> 0:11:59,000
of these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.

252
0:12:00.207,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Well, that's less than one percent

253
0:12:02.001,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of the surface area of the bay.

254
0:12:03.752,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year,

255
0:12:07.494,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel,

256
0:12:10.49,000 --> 0:12:12,000
which is about 20 percent of the biodiesel,

257
0:12:12.69,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco,

258
0:12:15.698,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and that's without doing anything about efficiency.

259
0:12:18.888,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Where else could we potentially put this system?

260
0:12:21.858,000 --> 0:12:23,000
There's lots of possibilities.

261
0:12:24.758,000 --> 0:12:26,000
There's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.

262
0:12:26.81,000 --> 0:12:27,000
San Diego Bay is another example,

263
0:12:28.626,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Mobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay, but the reality is,

264
0:12:31.539,000 --> 0:12:33,000
as sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lots

265
0:12:33.631,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of new opportunities to consider. (Laughter)

266
0:12:37.538,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So what I'm telling you about is a system

267
0:12:41.106,000 --> 0:12:44,000
of integrated activities.

268
0:12:44.738,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy

269
0:12:47.348,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is integrated with aquaculture.

270
0:12:50.15,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I set out to find a pathway

271
0:12:54.074,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to innovative production of sustainable biofuels,

272
0:12:59.72,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and en route I discovered that what's really required

273
0:13:02.968,000 --> 0:13:09,000
for sustainability is integration more than innovation.

274
0:13:10.245,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Long term, I have great faith

275
0:13:13.675,000 --> 0:13:18,000
in our collective and connected ingenuity.

276
0:13:18.82,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish

277
0:13:23.136,000 --> 0:13:25,000
if we are radically open

278
0:13:25.338,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and we don't care who gets the credit.

279
0:13:29.068,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Sustainable solutions for our future problems

280
0:13:33.284,000 --> 0:13:35,000
are going to be diverse

281
0:13:35.684,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and are going to be many.

282
0:13:38.149,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I think we need to consider everything,

283
0:13:40.94,000 --> 0:13:43,000
everything from alpha to OMEGA.

284
0:13:43.972,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Thank you. (Applause)

285
0:13:46.852,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Applause)

286
0:13:52.607,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Chris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan.

287
0:13:55.819,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Can this project continue to move forward within

288
0:13:58.027,000 --> 0:14:01,000
NASA or do you need some very ambitious

289
0:14:01.992,000 --> 0:14:05,000
green energy fund to come and take it by the throat?

290
0:14:06.068,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Jonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage now

291
0:14:07.371,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in NASA where they would like to spin it out into something

292
0:14:10.385,000 --> 0:14:12,000
which would go offshore, and there are a lot of issues

293
0:14:12.776,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with doing it in the United States because of limited

294
0:14:15.003,000 --> 0:14:17,000
permitting issues and the time required to get permits

295
0:14:17.497,000 --> 0:14:18,000
to do things offshore.

296
0:14:19.011,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It really requires, at this point, people on the outside,

297
0:14:21.809,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and we're being radically open with this technology

298
0:14:24.113,000 --> 0:14:25,000
in which we're going to launch it out there

299
0:14:25.825,000 --> 0:14:27,000
for anybody and everybody who's interested

300
0:14:28.101,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to take it on and try to make it real.

301
0:14:29.941,000 --> 0:14:31,000
CA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.

302
0:14:32.418,000 --> 0:14:33,000
You're publishing it.

303
0:14:34.093,000 --> 0:14:34,000
JT: Absolutely.

304
0:14:34.856,000 --> 0:14:35,000
CA: All right. Thank you so much.

305
0:14:36.747,000 --> 0:14:39,000
JT: Thank you. (Applause)

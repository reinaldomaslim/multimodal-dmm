1
0:00:13.52,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Hello. I'd like to show you guys 30 seconds of the best day of my life.

2
0:00:50.24,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Applause)

3
0:00:56.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So that was El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park,

4
0:01:00.44,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and in case you couldn't tell,

5
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I was climbing by myself without a rope,

6
0:01:04.04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a style of a climbing known as free soloing.

7
0:01:06.72,000 --> 0:01:08,000
That was the culmination of a nearly decade-long dream,

8
0:01:09.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and in the video I'm over 2,500 feet off the ground.

9
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Seems scary? Yeah, it is,

10
0:01:14.56,000 --> 0:01:17,000
which is why I spent so many years dreaming about soloing El Cap

11
0:01:17.6,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and not actually doing it.

12
0:01:18.88,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But on the day that that video was taken,

13
0:01:21.04,000 --> 0:01:22,000
it didn't feel scary at all.

14
0:01:22.64,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It felt as comfortable and natural as a walk in the park,

15
0:01:25.4,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which is what most folks were doing in Yosemite that day.

16
0:01:28.4,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Today I'd like to talk about how I was able to feel so comfortable

17
0:01:31.56,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and how I overcame my fear.

18
0:01:32.92,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'll start with a very brief version of how I became a climber,

19
0:01:35.92,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and then tell the story of my two most significant free solos.

20
0:01:38.88,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They were both successful, which is why I'm here.

21
0:01:41.24,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:43.48,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But the first felt largely unsatisfying,

23
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
whereas the second, El Cap, was by far the most fulfilling day of my life.

24
0:01:51.56,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Through these two climbs, you'll see my process for managing fear.

25
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So I started climbing in a gym when I was around 10 years old,

26
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which means that my life has been centered on climbing

27
0:02:00.52,000 --> 0:02:01,000
for more than 20 years.

28
0:02:01.76,000 --> 0:02:03,000
After nearly a decade of climbing mostly indoors,

29
0:02:04.12,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I made the transition to the outdoors and gradually started free soloing.

30
0:02:07.6,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I built up my comfort over time

31
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and slowly took on bigger and more challenging walls.

32
0:02:11.68,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And there have been many free soloists before me,

33
0:02:14.04,000 --> 0:02:16,000
so I had plenty of inspiration to draw from.

34
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But by 2008, I'd repeated most of their previous solos in Yosemite

35
0:02:19.32,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and was starting to imagine breaking into new terrain.

36
0:02:21.88,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The obvious first choice was Half Dome,

37
0:02:23.8,000 --> 0:02:26,000
an iconic 2,000-foot wall that lords over the east end of the valley.

38
0:02:27.09,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The problem, though also the allure,

39
0:02:29.28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
was that it was too big.

40
0:02:30.72,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I didn't really know how to prepare for a potential free solo.

41
0:02:33.68,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I decided to skip the preparations

42
0:02:35.52,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and just go up there and have an adventure.

43
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I figured I would rise to the occasion,

44
0:02:40.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
which, unsurprisingly, was not the best strategy.

45
0:02:43.88,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I did at least climb the route roped up with a friend two days before

46
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
just to make sure that I knew roughly where to go

47
0:02:49.52,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and that I could physically do it.

48
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But when I came back by myself two days later,

49
0:02:53.4,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I decided that I didn't want to go that way.

50
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I knew that there was a 300-foot variation

51
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that circled around one of the hardest parts of the climb.

52
0:03:00.32,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I suddenly decided to skip the hard part and take the variation,

53
0:03:03.36,000 --> 0:03:04,000
even though I'd never climbed it before,

54
0:03:05.32,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but I immediately began to doubt myself.

55
0:03:07.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Imagine being by yourself in the dead center of a 2,000-foot face,

56
0:03:10.68,000 --> 0:03:11,000
wondering if you're lost.

57
0:03:12.6,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:13.84,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Thankfully, it was pretty much the right way

59
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I circled back to the route.

60
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I was slightly rattled, I was pretty rattled,

61
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but I tried not to let it bother me too much

62
0:03:23.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because I knew that all the hardest climbing was up at the top.

63
0:03:26.56,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I needed to stay composed.

64
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It was a beautiful September morning, and as I climbed higher,

65
0:03:30.96,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I could hear the sounds of tourists chatting and laughing on the summit.

66
0:03:34.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They'd all hiked up the normal trail on the back,

67
0:03:36.76,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which I was planning on using for my descent.

68
0:03:38.92,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But between me and the summit lay a blank slab of granite.

69
0:03:41.68,000 --> 0:03:43,000
There were no cracks or edges to hold on to,

70
0:03:43.8,000 --> 0:03:46,000
just small ripples of texture up a slightly less than vertical wall.

71
0:03:47.04,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I had to trust my life to the friction between my climbing shoes

72
0:03:50.08,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and the smooth granite.

73
0:03:51.4,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I carefully balanced my way upward,

74
0:03:53.12,000 --> 0:03:55,000
shifting my weight back and forth between the small smears.

75
0:03:55.92,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But then I reached a foothold that I didn't quite trust.

76
0:03:58.6,000 --> 0:04:,000
Two days ago, I'd have just stepped right up on it,

77
0:04:01.04,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but that would have been with a rope on.

78
0:04:02.969,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now it felt too small and too slippery.

79
0:04:04.88,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I doubted that my foot would stay on if I weighted it.

80
0:04:07.44,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I considered a foot further to the side, which seemed worse.

81
0:04:10.32,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I switched my feet and tried a foot further out.

82
0:04:12.6,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It seemed even worse.

83
0:04:13.84,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I started to panic.

84
0:04:15.08,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I could hear people laughing on the summit just above me.

85
0:04:17.8,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I wanted to be anywhere but on that slab.

86
0:04:19.96,000 --> 0:04:2,000
My mind was racing in every direction.

87
0:04:21.84,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I knew what I had to do, but I was too afraid to do it.

88
0:04:24.48,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I just had to stand up on my right foot.

89
0:04:26.6,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And so after what felt like an eternity, I accepted what I had to do

90
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I stood up on the right foot,

91
0:04:31.76,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and it didn't slip, and so I didn't die,

92
0:04:33.76,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and that move marked the end of the hardest climbing.

93
0:04:36.28,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And so I charged from there towards the summit.

94
0:04:38.96,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And so normally when you summit Half Dome,

95
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you have a rope and a bunch of climbing gear on you,

96
0:04:43.52,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and tourists gasp and they flock around you for photos.

97
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This time I popped over the edge shirtless, panting, jacked.

98
0:04:49.04,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I was amped, but nobody batted an eye.

99
0:04:51.12,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I looked like a lost hiker that was too close to the edge.

101
0:04:59.76,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I was surrounded by people talking on cell phones and having picnics.

102
0:05:04.76,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I felt like I was in a mall.

103
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I took off my tight climbing shoes and started hiking back down,

105
0:05:11.36,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and that's when people stopped me.

106
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"You're hiking barefoot? That's so hard-core."

107
0:05:15.36,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I didn't bother to explain,

109
0:05:24.04,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but that night in my climbing journal, I duly noted my free solo of Half Dome,

110
0:05:28.92,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but I included a frowny face and a comment, "Do better?"

111
0:05:33.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I'd succeeded in the solo

112
0:05:34.4,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and it was celebrated as a big first in climbing.

113
0:05:36.76,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Some friends later made a film about it.

114
0:05:38.72,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But I was unsatisfied.

115
0:05:40.32,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I was disappointed in my performance,

116
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because I knew that I had gotten away with something.

117
0:05:44.68,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I didn't want to be a lucky climber. I wanted to be a great climber.

118
0:05:47.92,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I actually took the next year or so off from free soloing,

119
0:05:50.68,000 --> 0:05:53,000
because I knew that I shouldn't make a habit of relying on luck.

120
0:05:53.72,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But even though I wasn't soloing very much,

121
0:05:55.76,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I'd already started to think about El Cap.

122
0:05:57.8,000 --> 0:06:,000
It was always in the back of my mind as the obvious crown jewel of solos.

123
0:06:01.28,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's the most striking wall in the world.

124
0:06:03.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Each year, for the next seven years,

125
0:06:05.72,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I'd think, "This is the year that I'm going to solo El Cap."

126
0:06:08.64,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And then I would drive into Yosemite, look up at the wall, and think,

127
0:06:11.92,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"No frickin' way."

128
0:06:13.2,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:15.08,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's too big and too scary.

130
0:06:17.68,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But eventually I came to accept that I wanted to test myself against El Cap.

131
0:06:21.44,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It represented true mastery,

132
0:06:23.64,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but I needed it to feel different.

133
0:06:25.36,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I didn't want to get away with anything or barely squeak by.

134
0:06:28.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This time I wanted to do it right.

135
0:06:31.28,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The thing that makes El Cap so intimidating

136
0:06:33.36,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is the sheer scale of the wall.

137
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Most climbers take three to five days

138
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to ascend the 3,000 feet of vertical granite.

139
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The idea of setting out up a wall of that size

140
0:06:41.92,000 --> 0:06:44,000
with nothing but shoes and a chalk bag seemed impossible.

141
0:06:45.24,000 --> 0:06:46,000
3,000 feet of climbing represents

142
0:06:46.88,000 --> 0:06:48,000
thousands of distinct hand and foot movements,

143
0:06:49.08,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which is a lot to remember.

144
0:06:50.44,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Many of the moves I knew through sheer repetition.

145
0:06:52.84,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I'd climbed El Cap maybe 50 times over the previous decade with a rope.

146
0:06:56.44,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But this photo shows my preferred method of rehearsing the moves.

147
0:06:59.56,000 --> 0:07:,000
I'm on the summit,

148
0:07:00.8,000 --> 0:07:02,000
about to rappel down the face with over a thousand feet of rope

149
0:07:03.746,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to spend the day practicing.

150
0:07:05.32,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Once I found sequences that felt secure and repeatable,

151
0:07:07.916,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I had to memorize them.

152
0:07:09.05,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I had to make sure that they were so deeply ingrained within me

153
0:07:12.036,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that there was no possibility of error.

154
0:07:13.95,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I didn't want to be wondering if I was going the right way

155
0:07:16.88,000 --> 0:07:17,000
or using the best holds.

156
0:07:18.12,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I needed everything to feel automatic.

157
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Climbing with a rope is a largely physical effort.

158
0:07:22.4,000 --> 0:07:25,000
You just have to be strong enough to hold on and make the movements upward.

159
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But free soloing plays out more in the mind.

160
0:07:28.12,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The physical effort is largely the same.

161
0:07:30.08,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Your body is still climbing the same wall.

162
0:07:32.12,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But staying calm and performing at your best

163
0:07:34.4,000 --> 0:07:36,000
when you know that any mistake could mean death

164
0:07:36.64,000 --> 0:07:38,000
requires a certain kind of mindset.

165
0:07:38.8,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

166
0:07:41.4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
That's not supposed to be funny, but if it is, it is.

167
0:07:43.92,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:46.2,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I worked to cultivate that mindset through visualization,

169
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which basically just means imagining the entire experience of soloing the wall.

170
0:07:53.2,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Partially, that was to help me remember all the holds,

171
0:07:55.76,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but mostly visualization was about feeling the texture

172
0:07:58.32,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of each hold in my hand

173
0:07:59.56,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and imagining the sensation of my leg reaching out and placing my foot just so.

174
0:08:03.32,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I'd imagine it all like a choreographed dance thousands of feet up.

175
0:08:06.92,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The most difficult part of the whole route was called the Boulder Problem.

176
0:08:10.44,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It was about 2,000 feet off the ground

177
0:08:12.32,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and consisted of the hardest physical moves on the whole route:

178
0:08:15.32,000 --> 0:08:18,000
long pulls between poor handholds with very small, slippery feet.

179
0:08:18.52,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is what I mean by a poor handhold:

180
0:08:20.44,000 --> 0:08:23,000
an edge smaller than the width of a pencil but facing downward

181
0:08:23.64,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that I had to press up into with my thumb.

182
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But that wasn't even the hardest part.

183
0:08:28.04,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The crux culminated in a karate kick

184
0:08:29.8,000 --> 0:08:31,000
with my left foot over to the inside of an adjacent corner,

185
0:08:32.64,000 --> 0:08:35,000
a maneuver that required a high degree of precision and flexibility,

186
0:08:35.88,000 --> 0:08:37,000
enough so that I'd been doing a nightly stretching routine

187
0:08:38.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
for a full year ahead of time

188
0:08:40.08,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to make sure that I could comfortably make the reach with my leg.

189
0:08:43.2,000 --> 0:08:44,000
As I practiced the moves,

190
0:08:44.48,000 --> 0:08:46,000
my visualization turned to the emotional component

191
0:08:46.919,000 --> 0:08:47,000
of a potential solo.

192
0:08:48.4,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Basically, what if I got up there and it was too scary?

193
0:08:51.2,000 --> 0:08:52,000
What if I was too tired?

194
0:08:52.52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What if I couldn't quite make the kick?

195
0:08:54.402,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I had to consider every possibility while I was safely on the ground,

196
0:08:57.68,000 --> 0:09:,000
so that when the time came and I was actually making the moves without a rope,

197
0:09:01.4,000 --> 0:09:02,000
there was no room for doubt to creep in.

198
0:09:03.36,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Doubt is the precursor to fear,

199
0:09:04.85,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and I knew that I couldn't experience my perfect moment if I was afraid.

200
0:09:08.28,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I had to visualize and rehearse enough to remove all doubt.

201
0:09:11.12,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But beyond that, I also visualized how it would feel

202
0:09:13.6,000 --> 0:09:14,000
if it never seemed doable.

203
0:09:15.36,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What if, after so much work, I was afraid to try?

204
0:09:19.44,000 --> 0:09:2,000
What if I was wasting my time

205
0:09:20.96,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and I would never feel comfortable in such an exposed position?

206
0:09:24.32,000 --> 0:09:25,000
There were no easy answers,

207
0:09:25.68,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but El Cap meant enough to me that I would put in the work and find out.

208
0:09:29.44,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Some of my preparations were more mundane.

209
0:09:31.68,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is a photo of my friend Conrad Anker

210
0:09:33.84,000 --> 0:09:35,000
climbing up the bottom of El Cap with an empty backpack.

211
0:09:36.52,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We spent the day climbing together

212
0:09:38.2,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to a specific crack in the middle of the wall

213
0:09:40.36,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that was choked with loose rocks

214
0:09:41.96,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that made that section difficult and potentially dangerous,

215
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:46,000
because any missed step might knock a rock to the ground

216
0:09:47.48,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and kill a passing climber or hiker.

217
0:09:49.24,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So we carefully removed the rocks, loaded them into the pack

218
0:09:52.12,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and rappelled back down.

219
0:09:53.4,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Take a second to imagine how ridiculous it feels

220
0:09:55.68,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to climb 1,500 feet up a wall just to fill a backpack full of rocks.

221
0:09:58.92,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

222
0:10:00.56,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It's never that easy to carry a pack full of rocks around.

223
0:10:03.32,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It's even harder on the side of a cliff.

224
0:10:05.28,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It may have felt silly, but it still had to get done.

225
0:10:07.8,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I needed everything to feel perfect

226
0:10:09.52,000 --> 0:10:11,000
if I was ever going to climb the route without a rope.

227
0:10:12.12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
After two seasons of working specifically toward a potential free solo of El Cap,

228
0:10:15.96,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I finally finished all my preparations.

229
0:10:17.88,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I knew every handhold and foothold on the whole route,

230
0:10:20.42,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and I knew exactly what to do.

231
0:10:21.88,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Basically, I was ready.

232
0:10:23.36,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It was time to solo El Cap.

233
0:10:25.64,000 --> 0:10:27,000
On June 3, 2017,

234
0:10:27.96,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I woke up early, ate my usual breakfast of muesli and fruit

235
0:10:31.2,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and made it to the base of the wall before sunrise.

236
0:10:33.68,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I felt confident as I looked up the wall.

237
0:10:35.68,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I felt even better as I started climbing.

238
0:10:38.8,000 --> 0:10:39,000
About 500 feet up, I reached a slab

239
0:10:40.6,000 --> 0:10:43,000
very similar to the one that had given me so much trouble on Half Dome,

240
0:10:43.96,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but this time was different.

241
0:10:45.44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'd scouted every option, including hundreds of feet of wall to either side.

242
0:10:49.04,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I knew exactly what to do and how to do it.

243
0:10:51.36,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I had no doubts. I just climbed right through.

244
0:10:54.44,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Even the difficult and strenuous sections passed by with ease.

245
0:10:57.56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I was perfectly executing my routine.

246
0:11:00.6,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I rested for a moment below the Boulder Problem

247
0:11:02.88,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and then climbed it just as I had practiced so many times with the rope on.

248
0:11:06.48,000 --> 0:11:09,000
My foot shot across to the wall on the left without hesitation,

249
0:11:09.52,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and I knew that I had done it.

250
0:11:12.88,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Climbing Half Dome had been a big goal

251
0:11:14.8,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and I did it,

252
0:11:16.04,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but I didn't get what I really wanted.

253
0:11:17.92,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I didn't achieve mastery.

254
0:11:19.24,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I was hesitant and afraid, and it wasn't the experience that I wanted.

255
0:11:22.92,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But El Cap was different.

256
0:11:24.6,000 --> 0:11:27,000
With 600 feet to go, I felt like the mountain was offering me a victory lap.

257
0:11:28.36,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I climbed with a smooth precision

258
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and enjoyed the sounds of the birds swooping around the cliff.

259
0:11:32.96,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It all felt like a celebration.

260
0:11:34.48,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And then I reached the summit

261
0:11:35.92,000 --> 0:11:37,000
after three hours and 56 minutes of glorious climbing.

262
0:11:38.48,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It was the climb that I wanted, and it felt like mastery.

263
0:11:41.2,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Thank you.

264
0:11:42.44,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement,

2
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century

3
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:25,000
also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.

4
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:3,000
He said, "A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' --

5
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a part limited in time and space.

6
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings,

7
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
as something separated from the rest,

8
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.

9
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This delusion is a kind of prison for us,

10
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:52,000
restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.

11
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion,

12
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."

13
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology,

14
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
wherein compassion -- "karuna," it is called --

15
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is defined as, "the sensitivity to another's suffering

16
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."

17
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy,

18
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself

19
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and wishes to share it.

20
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness

21
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others,

22
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern

23
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free

24
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and, implicitly, more happy.

25
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.

26
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.

27
0:01:56,000 --> 0:02:,000
Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering

28
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:05,000
as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had

29
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others,

30
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:13,000
even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.

31
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
In fact, suffering is so huge and enormous,

32
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
his own becomes less and less monumental.

33
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others.

34
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And this immediately cheers him up,

35
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion.

36
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Thus, he uses his own suffering

37
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.

38
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:41,000
He is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say.

39
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now, I want to tell a story,

40
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition,

41
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of the great Saint Asanga

42
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West

43
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.

44
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.

45
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
And he was discontented with the state of people's practice

46
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.

47
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine.

48
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,

49
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but they are acting selfish and pathetic.

50
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.

51
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,

52
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but exists currently in a certain heaven" -- that's Maitreya --

53
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate

54
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,

55
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and gives me a teaching or something

56
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to revive the practice of compassion in the world today."

57
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years

58
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.

59
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And he left in disgust.

60
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And as he was leaving, he saw a man --

61
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.

62
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And he had a lump of iron.

63
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And he was rubbing it with a cloth.

64
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And he became interested in that.

65
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
He said, "Well what are you doing?"

66
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And the man said, "I'm making a needle."

67
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And he said, "That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle

68
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."

69
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And the man said, "Really?" And he showed him a dish full of needles.

70
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So he said, "Okay, I get the point."

71
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
He went back to his cave. He meditated again.

72
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Another three years, no vision. He leaves again.

73
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
This time, he comes down.

74
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.

75
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,

76
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:32,000
its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock

77
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock

78
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.

79
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back.

80
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Another three years.

81
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.

82
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,

83
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:51,000
making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.

84
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.

85
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right

86
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to see any encouraging vision.

87
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.

88
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog

89
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:1,000
who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,

90
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
even in America, I think, in some areas --

91
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and he's looking just terrible.

92
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic,

93
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.

94
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.

95
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Some of it is like gangrenous,

96
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.

97
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
He thinks, "What can I do to fix up this dog?

98
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it."

99
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean,

100
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but then his awareness focuses on the maggots.

101
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.

102
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.

103
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?

104
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya,

105
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and everything is all hopeless.

106
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
And now I'm going to kill the maggots?"

107
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So, he had a brilliant idea.

108
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh,

109
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and he placed it on ground.

110
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.

111
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
He was just immediately caught with the situation.

112
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So he thought, "I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh,

113
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
then clean the dog's wounds, and then

114
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I'll figure out what to do with the maggots."

115
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.

116
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.

117
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So he says, "Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh.

118
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue" --

119
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the dog is kind of used up --

120
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing."

121
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.

122
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.

123
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that.

124
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:55,000
He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya

125
0:06:55,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body,

126
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees.

127
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And he says, "Oh." He bows.

128
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.

129
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So as he comes up from his first bow he says,

130
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:16,000
"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?

131
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What is this?"

132
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And Maitreya says, "I was with you. Who do you think was making needles

133
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"

134
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.

136
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And he said, "You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.

137
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."

138
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit.

139
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.

140
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you."

141
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball --

142
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
took him on his shoulder.

143
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice!

144
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is."

145
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him --

146
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town --

147
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,

148
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:18,000
like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,

149
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
shouting that the future Buddha had come.

150
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So, naturally, they chased him out of town.

151
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,

152
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,

153
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.

154
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.

155
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven,

156
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.

157
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years,

158
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
dictating to him five complicated tomes

159
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.

160
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them.

161
0:08:55,000 --> 0:09:,000
A famous one, it's called the "Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion."

162
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one --

163
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
even animals too, but everyone is in human form.

164
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.

165
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.

166
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.

167
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love.

168
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.

169
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.

170
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.

171
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.

172
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:41,000
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.

173
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.

174
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But they are nice to somebody. I could be them."

175
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives,

176
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we've all been each other's relatives, actually.

177
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Therefore all of you, in the Buddhist view,

178
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I,

179
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:07,000
have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.

180
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And also, actually, I've been your mother.

181
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,

182
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the way the Buddhists reflect.

183
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way

184
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
are part of the eternal mother.

185
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful.

186
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So, that's the way the Buddhists do it.

187
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:32,000
A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.

188
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So, in that sense, we're related.

189
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So, they first create this foundation of equality.

190
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love --

191
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:45,000
just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.

192
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them"

193
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.

194
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.

195
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition."

196
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.

197
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,

198
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.

199
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And we see the mother in every being.

200
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We see that look that the mother has on her face,

201
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:22,000
looking at this child that is a miracle

202
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,

203
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:29,000
where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.

204
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.

205
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.

206
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,

207
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in spiritual traditions.

208
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.

209
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
People laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that

210
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom,

211
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:01,000
when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.

212
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.

213
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.

214
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And you think of him as nursing you.

215
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,

216
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
but you think of him as a mom.

217
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you,

218
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and you see how they could be familiar to you.

219
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And you do that for a while, until you really feel that.

220
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You can feel the familiarity of all beings.

221
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Nobody seems alien. They're not "other."

222
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.

223
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,

224
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
if you can remember the kindness of your own mother,

225
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
if you can remember the kindness of your spouse,

226
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.

227
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.

228
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.

229
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.

230
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.

231
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And then, third, you step from there to what is called "a feeling of gratitude."

232
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.

233
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."

234
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days

235
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.

236
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,

237
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
when they are satisfied.

238
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.

239
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,

240
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but when they're happy they look beautiful.

241
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And so you see beings in their potential happiness.

242
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.

243
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We think Jesus is being unrealistic

244
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:49,000
when he says, "Love thine enemy."

245
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic

246
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that."

247
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But, actually, that's practical.

248
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.

249
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:04,000
If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?

250
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
How boring to run around chasing you.

251
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.

252
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,

253
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:14,000
because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.

254
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But anyway, that's the "lovely love. "

255
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And then finally, the fifth step is compassion, "universal compassion."

256
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.

257
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And you look at them, and you see how they are.

258
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.

259
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:34,000
You see that furrowed brow in people.

260
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.

261
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
They're driven by this duty and this obligation.

262
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:43,000
"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something."

263
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And they're rushing around all stressed out.

264
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.

265
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But actually they are cruel to themselves.

266
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.

267
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And they, then, never get any positive feedback.

268
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And the more they succeed and the more power they have,

269
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
the more unhappy they are.

270
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And this is where you feel real compassion for them.

271
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And you then feel you must act.

272
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And the choice of the action, of course,

273
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:12,000
hopefully will be more practical

274
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog

275
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,

276
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
he wanted to help.

277
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town

278
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.

279
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.

280
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" --

281
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,

282
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and you have compassion for yourself also,

283
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.

284
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy

285
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:53,000
being more and more mean to other people

286
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and getting punished in the future for it in various ways.

287
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.

288
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.

289
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,

290
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:07,000
by dying, but they don't.

291
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.

292
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Never mind. I won't get into that.

293
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:15,000
But the next step is called "universal responsibility."

294
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion

295
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:21,000
must lead us to develop through true compassion,

296
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
what is called "universal responsibility."

297
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:27,000
In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama

298
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that he always teaches everywhere, he says

299
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.

300
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility."

301
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us:

302
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:42,000
we are responsible for that, and we should take it

303
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and do whatever we can at whatever little level

304
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and small level that we can do it.

305
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:5,000
We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.

306
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life

307
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:58,000
where we live equally for ourselves and for others

308
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and we are

309
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
joyful and happy.

310
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.

311
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Compassion makes you happy.

312
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:13,000
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself,

313
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:15,000
even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.

314
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings:

315
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:23,000
they can sense this new quality in yourself,

316
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and it helps them already, and gives them an example.

317
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over.

318
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:34,000
So, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it

319
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and develop it within yourself.

320
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Don't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate,"

321
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and sort of think you're stuck there.

322
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:44,000
You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion,

323
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:48,000
the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others,

324
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and take universal responsibility for them.

325
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:55,000
And then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile,

326
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:57,000
but Karen Armstrong will smile.

327
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.763,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want you all to think

2
0:00:16.603,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about the third word that was ever said about you --

3
0:00:23.582,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or, if you were delivering,

4
0:00:26.638,000 --> 0:00:29,000
about the person you were delivering.

5
0:00:31.864,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud.

6
0:00:35.729,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It was -- the first two were, "It's a ..."

7
0:00:41.31,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Audience: (Mixed reply) Girl. Boy.

8
0:00:43.355,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:44.38,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Well, it shows you that --

10
0:00:46.006,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I also deal with issues where there's not certainty

11
0:00:49.109,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of whether it's a girl or a boy,

12
0:00:50.708,000 --> 0:00:53,000
so the mixed answer was very appropriate.

13
0:00:54.336,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Of course, now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound,

14
0:00:58.994,000 --> 0:01:01,000
unless the prospective parents choose to be surprised,

15
0:01:02.972,000 --> 0:01:03,000
like we all were.

16
0:01:05.835,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement

17
0:01:12.859,000 --> 0:01:14,000
on the third word,

18
0:01:14.899,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because the third word

19
0:01:17.4,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is a description of your sex.

20
0:01:25.159,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And by that I mean,

21
0:01:27.572,000 --> 0:01:3,000
made by a description of your genitals.

22
0:01:32.436,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now, as a pediatric endocrinologist,

23
0:01:35.504,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I used to be very, very involved and still somewhat am, in cases

24
0:01:41.005,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in which there are mismatches in the externals

25
0:01:47.293,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or between the externals and the internals,

26
0:01:51.331,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and we literally have to figure out

27
0:01:56.168,000 --> 0:01:59,000
what is the description of your sex.

28
0:02:00.502,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth

29
0:02:05.808,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that would define you.

30
0:02:10.101,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And when I talk about definition,

31
0:02:12.268,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I'm talking about your sexual orientation.

32
0:02:18.274,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We don't say, "It's a ... gay boy!"

33
0:02:23.668,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"A lesbian girl!"

34
0:02:26.449,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Those situations don't really define themselves

35
0:02:29.982,000 --> 0:02:31,000
more until the second decade of life.

36
0:02:33.971,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Nor do they define your gender,

37
0:02:38.952,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which, as different from your anatomic sex,

38
0:02:42.564,000 --> 0:02:45,000
describes your self-concept:

39
0:02:45.838,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Do you see yourself as a male or female,

40
0:02:51.37,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or somewhere in the spectrum in between?

41
0:02:56.593,000 --> 0:03:01,000
That sometimes shows up

42
0:03:01.896,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in the first decade of life,

43
0:03:04.88,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but it can be very confusing for parents,

44
0:03:08.526,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because it is quite normative for children

45
0:03:13.257,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to act in a cross-gender play and way,

46
0:03:17.634,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and, in fact, there are studies that show

47
0:03:19.968,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion

48
0:03:25.82,000 --> 0:03:31,000
will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender

49
0:03:32.762,000 --> 0:03:34,000
at the time when puberty begins.

50
0:03:36.746,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But, at the time that puberty begins --

51
0:03:42.206,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that means between about age 10 to 12 in girls, 12 to 14 in boys --

52
0:03:49.239,000 --> 0:03:5,000
with breast budding,

53
0:03:50.97,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or two to three times' increase in the gonads

54
0:03:54.867,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in the case of genetic males,

55
0:03:57.736,000 --> 0:03:58,000
by that particular point,

56
0:03:59.386,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body

57
0:04:05.504,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is almost certain to be transgender

58
0:04:09.291,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings,

59
0:04:16.303,000 --> 0:04:2,000
no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy

60
0:04:20.862,000 --> 0:04:22,000
or any other noxious things.

61
0:04:24.742,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now, this is relatively rare,

62
0:04:27.213,000 --> 0:04:29,000
so I had relatively little personal experience with this.

63
0:04:30.929,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And my experience was more typical,

64
0:04:33.607,000 --> 0:04:35,000
only because I had an adolescent practice.

65
0:04:35.671,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I saw someone age 24,

66
0:04:37.363,000 --> 0:04:41,000
genetically female, went through Harvard with three male roommates

67
0:04:41.954,000 --> 0:04:42,000
who knew the whole story,

68
0:04:43.314,000 --> 0:04:49,000
a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name,

69
0:04:49.355,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and came to me after graduating,

70
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
saying, "Help me. I know you know a lot of endocrinology."

71
0:04:56.348,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And indeed, I've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads.

72
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:,000
This wasn't rocket science.

73
0:05:01.348,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But I made a deal with him:

74
0:05:02.975,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"I'll treat you if you teach me."

75
0:05:05.9,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And so he did.

76
0:05:09.161,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And what an education I got

77
0:05:10.995,000 --> 0:05:12,000
from taking care of all the members of his support group.

78
0:05:15.647,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And then I got really confused,

79
0:05:18.194,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because I thought it was relatively easy at that age

80
0:05:20.751,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to just give people the hormones

81
0:05:22.358,000 --> 0:05:25,000
of the gender in which they were affirming.

82
0:05:26.595,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But then my patient married,

83
0:05:29.825,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and he married a woman who had been born as a male,

84
0:05:34.655,000 --> 0:05:37,000
had married as a male, had two children,

85
0:05:37.958,000 --> 0:05:41,000
then went through a transition into female.

86
0:05:43.721,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And now this delightful female

87
0:05:48.536,000 --> 0:05:53,000
was attached to my male patient -- in fact, got legally married,

88
0:05:54.226,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because they showed up as a man and a woman, and who knew, right?

89
0:05:57.502,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:59.966,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And I was confused --

91
0:06:03.501,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"Does this make so-and-so gay?

92
0:06:05.922,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Does this make so-and-so straight?"

93
0:06:07.696,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity.

94
0:06:13.609,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And my patient said to me,

95
0:06:15.808,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"Look, look, look.

96
0:06:17.3,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If you just think of the following, you'll get it right:

97
0:06:20.737,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Sexual orientation is who you go to bed with.

98
0:06:24.004,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Gender identity is who you go to bed as."

99
0:06:27.802,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

100
0:06:29.827,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And I subsequently learned from the many adults --

101
0:06:32.643,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I took care of about 200 adults --

102
0:06:35.189,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I learned from them

103
0:06:36.883,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that if I didn't peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room,

104
0:06:41.542,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I would never be able to guess better than chance,

105
0:06:45.241,000 --> 0:06:49,000
whether they were gay, straight, bi or asexual

106
0:06:49.463,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in their affirmed gender.

107
0:06:51.631,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In other words,

108
0:06:52.877,000 --> 0:06:56,000
one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.

109
0:06:57.46,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And the data show it.

110
0:07:02.075,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Now, as I took care of the 200 adults,

111
0:07:04.248,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I found it extremely painful.

112
0:07:06.814,000 --> 0:07:08,000
These people -- many of them --

113
0:07:09.821,000 --> 0:07:13,000
had to give up so much of their lives.

114
0:07:14.122,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Sometimes their parents would reject them,

115
0:07:16.577,000 --> 0:07:18,000
siblings, their own children,

116
0:07:18.95,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and then their divorcing spouse

117
0:07:20.721,000 --> 0:07:23,000
would forbid them from seeing their children.

118
0:07:24.724,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It was so awful,

119
0:07:26.509,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but why did they do it at 40 and 50?

120
0:07:30.289,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Because they felt they had to affirm themselves

121
0:07:35.058,000 --> 0:07:36,000
before they would kill themselves.

122
0:07:37.316,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And indeed, the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people

123
0:07:43.286,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is among the highest in the world.

124
0:07:47.057,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So, what to do?

125
0:07:49.02,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I was intrigued, in going to a conference in Holland,

126
0:07:52.956,000 --> 0:07:54,000
where they are experts in this,

127
0:07:55.226,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and saw the most remarkable thing.

128
0:07:58.623,000 --> 0:08:01,000
They were treating young adolescents

129
0:08:01.869,000 --> 0:08:06,000
after giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender,

130
0:08:07.863,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn't want.

131
0:08:12.283,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Because basically, kids look about the same,

132
0:08:14.869,000 --> 0:08:16,000
each sex, until they go through puberty,

133
0:08:17.888,000 --> 0:08:19,000
at which point, if you feel you're in the wrong sex,

134
0:08:20.605,000 --> 0:08:22,000
you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey.

135
0:08:23.675,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The fantasy that you had that your body will change

136
0:08:26.24,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to be who you want it to be, with puberty,

137
0:08:28.915,000 --> 0:08:3,000
actually is nullified by the puberty you get.

138
0:08:33.779,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And they fall apart.

139
0:08:37.328,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So that's why putting the puberty on hold -- why on hold?

140
0:08:40.828,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You can't just give them the opposite hormones that young.

141
0:08:43.902,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They'll end up stunted in growth,

142
0:08:45.761,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and you think you can have a meaningful conversation

143
0:08:48.333,000 --> 0:08:5,000
about the fertility effects of such treatment

144
0:08:50.847,000 --> 0:08:53,000
with a 10-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy?

145
0:08:54.663,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So this buys time in the diagnostic process

146
0:08:57.193,000 --> 0:08:58,000
for four or five years,

147
0:08:59.045,000 --> 0:09:01,000
so that they can work it out.

148
0:09:01.819,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They can have more and more testing,

149
0:09:04.471,000 --> 0:09:07,000
they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them.

150
0:09:08.464,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And then, in a program they call 12-16-18,

151
0:09:12.646,000 --> 0:09:16,000
around age 12 is when they give the blocking hormones,

152
0:09:17.519,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and then at age 16, with retesting,

153
0:09:19.983,000 --> 0:09:21,000
they re-qualify to receive --

154
0:09:22.289,000 --> 0:09:24,000
now remember, the blocking hormones are reversible,

155
0:09:25.285,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex,

156
0:09:28.19,000 --> 0:09:31,000
you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change,

157
0:09:31.531,000 --> 0:09:32,000
depending on what you're using,

158
0:09:33.297,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and those effects are permanent,

159
0:09:35.423,000 --> 0:09:36,000
or require surgery to remove,

160
0:09:37.265,000 --> 0:09:38,000
or electrolysis,

161
0:09:38.52,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and you can never really affect the voice.

162
0:09:41.027,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So this is serious, and this is 15-, 16-year-old stuff.

163
0:09:45.184,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And then at 18, they're eligible for surgery.

164
0:09:48.772,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And while there's no good surgery for females to males genitally,

165
0:09:52.888,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the male-to-female surgery has fooled gynecologists.

166
0:09:57.381,000 --> 0:09:58,000
That's how good it can be.

167
0:10:00.087,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So I looked at how the patients were doing,

168
0:10:04.088,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else,

169
0:10:06.974,000 --> 0:10:08,000
except they were pubertally delayed.

170
0:10:09.729,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But once they gave them the hormones

171
0:10:11.666,000 --> 0:10:13,000
consistent with the gender they affirm,

172
0:10:14.299,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they look beautiful.

173
0:10:16.229,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They look normal.

174
0:10:18.04,000 --> 0:10:19,000
They had normal heights.

175
0:10:19.935,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You would never be able to pick them out in a crowd.

176
0:10:24.522,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So at that point, I decided I'm going to do this.

177
0:10:27.103,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in,

178
0:10:31.611,000 --> 0:10:35,000
because, in fact, if you're going to deal with it in kids aged 10 to 14,

179
0:10:36.452,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that's pediatric endocrinology.

180
0:10:39.354,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So I brought some kids in,

181
0:10:43.513,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and this now became the standard of care,

182
0:10:46.098,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and the [Boston] Children's Hospital was behind it.

183
0:10:48.927,000 --> 0:10:52,000
By my showing them the kids before and after,

184
0:10:53.094,000 --> 0:10:56,000
people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated,

185
0:10:56.939,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and pictures of the Dutch --

186
0:11:00.035,000 --> 0:11:01,000
they came to me and said,

187
0:11:01.28,000 --> 0:11:03,000
"You've got to do something for these kids."

188
0:11:03.511,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Well, where were these kids before?

189
0:11:06.774,000 --> 0:11:08,000
They were out there suffering, is where they were.

190
0:11:09.894,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So we started a program in 2007.

191
0:11:16.062,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It became the first program of its kind --

192
0:11:18.482,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but it's really of the Dutch kind --

193
0:11:20.863,000 --> 0:11:21,000
in North America.

194
0:11:22.927,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And since then, we have 160 patients.

195
0:11:27.18,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Did they come from Afghanistan? No.

196
0:11:30.44,000 --> 0:11:37,000
75 percent of them came from within 150 miles of Boston.

197
0:11:38.701,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And some came from England.

198
0:11:42.138,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Jackie had been abused in the Midlands, in England.

199
0:11:46.205,000 --> 0:11:47,000
She's 12 years old there,

200
0:11:48.091,000 --> 0:11:49,000
she was living as a girl,

201
0:11:49.428,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but she was being beaten up.

202
0:11:51.61,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It was a horror show, they had to homeschool her.

203
0:11:54.649,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And the reason the British were coming

204
0:11:57.017,000 --> 0:12:02,000
was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age 16,

205
0:12:02.741,000 --> 0:12:05,000
which means they were consigning them to an adult body

206
0:12:06.478,000 --> 0:12:07,000
no matter what happened,

207
0:12:07.961,000 --> 0:12:08,000
even if they tested them well.

208
0:12:10.108,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Jackie, on top of it, was, by virtue of skeletal markings,

209
0:12:14.81,000 --> 0:12:15,000
destined to be six feet five.

210
0:12:19.138,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And yet, she had just begun a male puberty.

211
0:12:22.938,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Well, I did something a little bit innovative,

212
0:12:26.537,000 --> 0:12:28,000
because I do know hormones,

213
0:12:28.659,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and that estrogen is much more potent

214
0:12:30.621,000 --> 0:12:33,000
in closing epiphyses, the growth plates,

215
0:12:34.435,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and stopping growth, than testosterone is.

216
0:12:37.752,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone,

217
0:12:42.505,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but we added estrogen, not at 16, but at 13.

218
0:12:46.909,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And so here she is at 16, on the left.

219
0:12:50.093,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And on her 16th birthday, she went to Thailand,

220
0:12:52.395,000 --> 0:12:54,000
where they would do a genital plastic surgery.

221
0:12:54.697,000 --> 0:12:55,000
They will do it at 18 now.

222
0:12:56.597,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And she ended up 5'11".

223
0:12:59.312,000 --> 0:13:02,000
But more than that, she has normal breast size,

224
0:13:02.559,000 --> 0:13:04,000
because by blocking testosterone,

225
0:13:04.871,000 --> 0:13:07,000
every one of our patients has normal breast size

226
0:13:08.249,000 --> 0:13:11,000
if they get to us at the appropriate age,

227
0:13:11.283,000 --> 0:13:12,000
not too late.

228
0:13:13.057,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And on the far right, there she is.

229
0:13:14.84,000 --> 0:13:17,000
She went public -- semifinalist in the Miss England competition.

230
0:13:21.068,000 --> 0:13:23,000
The judges debated as to, can they do this?

231
0:13:24.134,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And one of them quipped, I'm told,

232
0:13:28.309,000 --> 0:13:31,000
"But she has more natural self than half the other contestants."

233
0:13:32.299,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Laughter)

234
0:13:34.211,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And some of them have been rearranged a little bit,

235
0:13:38.482,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but it's all her DNA.

236
0:13:41.679,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman.

237
0:13:45.121,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And she was offered contracts as a model,

238
0:13:49.006,000 --> 0:13:51,000
at which point she teased me, when she said,

239
0:13:51.155,000 --> 0:13:53,000
"You know, I might have had a better chance as a model

240
0:13:53.724,000 --> 0:13:54,000
if you'd made me six feet one."

241
0:13:55.456,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Laughter)

242
0:13:57.46,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Go figure.

243
0:14:00.038,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So this picture, I think, says it all.

244
0:14:03.74,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It really says it all.

245
0:14:05.76,000 --> 0:14:08,000
These are Nicole and brother Jonas,

246
0:14:09.408,000 --> 0:14:1,000
identical twin boys,

247
0:14:12.427,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and proven to be identical.

248
0:14:15.978,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three.

249
0:14:19.596,000 --> 0:14:21,000
At age seven, they changed her name,

250
0:14:22.127,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty.

251
0:14:26.904,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only 14,

252
0:14:29.712,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that male puberty is early in this family,

253
0:14:32.523,000 --> 0:14:34,000
because he looks more like a 16-year-old.

254
0:14:35.086,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But it makes the point all the more,

255
0:14:36.92,000 --> 0:14:39,000
of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is.

256
0:14:40.665,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here,

257
0:14:44.451,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and Jonas is just going -- biologic control.

258
0:14:48.189,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This is what Nicole would look like

259
0:14:49.91,000 --> 0:14:51,000
if we weren't doing what we were doing.

260
0:14:51.991,000 --> 0:14:53,000
He's got a prominent Adam's apple.

261
0:14:54.482,000 --> 0:14:57,000
He's got angular bones to the face, a mustache,

262
0:14:58.063,000 --> 0:15:,000
and you can see there's a height difference,

263
0:15:00.15,000 --> 0:15:02,000
because he's gone through a growth spurt that she won't get.

264
0:15:03.053,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Now Nicole is on estrogen.

265
0:15:04.594,000 --> 0:15:06,000
She has a bit of a form to her.

266
0:15:07.887,000 --> 0:15:1,000
This family went to the White House last spring,

267
0:15:11.526,000 --> 0:15:16,000
because of their work in overturning an anti-discrimination --

268
0:15:17.289,000 --> 0:15:19,000
there was a bill that would block

269
0:15:19.695,000 --> 0:15:23,000
the right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms,

270
0:15:24.322,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and it looked like the bill was going to pass,

271
0:15:27.091,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and that would have been a problem,

272
0:15:28.822,000 --> 0:15:31,000
but Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine

273
0:15:32.323,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and said, "I can do this.

274
0:15:34.335,000 --> 0:15:35,000
If they see me, they'll understand

275
0:15:36.351,000 --> 0:15:38,000
why I'm no threat in the ladies' room,

276
0:15:38.521,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but I can be threatened in the men's room."

277
0:15:40.627,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And then they finally got it.

278
0:15:44.038,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So where do we go from here?

279
0:15:47.022,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Well, we still have a ways to go in terms of anti-discrimination.

280
0:15:51.115,000 --> 0:15:54,000
There are only 17 states that have an anti-discrimination law

281
0:15:54.806,000 --> 0:15:56,000
against discrimination in housing,

282
0:15:57.406,000 --> 0:16:,000
employment, public accommodation --

283
0:16:00.522,000 --> 0:16:02,000
only 17 states, and five of them are in New England.

284
0:16:03.534,000 --> 0:16:04,000
We need less expensive drugs.

285
0:16:05.459,000 --> 0:16:06,000
They cost a fortune.

286
0:16:07.164,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And we need to get this condition out of the DSM.

287
0:16:11.081,000 --> 0:16:15,000
It is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian,

288
0:16:15.805,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and that went out the window in 1973,

289
0:16:18.748,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and the whole world changed.

290
0:16:20.649,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And this isn't going to break anybody's budget.

291
0:16:23.018,000 --> 0:16:24,000
This is not that common.

292
0:16:25.279,000 --> 0:16:28,000
But the risks of not doing anything for them

293
0:16:30.005,000 --> 0:16:36,000
not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide,

294
0:16:36.501,000 --> 0:16:42,000
but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society.

295
0:16:42.777,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Thank you.

296
0:16:43.952,000 --> 0:16:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Sustainability represents

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the what, the where and the how

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
of what is caught.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The who and the why are what's important to me.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I want to know how I impact them.

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I want to know how they impact me.

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I want to know why they fish.

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
for their living.

11
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Understanding all of this enables us

12
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to shift our perception of seafood

13
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
away from a commodity

14
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to an opportunity

15
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to restore our ecosystem.

16
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood

17
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that we're also so fortunate to eat.

18
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So what do we call this?

19
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I think we call it restorative seafood.

20
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Where sustainability is the capacity

21
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to endure and maintain,

22
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.

23
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system

24
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean

25
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as a resource,

26
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean

27
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and to encourage its resiliency.

28
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It is a more hopeful, it is a more human,

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Wallet guides -- standard issue

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
by lots in the marine conservation world --

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
think twice about yellow.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But in my mind, it's really not enough

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to just eat green list.

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We can't sustain this without the measure of our success

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
really changing the fate of the species

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in the yellow and the red.

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But what if we eat only in the green list?

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here --

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
comes from sustainable stocks.

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Pole caught -- no bycatch.

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
What's the context of this meal?

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Do I do this three times a week?

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I might still be in the green list,

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but I'm not doing myself, or you,

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
or the oceans any favors.

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The point is that we have to have a context,

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a gauge for our actions in all this.

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health --

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That's great! I love red wine!

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Well, how many bottles is it

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
before you tell me that I have a problem?

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Well folks, we have a protein problem.

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We have lost this sensibility

63
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
when it regards our food,

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and we are paying a cost.

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We are hiding that cost

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is that it really takes into account our needs.

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Restorative seafood might best be represented

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Vegetables:

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they might yet save the oceans.

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Well I'd like to respectfully submit

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that broccoli green might then be the new blue.

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We must continue to eat

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the best seafood possible, if at all.

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The best part about restorative seafood though

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is that it comes on the half-shell

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with crunchy, grilled broccoli

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with just a hint of chili flake.

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Whooo!

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This is an easy sell.

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Jamie Oliver is campaigning

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to save America from the way we eat.

97
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans

98
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
from the way we eat.

99
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
There's a pattern here.

100
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Forget nuclear holocaust;

101
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
it's the fork that we have to worry about.

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We have ravaged our Earth

103
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and then used the food that we've sourced

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And so I think it's time

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we change what we expect from our food.

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Sustainability is complicated

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.

110
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So let's start there.

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Dan Barber and Alice Waters

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But green foods often represent

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
a way for us to disregard

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the responsibility as eaters.

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Just because it comes from a green source

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We have eco-friendly shrimp.

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We can make them; we have that technology.

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It doesn't work.

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part

124
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
of restorative seafood.

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
While we try to manage declining marine populations,

126
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Studies say that tens of thousands

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
might be around for another birthday

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
if we included more seafood.

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But it's not all about the seafood.

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's about the way that we look at our plates.

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
A couple things happened.

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I made more money.

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
People started buying appetizers and salads,

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
People spent more time engaging in their meals,

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
engaging with each other over their meals.

142
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
People got, in short, more of what they came there for

143
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
even though they got less protein.

144
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.

145
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They got healthier. I made more money.

146
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is great.

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Environmental consideration was served with every plate,

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but it was served with a heaping mound

149
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of consideration for human interests at the same time.

150
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
One of the other things we did

151
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
was begin to diversify the species that we served --

152
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Shellfish, mussels, oysters,

154
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.

155
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We were directing tastes

156
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
towards more resilience, more restorative options.

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This is what we need to favor.

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is what the green list says.

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.

160
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But what of those big predators,

161
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
those fashionable species,

162
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?

163
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.

164
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean,

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
so here we go.

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.

168
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Put it on four plates.

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Mound up those four plates with vegetables

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have,

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
light the candles and celebrate it.

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Invite your friends and neighbors over

174
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and repeat once a year,

175
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
maybe.

176
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I expect a lot from food.

177
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I expect health

178
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and joy and family and community.

179
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I expect that producing ingredients,

180
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
preparing dishes and eating meals

181
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is all part of the communion of human interests.

182
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.

183
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And he taught me very early on

184
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
about the privilege that eating represents.

185
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I remember well the meals of my childhood.

186
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They were reasonable portions of protein

187
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
served with copious quantities of vegetables

188
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and small amounts of starch, usually rice.

189
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
This is still how I largely eat today.

190
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I get sick when I go to steakhouses.

191
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I get the meat sweats.

192
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's like a hangover from protein.

193
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's disgusting.

194
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But of all the dire news that you'll hear

195
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and that you have heard about the state of our oceans,

196
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you

197
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
possibly the very worst of it

198
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and that is this whole time

199
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
your mother was right.

200
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Eat your vegetables.

201
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's pretty straightforward.

202
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So what are we looking for in a meal?

203
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients

204
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that are good for my body.

205
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt

206
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.

207
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
For family, I'm looking for recipes

208
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that genuflect to my own personal histories.

209
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
For community though, we start at the very beginning.

210
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
There's no escaping the fact

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that everything we eat has a global impact.

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and then take the first step to minimize it.

214
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We've seen an image of our blue planet,

215
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
our world bank.

216
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But it is more than just a repository of our resources;

217
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
it's also the global geography

218
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
of the communion we call dinner.

219
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So if we all take only what we need,

220
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
then we can begin to share the rest,

221
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we can begin to celebrate,

222
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we can begin to restore.

223
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We need to savor vegetables.

224
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And we need to save dinner.

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Thank you.

227
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Applause)

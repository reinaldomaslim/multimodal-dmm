1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that pays all the bills.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's held every two years in Burma.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I particularly remember a really good speech

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that what we create in advertising,

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you might call it badge value, subjective value,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
intangible value of some kind --

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
gets rather a bad rap.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You can either live in a world which is poorer,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which people in general don't like.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
constitutes a greater part of overall value,

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that actually intangible value, in many ways

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is a very, very fine substitute

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
for using up labor or limited resources

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in the creation of things.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The question was given to a bunch of engineers,

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And they came up with a very good engineering solution,

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
which was to spend six billion pounds

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
building completely new tracks

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
from London to the coast,

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
merely to make it shorter.

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion.

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and female supermodels,

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for the entire duration of the journey.

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Applause)

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.

46
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again.

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And this shows that engineers,

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
medical people, scientific people,

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
have an obsession with solving the problems of reality,

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth

52
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in society, most problems are actually problems of perception.

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So I'll ask you another question.

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What on earth is wrong with placebos?

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They work extraordinarily well.

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They have no side effects,

58
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog

61
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and actually produce placebo education.

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
It actually works by giving you the impression

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of unwarranted self-confidence,

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which then makes you very, very successful in later life.

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Applause)

72
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
How many problems of life can be solved

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
actually by tinkering with perception,

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business

76
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of actually trying to change reality?

77
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but doing a bit of historical research,

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it seems to be Fredrick the Great.

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And you get a far lower risk of famine,

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --

88
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
rather like contemporary Scottish people.

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So, actually, he tried making it compulsory.

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The Prussian peasantry said,

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
There are even records of people being executed

95
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
for refusing to grow potatoes.

96
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So he tried plan B.

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And he planted it in a royal potato patch,

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with guards who had instructions

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to guard over it, night and day,

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it's worth stealing.

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Before long, there was a massive underground

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
potato-growing operation in Germany.

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It was an absolute masterpiece.

111
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk."

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in Turkey, to modernize it.

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and a hell of a lot of resistance.

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Ataturk was a lateral thinker.

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Applause)

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.

124
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:

125
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
All convicted child molesters

126
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
have to drive a Porsche Cayenne.

127
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Which is that, actually, first one,

130
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
all value is actually relative.

131
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
All value is perceived value.

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice."

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso

134
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
decided to practice price discrimination

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.

137
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
As an advertising man, I have to admire that.

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But the first thing is that all value is subjective.

139
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
These funny signs that flash your speed at you,

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
some of the new ones, on the bottom right,

142
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,

143
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to act as an emotional trigger.

144
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of the running cost of a conventional speed camera,

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but they prevent twice as many accidents.

147
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling

148
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to conventional, classically trained economists,

149
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is that a weird little smiley face

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
has a better effect on changing your behavior

151
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Tiny little behavioral economics detail:

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in Italy, penalty points go backwards.

154
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You start with 12 and they take them away.

155
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Because they found that loss aversion

156
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is a more powerful influence on people's behavior.

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"

158
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Not so in Italy.

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Another fantastic case of creating intangible value

160
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,

161
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
after all, the environmental movement needs to be about:

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.

163
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
were encouraged to give in all their jewelry.

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And it was replaced with replica jewelry

166
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
made of cast iron.

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813."

168
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia

170
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
wasn't made of gold or diamonds.

171
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It was made of cast iron.

172
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value

173
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of having gold jewelry. This actually

174
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
had symbolic value, badge value.

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So, the modern equivalent would of course be this.

177
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

178
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,

179
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --

180
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
there are opposite kind of things

181
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
where actually the value in them depends on them being

182
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.

183
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.

184
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Adam Smith talks about 18th century America,

185
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
it was almost a block in the economy in New England,

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.

189
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures

190
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which lead to more egalitarian societies.

191
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
What's also interesting, if you look at products

192
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that have a high component

193
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
of what you might call messaging value,

194
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:

195
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They are often quite egalitarian.

196
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something

197
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
which replaces material value with symbolic value.

198
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,

199
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and you may not like the Coca-Cola company,

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
What Warhol said about Coke is, he said,

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States

203
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."

204
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Now, that is, actually, when you think about it -- we take it for granted --

205
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
it's actually a remarkable achievement,

206
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to produce something that's that democratic.

207
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now, we basically have to change our views slightly.

208
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
There is a basic view that real value involves making things,

209
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
involves labor. It involves engineering.

210
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It involves limited raw materials.

211
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.

212
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.

213
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It patently veers toward propaganda.

214
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
However, what we do have now

215
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is a much more variegated media ecosystem

216
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.

217
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood

218
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
as translated into food.

219
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You had a monopoly supplier. On the left,

220
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.

221
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And on your right you have a dependent public

223
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.

224
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

225
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Nowadays, the user is actually involved.

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."

227
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Although it's called agriculture in the world of food.

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Laughter)

229
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
This is actually called a mash-up,

230
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
where you take content that someone else has produced

231
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and you do something new with it.

232
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
In the world of food we call it cooking.

233
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
This is food 2.0,

234
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.

235
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
This is mobile food. British are very good at that.

236
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,

237
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the pie, the sandwich.

238
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We invented the whole lot of them.

239
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,

240
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but it's not very portable, generally.

241
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

242
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich.

243
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.

244
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Finally, we have contextual communication.

246
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.

247
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.

248
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It tastes great within the borders of that country,

249
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.

250
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

251
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Unicum in Hungary, for example.

252
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,

253
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
which even tastes shite when you're in Greece.

254
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

255
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But so much communication now is contextual

256
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that the capacity for actually nudging people,

257
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg,

258
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
at the University of Stanford, makes the point

259
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that actually the mobile phone is --

260
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies."

261
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,

262
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
contextual, timely and immediate,

263
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.

264
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal,

265
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
we simply have to ask the question,

266
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.

267
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I'll give you one example.

268
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,

269
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,

270
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
put 50 dollars into your pension,

271
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
you would save a lot more.

272
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines

273
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the behavior. Okay?

274
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating

275
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
opportunities for impulse buying.

276
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.

277
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
If you did this, more people would save more.

278
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's simply a question of changing the interface

279
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
by which people make decisions,

280
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and the very nature of the decisions changes.

281
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Obviously, I don't want people to do this,

282
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just

283
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
consumerism needlessly postponed.

284
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Laughter)

285
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But if anybody did want to do that,

286
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:

287
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.

288
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now, I've got an example here from Canada.

289
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada

290
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
called Hunter Somerville,

291
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
who was working in improv in Toronto,

292
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and got a part-time job in advertising,

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and was given the job of advertising Shreddies.

294
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now this is the most perfect case of creating

295
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
intangible, added value,

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
without changing the product in the slightest.

297
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,

298
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.

299
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.

300
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter)

301
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,

302
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
he came up with this.

303
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Video: (Buzzer)

304
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square.

305
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Laughter)

306
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?

307
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

308
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.

309
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.

310
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

311
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example

312
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
of intangible value creation. All it requires is

313
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.

314
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I would say it's a work of genius.

315
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.

316
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,

317
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which is something very exciting for them.

318
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.

319
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Laughter)

320
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,

321
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.

322
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Laughter)

323
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Woman: Weren't they square?

324
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.

325
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Man: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.

326
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,

327
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
if you flip it over it looks like a nine.

328
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But a six is very different from a nine.

329
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Woman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". Man: An "M" and a "W", exactly.

330
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Man #2: [unclear]

331
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that

332
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
it's more interesting looking.

333
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Man: Just try both of them.

334
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Take a square one there, first.

335
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
(Laughter)

336
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.

337
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Man: The first one?

338
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Laughter)

339
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.

340
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,

341
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
who actually resented this intrusion.

342
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So, eventually, the manufacturers actually

343
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.

344
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Laughter)

345
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Applause)

346
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Laughter)

347
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called

348
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
the American Institute of Wine Economics,

349
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
which actually does extensive research into perception of things,

350
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and discovers that except for among

351
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,

352
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment

353
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
in wine,

354
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
except when you tell the people how expensive it is,

355
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.

356
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So drink your wine blind in the future.

357
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
But this is both hysterically funny --

358
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
but I think an important philosophical point,

359
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.

360
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,

361
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and less time agonizing over what else we can do.

362
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Two quotations to more or less end with.

363
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things

364
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
familiar and familiar things new."

365
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is,

366
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also

367
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on

368
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
those things which are already existing.

369
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.

370
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Because they help people share news.

371
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.

372
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,

373
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and increase the kind of third-party

374
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.

375
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,

376
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
which is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,"

377
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.

378
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,

379
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
love, sex and other things,

380
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and learn to place a material value

381
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
on what you've previously discounted

382
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
for being merely intangible, a thing not seen,

383
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.

384
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Thank you very much indeed.

385
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
(Applause)

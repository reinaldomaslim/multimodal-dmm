1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to have a pretty simple idea

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and that is all of us are makers.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I really believe that.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
All of us are makers.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We're born makers.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We have this ability

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to make things,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to grasp things with our hands.

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We use words like "grasp" metaphorically

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to also think about understanding things.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We don't just live, but we make.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We create things.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well I'm going to show you a group of makers

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
from Maker Faire and various places.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It doesn't come out particularly well,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but that's a particularly tall bicycle.

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's a scraper bike; it's called --

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
from Oakland.

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And this is a particularly small scooter

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
for a gentleman of this size.

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But he's trying to power it, or motorize it,

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
with a drill.

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And the question he had is,

26
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Can I do it? Can it be done?"

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Apparently it can.

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
they're people who love

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
doing what they do.

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They don't always even know why they're doing it.

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We have begun organizing makers

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
at our Maker Faire.

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
There was one held in Detroit here last summer,

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But we hold them in San Francisco --

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Applause)

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
-- and in New York.

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And it's a fabulous event

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to just meet and talk to these people who make things

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and are there to just show them to you and talk about them

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and have a great conversation.

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Dale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Guy: Where did you guys get those?

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Muffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We got there first.

49
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Lady: Will you glide with us?

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
DD: This is something I call "swinging in the rain."

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And you can barely see it,

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?"

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's the experience of a clever ride.

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And of course, we have fashion.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
People are remaking things into fashion.

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I don't know if this is called a basket-bra,

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but it ought to be something like that.

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We have art students getting together,

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
taking old radiator parts

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
They did that in the summer, and it was very warm.

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You know what those are, right?

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter,

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000

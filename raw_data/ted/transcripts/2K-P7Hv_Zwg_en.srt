1
0:00:12.574,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Africa is booming.

2
0:00:14.361,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Per capita incomes since the year 2000

3
0:00:16.866,000 --> 0:00:17,000
have doubled,

4
0:00:18.466,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and this boom is impacting on everyone.

5
0:00:21.841,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Life expectancy has increased by one year

6
0:00:24.667,000 --> 0:00:26,000
every three years for the last decade.

7
0:00:27.417,000 --> 0:00:3,000
That means if an African child is born today,

8
0:00:30.902,000 --> 0:00:31,000
rather than three days ago,

9
0:00:32.69,000 --> 0:00:33,000
they will get an extra day of life

10
0:00:34.577,000 --> 0:00:36,000
at the end of their lifespan.

11
0:00:36.6,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's that quick.

12
0:00:38.391,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:

13
0:00:42.503,000 --> 0:00:46,000
600,000 less people a year are getting HIV

14
0:00:46.753,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in sub-Saharan Africa.

15
0:00:49.217,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The battle against malaria is being won,

16
0:00:52.279,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with deaths from malaria down 27 percent,

17
0:00:55.079,000 --> 0:00:56,000
according to the latest World Bank data.

18
0:00:56.841,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.

19
0:00:59.938,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This shouldn't surprise us,

20
0:01:02.11,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because actually, everybody grows.

21
0:01:04.859,000 --> 0:01:05,000
If you go back to Imperial Rome

22
0:01:06.835,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in the Year 1 A.D.,

23
0:01:09.04,000 --> 0:01:11,000
there was admittedly about 1,800 years

24
0:01:11.338,000 --> 0:01:13,000
where there wasn't an awful lot of growth.

25
0:01:13.585,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But then the people that the Romans

26
0:01:15.577,000 --> 0:01:18,000
would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,

27
0:01:19.392,000 --> 0:01:21,000
were actually part of the Industrial Revolution,

28
0:01:21.512,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,

29
0:01:24.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and you saw that get quicker and quicker,

30
0:01:27.24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and it's been impacting everyone.

31
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore

32
0:01:32.615,000 --> 0:01:34,000
or the tundra of northern Finland.

33
0:01:34.865,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when

34
0:01:37.786,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the inevitable happens.

35
0:01:40.12,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Among the reasons I think it's happening right now

36
0:01:42.741,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is the quality of the leadership across Africa.

37
0:01:46.223,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s,

38
0:01:49.541,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the greatest politician in the world was African,

39
0:01:53.237,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but I'm meeting brilliant people

40
0:01:55.848,000 --> 0:01:56,000
across the continent the entire time,

41
0:01:57.712,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and they're doing the reforms

42
0:01:59.28,000 --> 0:02:01,000
which have transformed the economic situation

43
0:02:01.792,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for their countries.

44
0:02:03.573,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And the West is engaging with that.

45
0:02:05.675,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The West has given debt forgiveness programs

46
0:02:07.994,000 --> 0:02:09,000
which have halved sub-Saharan debt

47
0:02:10.497,000 --> 0:02:13,000
from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40.

48
0:02:14.215,000 --> 0:02:16,000
At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120

49
0:02:16.904,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and we're all feeling slightly miserable

50
0:02:18.992,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as a result.

51
0:02:20.325,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Politics gets weaker when debt is high.

52
0:02:23.44,000 --> 0:02:24,000
When public sector debt is low,

53
0:02:25.403,000 --> 0:02:26,000
governments don't have to choose

54
0:02:26.875,000 --> 0:02:28,000
between investing in education and health

55
0:02:29.357,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and paying interest on that debt you owe.

56
0:02:31.632,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good.

57
0:02:34.854,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The private sector as well.

58
0:02:36.711,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Again, in the West, we have private sector debt

59
0:02:39.872,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of 200 percent of GDP in Spain,

60
0:02:42.127,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the U.K., and the U.S.

61
0:02:44.418,000 --> 0:02:46,000
That's an awful lot of debt.

62
0:02:46.493,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Africa, many African countries,

63
0:02:49.084,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.

64
0:02:52.57,000 --> 0:02:55,000
If there's any continent that can do what China has done --

65
0:02:56.122,000 --> 0:02:59,000
China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart --

66
0:02:59.539,000 --> 0:03:01,000
if anyone can do what China has done

67
0:03:01.687,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in the last 30 years,

68
0:03:03.816,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it'll be Africa in the next 30.

69
0:03:06.41,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt.

70
0:03:09.132,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do.

71
0:03:11.716,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Foreign direct investment

72
0:03:13.53,000 --> 0:03:16,000
has poured into Africa in the last 15 years.

73
0:03:17.208,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Back in the '70s,

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
no one touched the continent with a barge pole.

75
0:03:22.257,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And this investment is actually Western-led.

76
0:03:24.528,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We hear a lot about China,

77
0:03:26.369,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and they do lend a lot of money,

78
0:03:28.689,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years

79
0:03:31.264,000 --> 0:03:34,000
has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada.

80
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Ten percent's come from India.

81
0:03:36.936,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And they're investing in energy.

82
0:03:39.166,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now.

83
0:03:42.416,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia.

84
0:03:45.72,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And they're investing in telecoms,

85
0:03:47.791,000 --> 0:03:49,000
shopping malls.

86
0:03:49.796,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And this very encouraging story, I think,

87
0:03:53.038,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is partly demographic-led.

88
0:03:54.913,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And it's not just about African demographics.

89
0:03:58.25,000 --> 0:04:,000
I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds

90
0:04:01.225,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in various parts of the world,

91
0:04:03.507,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second.

92
0:04:06.898,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn

93
0:04:09.353,000 --> 0:04:11,000
setting up an iPhone factory, by chance.

94
0:04:12.068,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You might choose China,

95
0:04:13.688,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line,

96
0:04:15.89,000 --> 0:04:16,000
where there's 200 million young people,

97
0:04:17.834,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger.

98
0:04:22.679,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Which means you're going to have new guys

99
0:04:24.983,000 --> 0:04:26,000
knocking on the door saying, "Give us a job,"

100
0:04:27.345,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and, "I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job."

101
0:04:30.58,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, that's completely changed now.

102
0:04:33.168,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent

103
0:04:36.312,000 --> 0:04:4,000
fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China.

104
0:04:40.423,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So where do you set up your new factory?

105
0:04:43.624,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You look at South Asia, and people are.

106
0:04:45.411,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh,

107
0:04:47.466,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and they're also looking at Africa.

108
0:04:49.857,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And they're looking at Africa

109
0:04:51.648,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because that yellow line is showing you

110
0:04:54.162,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that the number of young Africans

111
0:04:55.822,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is going to continue to get bigger

112
0:04:57.413,000 --> 0:05:02,000
decade after decade after decade out to 2050.

113
0:05:02.832,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now, there's a problem with lots of young people

114
0:05:05.696,000 --> 0:05:06,000
coming into any market,

115
0:05:07.646,000 --> 0:05:08,000
particularly when they're young men.

116
0:05:09.19,000 --> 0:05:11,000
A bit dangerous, sometimes.

117
0:05:11.516,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I think one of the crucial factors

118
0:05:13.474,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is how educated is that demographic?

119
0:05:16.895,000 --> 0:05:17,000
If you look at the red line here,

120
0:05:18.827,000 --> 0:05:19,000
what you're going to see is that in 1975,

121
0:05:20.503,000 --> 0:05:22,000
just nine percent of kids

122
0:05:22.592,000 --> 0:05:24,000
were in secondary school education

123
0:05:24.992,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in sub-Saharan Africa.

124
0:05:27.65,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Would you set up a factory

125
0:05:29.417,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?

126
0:05:31.307,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Nobody else did.

127
0:05:32.627,000 --> 0:05:34,000
They chose instead Turkey and Mexico

128
0:05:35.28,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to set up the textiles factories,

129
0:05:37.776,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because their education levels

130
0:05:39.234,000 --> 0:05:41,000
were 25 to 30 percent.

131
0:05:42.135,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels

132
0:05:45.596,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.

133
0:05:49.332,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They will get the textiles jobs

134
0:05:52.511,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that will take people out of rural poverty

135
0:05:55.191,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.

136
0:05:59.855,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So what's Africa looking like today?

137
0:06:02.914,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is how I look at Africa.

138
0:06:04.575,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.

139
0:06:06.399,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Each little box is about a billion dollars,

140
0:06:08.31,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention

141
0:06:10.027,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to Nigeria sitting there in the middle.

142
0:06:12.319,000 --> 0:06:14,000
South Africa is playing a role.

143
0:06:14.484,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But when I'm thinking about the future,

144
0:06:16.563,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I'm actually most interested

145
0:06:19.114,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in Central, Western and Southern Africa.

146
0:06:21.879,000 --> 0:06:23,000
If I look at Africa by population,

147
0:06:24.441,000 --> 0:06:25,000
East Africa stands out

148
0:06:25.81,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as so much potential.

149
0:06:27.794,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And I'm showing you something else with these maps.

150
0:06:30.826,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.

151
0:06:33.568,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Fragile democracies is the beige color.

152
0:06:36.821,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Strong democracies are the orange color.

153
0:06:39.464,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And what you'll see here is that most Africans

154
0:06:42.194,000 --> 0:06:45,000
are now living in democracies.

155
0:06:46.013,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Why does that matter?

156
0:06:48.189,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Because what people want

157
0:06:50.623,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is what politicians try,

158
0:06:52.758,000 --> 0:06:55,000
they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.

159
0:06:55.849,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.

160
0:06:58.496,000 --> 0:07:,000
In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,

161
0:07:01.372,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the battle between the two candidates

162
0:07:03.602,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was over education.

163
0:07:06.875,000 --> 0:07:07,000
One guy offered free secondary school education

164
0:07:08.868,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to all, not just 30 percent.

165
0:07:11.216,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The other guy had to say,

166
0:07:12.535,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I'm going to build 50 new schools.

167
0:07:14.662,000 --> 0:07:16,000
He won by a margin.

168
0:07:17.521,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So democracy is encouraging governments

169
0:07:20.571,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to invest in education.

170
0:07:22.171,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Education is helping growth and investment,

171
0:07:24.256,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and that's giving budget revenues,

172
0:07:25.668,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which is giving governments more money,

173
0:07:27.507,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which is helping growth through education.

174
0:07:30.713,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It's a positive, virtuous circle.

175
0:07:33.248,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But I get asked this question,

176
0:07:35.809,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and this particular question makes me quite sad:

177
0:07:38.895,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's, "But what about corruption?

178
0:07:41.426,000 --> 0:07:45,000
How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?"

179
0:07:45.53,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And what makes me sad about it

180
0:07:47.171,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is that this graph here is showing you

181
0:07:49.196,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.

182
0:07:53.161,000 --> 0:07:57,000
When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.

183
0:07:57.707,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And the countries on the right hand side,

184
0:07:59.82,000 --> 0:08:,000
you'll see the per capita GDP,

185
0:08:01.543,000 --> 0:08:02,000
basically every country

186
0:08:03.368,000 --> 0:08:06,000
with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,

187
0:08:06.863,000 --> 0:08:08,000
has got a corruption score

188
0:08:09.083,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of roughly, what's that, about three?

189
0:08:12.118,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Three out of 10. That's not good.

190
0:08:14.401,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Every poor country is corrupt.

191
0:08:16.765,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt.

192
0:08:20.891,000 --> 0:08:24,000
How do you get from poverty and corruption

193
0:08:24.894,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to wealth and less corruption?

194
0:08:27.163,000 --> 0:08:29,000
You see the middle class grow.

195
0:08:29.355,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And the way to do that is to invest,

196
0:08:32.842,000 --> 0:08:35,000
not to say I'm not investing in that continent

197
0:08:36.222,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because there's too much corruption.

198
0:08:38.499,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.

199
0:08:41.176,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --

200
0:08:44.115,000 --> 0:08:46,000
not in Africa, actually.

201
0:08:46.227,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But what I'm saying here is that

202
0:08:47.925,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we can make a difference

203
0:08:49.715,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and we can do that by investing.

204
0:08:52.621,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.

205
0:08:56.128,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Economists aren't great at forecasting.

206
0:08:58.995,000 --> 0:09:,000
Because the question really is, what happens next?

207
0:09:01.107,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And if you go back to the year 2000,

208
0:09:03.631,000 --> 0:09:04,000
what you'll find is The Economist

209
0:09:05.394,000 --> 0:09:08,000
had a very famous cover, "The Hopeless Continent,"

210
0:09:08.562,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth

211
0:09:10.744,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --

212
0:09:14.874,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and they said,

213
0:09:16.978,000 --> 0:09:18,000
what's going to happen in the next 10 years?

214
0:09:19.511,000 --> 0:09:21,000
They assumed two percent,

215
0:09:21.89,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and that made it a pretty hopeless story,

216
0:09:23.783,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because population growth was two and a half.

217
0:09:26.933,000 --> 0:09:28,000
People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.

218
0:09:29.713,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover,

219
0:09:33.151,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and what does that new cover show?

220
0:09:34.997,000 --> 0:09:36,000
That new cover shows, well, Africa rising,

221
0:09:37.98,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because the growth over the last 10 years

222
0:09:39.707,000 --> 0:09:41,000
has been about five and a half percent.

223
0:09:42.327,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I would like to see if you can all now become economists,

224
0:09:45.853,000 --> 0:09:47,000
because if growth for the last 10 years

225
0:09:48.368,000 --> 0:09:5,000
has been five and a half percent,

226
0:09:50.488,000 --> 0:09:51,000
what do you think the IMF is forecasting

227
0:09:52.191,000 --> 0:09:55,000
for the next five years of growth in Africa?

228
0:09:55.211,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Very good. I think you're secretly saying

229
0:09:57.986,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to your head, probably five and a half percent.

230
0:10:00.168,000 --> 0:10:01,000
You're all economists, and I think,

231
0:10:02.11,000 --> 0:10:04,000
like most economists, wrong.

232
0:10:04.592,000 --> 0:10:06,000
No offense.

233
0:10:06.688,000 --> 0:10:08,000
What I like to do is try and find the countries

234
0:10:09.569,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that are doing exactly what Africa has already done,

235
0:10:13.73,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing

236
0:10:17.128,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.

237
0:10:20.175,000 --> 0:10:22,000
India is one of those examples.

238
0:10:22.829,000 --> 0:10:26,000
This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.

239
0:10:26.948,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second.

240
0:10:29.862,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Actually, for the first 20 years,

241
0:10:32.232,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.

242
0:10:35.275,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It grew at two percent

243
0:10:37.336,000 --> 0:10:4,000
when population growth was about two and a half.

244
0:10:40.416,000 --> 0:10:42,000
If that's familiar, that's exactly what happened

245
0:10:42.596,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.

246
0:10:44.891,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And then something happened in 1980.

247
0:10:46.665,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Boom! India began to explode.

248
0:10:48.888,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth,"

249
0:10:51.172,000 --> 0:10:54,000
"democracies can't grow." Actually India could.

250
0:10:54.228,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And if I lay sub-Saharan growth

251
0:10:57.034,000 --> 0:10:59,000
on top of the Indian growth story,

252
0:10:59.302,000 --> 0:11:01,000
it's remarkably similar.

253
0:11:01.918,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Twenty years of not much growth

254
0:11:04.205,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and a trend line which is actually telling you

255
0:11:05.759,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that sub-Saharan African growth is

256
0:11:07.749,000 --> 0:11:09,000
slightly better than India.

257
0:11:10.31,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,

258
0:11:13.745,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,

259
0:11:16.569,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,

260
0:11:20.675,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I can draw out some forecasts

261
0:11:22.852,000 --> 0:11:24,000
for the next 30 to 40 years

262
0:11:25.172,000 --> 0:11:27,000
which I think are better

263
0:11:27.242,000 --> 0:11:29,000
than the ones where you're looking backwards.

264
0:11:30.094,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And that tells me this:

265
0:11:32.441,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that Africa is going to go

266
0:11:34.223,000 --> 0:11:37,000
from a $2 trillion economy today

267
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to a $29 trillion economy by 2050.

268
0:11:41.532,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now that's bigger than Europe and America

269
0:11:43.54,000 --> 0:11:46,000
put together in today's money.

270
0:11:46.998,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.

271
0:11:50.918,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The population's going to double

272
0:11:52.656,000 --> 0:11:53,000
from one billion to two billion,

273
0:11:54.109,000 --> 0:11:57,000
so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold

274
0:11:57.459,000 --> 0:11:59,000
in the next 35 years.

275
0:12:00.323,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And when I present this in Africa --

276
0:12:03.44,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Nairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.

277
0:12:07.244,000 --> 0:12:11,000
"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?"

278
0:12:12.112,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And you know what?

279
0:12:13.955,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Actually, I think they've got a point.

280
0:12:16.344,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned,

281
0:12:18.816,000 --> 0:12:21,000
yes from the positives in Asia and India,

282
0:12:22.1,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but also the negatives?

283
0:12:23.478,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.

284
0:12:26.04,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here

285
0:12:29.435,000 --> 0:12:3,000
this last week,

286
0:12:31.044,000 --> 0:12:32,000
surely some of these can perhaps

287
0:12:32.988,000 --> 0:12:34,000
help Africa grow even faster?

288
0:12:35.716,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I think here we can play a role.

289
0:12:38.151,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Because technology does let you help.

290
0:12:40.994,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You can go and download

291
0:12:43.133,000 --> 0:12:45,000
some of the great African literature

292
0:12:45.168,000 --> 0:12:46,000
from the Internet now.

293
0:12:46.967,000 --> 0:12:48,000
No, not right now, just 30 seconds.

294
0:12:49.44,000 --> 0:12:51,000
You can go and buy some of the great tunes.

295
0:12:51.63,000 --> 0:12:52,000
My iPod's full of them.

296
0:12:53.361,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Buy African products.

297
0:12:55.051,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Go on holiday and see for yourself

298
0:12:57.016,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the change that's happening.

299
0:12:58.565,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Invest.

300
0:12:59.97,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Perhaps hire people, give them the skills

301
0:13:02.096,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that they can take back to Africa,

302
0:13:04.365,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and their companies will grow an awful lot faster

303
0:13:06.63,000 --> 0:13:08,000
than most of ours here in the West.

304
0:13:09.28,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And then you and I can help make sure

305
0:13:13.581,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that for Africa, the 21st century is their century.

306
0:13:17.71,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Thank you very much.

307
0:13:19.52,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Applause)

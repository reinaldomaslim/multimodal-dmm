1
0:00:12.461,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Bryn Freedman: So you said that in the 20th century,

2
0:00:15.896,000 --> 0:00:17,000
global power was in the hands of government.

3
0:00:18.741,000 --> 0:00:2,000
At the beginning of this digital century,

4
0:00:21.234,000 --> 0:00:22,000
it really moved to corporations

5
0:00:23.019,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that in the future, it would move to individuals.

6
0:00:26.948,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I've interviewed a lot of people,

7
0:00:28.758,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and they say you're wrong,

8
0:00:30.634,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and they are betting on the companies.

9
0:00:32.777,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So why are you right,

10
0:00:34.46,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and why are individuals going to win out?

11
0:00:37.419,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Fadi Chehadé: Because companies cater to individuals,

12
0:00:39.992,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and we as the citizenry

13
0:00:42.049,000 --> 0:00:46,000
need to start understanding that we have a big role

14
0:00:46.564,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in shaping how the world will be governed, moving forward.

15
0:00:49.624,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Yes, indeed, the tug of war right now is between governments,

16
0:00:53.915,000 --> 0:00:56,000
who lost much of their power to companies

17
0:00:57.009,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because the internet is not built around the nation-state system

18
0:01:01.291,000 --> 0:01:03,000
around which governments have power.

19
0:01:03.355,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The internet is transnational.

20
0:01:05.236,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's not international, and it's not national,

21
0:01:08.299,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and therefore the companies became very powerful.

22
0:01:12.028,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They shape our economy.

23
0:01:13.926,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They shape our society.

24
0:01:15.942,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Governments don't know what to do.

25
0:01:17.609,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Right now, they're reacting.

26
0:01:19.649,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I fear that if we do not, as the citizenry --

27
0:01:22.967,000 --> 0:01:26,000
which are, in my opinion, the most important leg of that stool --

28
0:01:27.739,000 --> 0:01:28,000
don't take our role,

29
0:01:29.285,000 --> 0:01:3,000
then you are right.

30
0:01:30.502,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The detractors, or the people telling you that businesses will prevail, are right.

31
0:01:35.287,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It will happen.

32
0:01:36.462,000 --> 0:01:39,000
BF: So are you saying that individuals will force businesses

33
0:01:40.318,000 --> 0:01:42,000
or business will be forced to be responsive,

34
0:01:42.85,000 --> 0:01:45,000
or is there a fear that they won't be?

35
0:01:46.247,000 --> 0:01:47,000
FC: I think they will be.

36
0:01:47.643,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Look at two weeks ago,

37
0:01:49.517,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a small company called Skip winning over Uber and Lyft and everyone

38
0:01:53.953,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to actually get the license for the San Francisco scooter business.

39
0:01:59.232,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And if you read why did Skip win,

40
0:02:01.422,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because Skip listened to the people of San Francisco,

41
0:02:04.342,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who were tired of scooters being thrown everywhere,

42
0:02:07.215,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and actually went to the city and said,

43
0:02:09.913,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"We will deploy the service,

44
0:02:12.103,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but we will respond to the people's requirements

45
0:02:15.183,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that we organize ourselves around a set of rules."

46
0:02:18.277,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They self-governed their behavior, and they won the contract

47
0:02:21.667,000 --> 0:02:23,000
over some very powerful companies.

48
0:02:23.731,000 --> 0:02:26,000
BF: So speaking of guidelines and self-governance,

49
0:02:27.321,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you've spent an entire lifetime creating guidelines and norms

50
0:02:31.366,000 --> 0:02:32,000
for the internet.

51
0:02:33.088,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Do you think those days are over?

52
0:02:34.851,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Who is going to guide, who is going to control,

53
0:02:37.637,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and who is going to create those norms?

54
0:02:39.812,000 --> 0:02:44,000
FC: The rules that govern the technology layers of the internet

55
0:02:45.196,000 --> 0:02:47,000
are now well put in place,

56
0:02:47.903,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and I was very busy for a few years setting those rules

57
0:02:51.379,000 --> 0:02:55,000
around the part of the internet that makes the internet one network.

58
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The domain-name system, the IP numbers,

59
0:02:58.029,000 --> 0:02:59,000
all of that is in place.

60
0:02:59.769,000 --> 0:03:03,000
However, as we get now into the upper layers of the internet,

61
0:03:04.127,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the issues that affect me and you every day --

62
0:03:06.977,000 --> 0:03:08,000
privacy, security, etc. --

63
0:03:09.803,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the system to create norms for those unfortunately is not in place.

64
0:03:17.109,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So we do have an issue.

65
0:03:18.737,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We have a system of cooperation and governance

66
0:03:22.411,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that really needs to be created right now

67
0:03:25.269,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so that companies, governments and the citizenry can agree

68
0:03:30.024,000 --> 0:03:32,000
how this new digital world is going to advance.

69
0:03:32.39,000 --> 0:03:35,000
BF: So what gives a digital company any incentive?

70
0:03:35.596,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Let's say -- Facebook comes to mind --

71
0:03:37.645,000 --> 0:03:39,000
they would say they have their users' best interests at heart,

72
0:03:40.614,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but I think a lot of people would disagree with that.

73
0:03:43.177,000 --> 0:03:48,000
FC: It's been very difficult to watch how tech companies have reacted

74
0:03:49.109,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to the citizenry's response to their technologies.

75
0:03:52.791,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And some of them, two or three years ago, basically dismissed it.

76
0:03:56.499,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The word that I heard in many board rooms is, "We're just a technology platform.

77
0:04:01.888,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It's not my issue if my technology platform

78
0:04:04.8,000 --> 0:04:06,000
causes families to go kill their girls in Pakistan.

79
0:04:07.635,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It's not my issue. It's their problem.

80
0:04:09.946,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I just have a technology platform."

81
0:04:11.939,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now, I think we are now entering a stage

82
0:04:15.178,000 --> 0:04:2,000
where companies are starting to realize this is no longer sustainable,

83
0:04:20.513,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and they're starting to see the pushback

84
0:04:22.703,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that's coming from people, users, citizens,

85
0:04:25.862,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but also governments that are starting to say,

86
0:04:28.5,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"This cannot be."

87
0:04:30.087,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So I think there is a maturity that is starting to set,

88
0:04:35.54,000 --> 0:04:37,000
especially in that Silicon Valley area,

89
0:04:38.038,000 --> 0:04:42,000
where people are beginning to say, "We have a role."

90
0:04:42.585,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So when I speak to these leaders, I say,

91
0:04:45.165,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"Look, you could be the CEO, a very successful CEO of a company,

92
0:04:49.042,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but you could also be a steward."

93
0:04:51.669,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And that's the key word.

94
0:04:52.906,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"You could be a steward of the power you have

95
0:04:56.482,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to shape the lives and the economies of billions of people.

96
0:05:00.967,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Which one do you want to be?"

97
0:05:03.218,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And the answer is, it's not one or the other.

98
0:05:06.568,000 --> 0:05:08,000
This is what we are missing right now.

99
0:05:09.073,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So when an adult like Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft,

100
0:05:13.125,000 --> 0:05:14,000
said a few months ago,

101
0:05:14.637,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"We need a new set of Geneva Conventions

102
0:05:17.581,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to manage the security of the digital space,"

103
0:05:20.294,000 --> 0:05:23,000
many of the senior leaders in Silicon Valley

104
0:05:23.985,000 --> 0:05:26,000
actually spoke against his words.

105
0:05:27.326,000 --> 0:05:28,000
"What do you mean, Geneva Convention?

106
0:05:29.186,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We don't need any Geneva Conventions. We self-regulate."

107
0:05:32.157,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But that mood is changing,

108
0:05:34.289,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and I'm starting to see many leaders say,

109
0:05:37.519,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"Help us out."

110
0:05:39.201,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But here lies the conundrum.

111
0:05:41.909,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Who is going to help those leaders do the right thing?

112
0:05:44.846,000 --> 0:05:46,000
BF: So who is going to help them?

113
0:05:47.449,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Because I'd love to interview you for an hour,

114
0:05:51.609,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but give me your biggest fear and your best hope

115
0:05:56.862,000 --> 0:05:57,000
for how this is going to work out.

116
0:06:00.981,000 --> 0:06:06,000
FC: My biggest hope is that we will become each stewards

117
0:06:07.744,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of this new digital world.

118
0:06:09.358,000 --> 0:06:1,000
That's my biggest hope,

119
0:06:10.763,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because I do think, often, we want to put the blame on others.

120
0:06:15.811,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"Oh, it's these CEOs. They're behaving this way."

121
0:06:18.236,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"These governments are not doing enough."

122
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But how about us?

123
0:06:21.948,000 --> 0:06:26,000
How is each of us actually taking the responsibility to be a steward

124
0:06:27.044,000 --> 0:06:29,000
of the digital space we live in?

125
0:06:29.297,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And one of the things I've been pushing on university presidents

126
0:06:32.544,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is we need every engineering and science and computer science student

127
0:06:36.908,000 --> 0:06:38,000
who is about to write the next line of code

128
0:06:39.467,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or design the next IoT device

129
0:06:41.8,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to actually have in them a sense of responsibility and stewardship

130
0:06:46.651,000 --> 0:06:47,000
towards what they're building.

131
0:06:48.184,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So I suggested we create a new oath,

132
0:06:50.604,000 --> 0:06:51,000
like the Hippocratic Oath,

133
0:06:52.287,000 --> 0:06:54,000
so that every student entering an engineering program

134
0:06:55.239,000 --> 0:06:58,000
takes a technocratic oath or a wisdom oath

135
0:06:58.864,000 --> 0:07:,000
or some oath of commitment to the rest of us.

136
0:07:01.801,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That's my best hope, that we all rise.

137
0:07:04.501,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Because governments and businesses will fight over this power game,

138
0:07:09.438,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but where are we?

139
0:07:10.996,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And unless we play into that power table,

140
0:07:15.472,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I think we'll end up in a bad place.

141
0:07:18.395,000 --> 0:07:19,000
My biggest fear?

142
0:07:21.392,000 --> 0:07:23,000
My biggest fear, to be very tactical today,

143
0:07:24.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
what is keeping me up at night

144
0:07:26.543,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is the current war between the West, the liberal world,

145
0:07:33.304,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and China,

146
0:07:34.837,000 --> 0:07:36,000
in the area of artificial intelligence.

147
0:07:37.138,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There is a real war going on,

148
0:07:39.408,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and for those of us who have lived through the nuclear nonproliferation age

149
0:07:44.423,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and saw how people agreed

150
0:07:46.811,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to take some very dangerous things off the table,

151
0:07:50.787,000 --> 0:07:53,000
well, the Carnegie Endowment just finished a study.

152
0:07:54.49,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They talked to every country that made nuclear weapons

153
0:07:57.245,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and asked them,

154
0:07:59.046,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"Which digital 'weapon' would you take off the table

155
0:08:04.829,000 --> 0:08:06,000
against somebody else's schools or hospitals?"

156
0:08:07.828,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And the answer --

157
0:08:09.051,000 --> 0:08:12,000
from every nuclear power -- to this question was,

158
0:08:13.447,000 --> 0:08:14,000
nothing.

159
0:08:15.693,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That's what I'm worried about ...

160
0:08:18.161,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The weaponization of the digital space,

161
0:08:21.105,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and the race to get there.

162
0:08:22.741,000 --> 0:08:24,000
BF: Well, it sounds like you've got a lot of work to do,

163
0:08:25.56,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and so do the rest of us.

164
0:08:27.155,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Fadi, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

165
0:08:29.865,000 --> 0:08:3,000
FC: Thank you.

166
0:08:31.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000

2
0:00:15.885,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I love my food.

3
0:00:17.635,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And I love information.

4
0:00:20.441,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My children usually tell me

5
0:00:23.756,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other.

6
0:00:27.218,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.302,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so

8
0:00:31.552,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is to take you through how those passions developed,

9
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the point in my life when the two passions merged,

10
0:00:37.12,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the journey of learning that took place from that point.

11
0:00:42.085,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And one idea I want to leave you with today

12
0:00:44.881,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is what would would happen differently in your life

13
0:00:47.487,000 --> 0:00:51,000
if you saw information the way you saw food?

14
0:00:52.129,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was born in Calcutta --

15
0:00:54.3,000 --> 0:00:57,000
a family where my father and his father before him

16
0:00:58.135,000 --> 0:00:59,000
were journalists,

17
0:00:59.862,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and they wrote magazines in the English language.

18
0:01:02.885,000 --> 0:01:04,000
That was the family business.

19
0:01:05.093,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And as a result of that,

20
0:01:06.843,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I grew up with books everywhere around the house.

21
0:01:09.802,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I mean books everywhere around the house.

22
0:01:13.247,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And that's actually a shop in Calcutta,

23
0:01:15.718,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but it's a place where we like our books.

24
0:01:19.22,000 --> 0:01:22,000
In fact, I've got 38,000 of them now

25
0:01:22.522,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and no Kindle in sight.

26
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere,

27
0:01:30.415,000 --> 0:01:32,000
with people to talk to about those books,

28
0:01:32.937,000 --> 0:01:35,000
this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing.

29
0:01:36.008,000 --> 0:01:39,000
By the time I was 18, I had a deep passion for books.

30
0:01:39.518,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It wasn't the only passion I had.

31
0:01:42.039,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was a South Indian

32
0:01:44.173,000 --> 0:01:46,000
brought up in Bengal.

33
0:01:46.32,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And two of the things about Bengal:

34
0:01:48.8,000 --> 0:01:5,000
they like their savory dishes

35
0:01:51.312,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and they like their sweets.

36
0:01:53.124,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So by the time I grew up,

37
0:01:54.895,000 --> 0:01:57,000
again, I had a well-established passion for food.

38
0:01:58.55,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now I was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s,

39
0:02:01.706,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in,

40
0:02:05.166,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but these two were the ones that differentiated me.

41
0:02:08.483,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:09.843,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And then life was fine, dandy.

43
0:02:12.694,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Everything was okay,

44
0:02:14.352,000 --> 0:02:17,000
until I got to about the age of 26,

45
0:02:18.231,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I went to a movie called "Short Circuit."

46
0:02:21.843,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Oh, some of you have seen it.

47
0:02:23.843,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And apparently it's being remade right now

48
0:02:27.218,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and it's going to be coming out next year.

49
0:02:29.247,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's the story of this experimental robot

50
0:02:32.666,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which got electrocuted and found a life.

51
0:02:35.623,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And as it ran, this thing was saying, "Give me input. Give me input."

52
0:02:39.76,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I suddenly realized that for a robot

53
0:02:42.264,000 --> 0:02:45,000
both information as well as food

54
0:02:45.733,000 --> 0:02:47,000
were the same thing.

55
0:02:47.927,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Energy came to it in some form or shape,

56
0:02:50.552,000 --> 0:02:52,000
data came to it in some form or shape.

57
0:02:52.689,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I began to think,

58
0:02:55.135,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I wonder what it would be like

59
0:02:56.885,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to start imagining myself

60
0:02:59.329,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as if energy and information were the two things I had as input --

61
0:03:03.71,000 --> 0:03:07,000
as if food and information were similar in some form or shape.

62
0:03:07.767,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I started doing some research then, and this was the 25-year journey,

63
0:03:11.158,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and started finding out

64
0:03:12.587,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that actually human beings as primates

65
0:03:16.295,000 --> 0:03:18,000
have far smaller stomachs

66
0:03:18.91,000 --> 0:03:21,000
than should be the size for our body weight

67
0:03:22.144,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and far larger brains.

68
0:03:25.079,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And as I went to research that even further,

69
0:03:28.373,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I got to a point where I discovered something

70
0:03:31.968,000 --> 0:03:34,000
called the expensive tissue hypothesis.

71
0:03:35.362,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That actually for a given body mass of a primate

72
0:03:39.452,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the metabolic rate was static.

73
0:03:42.015,000 --> 0:03:45,000
What changed was the balance of the tissues available.

74
0:03:45.773,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And two of the most expensive tissues in our human body

75
0:03:49.393,000 --> 0:03:52,000
are nervous tissue and digestive tissue.

76
0:03:53.162,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis

77
0:03:57.339,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995.

78
0:04:01.844,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It's a lady named Leslie Aiello.

79
0:04:04.802,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other.

80
0:04:09.594,000 --> 0:04:12,000
If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large,

81
0:04:13.302,000 --> 0:04:16,000
you had to live with a smaller gut.

82
0:04:16.449,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That then set me off completely

83
0:04:19.283,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to say, Okay, these two are connected.

84
0:04:22.003,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food

85
0:04:26.189,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and said, So we were hunter-gathers of information.

86
0:04:29.01,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information.

87
0:04:33.385,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Does that really explain what we're seeing

88
0:04:35.135,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with the intellectual property battles nowadays?

89
0:04:37.885,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Because those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin

90
0:04:41.218,000 --> 0:04:44,000
wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted,

91
0:04:44.885,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and those that were in the business of farming information

92
0:04:47.51,000 --> 0:04:49,000
wanted to build fences around it,

93
0:04:49.885,000 --> 0:04:52,000
create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement.

94
0:04:53.556,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So there was always going to be a tension within that.

95
0:04:56.52,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And everything I saw in the cultivation

96
0:04:58.577,000 --> 0:05:,000
said there were huge fights amongst the foodies

97
0:05:01.135,000 --> 0:05:03,000
between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers.

98
0:05:03.362,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And this is happening here.

99
0:05:05.677,000 --> 0:05:07,000
When I moved to preparation, this same thing was true,

100
0:05:08.558,000 --> 0:05:1,000
expect that there were two schools.

101
0:05:10.885,000 --> 0:05:13,000
One group of people said you can distill your information,

102
0:05:13.968,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you can extract value, separate it and serve it up,

103
0:05:17.343,000 --> 0:05:18,000
while another group turned around

104
0:05:19.087,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and said no, no you can ferment it.

105
0:05:20.824,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You bring it all together and mash it up

106
0:05:23.489,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and the value emerges that way.

107
0:05:25.578,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The same is again true with information.

108
0:05:28.239,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable.

109
0:05:31.958,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Because what I began to see then

110
0:05:34.315,000 --> 0:05:37,000
was there were so many different ways people would consume this.

111
0:05:37.76,000 --> 0:05:39,000
They'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients.

112
0:05:40.248,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Do you cook it? Do you have it served to you?

113
0:05:42.389,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Do you go to a restaurant?

114
0:05:44.077,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The same is true every time as I started thinking about information.

115
0:05:47.851,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The analogies were getting crazy --

116
0:05:50.364,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that information had sell-by dates,

117
0:05:53.06,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that people had misused information that wasn't dated properly

118
0:05:57.01,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and could really make an effect on the stock market,

119
0:05:59.343,000 --> 0:06:01,000
on corporate values, etc.

120
0:06:01.746,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And by this time I was hooked.

121
0:06:04.142,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And this is about 23 years into this process.

122
0:06:07.137,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And I began to start thinking of myself

123
0:06:09.427,000 --> 0:06:12,000
as we start having mash-ups of fact and fiction,

124
0:06:12.898,000 --> 0:06:15,000
docu-dramas, mockumentaries, whatever you call it.

125
0:06:16.385,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Are we going to reach the stage

126
0:06:17.845,000 --> 0:06:21,000
where information has a percentage for fact associated with it?

127
0:06:22.403,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We start labeling information for the fact percentage?

128
0:06:25.84,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Are we going to start looking at what happens

129
0:06:28.468,000 --> 0:06:31,000
when your information source is turned off, as a famine?

130
0:06:32.047,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Which brings me to the final element of this.

131
0:06:34.614,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Clay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload,

132
0:06:37.76,000 --> 0:06:4,000
there is only filter failure.

133
0:06:40.927,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I put it to you that information,

134
0:06:43.552,000 --> 0:06:45,000
if viewed from the point of food,

135
0:06:45.949,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is never a production issue; you never speak of food overload.

136
0:06:49.835,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Fundamentally it's a consumption issue.

137
0:06:52.031,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And we have to start thinking

138
0:06:54.052,000 --> 0:06:59,000
about how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves,

139
0:06:59.433,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to have the faculties to be able to deal with information,

140
0:07:01.968,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly.

141
0:07:05.718,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In fact, when I saw "Supersize Me," I starting thinking of saying,

142
0:07:09.552,000 --> 0:07:1,000
What would happen

143
0:07:11.51,000 --> 0:07:15,000
if an individual had 31 days nonstop Fox News?

144
0:07:15.704,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:17.068,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Would there be time to be able to work with it?

146
0:07:19.97,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So you start really understanding

147
0:07:22.933,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that you can have diseases, toxins, a need to balance your diet,

148
0:07:29.287,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and once you start looking, and from that point on,

149
0:07:32.198,000 --> 0:07:35,000
everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information,

150
0:07:35.885,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the production of information, the preparation of information,

151
0:07:39.215,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I've looked at from the viewpoint of food.

152
0:07:42.748,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It has probably not helped my waistline any

153
0:07:45.218,000 --> 0:07:47,000
because I like practicing on both sides.

154
0:07:47.706,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But I'd like to leave you with just that question:

155
0:07:51.427,000 --> 0:07:53,000
If you began to think of all the information that you consume

156
0:07:54.41,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the way you think of food,

157
0:07:55.993,000 --> 0:07:56,000
what would you do differently?

158

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky.

2
0:00:20.625,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We don't live in the world our mothers lived in,

3
0:00:23.476,000 --> 0:00:24,000
our grandmothers lived in,

4
0:00:24.739,000 --> 0:00:26,000
where career choices for women were so limited.

5
0:00:27.628,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And if you're in this room today,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights,

7
0:00:34.028,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them.

8
0:00:38.641,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But all that aside, we still have a problem,

9
0:00:41.37,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and it's a real problem.

10
0:00:42.609,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And the problem is this:

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Women are not making it to the top of any profession

12
0:00:48.456,000 --> 0:00:49,000
anywhere in the world.

13
0:00:50.354,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The numbers tell the story quite clearly.

14
0:00:52.811,000 --> 0:00:55,000
190 heads of state -- nine are women.

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Of all the people in parliament in the world,

16
0:00:58.75,000 --> 0:00:59,000
13 percent are women.

17
0:01:01.058,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In the corporate sector, women at the top,

18
0:01:03.926,000 --> 0:01:05,000
C-level jobs, board seats --

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
tops out at 15, 16 percent.

20
0:01:09.025,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The numbers have not moved since 2002

21
0:01:12.001,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and are going in the wrong direction.

22
0:01:14.472,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And even in the non-profit world,

23
0:01:16.628,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women,

24
0:01:19.924,000 --> 0:01:21,000
women at the top: 20 percent.

25
0:01:23.282,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We also have another problem,

26
0:01:24.724,000 --> 0:01:26,000
which is that women face harder choices

27
0:01:27.138,000 --> 0:01:3,000
between professional success and personal fulfillment.

28
0:01:30.735,000 --> 0:01:35,000
A recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers,

29
0:01:35.805,000 --> 0:01:37,000
two-thirds of the married men had children

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and only one-third of the married women had children.

31
0:01:41.929,000 --> 0:01:43,000
A couple of years ago, I was in New York,

32
0:01:43.963,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and I was pitching a deal,

33
0:01:45.443,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices

34
0:01:48.818,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you can picture.

35
0:01:50.015,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I'm in the meeting -- it's about a three-hour meeting --

36
0:01:52.849,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and two hours in, there needs to be that bio break,

37
0:01:56.032,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and everyone stands up,

38
0:01:57.863,000 --> 0:02:,000
and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed.

39
0:02:01.521,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office.

40
0:02:05.818,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So I start looking around for moving boxes,

41
0:02:08.385,000 --> 0:02:1,000
figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any.

42
0:02:10.695,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And so I said, "Did you just move into this office?"

43
0:02:14.02,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And he said, "No, we've been here about a year."

44
0:02:16.889,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And I said, "Are you telling me that I am the only woman

45
0:02:21.014,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?"

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And he looked at me, and he said,

47
0:02:25.87,000 --> 0:02:28,000
"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom."

48
0:02:29.475,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:31.898,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So the question is, how are we going to fix this?

50
0:02:36.867,000 --> 0:02:39,000
How do we change these numbers at the top?

51
0:02:40.143,000 --> 0:02:42,000
How do we make this different?

52
0:02:42.879,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I want to start out by saying, I talk about this --

53
0:02:45.54,000 --> 0:02:47,000
about keeping women in the workforce --

54
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because I really think that's the answer.

55
0:02:50.873,000 --> 0:02:52,000
In the high-income part of our workforce,

56
0:02:53.159,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in the people who end up at the top --

57
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Fortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries --

58
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out.

59
0:03:03.931,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now people talk about this a lot,

60
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring

61
0:03:09.298,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and programs companies should have to train women.

62
0:03:11.807,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I want to talk about none of that today,

63
0:03:13.736,000 --> 0:03:15,000
even though that's all really important.

64
0:03:15.762,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals.

65
0:03:18.955,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What are the messages we need to tell ourselves?

66
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us?

67
0:03:24.448,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What are the messages we tell our daughters?

68
0:03:26.901,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear

69
0:03:29.324,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that this speech comes with no judgments.

70
0:03:31.43,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I don't have the right answer.

71
0:03:33.034,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I don't even have it for myself.

72
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday,

73
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and I was getting on the plane for this conference.

74
0:03:41.05,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool,

75
0:03:44.17,000 --> 0:03:47,000
did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, "Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing.

76
0:03:47.861,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.

77
0:03:50.707,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I know no women,

78
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce,

79
0:03:55.094,000 --> 0:03:56,000
who don't feel that sometimes.

80
0:03:56.657,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce

81
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
is the right thing for everyone.

82
0:04:01.588,000 --> 0:04:03,000
My talk today is about what the messages are

83
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
if you do want to stay in the workforce,

84
0:04:06.641,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and I think there are three.

85
0:04:08.775,000 --> 0:04:09,000
One, sit at the table.

86
0:04:11.164,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Two, make your partner a real partner.

87
0:04:14.466,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And three, don't leave before you leave.

88
0:04:19.056,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Number one: sit at the table.

89
0:04:21.114,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook,

90
0:04:22.963,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we hosted a very senior government official,

91
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and he came in to meet with senior execs

92
0:04:28.505,000 --> 0:04:29,000
from around Silicon Valley.

93
0:04:30.614,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And everyone kind of sat at the table.

94
0:04:32.82,000 --> 0:04:34,000
He had these two women who were traveling with him

95
0:04:35.416,000 --> 0:04:36,000
pretty senior in his department,

96
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and I kind of said to them,

97
0:04:38.57,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table,"

98
0:04:40.808,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and they sat on the side of the room.

99
0:04:43.793,000 --> 0:04:44,000
When I was in college, my senior year,

100
0:04:45.769,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I took a course called European Intellectual History.

101
0:04:48.292,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Don't you love that kind of thing from college?

102
0:04:50.523,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I wish I could do that now.

103
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I took it with my roommate, Carrie,

104
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
who was then a brilliant literary student --

105
0:04:56.824,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar --

106
0:04:59.158,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and my brother -- smart guy,

107
0:05:01.199,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but a water-polo-playing pre-med,

108
0:05:02.838,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who was a sophomore.

109
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The three of us take this class together.

110
0:05:06.818,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin,

111
0:05:11.018,000 --> 0:05:12,000
goes to all the lectures.

112
0:05:12.734,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I read all the books in English

113
0:05:14.808,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and go to most of the lectures.

114
0:05:16.489,000 --> 0:05:17,000
My brother is kind of busy.

115
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures,

116
0:05:21.996,000 --> 0:05:24,000
marches himself up to our room

117
0:05:25.067,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored.

118
0:05:28.117,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down.

119
0:05:30.822,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And we sit there for three hours --

120
0:05:33.005,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and our little blue notebooks -- yes, I'm that old.

121
0:05:35.41,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We walk out, we look at each other, and we say, "How did you do?"

122
0:05:38.649,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point

123
0:05:42.15,000 --> 0:05:43,000
on the Hegelian dialectic."

124
0:05:43.749,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And I say, "God, I really wish I had really connected

125
0:05:46.698,000 --> 0:05:49,000
John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow."

126
0:05:49.937,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And my brother says,

127
0:05:51.465,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"I got the top grade in the class."

128
0:05:53.404,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:55.373,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"You got the top grade in the class?

130
0:05:57.493,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You don't know anything."

131
0:05:59.067,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:00.491,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows:

133
0:06:05.063,000 --> 0:06:08,000
women systematically underestimate their own abilities.

134
0:06:08.577,000 --> 0:06:09,000
If you test men and women,

135
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs,

136
0:06:13.878,000 --> 0:06:14,000
men get it wrong slightly high,

137
0:06:15.766,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and women get it wrong slightly low.

138
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce.

139
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
A study in the last two years

140
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of people entering the workforce out of college

141
0:06:25.901,000 --> 0:06:29,000
showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess,

142
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
are negotiating their first salary,

143
0:06:32.685,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and only seven percent of women.

144
0:06:35.397,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And most importantly,

145
0:06:37.54,000 --> 0:06:39,000
men attribute their success to themselves,

146
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and women attribute it to other external factors.

147
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
If you ask men why they did a good job,

148
0:06:45.657,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they'll say, "I'm awesome.

149
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Obviously. Why are you even asking?"

150
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
If you ask women why they did a good job,

151
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
what they'll say is someone helped them,

152
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they got lucky, they worked really hard.

153
0:06:57.906,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Why does this matter?

154
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Boy, it matters a lot.

155
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Because no one gets to the corner office

156
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
by sitting on the side, not at the table,

157
0:07:06.838,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and no one gets the promotion

158
0:07:08.865,000 --> 0:07:1,000
if they don't think they deserve their success,

159
0:07:11.444,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or they don't even understand their own success.

160
0:07:15.112,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I wish the answer were easy.

161
0:07:16.9,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for,

162
0:07:19.536,000 --> 0:07:2,000
these fabulous women,

163
0:07:20.574,000 --> 0:07:22,000
"Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself.

164
0:07:22.848,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Own your own success."

165
0:07:24.626,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I wish I could tell that to my daughter.

166
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But it's not that simple.

167
0:07:29.172,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing,

168
0:07:32.764,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men

169
0:07:37.089,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and negatively correlated for women.

170
0:07:39.881,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true.

171
0:07:43.472,000 --> 0:07:45,000
There's a really good study that shows this really well.

172
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
There's a famous Harvard Business School study

173
0:07:48.475,000 --> 0:07:49,000
on a woman named Heidi Roizen.

174
0:07:50.132,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley,

175
0:07:54.56,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and she uses her contacts

176
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to become a very successful venture capitalist.

177
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
In 2002 -- not so long ago --

178
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a professor who was then at Columbia University

179
0:08:03.523,000 --> 0:08:05,000
took that case and made it [Howard] Roizen.

180
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students.

181
0:08:09.787,000 --> 0:08:11,000
He changed exactly one word:

182
0:08:12.743,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Heidi" to "Howard."

183
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But that one word made a really big difference.

184
0:08:17.807,000 --> 0:08:18,000
He then surveyed the students,

185
0:08:19.462,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and the good news was the students, both men and women,

186
0:08:22.152,000 --> 0:08:24,000
thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent,

187
0:08:24.57,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and that's good.

188
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard.

189
0:08:28.967,000 --> 0:08:3,000
He's a great guy. You want to work for him.

190
0:08:30.991,000 --> 0:08:32,000
You want to spend the day fishing with him.

191
0:08:33.015,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But Heidi? Not so sure.

192
0:08:34.601,000 --> 0:08:36,000
She's a little out for herself. She's a little political.

193
0:08:37.49,000 --> 0:08:39,000
You're not sure you'd want to work for her.

194
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is the complication.

195
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues,

196
0:08:44.594,000 --> 0:08:46,000
we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A,

197
0:08:47.302,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table,

198
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and we have to do it in a world

199
0:08:52.063,000 --> 0:08:55,000
where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that,

200
0:08:55.682,000 --> 0:08:57,000
even though for their brothers, there are not.

201
0:08:59.077,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this.

202
0:09:02.768,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me,

203
0:09:05.84,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but I think important.

204
0:09:07.53,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago

205
0:09:10.751,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to about 100 employees,

206
0:09:13.264,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there

207
0:09:16.336,000 --> 0:09:19,000
sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me.

208
0:09:19.699,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked.

209
0:09:21.866,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And she said, "I learned something today.

210
0:09:23.843,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I learned that I need to keep my hand up."

211
0:09:26.239,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"What do you mean?"

212
0:09:27.295,000 --> 0:09:28,000
She said, "You're giving this talk,

213
0:09:29.113,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and you said you would take two more questions.

214
0:09:31.434,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I had my hand up with many other people,

215
0:09:33.538,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and you took two more questions.

216
0:09:35.157,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I put my hand down, and I noticed all the women did the same,

217
0:09:38.091,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and then you took more questions,

218
0:09:40.044,000 --> 0:09:41,000
only from the men."

219
0:09:42.416,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And I thought to myself,

220
0:09:43.731,000 --> 0:09:45,000
"Wow, if it's me -- who cares about this, obviously --

221
0:09:46.56,000 --> 0:09:47,000
giving this talk --

222
0:09:48.518,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised,

223
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and the women's hands are still raised,

224
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
how good are we

225
0:09:57.462,000 --> 0:09:59,000
as managers of our companies and our organizations

226
0:10:00.19,000 --> 0:10:02,000
at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities

227
0:10:02.739,000 --> 0:10:03,000
more than women?"

228
0:10:04.537,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We've got to get women to sit at the table.

229
0:10:06.951,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Cheers)

230
0:10:07.976,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Applause)

231
0:10:11.208,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Message number two:

232
0:10:12.555,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Make your partner a real partner.

233
0:10:14.466,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce

234
0:10:17.681,000 --> 0:10:18,000
than we have in the home.

235
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The data shows this very clearly.

236
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
If a woman and a man work full-time and have a child,

237
0:10:26.463,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does,

238
0:10:29.84,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does.

239
0:10:34.707,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one.

240
0:10:38.481,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more?

241
0:10:42.074,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them.

242
0:10:45.908,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause.

243
0:10:49.868,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I think the cause is more complicated.

244
0:10:52.106,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I think, as a society,

245
0:10:53.619,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we put more pressure on our boys to succeed

246
0:10:55.86,000 --> 0:10:56,000
than we do on our girls.

247
0:10:57.714,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I know men that stay home

248
0:10:59.766,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and work in the home to support wives with careers,

249
0:11:02.857,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and it's hard.

250
0:11:03.908,000 --> 0:11:06,000
When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there,

251
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I notice that the other mommies don't play with him.

252
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And that's a problem,

253
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because we have to make it as important a job,

254
0:11:16.47,000 --> 0:11:19,000
because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home,

255
0:11:19.873,000 --> 0:11:2,000
for people of both genders,

256
0:11:21.377,000 --> 0:11:24,000
if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce.

257
0:11:24.895,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Applause)

258
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Studies show that households with equal earning

259
0:11:28.523,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and equal responsibility

260
0:11:30.489,000 --> 0:11:32,000
also have half the divorce rate.

261
0:11:32.674,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there,

262
0:11:35.882,000 --> 0:11:36,000
they also have more --

263
0:11:37.719,000 --> 0:11:38,000
how shall I say this on this stage?

264
0:11:39.553,000 --> 0:11:41,000
They know each other more in the biblical sense as well.

265
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Cheers)

266
0:11:44.777,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Message number three:

267
0:11:46.736,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Don't leave before you leave.

268
0:11:48.799,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I think there's a really deep irony

269
0:11:50.566,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to the fact that actions women are taking --

270
0:11:52.675,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and I see this all the time --

271
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
with the objective of staying in the workforce

272
0:11:57.41,000 --> 0:11:59,000
actually lead to their eventually leaving.

273
0:11:59.999,000 --> 0:12:,000
Here's what happens:

274
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy.

275
0:12:03.828,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And she starts thinking about having a child,

276
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child,

277
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
she starts thinking about making room for that child.

278
0:12:12.257,000 --> 0:12:14,000
"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?"

279
0:12:15.442,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And literally from that moment,

280
0:12:18.116,000 --> 0:12:2,000
she doesn't raise her hand anymore,

281
0:12:20.434,000 --> 0:12:23,000
she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project,

282
0:12:23.788,000 --> 0:12:24,000
she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that."

283
0:12:25.789,000 --> 0:12:26,000
She starts leaning back.

284
0:12:27.462,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The problem is that --

285
0:12:28.883,000 --> 0:12:31,000
let's say she got pregnant that day, that day --

286
0:12:32.471,000 --> 0:12:34,000
nine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave,

287
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
six months to catch your breath --

288
0:12:37.434,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Fast-forward two years,

289
0:12:38.92,000 --> 0:12:39,000
more often -- and as I've seen it --

290
0:12:40.904,000 --> 0:12:42,000
women start thinking about this way earlier --

291
0:12:43.442,000 --> 0:12:44,000
when they get engaged, or married,

292
0:12:45.356,000 --> 0:12:47,000
when they start thinking about having a child,

293
0:12:47.528,000 --> 0:12:48,000
which can take a long time.

294
0:12:49.019,000 --> 0:12:51,000
One woman came to see me about this.

295
0:12:51.051,000 --> 0:12:52,000
She looked a little young.

296
0:12:52.804,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And I said, "So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?"

297
0:12:56.162,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married."

298
0:12:58.148,000 --> 0:12:59,000
She didn't even have a boyfriend.

299
0:12:59.747,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter)

300
0:13:00.772,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I said, "You're thinking about this just way too early."

301
0:13:04.479,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But the point is that what happens

302
0:13:07.121,000 --> 0:13:09,000
once you start kind of quietly leaning back?

303
0:13:10.803,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Everyone who's been through this --

304
0:13:12.593,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home,

305
0:13:15.36,000 --> 0:13:17,000
your job better be really good to go back,

306
0:13:17.97,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because it's hard to leave that kid at home.

307
0:13:20.137,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Your job needs to be challenging.

308
0:13:22.025,000 --> 0:13:23,000
It needs to be rewarding.

309
0:13:23.715,000 --> 0:13:25,000
You need to feel like you're making a difference.

310
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion

311
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and some guy next to you did,

312
0:13:31.55,000 --> 0:13:34,000
if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities,

313
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
you're going to be bored

314
0:13:37.012,000 --> 0:13:39,000
because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal.

315
0:13:40.472,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Don't leave before you leave.

316
0:13:42.891,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Stay in.

317
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Keep your foot on the gas pedal,

318
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child --

319
0:13:50.915,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and then make your decisions.

320
0:13:53.156,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Don't make decisions too far in advance,

321
0:13:55.658,000 --> 0:13:57,000
particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making.

322
0:13:59.771,000 --> 0:14:,000
My generation really, sadly,

323
0:14:01.536,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is not going to change the numbers at the top.

324
0:14:03.831,000 --> 0:14:04,000
They're just not moving.

325
0:14:05.575,000 --> 0:14:08,000
We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population --

326
0:14:08.801,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women]

327
0:14:11.492,000 --> 0:14:12,000
at the top of any industry.

328
0:14:14.13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But I'm hopeful that future generations can.

329
0:14:17.544,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I think a world where half of our countries and our companies

330
0:14:22.257,000 --> 0:14:24,000
were run by women, would be a better world.

331
0:14:24.694,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are,

332
0:14:28.099,000 --> 0:14:3,000
even though that would be very helpful.

333
0:14:30.776,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I think it would be a better world.

334
0:14:33.503,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I have two children.

335
0:14:34.802,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter.

336
0:14:37.82,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I want my son to have a choice

337
0:14:39.521,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to contribute fully in the workforce or at home,

338
0:14:42.617,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed,

339
0:14:46.537,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but to be liked for her accomplishments.

340
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Thank you.

341
0:14:50.394,000 --> 0:14:51,000
(Applause)

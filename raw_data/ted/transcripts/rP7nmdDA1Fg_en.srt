1
0:00:13.793,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying.

2
0:00:18.809,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:20.611,000 --> 0:00:24,000
At least, according to a 1973 "Book of Lists" survey

4
0:00:25.143,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which preceded all those online best, worst, funniest lists that you see today.

5
0:00:32.167,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Only heights and public speaking

6
0:00:35.829,000 --> 0:00:38,000
exceeded the six-legged as sources of fear.

7
0:00:39.884,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I suspect if you had put spiders in there,

8
0:00:43.46,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart.

9
0:00:48.736,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, I am not one of those people.

10
0:00:50.863,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I really love insects.

11
0:00:53.033,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I think they're interesting and beautiful,

12
0:00:57.108,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and sometimes even cute.

13
0:00:58.62,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

14
0:01:00.111,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I'm not alone.

15
0:01:01.503,000 --> 0:01:04,000
For centuries, some of the greatest minds in science,

16
0:01:05.233,000 --> 0:01:08,000
from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson,

17
0:01:08.269,000 --> 0:01:13,000
have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on Earth.

18
0:01:14.661,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Well, why is that?

19
0:01:16.386,000 --> 0:01:19,000
What is that keeps us coming back to insects?

20
0:01:20.055,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Some of it, of course, is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them.

21
0:01:24.678,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They're more numerous than any other kind of animal.

22
0:01:27.689,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We don't even know how many species of insects there are,

23
0:01:30.537,000 --> 0:01:32,000
because new ones are being discovered all the time.

24
0:01:33.278,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There are at least a million, maybe as many as 10 million.

25
0:01:37.221,000 --> 0:01:41,000
This means that you could have an insect-of-the-month calendar

26
0:01:41.509,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and not have to reuse a species for over 80,000 years.

27
0:01:45.518,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:48.442,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Take that, pandas and kittens!

29
0:01:50.154,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:52.506,000 --> 0:01:55,000
More seriously, insects are essential.

31
0:01:55.998,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We need them.

32
0:01:57.469,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's been estimated that 1 out of every 3 bites of food

33
0:02:00.893,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is made possible by a pollinator.

34
0:02:04.972,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries

35
0:02:08.223,000 --> 0:02:1,000
about everything from the structure of our nervous systems

36
0:02:11.148,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to how our genes and DNA work.

37
0:02:14.388,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But what I love most about insects

38
0:02:16.29,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is what they can tell us about our own behavior.

39
0:02:19.539,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Insects seem like they do everything that people do.

40
0:02:22.62,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They meet, they mate, they fight, they break up.

41
0:02:26.509,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And they do so with what looks like love or animosity.

42
0:02:31.665,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own,

43
0:02:36.9,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and that difference can be really illuminating.

44
0:02:40.234,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There's nowhere where that's more true

45
0:02:42.125,000 --> 0:02:45,000
than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests -- sex.

46
0:02:46.142,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, I will maintain. and I think I can defend,

47
0:02:48.999,000 --> 0:02:5,000
what may seem like a surprising statement.

48
0:02:52.749,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people.

49
0:02:56.32,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:58.131,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the wild variety that we see

51
0:03:01.294,000 --> 0:03:03,000
makes us challenge some of our own assumptions

52
0:03:04.231,000 --> 0:03:06,000
about what it means to be male and female.

53
0:03:07.663,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Of course, to start with,

54
0:03:09.338,000 --> 0:03:11,000
a lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce.

55
0:03:12.319,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Female aphids can make little, tiny clones of themselves without ever mating.

56
0:03:17.441,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Virgin birth, right there.

57
0:03:18.938,000 --> 0:03:19,000
On your rose bushes.

58
0:03:20.25,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:23.47,000 --> 0:03:24,000
When they do have sex,

60
0:03:25.035,000 --> 0:03:28,000
even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm.

61
0:03:28.316,000 --> 0:03:3,000
There are some kinds of fruit flies

62
0:03:30.715,000 --> 0:03:33,000
whose sperm is longer than the male's own body.

63
0:03:34.216,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And that's important because the males use their sperm to compete.

64
0:03:38.873,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now, male insects do compete with weapons, like the horns on these beetles.

65
0:03:43.553,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But they also compete after mating with their sperm.

66
0:03:48.726,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives

67
0:03:53.876,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with all of the attachments pulled out.

68
0:03:55.993,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:57.887,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They use these formidable devices like scoops,

70
0:04:02.057,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with.

71
0:04:06.818,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:08.909,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So, what can we learn from this?

73
0:04:11.63,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:17.333,000 --> 0:04:22,000
All right, it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them

75
0:04:22.367,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or of them setting an example for us to follow.

76
0:04:25.915,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Which, given this, is probably just as well.

77
0:04:29.265,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And also, did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects?

78
0:04:32.863,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So, no, that's not the point.

79
0:04:35.215,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But what I think insects do,

80
0:04:36.976,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles.

81
0:04:43.319,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So, people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version

82
0:04:48.872,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of what males and females are like.

83
0:04:50.851,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive,

84
0:04:54.028,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and females are passive and coy.

85
0:04:55.794,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But that's just not the case.

86
0:04:58.606,000 --> 0:05:,000
So for example, take katydids,

87
0:05:00.692,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers.

88
0:05:03.558,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The males are very picky about who they mate with,

89
0:05:07.059,000 --> 0:05:1,000
because they not only transfer sperm during mating,

90
0:05:10.308,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they also give the female something called a nuptial gift.

91
0:05:14.798,000 --> 0:05:17,000
You can see two katydids mating in these photos.

92
0:05:18.499,000 --> 0:05:2,000
In both panels, the male's the one on the right,

93
0:05:20.843,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and that sword-like appendage is the female's egg-laying organ.

94
0:05:25.126,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The white blob is the sperm,

95
0:05:27.677,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the green blob is the nuptial gift,

96
0:05:31.087,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and the male manufactures this from his own body

97
0:05:34.477,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and it's extremely costly to produce.

98
0:05:36.679,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It can weigh up to a third of his body mass.

99
0:05:39.985,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I will now pause for a moment and let you think about

100
0:05:42.543,000 --> 0:05:46,000
what it would be like if human men, every time they had sex,

101
0:05:46.73,000 --> 0:05:52,000
had to produce something that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds.

102
0:05:52.801,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:56.432,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Okay, they would not be able to do that very often.

104
0:05:59.695,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

105
0:06:01.216,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And indeed, neither can the katydids.

106
0:06:04.343,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And so what that means

107
0:06:06.279,000 --> 0:06:09,000
is the katydid males are very choosy

108
0:06:10.111,000 --> 0:06:13,000
about who they offer these nuptial gifts to.

109
0:06:13.215,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, the gift is very nutritious,

110
0:06:15.165,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and the female eats it during and after mating.

111
0:06:17.883,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So, the bigger it is, the better off the male is,

112
0:06:20.264,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because that means more time for his sperm

113
0:06:22.464,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to drain into her body and fertilize her eggs.

114
0:06:25.521,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But it also means that the males are very passive about mating,

115
0:06:29.895,000 --> 0:06:32,000
whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive,

116
0:06:33.444,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can.

117
0:06:37.784,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So, it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules.

118
0:06:42.974,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Even more generally though,

119
0:06:44.709,000 --> 0:06:49,000
males are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects.

120
0:06:49.797,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In the social insects -- the bees and wasps and ants --

121
0:06:54.25,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the individuals that you see every day --

122
0:06:56.869,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl,

123
0:06:59.338,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower --

124
0:07:02.371,000 --> 0:07:04,000
all of those are always female.

125
0:07:05.3,000 --> 0:07:09,000
People have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia.

126
0:07:09.9,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The ancient Greeks knew that there was a class of bees, the drones,

127
0:07:15.022,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that are larger than the workers,

128
0:07:17.097,000 --> 0:07:19,000
although they disapproved of the drones' laziness

129
0:07:19.691,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because they could see that the drones just hang around the hive

130
0:07:22.77,000 --> 0:07:23,000
until the mating flight --

131
0:07:24.319,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they're the males.

132
0:07:25.562,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They hang around until the mating flight,

133
0:07:27.605,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen.

134
0:07:30.368,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex,

135
0:07:32.676,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees

136
0:07:37.267,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but they found it difficult to believe

137
0:07:40.148,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female.

138
0:07:43.705,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Aristotle tried to get involved as well.

139
0:07:46.739,000 --> 0:07:5,000
He suggested, "OK, if the stinging individuals are going to be the males ..."

140
0:07:51.351,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Then he got confused, because that would have meant

141
0:07:53.841,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the males were also taking care of the young in a colony,

142
0:07:56.594,000 --> 0:08:,000
and he seemed to think that would be completely impossible.

143
0:08:01.026,000 --> 0:08:04,000
He then concluded that maybe bees had the organs of both sexes

144
0:08:04.099,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in the same individual,

145
0:08:05.274,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which is not that far-fetched, some animals do that,

146
0:08:07.867,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but he never really did get it figured out.

147
0:08:10.744,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And you know, even today, my students, for instance,

148
0:08:14.554,000 --> 0:08:18,000
call every animal they see, including insects, a male.

149
0:08:19.585,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And when I tell them that the ferocious army-ant soldiers

150
0:08:23.145,000 --> 0:08:25,000
with their giant jaws, used to defend the colony,

151
0:08:26.102,000 --> 0:08:29,000
are all always female,

152
0:08:29.228,000 --> 0:08:31,000
they seem to not quite believe me.

153
0:08:31.586,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:32.755,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And certainly all of the movies -- Antz, Bee Movie --

155
0:08:37.979,000 --> 0:08:42,000
portray the main character in the social insects as being male.

156
0:08:44.869,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Well, what difference does this make?

157
0:08:46.697,000 --> 0:08:47,000
These are movies. They're fiction.

158
0:08:48.358,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They have talking animals in them.

159
0:08:50.004,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What difference does it make if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld?

160
0:08:53.708,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I think it does matter,

161
0:08:55.896,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and it's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one

162
0:08:58.784,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that has implications for medicine and health

163
0:09:02.937,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and a lot of other aspects of our lives.

164
0:09:05.595,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You all know that scientists use what we call model systems,

165
0:09:09.112,000 --> 0:09:12,000
which are creatures -- white rats or fruit flies --

166
0:09:12.497,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that are kind of stand-ins for all other animals, including people.

167
0:09:17.075,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And the idea is that what's true for a person

168
0:09:20.043,000 --> 0:09:22,000
will also be true for the white rat.

169
0:09:22.478,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And by and large, that turns out to be the case.

170
0:09:25.482,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But you can take the idea of a model system too far.

171
0:09:29.924,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And what I think we've done,

172
0:09:32.217,000 --> 0:09:37,000
is use males, in any species, as though they are the model system.

173
0:09:37.692,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The norm.

174
0:09:38.939,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The way things are supposed to be.

175
0:09:41.51,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And females as a kind of variant --

176
0:09:44.583,000 --> 0:09:47,000
something special that you only study after you get the basics down.

177
0:09:49.802,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And so, back to the insects.

178
0:09:52.509,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I think what that means

179
0:09:53.881,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them.

180
0:09:56.724,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Because they assumed that the world's stage was largely occupied by male players

181
0:10:03.184,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and females would only have minor, walk-on roles.

182
0:10:07.626,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But when we do that, we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like.

183
0:10:13.588,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And we can also miss out on the way natural, living things, including people,

184
0:10:20.611,000 --> 0:10:21,000
can vary.

185
0:10:22.025,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And I think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research,

186
0:10:27.124,000 --> 0:10:29,000
something that we know now to be a problem

187
0:10:29.213,000 --> 0:10:33,000
if we want the results to apply to both men and women.

188
0:10:34.76,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Well, the last thing I really love about insects

189
0:10:37.311,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them.

190
0:10:40.596,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They have little, tiny brains

191
0:10:42.387,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with very little cognitive ability, the way we normally think of it.

192
0:10:46.398,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They have complicated behavior, but they lack complicated brains.

193
0:10:51.86,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And so, we can't just think of them as though they're little people

194
0:10:57.061,000 --> 0:11:,000
because they don't do things the way that we do.

195
0:11:00.63,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I really love that it's difficult to anthropomorphize insects,

196
0:11:04.754,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to look at them and just think of them like they're little people

197
0:11:08.301,000 --> 0:11:1,000
in exoskeletons, with six legs.

198
0:11:10.927,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Laughter)

199
0:11:12.212,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Instead, you really have to accept them on their own terms,

200
0:11:15.781,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because insects make us question what's normal and what's natural.

201
0:11:21.527,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now, you know, people write fiction and talk about parallel universes.

202
0:11:26.184,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They speculate about the supernatural,

203
0:11:29.506,000 --> 0:11:32,000
maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us.

204
0:11:34.537,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The allure of another world

205
0:11:37.757,000 --> 0:11:43,000
is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal.

206
0:11:44.376,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But as far as I'm concerned,

207
0:11:46.689,000 --> 0:11:48,000
who needs to be able to see dead people,

208
0:11:48.882,000 --> 0:11:49,000
when you can see live insects?

209
0:11:51.262,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Thank you.

210
0:11:52.448,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Applause)

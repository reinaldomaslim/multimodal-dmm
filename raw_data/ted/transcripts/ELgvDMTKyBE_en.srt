1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The Hindus say, "Nada brahma,"

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
one translation of which is, "The world is sound."

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So you are, in fact, a chord --

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
each of you an individual chord.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
One definition of health may be

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that that chord is in complete harmony.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Your ears can't hear that chord;

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Incidentally, we see just one octave.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
They work even when you sleep.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The smallest sound you can perceive

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The loudest sound you can hear

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is a trillion times more powerful than that.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Ears are made not for hearing,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but for listening.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Listening is an active skill,

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at --

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it's a relationship with sound.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
places you can listen from?

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Here are two of them.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Reductive listening is listening "for."

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It reduces everything down to what's relevant

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and it discards everything that's not relevant.

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Men typically listen reductively.

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So he's saying, "I've got this problem."

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next."

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
That's the way we talk, right guys?

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Expansive listening, on the other hand,

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is listening "with," not listening "for."

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It's got no destination in mind --

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
it's just enjoying the journey.

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Women typically listen expansively.

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other,

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
possibly both talking at the same time.

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk,

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
practice expansive listening,

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and you can transform your relationships.

46
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is noise, surrounding us all the time.

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Noise like this, according to the European Union,

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
is reducing the health and the quality of life

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of 25 percent

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
of the population of Europe.

52
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Two percent of the population of Europe --

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that's 16 million people --

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are having their sleep devastated

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
by noise like that.

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Noise kills

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
200,000 people a year in Europe.

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's a really big problem.

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it,

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.

62
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It looks a bit like this.

63
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The trouble with widespread headphone use

64
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is it brings three really big health issues.

65
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined:

66
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"schizophonia."

67
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's a dislocation

68
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
between what you see and what you hear.

69
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So, we're inviting into our lives

70
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the voices of people who are not present with us.

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I think there's something deeply unhealthy

72
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
about living all the time in schizophonia.

73
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse

74
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is compression.

75
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We squash music to fit it into our pocket

76
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and there is a cost attached to this.

77
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.

78
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Music)

79
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.

80
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Music)

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I do hope that some of you at least

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
can hear the difference between those two.

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There is a cost of compression.

84
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.

85
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You're having to imagine it.

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's not good for you in the long run.

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The third problem with headphones is this: deafness --

88
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
noise-induced hearing disorder.

89
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another,

90
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but really worryingly,

91
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
16 percent --

92
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
roughly one in six -- of American teenagers

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder

94
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
as a result of headphone abuse.

95
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
One study at an American university

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
found that 61 percent of college freshmen

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
had damaged hearing

98
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
as a result of headphone abuse.

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.

100
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now that's a really serious problem.

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and pass these on to your children, please.

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Professional hearing protectors are great;

104
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I use some all the time.

105
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
If you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because quality means you don't have to have it so loud.

107
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice,

108
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it's too loud.

109
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And thirdly, if you're in bad sound,

110
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.

111
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Protect your ears in that way.

112
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out.

113
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
WWB:

114
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Wind, water, birds --

115
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
stochastic natural sounds

116
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
composed of lots of individual random events,

117
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
all of it very healthy,

118
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
all of it sound that we evolved to over the years.

119
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.

120
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Silence is beautiful.

121
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The Elizabethans described language

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
as decorated silence.

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I urge you to move away from silence with intention

124
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and to design soundscapes just like works of art.

125
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.

126
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's fun to get into designing with sound.

127
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.

128
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Sound design is the future,

129
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds.

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities,

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
eight ways sound can improve health.

132
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy;

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it's also now being used to treat cancer.

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.

136
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Sound healing is a wonderful modality.

137
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's been around for thousands of years.

138
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I do urge you to explore this.

139
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
There are great things being done there, treating now autism,

140
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
dementia and other conditions.

141
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you,

142
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
if it's music that's made with good intention,

143
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
made with love, generally.

144
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good.

145
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There are all sorts of types of music

146
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that are very healthy.

147
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And four modalities where you need to take some action

148
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and get involved.

149
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
First of all, listen consciously.

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.

152
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Secondly, get in touch with making some sound --

153
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
create sound.

154
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The voice is the instrument we all play,

155
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice? Get trained;

156
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
learn to sing, learn to play an instrument.

157
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.

158
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You can do this in groups as well.

159
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia;

160
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to make music and sound in a group of people,

161
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
whichever style you enjoy particularly.

162
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.

163
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Protect your ears? Yes, absolutely.

164
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you

165
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
at home and at work.

166
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And let's start to speak up

167
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
when people are assailing us

168
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
with the noise that I played you early on.

169
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now

170
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to improve your health with sound.

171
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful

172
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and if we all start doing these things,

173
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we will take a very big step in that direction.

174
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So I urge you to take that path.

175
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you.

176
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I wish you sound health.

177
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Applause)

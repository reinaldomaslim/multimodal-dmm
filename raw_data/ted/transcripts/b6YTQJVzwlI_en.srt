1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We're 25, 26 years after

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the advent of the Macintosh,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
which was an astoundingly seminal event

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in the history

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of human-machine interface

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and in computation in general.

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It fundamentally changed the way

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that people thought about computation,

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
thought about computers,

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It was such a radical change, in fact,

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that the early Macintosh development team

13
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in '82, '83, '84

14
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up.

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, this is an interesting little message,

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it's a lesson that has since, I think,

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
been forgotten or lost or something,

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and that is, namely, that the OS is the interface.

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The interface is the OS.

20
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one.

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter.

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
There were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers.

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So it was a necessity.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But in the quarter-century since then,

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we've seen all of the fundamental

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
supporting technologies go berserk.

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So memory capacity and disk capacity

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Same thing for processor speeds.

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Networks, we didn't have networks at all

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
at the time of the Macintosh's introduction,

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and that has become the single most salient aspect

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
of how we live with computers.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And, of course, graphics: Today

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
buys you more graphics power

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago.

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So we've got that incredible ramp-up.

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Then, on the side, we've got the Web

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and, increasingly, the cloud,

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
which is fantastic,

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental --

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
kind of a distraction.

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So we've forgotten to invent new interfaces.

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard,

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and people are starting to wake up about that.

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So what happens next? Where do we go from there?

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The problem, as we see it,

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
has to do with a single, simple word: "space,"

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
or a single, simple phrase:

52
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"real world geometry."

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Computers and the programming languages

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that we talk to them in, that we teach them in,

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
are hideously insensate when it comes to space.

56
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
They don't understand real world space.

57
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
They also don't understand time, but that's a matter for a separate talk.

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So what happens if you start to

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
explain space to them?

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room.

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The Luminous Room is a system

63
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in which it's considered that

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
input and output spaces are co-located.

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
That's a strangely simple,

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and yet unexplored idea, right?

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
When you use a mouse, your hand is down here on the mouse pad.

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about:

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The pixels are up on the display.

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So here was a room in which all the walls, floors, ceilings,

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
pets, potted plants, whatever was in there,

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
were capable, not only of display but of sensing as well.

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And that means input and output are in the same space

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
enabling stuff like this.

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
That's a digital storage in a physical container.

76
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The contract is the same

77
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as with real word objects in real world containers.

78
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Has to come back out, whatever you put in.

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This little design experiment

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well.

81
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If you presented it with a chess board,

82
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
it tried to figure out what you might mean by that.

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And if there was nothing for them to do,

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the chess pieces eventually got bored

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and hopped away.

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The academics who were overseeing this work

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
thought that that was too frivolous,

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
so we built deadly serious applications

89
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
like this optics prototyping workbench

90
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box

91
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
becomes a laser.

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects,

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the system projects down the laser beam path.

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So you've got an interface that has no interface.

95
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You operate the world as you operate the real world,

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
which is to say, with your hands.

97
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Similarly, a digital wind tunnel with digital wind

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
flowing from right to left --

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
not that remarkable in a sense; we didn't invent the mathematics.

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display,

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object,

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
a real world object in that.

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Here, the real world merges with the simulation.

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And finally, to pull out all the stops,

105
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
this is a system called Urp, for urban planners,

106
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in which we give architects and urban planners back

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the models that we confiscated

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
when we insisted that they use CAD systems.

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And we make the machine meet them half way.

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It projects down digital shadows, as you see here.

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock,

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
then you can control the sun's position in the sky.

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That's 8 a.m. shadows.

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
There you are, swinging the sun around.

116
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Short shadows at noon and so forth.

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And we built up a series of tools like this.

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
There are inter-shadowing studies

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that children can operate,

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
even though they don't know anything about urban planning:

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
To move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building.

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
A material wand makes the building

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions.

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways?

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
A zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway.

126
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, if these ideas seem familiar

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
or perhaps even a little dated,

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that's great; they should seem familiar.

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
This work is 15 years old.

131
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii,

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
director of the Tangible Media Group.

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But it was that work that was seen

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
by Alex McDowell,

136
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
one of the world's legendary production designers.

137
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
called "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg,

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and invited us to come out from MIT

140
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and design the interfaces

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that would appear in that film.

142
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And the great thing about it was

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude,

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the idea that the putative 2054

145
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that we were painting in the film be believable,

146
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that he allowed us to take on that design work

147
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
as if it were an R&D effort.

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And the result is sort of

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
gratifyingly perpetual.

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
People still reference those sequences in "Minority Report"

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
when they talk about new UI design.

152
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So this led full circle, in a strange way,

153
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to build these ideas into what we believe

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is the necessary future of human machine interface:

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the Spatial Operating Environment, we call it.

156
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So here we have a bunch of stuff, some images.

157
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And, using a hand,

158
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom,

159
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
six degrees of navigational control.

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye.

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And you can come back out

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
through the scary orangutan.

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And that's all well and good.

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Let's do something a little more difficult.

165
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Here, we have a whole bunch of disparate images.

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We can fly around them.

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So navigation is a fundamental issue.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You have to be able to navigate in 3D.

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
is inherently spatial.

171
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it.

173
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.

174
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it.

175
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We can organize it this way.

176
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And, of course, it's not just about navigation,

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but about manipulation as well.

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So if we don't like stuff,

179
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
or we're intensely curious about

180
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications,

181
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we can pull them out like that.

182
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and ask for a different distribution.

184
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Let's just come down a bit

185
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and fly around.

186
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So that's a different way to look at stuff.

187
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
If you're of a more analytical nature

188
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
then you might want, actually, to look at this

189
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
as a color histogram.

190
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So now we've got the stuff color-sorted,

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
angle maps onto color.

192
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And now, if we want to select stuff,

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
3D, space,

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the idea that we're tracking hands in real space

195
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
becomes really important because we can reach in,

196
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
not in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D.

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Here are some selection planes.

198
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And we'll perform this Boolean operation

199
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.

200
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So, from there to the world of real work.

201
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Here's a logistics system,

202
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
a small piece of one that we're currently building.

203
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There're a lot of elements.

204
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data

205
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with three-dimensional and geospatial information.

206
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So here's a familiar place.

207
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And we'll bring this back here for a second.

208
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Maybe select a little bit of that.

209
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And bring out this graph.

210
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And we should, now,

211
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
be able to fly in here

212
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and have a closer look.

213
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
These are logistics elements

214
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that are scattered across the United States.

215
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
One thing that three-dimensional interactions

216
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and the general idea of imbuing

217
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
computation with space affords you

218
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is a final destruction of that unfortunate

219
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.

220
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
That's the old way, that's the old mantra:

221
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
one machine, one human, one mouse, one screen.

222
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Well, that doesn't really cut it anymore.

223
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
In the real world, we have people who collaborate;

224
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
we have people who have to work together,

225
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and we have many different displays.

226
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And we might want to look at these various images.

227
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We might want to ask for some help.

228
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The author of this new pointing device

229
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is sitting over there,

230
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
so I can pull this from there to there.

231
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
These are unrelated machines, right?

232
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble.

233
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So I'm going to leave that over there

234
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because I have a question for Paul.

235
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Paul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest

236
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on.

237
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So let me get some of these out of the way.

238
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Let's pull this apart:

239
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I'll go ahead and explode it.

240
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Kevin, can you help?

241
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board.

242
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Mind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise,

243
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but we do it in the lab all the time.

244
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
All right.

245
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located

246
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
or distant and distinct, is always important.

247
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And again, that stuff

248
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
needs to be undertaken in the context of space.

249
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse

250
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that takes us back to the world of imagery.

251
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
This is a system called TAMPER,

252
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which is a slightly whimsical look

253
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
at what the future of editing

254
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and media manipulation systems might be.

255
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We at Oblong believe that media should be

256
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
accessible in much more fine-grained form.

257
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So we have a large number of movies

258
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
stuck inside here.

259
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And let's just pick out a few elements.

260
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We can zip through them

261
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
as a possibility.

262
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We can grab elements off the front,

263
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
where upon they reanimate, come to life,

264
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and drag them down onto the table here.

265
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here

266
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and grab our blue friend

267
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and put him down on the table as well.

268
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We may need more than one.

269
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And we probably need,

270
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
well, we probably need a cowboy

271
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to be quite honest.

272
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

273
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Yeah, let's

274
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
take that one.

275
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Laughter)

276
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
You see, cowboys and French farce people

277
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
don't go well together, and the system knows that.

278
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Let me leave with one final thought,

279
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and that is that

280
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
one of the greatest English language writers

281
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
of the last three decades

282
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
suggested that great art is always a gift.

283
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars],

284
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks

285
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to buy the stolen Vermeer;

286
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
he was talking about the circumstances of its creation

287
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and of its existence.

288
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And I think that it's time that we asked

289
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for the same from technology.

290
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Technology is capable of

291
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
expressing and being imbued with

292
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
a certain generosity,

293
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and we need to demand that, in fact.

294
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
For some of this kind of technology,

295
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
ground center is

296
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
a combination of design, which is crucially important.

297
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We can't have advances in technology any longer

298
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
unless design is integrated from the very start.

299
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And, as well, as of efficacy, agency.

300
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We're, as human beings, the creatures that create,

301
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task

302
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and are built in that same image.

303
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So I will leave you with that. Thank you.

304
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Applause)

305
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Chris Anderson: So to ask the obvious question --

306
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
actually this is from Bill Gates --

307
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
when? (John Underkoffler: When?)

308
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
CA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage?

309
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers?

310
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
JU: No, it has to be for every human being.

311
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
That's our goal entirely.

312
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We won't have succeeded

313
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
unless we take that next big step.

314
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I mean it's been 25 years.

315
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Can there really be only one interface? There can't.

316
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
CA: But does that mean that, at your desk or in your home,

317
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
you need projectors, cameras?

318
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
You know, how can it work?

319
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
JU: No, this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display.

320
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It'll be built into architecture.

321
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years.

322
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So this is the inevitability about it.

323
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
CA: So, in your mind, five years time,

324
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
someone can buy this as part of

325
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
a standard computer interface?

326
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
JU: I think in five years time when you buy a computer,

327
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
you'll get this.

328
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
CA: Well that's cool.

329
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

330
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.

331
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
What do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this?

332
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
JU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day.

333
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
At the moment, our early-adopter customers --

334
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and these systems are deployed out in the real world --

335
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
do all the big data intensive, data heavy problems with it.

336
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So, whether it's logistics and supply chain management

337
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
or natural gas and resource extraction,

338
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
financial services, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics,

339
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
those are the topics right now, but that's not a killer app.

340
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And I understand what you're asking.

341
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
CA: C'mon, c'mon. Martial arts, games. C'mon.

342
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Laughter)

343
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
John, thank you for making science-fiction real.

344
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
JU: It's been a great pleasure.

345
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Thank you to you all.

346
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

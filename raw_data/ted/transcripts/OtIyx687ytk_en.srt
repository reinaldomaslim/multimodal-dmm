1
0:00:25.603,000 --> 0:00:28,000
On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday,

2
0:00:28.928,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes

3
0:00:32.343,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and my father was reading the paper or something,

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said,

5
0:00:38.31,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And my father smiled and said,

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"Well, you know what that means, don't you?"

8
0:00:47.41,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party

9
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and a cake and get a lot of presents?"

10
0:00:52.507,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And my dad said, "Well, yes.

11
0:00:54.742,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But more importantly,

12
0:00:55.926,000 --> 0:00:57,000
being seven means that you've reached the age of reason,

13
0:00:58.895,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."

14
0:01:03.446,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:06.322,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.

16
0:01:09.572,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about

17
0:01:11.847,000 --> 0:01:12,000
my second-grade class at school.

18
0:01:13.568,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But when she said it,

19
0:01:14.744,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations

20
0:01:17.829,000 --> 0:01:19,000
for our first communion and our first confession,

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress

22
0:01:23.01,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and the white veil.

23
0:01:24.185,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention

24
0:01:26.849,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to that phrase, "age of reason."

25
0:01:28.712,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"

26
0:01:32.924,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And my dad said, "Well, we believe, in the Catholic Church,

27
0:01:36.578,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong,

28
0:01:40.479,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.

29
0:01:43.141,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So, you've grown up and reached the age of reason,

30
0:01:45.78,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and now God will start keeping notes on you,

31
0:01:48.421,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and begin your permanent record."

32
0:01:50.401,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:51.435,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And I said, "Oh ...

34
0:01:55.767,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Wait a minute.

35
0:01:57.006,000 --> 0:02:,000
You mean all that time, up till today,

36
0:02:00.204,000 --> 0:02:04,000
all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?"

37
0:02:04.376,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."

38
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I thought, "How could I not have known this before?

40
0:02:11.609,000 --> 0:02:13,000
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?

41
0:02:14.363,000 --> 0:02:16,000
All that being good and no real credit for it.

42
0:02:16.555,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And worst of all, how could I not have realized

43
0:02:18.788,000 --> 0:02:19,000
this very important information

44
0:02:20.296,000 --> 0:02:22,000
until the very day that it was basically useless to me?"

45
0:02:23.242,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?

46
0:02:26.632,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?"

47
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,

48
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."

49
0:02:35.289,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven.

50
0:02:39.725,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Julie, there is no Santa Claus."

51
0:02:42.085,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:45.18,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me.

53
0:02:48.919,000 --> 0:02:5,000
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus:

54
0:02:51.889,000 --> 0:02:53,000
how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed

55
0:02:54.419,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that instead of Santa delivering our presents

56
0:02:56.544,000 --> 0:02:57,000
over the night of Christmas Eve,

57
0:02:58.107,000 --> 0:03:01,000
like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises

58
0:03:01.246,000 --> 0:03:02,000
first thing Christmas morning,

59
0:03:02.716,000 --> 0:03:03,000
our family would give Santa more time.

60
0:03:04.707,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass

61
0:03:08.31,000 --> 0:03:11,000
on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.

62
0:03:12.302,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Which made me very suspicious.

63
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.

64
0:03:19.095,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style,

65
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.

66
0:03:24.673,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:25.855,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back

68
0:03:28.612,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?

69
0:03:31.74,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence:

70
0:03:35.534,000 --> 0:03:39,000
our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit,

71
0:03:40.071,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment,

72
0:03:43.35,000 --> 0:03:46,000
this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly --

73
0:03:47.135,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but let's face it, he was also very judgmental.

74
0:03:50.214,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all

75
0:03:52.801,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was actually sort of a relief.

76
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa,

77
0:03:57.959,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but rather, I was just dumbfounded

78
0:03:59.684,000 --> 0:04:02,000
about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.

79
0:04:02.752,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else,

80
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:07,000
someone who could use the information.

81
0:04:08.52,000 --> 0:04:09,000
They had to fit two criteria:

82
0:04:10.197,000 --> 0:04:12,000
they had to be old enough to be able to understand

83
0:04:12.562,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.

84
0:04:16.125,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.

85
0:04:19.277,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Well, I finally found Bill

86
0:04:20.563,000 --> 0:04:23,000
about a block away from our house at this public school playground.

87
0:04:23.796,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself,

88
0:04:25.936,000 --> 0:04:27,000
just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.

89
0:04:28.166,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I ran up to him and said, "Bill!

90
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven,

91
0:04:33.167,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and then you're capable of committing any and all sins

92
0:04:35.737,000 --> 0:04:36,000
against God and man."

93
0:04:36.912,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And Bill said, "So?"

94
0:04:38.924,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I said, "So, you're six.

95
0:04:40.934,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it."

96
0:04:44.996,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And he said, "So?"

97
0:04:46.762,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I said, "So? So everything!"

98
0:04:50.357,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I turned to run. I was so angry with him.

99
0:04:53.206,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But when I got to the top of the steps,

100
0:04:55.104,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I turned around dramatically and said,

101
0:04:56.945,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"Oh, by the way, Bill -- there is no Santa Claus."

102
0:05:00.4,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:02.352,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now, I didn't know it at the time,

104
0:05:04.115,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th.

105
0:05:07.285,000 --> 0:05:08,000
For my 13th birthday,

106
0:05:08.634,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends,

107
0:05:11.229,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said,

108
0:05:14.855,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"I need to speak to you privately.

109
0:05:18.101,000 --> 0:05:21,000
September 10th is not your birthday. It's October 10th."

110
0:05:22.106,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I said, "What?"

111
0:05:23.679,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:24.718,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And she said ...

113
0:05:26.003,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:27.581,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15th."

115
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:34.227,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"So I told them that your birthday was September 10th,

117
0:05:37.068,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and then I wasn't sure

118
0:05:38.243,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place,

119
0:05:41.135,000 --> 0:05:44,000
so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th.

120
0:05:44.841,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."

121
0:05:49.07,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I thought about it, and when I was four,

122
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I was already the oldest of four children,

123
0:05:53.024,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and my mother even had another child to come,

124
0:05:55.167,000 --> 0:05:57,000
so what I think she -- understandably -- really meant

125
0:05:57.696,000 --> 0:05:59,000
was that she was so ready, she was so ready.

126
0:06:00.095,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie.

127
0:06:01.793,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Every year on October 10th,

128
0:06:03.286,000 --> 0:06:05,000
when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it,

129
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day."

130
0:06:09.401,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

131
0:06:12.252,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Which was comforting, but troubling.

132
0:06:14.57,000 --> 0:06:17,000
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.

133
0:06:18.133,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:19.165,000 --> 0:06:21,000
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information

135
0:06:22.178,000 --> 0:06:24,000
was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party

136
0:06:24.877,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with all of my girlfriends.

137
0:06:26.203,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo.

138
0:06:30.087,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom.

139
0:06:33.186,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I read my horoscope every single day,

140
0:06:35.783,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and it was so totally me.

141
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And this meant that I was a Libra?

143
0:06:42.753,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.

144
0:06:46.091,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair,

145
0:06:49.512,000 --> 0:06:5,000
sort of lounging by some water,

146
0:06:51.068,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.

147
0:06:53.926,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This was around the time that I started filling out physically,

148
0:06:56.917,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls,

149
0:06:59.924,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale

150
0:07:03.652,000 --> 0:07:05,000
just seemed ominous and depressing.

151
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:09.169,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But I got the new Libra poster,

153
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and I started to read my new Libra horoscope,

154
0:07:14.301,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.

155
0:07:18.751,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:20.311,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It wasn't until years later, looking back

157
0:07:22.316,000 --> 0:07:24,000
on this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing,

158
0:07:24.999,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that it dawned on me:

159
0:07:26.31,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven.

160
0:07:28.857,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I had a whole other month

161
0:07:30.127,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.

162
0:07:34.238,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Oh, life can be so cruel.

163
0:07:38.317,000 --> 0:07:41,000
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.

164
0:07:42.192,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles,

165
0:07:44.852,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning

166
0:07:47.175,000 --> 0:07:49,000
for people who are peddling things door to door.

167
0:07:49.588,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church

168
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.

169
0:07:55.186,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me

170
0:07:57.45,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people,

171
0:08:00.329,000 --> 0:08:02,000
if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them.

172
0:08:03.556,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered.

173
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white, starched short-sleeved shirts,

174
0:08:13.309,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and they had little name tags

175
0:08:14.793,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that identified them as official representatives

176
0:08:17.11,000 --> 0:08:19,000
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,

177
0:08:19.935,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and they said they had a message for me, from God.

178
0:08:23.629,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."

179
0:08:28.848,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest,

180
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know,

181
0:08:34.111,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I've worked with them and even dated them,

182
0:08:36.144,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but I never really knew the doctrine,

183
0:08:37.946,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or what they said to people when they were out on a mission,

184
0:08:40.782,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in."

185
0:08:44.111,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And they looked really happy,

186
0:08:45.532,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because I don't think this happens to them all that often.

187
0:08:48.286,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Laughter)

188
0:08:49.317,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water --

189
0:09:03.085,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Ok, I got it, I got it.

190
0:09:04.664,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I got them glasses of water.

191
0:09:06.093,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.

192
0:09:07.943,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:10.952,000 --> 0:09:13,000
You can't put a video of myself in front of me

194
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and expect me not to fix my hair.

195
0:09:15.938,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Ok.

196
0:09:17.29,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

197
0:09:21.401,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water,

198
0:09:23.816,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and after niceties, they said,

199
0:09:25.797,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"

200
0:09:28.433,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God,

201
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but you know, I don't like that word 'heart,'

202
0:09:34.535,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because it anthropomorphizes God,

203
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God."

204
0:09:41.677,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys,

205
0:09:44.198,000 --> 0:09:47,000
so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said,

206
0:09:47.903,000 --> 0:09:5,000
"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."

207
0:09:51.862,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And they looked at each other and smiled,

208
0:09:53.862,000 --> 0:09:55,000
like that was the right answer.

209
0:09:55.957,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And then they said, "Do you believe

210
0:09:57.664,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"

211
0:10:00.135,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I said, "Yes, I do."

212
0:10:01.31,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly.

213
0:10:04.686,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."

214
0:10:07.801,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi,

215
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.

216
0:10:13.907,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil.

217
0:10:18.48,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.

218
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And God came to Lehi and said to him,

219
0:10:24.66,000 --> 0:10:26,000
"Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here."

220
0:10:27.569,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And God did lead them.

221
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
He led them to America.

222
0:10:32.172,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I said, "America?

223
0:10:33.667,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Laughter)

224
0:10:35.756,000 --> 0:10:39,000
From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"

225
0:10:40.443,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And they said, "Yes."

226
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Laughter)

227
0:10:43.879,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants

228
0:10:46.167,000 --> 0:10:48,000
reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years,

229
0:10:49.066,000 --> 0:10:52,000
there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites,

230
0:10:52.344,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and the Nephites were totally good -- each and every one of them --

231
0:10:55.818,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil --

232
0:10:58.009,000 --> 0:11:,000
every single one of them just bad to the bone.

233
0:11:00.184,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins,

234
0:11:03.716,000 --> 0:11:04,000
on his way up to heaven,

235
0:11:04.907,000 --> 0:11:06,000
he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.

236
0:11:07.504,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:08.554,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good --

238
0:11:12.066,000 --> 0:11:13,000
each and every one of them --

239
0:11:13.472,000 --> 0:11:15,000
they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.

240
0:11:16.197,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But apparently somebody blew it,

241
0:11:18.722,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.

242
0:11:21.483,000 --> 0:11:23,000
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon,

243
0:11:23.773,000 --> 0:11:25,000
who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.

244
0:11:26.543,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And he made sure this whole story was written down

245
0:11:29.277,000 --> 0:11:33,000
in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates,

246
0:11:33.669,000 --> 0:11:35,000
which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.

247
0:11:36.76,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter)

248
0:11:42.259,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.

249
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Laughter)

250
0:11:48.366,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"

251
0:11:51.242,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S."

252
0:11:55.108,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended

253
0:11:58.318,000 --> 0:12:,000
from a people who were totally evil?"

254
0:12:00.383,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And they said, "Yes."

255
0:12:02.627,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith

256
0:12:05.707,000 --> 0:12:08,000
found those buried gold plates right in his backyard,

257
0:12:09.366,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat

258
0:12:13.112,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and then buried his face into,

259
0:12:14.634,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and this allowed him to translate the gold plates

260
0:12:17.018,000 --> 0:12:19,000
from the reformed Egyptian into English.

261
0:12:19.89,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice

262
0:12:23.289,000 --> 0:12:24,000
about their pitch.

263
0:12:24.742,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Laughter)

264
0:12:27.607,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I wanted to say --

265
0:12:28.791,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Applause)

266
0:12:30.481,000 --> 0:12:32,000
"Ok, don't start with this story."

267
0:12:32.771,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

268
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I mean, even the Scientologists

269
0:12:36.067,000 --> 0:12:39,000
know to start with a personality test before they start --

270
0:12:39.376,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Applause)

271
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:45,000
telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.

272
0:12:46.138,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Then, they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us

273
0:12:48.749,000 --> 0:12:49,000
through his righteous prophets?"

274
0:12:50.313,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And I said, "No, I don't,"

275
0:12:51.59,000 --> 0:12:53,000
because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story

276
0:12:54.099,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and this crazy gold plate story,

277
0:12:55.675,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through,

278
0:12:58.533,000 --> 0:13:,000
so I backpedaled a little and I said,

279
0:13:00.755,000 --> 0:13:02,000
"Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'?

280
0:13:03.666,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"

281
0:13:07.15,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?"

282
0:13:10.72,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift

283
0:13:14.463,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that is so spectacular,

284
0:13:16.458,000 --> 0:13:2,000
it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men

285
0:13:21.259,000 --> 0:13:22,000
was the gift of prophecy."

286
0:13:23.656,000 --> 0:13:26,000
What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?

287
0:13:27.003,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?

288
0:13:30.366,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Laughter)

289
0:13:31.402,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Women's longer lifespan?

290
0:13:32.803,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men?

291
0:13:36.031,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But no -- it wasn't any of these gifts.

292
0:13:38.313,000 --> 0:13:41,000
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."

293
0:13:41.401,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I said, "Oh, come on.

294
0:13:42.853,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year

295
0:13:45.696,000 --> 0:13:47,000
from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45,

296
0:13:48.657,000 --> 0:13:49,000
assuming they didn't die from exhaustion,

297
0:13:50.677,000 --> 0:13:52,000
it still seems like some women would have some time left over

298
0:13:53.589,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to hear the word of God."

299
0:13:55.059,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And they said, "No."

300
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

301
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more,

302
0:14:03.188,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but they had more to say.

303
0:14:04.417,000 --> 0:14:06,000
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon,

304
0:14:07.175,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and if you're in good standing with the church,

305
0:14:09.413,000 --> 0:14:11,000
when you die, you get to go to heaven

306
0:14:11.573,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and be with your family for all eternity."

307
0:14:14.378,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And I said, "Oh, dear.

308
0:14:16.46,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Laughter)

309
0:14:23.388,000 --> 0:14:25,000
That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."

310
0:14:25.611,000 --> 0:14:26,000
(Laughter)

311
0:14:26.935,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And they said, "Oh.

312
0:14:28.444,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Laughter)

313
0:14:29.827,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Hey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven,

314
0:14:32.896,000 --> 0:14:34,000
you get your body restored to you in its best original state.

315
0:14:35.807,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.

316
0:14:38.261,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."

317
0:14:40.261,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I said, "Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus,

318
0:14:43.254,000 --> 0:14:45,000
because I had cancer a few years ago.

319
0:14:45.369,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So does this mean that if I went to heaven,

320
0:14:47.439,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I would get my old uterus back?"

321
0:14:49.495,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And they said, "Sure."

322
0:14:51.575,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.

323
0:14:57.364,000 --> 0:14:59,000
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?

324
0:15:00.355,000 --> 0:15:01,000
(Laughter)

325
0:15:02.085,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Would God force you to get your old nose back?

326
0:15:05.824,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Then they gave me this Book of Mormon,

327
0:15:07.769,000 --> 0:15:09,000
told me to read this chapter and that chapter,

328
0:15:09.946,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and said they'd come back and check in on me,

329
0:15:12.248,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry,"

330
0:15:14.937,000 --> 0:15:16,000
or maybe just, "Please don't," and they were gone.

331
0:15:17.339,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Ok, so I initially felt really superior to these boys,

332
0:15:19.951,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and smug in my more conventional faith.

333
0:15:23.417,000 --> 0:15:26,000
But then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.

334
0:15:27.12,000 --> 0:15:28,000
If someone came to my door

335
0:15:28.447,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time,

336
0:15:31.816,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl

337
0:15:35.414,000 --> 0:15:36,000
without the use of intercourse,

338
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us."

339
0:15:40.215,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Laughter)

340
0:15:41.541,000 --> 0:15:44,000
"And she had a baby, and that's the son of God,"

341
0:15:44.712,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous.

342
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I'm just so used to that story.

343
0:15:48.886,000 --> 0:15:49,000
(Laughter)

344
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.

345
0:15:53.48,000 --> 0:15:55,000
But the question they asked me when they first arrived

346
0:15:56.064,000 --> 0:15:57,000
really stuck in my head:

347
0:15:57.548,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart?

348
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question.

349
0:16:04.542,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Now, if they had asked me,

350
0:16:05.841,000 --> 0:16:08,000
"Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?"

351
0:16:09.091,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered,

352
0:16:13.121,000 --> 0:16:14,000
"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time.

353
0:16:14.77,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused,

354
0:16:17.539,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and I feel consoled and cared for.

355
0:16:20.191,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits,

356
0:16:24.283,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."

357
0:16:28.548,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But since they asked me that question with the word "believe" in it,

358
0:16:31.774,000 --> 0:16:32,000
somehow it was all different,

359
0:16:33.256,000 --> 0:16:38,000
because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.

1
0:00:12.836,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Some people are obsessed by French wines.

2
0:00:16.302,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Others love playing golf

3
0:00:18.548,000 --> 0:00:19,000
or devouring literature.

4
0:00:20.729,000 --> 0:00:23,000
One of my greatest pleasures in life is, I have to admit,

5
0:00:24.328,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a bit special.

6
0:00:25.946,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I cannot tell you how much I enjoy watching cities from the sky,

7
0:00:30.938,000 --> 0:00:31,000
from an airplane window.

8
0:00:32.916,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Some cities are calmly industrious,

9
0:00:35.935,000 --> 0:00:36,000
like Dusseldorf

10
0:00:37.499,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or Louisville.

11
0:00:39.78,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Others project an energy that they can hardly contain,

12
0:00:43.437,000 --> 0:00:44,000
like New York

13
0:00:44.778,000 --> 0:00:45,000
or Hong Kong.

14
0:00:46.524,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And then you have Paris

15
0:00:49.492,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or Istanbul,

16
0:00:51.228,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and their patina full of history.

17
0:00:54.108,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I see cities as living beings.

18
0:00:56.514,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And when I discover them from far above,

19
0:00:59.006,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space.

20
0:01:04.019,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Especially at night,

21
0:01:05.519,000 --> 0:01:09,000
when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden:

22
0:01:10.908,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the city's vascular system performing its vital function

23
0:01:15.219,000 --> 0:01:16,000
right before your eyes.

24
0:01:17.569,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But when I'm sitting in my car

25
0:01:21.02,000 --> 0:01:24,000
after an hour and a half of commute every day,

26
0:01:24.336,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that reality looks very different.

27
0:01:26.237,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:27.315,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Nothing --

29
0:01:28.497,000 --> 0:01:29,000
not public radio,

30
0:01:30.211,000 --> 0:01:31,000
no podcast --

31
0:01:31.394,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:32.446,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Not even mindfulness meditation

33
0:01:34.479,000 --> 0:01:35,000
makes this time worth living.

34
0:01:36.118,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:38.072,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Isn't it absurd

36
0:01:39.25,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that we created cars that can reach 130 miles per hour

37
0:01:43.731,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and we now drive them at the same speed as 19th-century horse carriages?

38
0:01:49.377,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:50.66,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In the US alone,

40
0:01:52.426,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we spent 29.6 billion hours commuting in 2014.

41
0:01:58.281,000 --> 0:01:59,000
With that amount of time,

42
0:01:59.923,000 --> 0:02:03,000
ancient Egyptians could have built 26 Pyramids of Giza.

43
0:02:04.238,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:05.308,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We do that in one year.

45
0:02:06.73,000 --> 0:02:1,000
A monumental waste of time, energy and human potential.

46
0:02:12.154,000 --> 0:02:13,000
For decades,

47
0:02:13.355,000 --> 0:02:15,000
our remedy for congestion was simple:

48
0:02:15.687,000 --> 0:02:18,000
build new roads or enlarge existing ones.

49
0:02:19.198,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And it worked.

50
0:02:20.372,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It worked admirably for Paris,

51
0:02:22.854,000 --> 0:02:25,000
when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings

52
0:02:25.968,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to create 85 miles

53
0:02:27.639,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of transportation-friendly boulevards.

54
0:02:30.879,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And it still works today in fast-growing emerging cities.

55
0:02:34.549,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But in more established urban centers,

56
0:02:36.969,000 --> 0:02:39,000
significant network expansions are almost impossible:

57
0:02:40.923,000 --> 0:02:41,000
habitat is just too dense,

58
0:02:42.867,000 --> 0:02:43,000
real estate, too expensive

59
0:02:44.864,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and public finances, too fragile.

60
0:02:47.78,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Our city's vascular system is getting clogged, it's getting sick,

61
0:02:51.409,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and we should pay attention.

62
0:02:53.04,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Our current way of thinking is not working.

63
0:02:56.172,000 --> 0:02:57,000
For our transportation to flow,

64
0:02:58.117,000 --> 0:03:,000
we need a new source of inspiration.

65
0:03:02.187,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So after 16 years working in transportation,

66
0:03:05.437,000 --> 0:03:08,000
my "aha moment" happened when speaking with a biotech customer.

67
0:03:09.622,000 --> 0:03:11,000
She was telling me how her treatment

68
0:03:11.674,000 --> 0:03:14,000
was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system.

69
0:03:15.582,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system --

70
0:03:18.074,000 --> 0:03:21,000
all the veins and arteries in our body

71
0:03:21.174,000 --> 0:03:24,000
making miracles of logistics every day."

72
0:03:25.112,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This is the moment I realized

73
0:03:27.294,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that biology has been in the transportation business

74
0:03:30.301,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for billions of years.

75
0:03:32.364,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It has been testing countless solutions

76
0:03:34.752,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to move nutrients, gases and proteins.

77
0:03:38.532,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It really is the world's most sophisticated transportation laboratory.

78
0:03:43.326,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So, what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us?

79
0:03:49.895,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I wanted to know:

80
0:03:51.184,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Why is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives,

81
0:03:55.004,000 --> 0:03:58,000
when our big cities get clogged on a daily basis?

82
0:03:58.99,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the reality is that you're looking at two very different networks.

83
0:04:04.013,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I don't know if you realize,

84
0:04:06.223,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but each of us has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in our bodies --

85
0:04:10.944,000 --> 0:04:11,000
60,000 miles.

86
0:04:12.262,000 --> 0:04:14,000
That's two-and-a-half times the Earth's circumference,

87
0:04:14.878,000 --> 0:04:15,000
inside you.

88
0:04:16.86,000 --> 0:04:19,000
What it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us,

89
0:04:20.203,000 --> 0:04:22,000
not just under the surface of our skin.

90
0:04:22.61,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But if you look at our cities,

91
0:04:24.843,000 --> 0:04:27,000
yes, we have some underground subway systems

92
0:04:27.965,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and some tunnels and bridges,

93
0:04:30.405,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and also some helicopters in the sky.

94
0:04:32.709,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground,

95
0:04:36.792,000 --> 0:04:37,000
on the surface.

96
0:04:38.45,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So in other words,

97
0:04:39.829,000 --> 0:04:43,000
while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us,

98
0:04:44.232,000 --> 0:04:46,000
our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional.

99
0:04:47.881,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And so what we need is to embrace that verticality.

100
0:04:51.29,000 --> 0:04:53,000
If our surface grid is saturated,

101
0:04:53.879,000 --> 0:04:54,000
well, let's elevate our traffic.

102
0:04:56.174,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This Chinese concept of a bus that can straddle traffic jams --

103
0:05:00.694,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that was an eye-opener on new ways to think about space and movement

104
0:05:05.103,000 --> 0:05:06,000
inside our cities.

105
0:05:06.863,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And we can go higher,

106
0:05:08.699,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and suspend our transportation like we did with our electrical grid.

107
0:05:13.968,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi are talking about testing

108
0:05:17.009,000 --> 0:05:2,000
these futuristic networks of suspended magnetic pods.

109
0:05:21.465,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And we can keep climbing, and fly.

110
0:05:25.263,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The fact that a company like Airbus

111
0:05:27.214,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is now seriously working on flying urban taxis

112
0:05:30.546,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is telling us something.

113
0:05:32.633,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Flying cars are finally moving from science-fiction déjà vu

114
0:05:37.525,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to attractive business-case territory.

115
0:05:40.238,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And that's an exciting moment.

116
0:05:42.415,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So building this 3-D transportation network

117
0:05:45.068,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams.

118
0:05:50.41,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But it's not the only one.

119
0:05:52.257,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We have to question

120
0:05:53.899,000 --> 0:05:56,000
other fundamental choices that we made, like the vehicles we use.

121
0:05:58.278,000 --> 0:06:,000
Just imagine a very familiar scene:

122
0:06:00.983,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You've been driving for 42 minutes.

123
0:06:03.656,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The two kids behind you are getting restless.

124
0:06:06.899,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And you're late.

125
0:06:08.754,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Do you see that slow car in front of you?

126
0:06:11.474,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Always comes when you're late, right?

127
0:06:13.316,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:14.475,000 --> 0:06:16,000
That driver is looking for parking.

129
0:06:17.193,000 --> 0:06:19,000
There is no parking spot available in the area,

130
0:06:19.434,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but how would he know?

131
0:06:21.552,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It is estimated that up to 30 percent of urban traffic is generated

132
0:06:26.492,000 --> 0:06:27,000
by drivers looking for parking.

133
0:06:29.091,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Do you see the 100 cars around you?

134
0:06:31.549,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Eighty-five of them only have one passenger.

135
0:06:34.571,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Those 85 drivers could all fit in one Londonian red bus.

136
0:06:39.339,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So the question is:

137
0:06:40.514,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Why are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most?

138
0:06:43.598,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Why are we doing this to ourselves?

139
0:06:45.746,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Biology would never do this.

140
0:06:48.189,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Space inside our arteries is fully utilized.

141
0:06:51.722,000 --> 0:06:52,000
At every heartbeat,

142
0:06:53.27,000 --> 0:06:57,000
a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells

143
0:06:57.307,000 --> 0:06:59,000
into massive trains of oxygen

144
0:06:59.449,000 --> 0:07:,000
that quickly flow throughout our body.

145
0:07:01.771,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted, either.

146
0:07:06.357,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In healthy conditions,

147
0:07:08.098,000 --> 0:07:12,000
more than 95 percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized.

148
0:07:12.494,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Can you imagine if the vehicles we used in our cities

149
0:07:15.379,000 --> 0:07:16,000
were 95 percent full,

150
0:07:17.087,000 --> 0:07:2,000
all the additional space you would have to walk, to bike

151
0:07:20.495,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and to enjoy our cities?

152
0:07:22.616,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The reason blood is so incredibly efficient

153
0:07:26.153,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is that our red blood cells are not dedicated

154
0:07:29.278,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to specific organs or tissues;

155
0:07:31.497,000 --> 0:07:34,000
otherwise, we would probably have traffic jams in our veins.

156
0:07:34.632,000 --> 0:07:35,000
No, they're shared.

157
0:07:35.888,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They're shared by all the cells of our body.

158
0:07:38.737,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And because our network is so extensive,

159
0:07:41.414,000 --> 0:07:45,000
each one of our 37 trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen

160
0:07:46.198,000 --> 0:07:47,000
precisely when it needs them.

161
0:07:48.253,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Blood is both a collective and individual form of transportation.

162
0:07:53.513,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But for our cities,

163
0:07:55.081,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we've been stuck.

164
0:07:56.389,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We've been stuck in an endless debate

165
0:07:58.458,000 --> 0:08:03,000
between creating a car-centric society or extensive mass-transit systems.

166
0:08:04.295,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I think we should transcend this.

167
0:08:05.934,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I think we can create vehicles that combine the convenience of cars

168
0:08:10.277,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and the efficiencies of trains and buses.

169
0:08:13.459,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Just imagine.

170
0:08:14.888,000 --> 0:08:18,000
You're comfortably sitting in a fast and smooth urban train,

171
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
along with 1,200 passengers.

172
0:08:21.95,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The problem with urban trains

173
0:08:23.661,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is that sometimes you have to stop five, ten, fifteen times

174
0:08:28.08,000 --> 0:08:29,000
before your final destination.

175
0:08:30.421,000 --> 0:08:32,000
What if in this train you didn't have to stop?

176
0:08:33.929,000 --> 0:08:34,000
In this train,

177
0:08:35.222,000 --> 0:08:38,000
wagons can detach dynamically while you're moving

178
0:08:39.012,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and become express, driverless buses

179
0:08:41.518,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that move on a secondary road network.

180
0:08:44.024,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And so without a single stop,

181
0:08:45.949,000 --> 0:08:46,000
nor a lengthy transfer,

182
0:08:47.56,000 --> 0:08:5,000
you are now sitting in a bus that is headed toward your suburb.

183
0:08:51.647,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And when you get close,

184
0:08:53.597,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the section you're sitting in detaches

185
0:08:56.928,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and self-drives you right to your doorstep.

186
0:09:00.523,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It is collective and individual at the same time.

187
0:09:03.922,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This could be one of the shared, modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow.

188
0:09:09.681,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now ...

189
0:09:11.217,000 --> 0:09:14,000
as if walking in a city buzzing with drones,

190
0:09:14.399,000 --> 0:09:18,000
flying taxis, modular buses and suspended magnetic pods

191
0:09:18.71,000 --> 0:09:19,000
was not exotic enough,

192
0:09:21.062,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I think there is another force in action

193
0:09:23.023,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that will make urban traffic mesmerizing.

194
0:09:26.541,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If you think about it,

195
0:09:28.154,000 --> 0:09:33,000
the current generation of driverless cars is just trying to earn its way

196
0:09:33.184,000 --> 0:09:36,000
into a traffic grid made by and for humans.

197
0:09:36.626,000 --> 0:09:39,000
They're trying to learn traffic rules, which is relatively simple,

198
0:09:40.551,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and coping with human unpredictability,

199
0:09:42.484,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which is more challenging.

200
0:09:45.063,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But what would happen when whole cities become driverless?

201
0:09:48.999,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Would we need traffic lights?

202
0:09:50.851,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Would we need lanes?

203
0:09:52.471,000 --> 0:09:53,000
How about speed limits?

204
0:09:54.563,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes.

205
0:09:57.402,000 --> 0:09:58,000
They never stop at red lights.

206
0:09:59.387,000 --> 0:10:,000
In the first driverless cities,

207
0:10:01.387,000 --> 0:10:03,000
you would have no red lights and no lanes.

208
0:10:04.014,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And when all the cars are driverless and connected,

209
0:10:07.63,000 --> 0:10:1,000
everything is predictable and reaction time, minimum.

210
0:10:11.219,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They can drive much faster

211
0:10:13.157,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up

212
0:10:16.118,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or the cars around them.

213
0:10:18.6,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So instead of rigid traffic rules,

214
0:10:22.203,000 --> 0:10:23,000
flow will be regulated

215
0:10:23.559,000 --> 0:10:27,000
by a mesh of dynamic and constantly self-improving algorithms.

216
0:10:30.468,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The result: a strange traffic

217
0:10:33.219,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of German autobahns

218
0:10:36.754,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and the creative vitality of the intersections of Mumbai.

219
0:10:40.695,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

220
0:10:42.278,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Traffic will be functionally exuberant.

221
0:10:44.257,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It will be liquid like our blood.

222
0:10:46.722,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And by a strange paradox,

223
0:10:48.502,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the more robotized our traffic grid will be,

224
0:10:51.337,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the more organic and alive its movement will feel.

225
0:10:55.075,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So yes,

226
0:10:56.876,000 --> 0:10:59,000
biology has all the attributes of a transportation genius today.

227
0:11:00.598,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But this process has taken billions of years,

228
0:11:03.431,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and went through all sorts of iterations and mutations.

229
0:11:06.892,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We can't wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system.

230
0:11:10.979,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We now have the dreams,

231
0:11:12.831,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the concepts

232
0:11:14.147,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and the technology

233
0:11:16.477,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to create 3-D transportation networks,

234
0:11:19.351,000 --> 0:11:2,000
invent new vehicles

235
0:11:21.09,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and change the flow in our cities.

236
0:11:23.109,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Let's do it.

237
0:11:24.288,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Thank you.

238
0:11:25.476,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Applause)

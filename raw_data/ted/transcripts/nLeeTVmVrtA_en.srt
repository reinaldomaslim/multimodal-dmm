2
0:00:12.965,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was born and raised in North Korea.

3
0:00:16.468,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Although my family constantly struggled against poverty,

4
0:00:21.268,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was always loved and cared for first,

5
0:00:24.796,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because I was the only son

6
0:00:26.947,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and the youngest of two in the family.

7
0:00:30.117,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But then the great famine began in 1994.

8
0:00:33.724,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was four years old.

9
0:00:36.183,000 --> 0:00:39,000
My sister and I would go searching for firewood

10
0:00:39.98,000 --> 0:00:4,000
starting at 5 in the morning

11
0:00:41.956,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and come back after midnight.

12
0:00:44.762,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I would wander the streets searching for food,

13
0:00:48.65,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I remember seeing a small child

14
0:00:50.823,000 --> 0:00:52,000
tied to a mother's back eating chips,

15
0:00:53.645,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and wanting to steal them from him.

16
0:00:56.869,000 --> 0:01:,000
Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness.

17
0:01:01.702,000 --> 0:01:04,000
For a hungry child, politics and freedom

18
0:01:04.905,000 --> 0:01:06,000
are not even thought of.

19
0:01:07.657,000 --> 0:01:09,000
On my ninth birthday, my parents

20
0:01:10.345,000 --> 0:01:13,000
couldn't give me any food to eat.

21
0:01:13.774,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But even as a child, I could feel the heaviness

22
0:01:17.718,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in their hearts.

23
0:01:20.753,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time,

24
0:01:25.968,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and in 2003, when I was 13 years old,

25
0:01:29.664,000 --> 0:01:31,000
my father became one of them.

26
0:01:32.577,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I saw my father wither away and die.

27
0:01:36.465,000 --> 0:01:4,000
In the same year, my mother disappeared one day,

28
0:01:40.597,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and then my sister told me

29
0:01:42.402,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that she was going to China to earn money,

30
0:01:45.003,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but that she would return with money and food soon.

31
0:01:49.198,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Since we had never been separated,

32
0:01:52.149,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I thought we would be together forever,

33
0:01:55.119,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I didn't even give her a hug when she left.

34
0:01:58.992,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life.

35
0:02:03.205,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But again, I didn't know

36
0:02:04.916,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it was going to be a long goodbye.

37
0:02:08.404,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then.

38
0:02:13.341,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Suddenly, I became an orphan and homeless.

39
0:02:17.56,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My daily life became very hard,

40
0:02:20.649,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but very simple.

41
0:02:22.701,000 --> 0:02:26,000
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.

42
0:02:26.724,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But that is no way to survive.

43
0:02:29.631,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I started to realize, begging would not be the solution.

44
0:02:34.349,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets.

45
0:02:39.675,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Sometimes, I found small jobs

46
0:02:42.64,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in exchange for food.

47
0:02:44.97,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Once, I even spent two months in the winter

48
0:02:48.116,000 --> 0:02:49,000
working in a coal mine,

49
0:02:49.859,000 --> 0:02:54,000
33 meters underground without any protection

50
0:02:55.634,000 --> 0:02:58,000
for up to 16 hours a day.

51
0:02:59.067,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I was not uncommon.

52
0:03:01.431,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Many other orphans survived this way, or worse.

53
0:03:08.992,000 --> 0:03:12,000
When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold

54
0:03:13.128,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or hunger pains,

55
0:03:14.595,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I hoped that, the next morning,

56
0:03:17.443,000 --> 0:03:19,000
my sister would come back to wake me up

57
0:03:20.006,000 --> 0:03:22,000
with my favorite food.

58
0:03:22.276,000 --> 0:03:25,000
That hope kept me alive.

59
0:03:25.426,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I don't mean big, grand hope.

60
0:03:28.224,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe

61
0:03:31.346,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that the next trash can had bread,

62
0:03:33.809,000 --> 0:03:36,000
even though it usually didn't.

63
0:03:36.942,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't even try,

64
0:03:40.385,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then I would die.

65
0:03:42.478,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Hope kept me alive.

66
0:03:46.416,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Every day, I told myself,

67
0:03:49.176,000 --> 0:03:51,000
no matter how hard things got,

68
0:03:51.904,000 --> 0:03:54,000
still I must live.

69
0:03:55.806,000 --> 0:03:59,000
After three years of waiting for my sister's return,

70
0:03:59.936,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I decided to go to China to look for her myself.

71
0:04:04.288,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I realized

72
0:04:07.148,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I couldn't survive much longer this way.

73
0:04:10.798,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I knew the journey would be risky,

74
0:04:13.603,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but I would be risking my life either way.

75
0:04:16.5,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea,

76
0:04:20.686,000 --> 0:04:23,000
or at least I could try for a better life

77
0:04:24.144,000 --> 0:04:27,000
by escaping to China.

78
0:04:27.38,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I had learned that many people tried to cross

79
0:04:30.61,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen.

80
0:04:35.397,000 --> 0:04:38,000
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people

81
0:04:39.355,000 --> 0:04:42,000
trying to cross the border without permission.

82
0:04:42.728,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Chinese soldiers will catch

83
0:04:45.379,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and send back North Koreans,

84
0:04:47.233,000 --> 0:04:51,000
where they face severe punishment.

85
0:04:51.573,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I decided to cross during the day,

86
0:04:54.654,000 --> 0:04:59,000
first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark,

87
0:05:00.087,000 --> 0:05:04,000
second because I knew I was already taking a risk,

88
0:05:04.736,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and since not many people tried to cross during the day,

89
0:05:08.151,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I thought I might be able to cross

90
0:05:09.841,000 --> 0:05:12,000
without being seen by anyone.

91
0:05:13.266,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I made it to China on February 15, 2006.

92
0:05:17.174,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I was 16 years old.

93
0:05:19.402,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I thought things in China would be easier,

94
0:05:22.322,000 --> 0:05:25,000
since there was more food.

95
0:05:25.595,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I thought more people would help me.

96
0:05:28.651,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But it was harder than living in North Korea,

97
0:05:32.664,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because I was not free.

98
0:05:34.359,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I was always worried about being caught

99
0:05:37.104,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and sent back.

100
0:05:39.899,000 --> 0:05:42,000
By a miracle, some months later,

101
0:05:43.17,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I met someone who was running

102
0:05:44.613,000 --> 0:05:47,000
an underground shelter for North Koreans,

103
0:05:47.955,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and was allowed to live there

104
0:05:50.563,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and eat regular meals for the first time in many years.

105
0:05:55.915,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Later that year, an activist helped me escape China

106
0:06:00.396,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and go to the United States as a refugee.

107
0:06:04.617,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I went to America without knowing a word of English,

108
0:06:07.917,000 --> 0:06:11,000
yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school.

109
0:06:12.296,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Even in North Korea, I was an F student.

110
0:06:16.495,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:17.879,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I barely finished elementary school.

112
0:06:21.586,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day.

113
0:06:24.89,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Textbooks and the library were not my playground.

114
0:06:28.828,000 --> 0:06:31,000
My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying,

115
0:06:32.573,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but it didn't work.

116
0:06:35.124,000 --> 0:06:38,000
At one point, my father gave up on me.

117
0:06:38.267,000 --> 0:06:41,000
He said, "You're not my son anymore."

118
0:06:42.236,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.

119
0:06:46.988,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But nevertheless, my level of motivation

120
0:06:49.649,000 --> 0:06:53,000
still didn't change before he died.

121
0:06:54.356,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So in America, it was kind of ridiculous

122
0:06:57.161,000 --> 0:07:,000
that they said I should go to high school.

123
0:07:00.188,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I didn't even go to middle school.

124
0:07:02.612,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I decided to go, just because they told me to,

125
0:07:05.996,000 --> 0:07:07,000
without trying much.

126
0:07:08.404,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But one day, I came home and my foster mother

127
0:07:11.817,000 --> 0:07:14,000
had made chicken wings for dinner.

128
0:07:15.026,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing,

129
0:07:18.28,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but I realized there were not enough for everyone,

130
0:07:21.476,000 --> 0:07:24,000
so I decided against it.

131
0:07:24.973,000 --> 0:07:26,000
When I looked down at my plate,

132
0:07:27.298,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his.

133
0:07:32.434,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I was so happy.

134
0:07:34.752,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I looked at him sitting next to me.

135
0:07:37.015,000 --> 0:07:4,000
He just looked back at me very warmly,

136
0:07:40.331,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but said no words.

137
0:07:43.003,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Suddenly I remembered my biological father.

138
0:07:47.847,000 --> 0:07:49,000
My foster father's small act of love

139
0:07:50.82,000 --> 0:07:52,000
reminded me of my father,

140
0:07:53.041,000 --> 0:07:56,000
who would love to share his food with me

141
0:07:56.041,000 --> 0:08:,000
when he was hungry, even if he was starving.

142
0:08:00.678,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America,

143
0:08:05.01,000 --> 0:08:08,000
yet my father died of starvation.

144
0:08:08.477,000 --> 0:08:12,000
My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him,

145
0:08:12.68,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and that night I also thought of what else I could do

146
0:08:16.171,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to honor him.

147
0:08:18.387,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And my answer was to promise to myself

148
0:08:21.121,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that I would study hard and get the best education

149
0:08:24.551,000 --> 0:08:27,000
in America to honor his sacrifice.

150
0:08:28.115,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I took school seriously,

151
0:08:30.651,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and for the first time ever in my life,

152
0:08:33.451,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I received an academic award for excellence,

153
0:08:37.348,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and made dean's list from the first semester in high school.

154
0:08:42.962,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:50.594,000 --> 0:08:52,000
That chicken wing changed my life.

156
0:08:53.324,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

157
0:08:57.381,000 --> 0:09:,000
Hope is personal. Hope is something

158
0:09:00.973,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that no one can give to you.

159
0:09:03.482,000 --> 0:09:05,000
You have to choose to believe in hope.

160
0:09:06.402,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You have to make it yourself.

161
0:09:09.569,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In North Korea, I made it myself.

162
0:09:12.809,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Hope brought me to America.

163
0:09:15.522,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But in America, I didn't know what to do,

164
0:09:18.522,000 --> 0:09:23,000
because I had this overwhelming freedom.

165
0:09:23.554,000 --> 0:09:27,000
My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction,

166
0:09:27.605,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and he motivated me and gave me a purpose

167
0:09:31.131,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to live in America.

168
0:09:35.058,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I did not come here by myself.

169
0:09:38.178,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I had hope, but hope by itself is not enough.

170
0:09:43.132,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Many people helped me along the way to get here.

171
0:09:47.286,000 --> 0:09:5,000
North Koreans are fighting hard to survive.

172
0:09:51.274,000 --> 0:09:53,000
They have to force themselves to survive,

173
0:09:54.063,000 --> 0:09:56,000
have hope to survive,

174
0:09:56.818,000 --> 0:10:,000
but they cannot make it without help.

175
0:10:01.579,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This is my message to you.

176
0:10:03.925,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Have hope for yourself,

177
0:10:06.634,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but also help each other.

178
0:10:09.746,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live.

179
0:10:16.328,000 --> 0:10:19,000
My foster father didn't intend to change my life.

180
0:10:20.114,000 --> 0:10:24,000
In the same way, you may also change someone's life

181
0:10:24.486,000 --> 0:10:28,000
with even the smallest act of love.

182
0:10:29.006,000 --> 0:10:34,000
A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger,

183
0:10:34.124,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and having the hope will bring you bread

184
0:10:37.225,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to keep you alive.

185
0:10:39.51,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But I confidently believe that

186
0:10:42.727,000 --> 0:10:45,000
your act of love and caring

187
0:10:46.185,000 --> 0:10:49,000
can also save another Joseph's life

188
0:10:49.589,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and change thousands of other Josephs

189
0:10:55.031,000 --> 0:10:59,000
who are still having hope to survive.

190
0:10:59.033,000 --> 0:11:,000
Thank you.

191
0:11:00.34,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause)

192
0:11:36.561,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Adrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing

193
0:11:39.386,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that very personal and special story with us.

194
0:11:42.568,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I know you haven't seen your sister for, you said,

195
0:11:45.793,000 --> 0:11:47,000
it was almost exactly a decade,

196
0:11:48.253,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and in the off chance that she may be able to see this,

197
0:11:50.67,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we wanted to give you an opportunity

198
0:11:52.497,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to send her a message.

199
0:11:54.725,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Joseph Kim: In Korean?

200
0:11:55.861,000 --> 0:11:57,000
AH: You can do English, then Korean as well.

201
0:11:58.469,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

202
0:12:02.377,000 --> 0:12:04,000
JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean

203
0:12:04.718,000 --> 0:12:06,000
because I don't think I can make it

204
0:12:07.459,000 --> 0:12:1,000
without tearing up.

205
0:12:11.115,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Nuna, it has been already 10 years

206
0:12:15.836,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that I haven’t seen you.

207
0:12:22.357,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I just wanted to say

208
0:12:25.749,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that I miss you, and I love you,

209
0:12:29.933,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and please come back to me and stay alive.

210
0:12:34.276,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I -- oh, gosh.

211
0:12:39.162,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I still haven't given up my hope to see you.

212
0:12:45.591,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I will live my life happily

213
0:12:50.253,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and study hard

214
0:12:53.572,000 --> 0:12:55,000
until I see you,

215
0:12:55.649,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and I promise I will not cry again.

216
0:13:00.228,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Laughter)

217
0:13:01.785,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Yes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you,

218
0:13:04.373,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and if you can't find me,

219
0:13:06.644,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I will also look for you,

220
0:13:09.716,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and I hope to see you one day.

221
0:13:12.452,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And can I also make a small message to my mom?

222
0:13:15.788,000 --> 0:13:16,000
AH: Sure, please.

223
0:13:17.439,000 --> 0:13:19,000
JK: I haven't spent much time with you,

224
0:13:20.228,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but I know that you still love me,

225
0:13:22.14,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and you probably still pray for me

226
0:13:25.084,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and think about me.

227
0:13:28.204,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I just wanted to say thank you

228
0:13:30.356,000 --> 0:13:33,000
for letting me be in this world.

229
0:13:33.89,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Thank you.

230
0:13:35.359,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Applause)

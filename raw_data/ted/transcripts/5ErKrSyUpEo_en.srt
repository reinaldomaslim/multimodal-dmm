1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:14,000
(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa,

2
0:00:15.12,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.

3
0:00:20.4,000 --> 0:00:23,000
There is a moment on the birthing table

4
0:00:24.52,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that feels like dying.

5
0:00:28.6,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The body in labor stretches to form an impossible circle.

6
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The contractions are less than a minute apart.

7
0:00:34.52,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Wave after wave, there is barely time to breathe.

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The medical term:

9
0:00:39.92,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"transition,"

10
0:00:42.52,000 --> 0:00:45,000
because "feels like dying" is not scientific enough.

11
0:00:45.88,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:46.92,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I checked.

13
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
During my transition,

14
0:00:50.4,000 --> 0:00:51,000
my husband was pressing down on my sacrum

15
0:00:52.377,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to keep my body from breaking.

16
0:00:53.84,000 --> 0:00:56,000
My father was waiting behind the hospital curtain ...

17
0:00:58.04,000 --> 0:00:59,000
more like hiding.

18
0:01:00.24,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But my mother was at my side.

19
0:01:03.56,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The midwife said she could see the baby's head,

20
0:01:07.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but all I could feel was a ring of fire.

21
0:01:10.48,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I turned to my mother and said, "I can't,"

22
0:01:12.56,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but she was already pouring my grandfather's prayer in my ear.

23
0:01:16.56,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Sikh Prayer) "Tati Vao Na Lagi, Par Brahm Sarnai."

24
0:01:19.8,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"The hot winds cannot touch you."

25
0:01:23.04,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"You are brave," she said.

26
0:01:25.68,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"You are brave."

27
0:01:30.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And suddenly I saw my grandmother standing behind my mother.

28
0:01:37.08,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And her mother behind her.

29
0:01:39.84,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And her mother behind her.

30
0:01:42.28,000 --> 0:01:45,000
A long line of women who had pushed through the fire before me.

31
0:01:45.56,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I took a breath;

32
0:01:46.84,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I pushed;

33
0:01:48.08,000 --> 0:01:49,000
my son was born.

34
0:01:51.04,000 --> 0:01:53,000
As I held him in my arms, shaking and sobbing

35
0:01:53.88,000 --> 0:01:56,000
from the rush of oxytocin that flooded my body,

36
0:01:57.32,000 --> 0:02:,000
my mother was already preparing to feed me.

37
0:02:00.92,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Nursing her baby as I nursed mine.

38
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:08,000
My mother had never stopped laboring for me,

39
0:02:08.12,000 --> 0:02:1,000
from my birth to my son's birth.

40
0:02:10.48,000 --> 0:02:13,000
She already knew what I was just beginning to name.

41
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That love is more than a rush of feeling

42
0:02:18.4,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that happens to us if we're lucky.

43
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Love is sweet labor.

44
0:02:25.36,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Fierce.

45
0:02:26.68,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Bloody.

46
0:02:28.24,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Imperfect.

47
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Life-giving.

48
0:02:32.4,000 --> 0:02:34,000
A choice we make over and over again.

49
0:02:39.56,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I am an American civil rights activist

50
0:02:41.96,000 --> 0:02:44,000
who has labored with communities of color since September 11,

51
0:02:45.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
fighting unjust policies by the state and acts of hate in the street.

52
0:02:49.76,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And in our most painful moments,

53
0:02:52.04,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in the face of the fires of injustice,

54
0:02:54.92,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I have seen labors of love deliver us.

55
0:03:00.6,000 --> 0:03:04,000
My life on the frontlines of fighting hate in America has been a study

56
0:03:04.88,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in what I've come to call revolutionary love.

57
0:03:10.12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Revolutionary love is the choice to enter into labor

58
0:03:16.04,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for others who do not look like us,

59
0:03:19.08,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for our opponents who hurt us

60
0:03:22.28,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and for ourselves.

61
0:03:25.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In this era of enormous rage,

62
0:03:28.8,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when the fires are burning all around us,

63
0:03:32.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I believe that revolutionary love is the call of our times.

64
0:03:40.6,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now, if you cringe when people say, "Love is the answer ..."

65
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I do, too.

66
0:03:46.68,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:47.72,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I am a lawyer.

68
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:51.32,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So let me show you how I came to see love as a force for social justice

70
0:03:56.6,000 --> 0:03:57,000
through three lessons.

71
0:04:01.88,000 --> 0:04:04,000
My first encounter with hate was in the schoolyard.

72
0:04:05.72,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I was a little girl growing up in California,

73
0:04:08.32,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where my family has lived and farmed for a century.

74
0:04:12.24,000 --> 0:04:15,000
When I was told that I would go to hell because I was not Christian,

75
0:04:15.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
called a "black dog" because I was not white,

76
0:04:18.64,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I ran to my grandfather's arms.

77
0:04:20.6,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Papa Ji dried my tears --

78
0:04:22.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
gave me the words of Guru Nanak,

79
0:04:24.4,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the founder of the Sikh faith.

80
0:04:27.4,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"I see no stranger," said Nanak.

81
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"I see no enemy."

82
0:04:33.04,000 --> 0:04:34,000
My grandfather taught me

83
0:04:34.32,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that I could choose to see all the faces I meet

84
0:04:39.88,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and wonder about them.

85
0:04:42.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And if I wonder about them,

86
0:04:44.32,000 --> 0:04:47,000
then I will listen to their stories even when it's hard.

87
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I will refuse to hate them even when they hate me.

88
0:04:51.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I will even vow to protect them when they are in harm's way.

89
0:04:54.88,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That's what it means to be a Sikh:

90
0:04:56.8,000 --> 0:04:57,000
S-i-k-h.

91
0:04:58.2,000 --> 0:05:,000
To walk the path of a warrior saint.

92
0:05:00.84,000 --> 0:05:03,000
He told me the story of the first Sikh woman warrior,

93
0:05:03.96,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Mai Bhago.

94
0:05:05.2,000 --> 0:05:08,000
The story goes there were 40 soldiers who abandoned their post

95
0:05:08.4,000 --> 0:05:1,000
during a great battle against an empire.

96
0:05:10.72,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They returned to a village,

97
0:05:12.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and this village woman turned to them and said,

98
0:05:15.32,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"You will not abandon the fight.

99
0:05:18.28,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You will return to the fire,

100
0:05:21.96,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I will lead you."

101
0:05:24.92,000 --> 0:05:25,000
She mounted a horse.

102
0:05:26.68,000 --> 0:05:27,000
She donned a turban.

103
0:05:28.36,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And with sword in her hand and fire in her eyes,

104
0:05:31.2,000 --> 0:05:32,000
she led them where no one else would.

105
0:05:33.04,000 --> 0:05:35,000
She became the one she was waiting for.

106
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"Don't abandon your posts, my dear."

107
0:05:41.6,000 --> 0:05:43,000
My grandfather saw me as a warrior.

108
0:05:43.68,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I was a little girl in two long braids,

109
0:05:46.84,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but I promised.

110
0:05:49.96,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Fast-forward, I'm 20 years old,

111
0:05:54.68,000 --> 0:05:56,000
watching the Twin Towers fall,

112
0:05:58.44,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the horror stuck in my throat,

113
0:06:00.2,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and then a face flashes on the screen:

114
0:06:03.08,000 --> 0:06:05,000
a brown man with a turban and beard,

115
0:06:05.48,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and I realize that our nation's new enemy looks like my grandfather.

116
0:06:12.44,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And these turbans meant to represent our commitment to serve

117
0:06:16.24,000 --> 0:06:18,000
cast us as terrorists.

118
0:06:18.32,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And Sikhs became targets of hate,

119
0:06:20.28,000 --> 0:06:22,000
alongside our Muslim brothers and sisters.

120
0:06:22.88,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The first person killed in a hate crime after September 11 was a Sikh man,

121
0:06:27.68,000 --> 0:06:29,000
standing in front of his gas station in Arizona.

122
0:06:31.4,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Balbir Singh Sodhi was a family friend I called "uncle,"

123
0:06:38.68,000 --> 0:06:41,000
murdered by a man who called himself "patriot."

124
0:06:45.44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
He is the first of many to have been killed,

125
0:06:50.24,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but his story --

126
0:06:51.52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
our stories barely made the evening news.

127
0:06:57.04,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I didn't know what to do,

128
0:06:58.36,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but I had a camera,

129
0:07:00.24,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I faced the fire.

130
0:07:02.04,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I went to his widow,

131
0:07:04.52,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Joginder Kaur.

132
0:07:06.68,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I wept with her, and I asked her,

133
0:07:09.96,000 --> 0:07:11,000
"What would you like to tell the people of America?"

134
0:07:14.88,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I was expecting blame.

135
0:07:18.52,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But she looked at me and said,

136
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:23,000
"Tell them, 'Thank you.'

137
0:07:25.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
3,000 Americans came to my husband's memorial.

138
0:07:29.56,000 --> 0:07:3,000
They did not know me,

139
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but they wept with me.

140
0:07:34.28,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Tell them, 'Thank you.'"

141
0:07:39.2,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Thousands of people showed up,

142
0:07:41.56,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because unlike national news,

143
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the local media told Balbir Uncle's story.

144
0:07:47.08,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Stories can create the wonder

145
0:07:49.68,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that turns strangers into sisters and brothers.

146
0:07:54.84,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This was my first lesson in revolutionary love --

147
0:07:58.72,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that stories can help us see no stranger.

148
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And so ...

149
0:08:06.28,000 --> 0:08:08,000
my camera became my sword.

150
0:08:09.88,000 --> 0:08:11,000
My law degree became my shield.

151
0:08:12.72,000 --> 0:08:14,000
My film partner became my husband.

152
0:08:15.28,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

153
0:08:17.44,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I didn't expect that.

154
0:08:19.44,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And we became part of a generation of advocates

155
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
working with communities facing their own fires.

156
0:08:28.84,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I worked inside of supermax prisons,

157
0:08:32.2,000 --> 0:08:34,000
on the shores of Guantanamo,

158
0:08:34.28,000 --> 0:08:35,000
at the sites of mass shootings

159
0:08:35.76,000 --> 0:08:37,000
when the blood was still fresh on the ground.

160
0:08:39.2,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And every time,

161
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for 15 years,

162
0:08:43.52,000 --> 0:08:45,000
with every film, with every lawsuit,

163
0:08:45.559,000 --> 0:08:46,000
with every campaign,

164
0:08:46.88,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I thought we were making the nation safer

165
0:08:49.24,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for the next generation.

166
0:08:54.159,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And then my son was born.

167
0:09:05.8,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In a time ...

168
0:09:08.8,000 --> 0:09:1,000
when hate crimes against our communities

169
0:09:10.88,000 --> 0:09:12,000
are at the highest they have been since 9/11.

170
0:09:15.96,000 --> 0:09:18,000
When right-wing nationalist movements are on the rise around the globe

171
0:09:19.96,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and have captured the presidency of the United States.

172
0:09:25.2,000 --> 0:09:28,000
When white supremacists march in our streets,

173
0:09:28.44,000 --> 0:09:3,000
torches high, hoods off.

174
0:09:32.8,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And I have to reckon with the fact

175
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him

176
0:09:42.96,000 --> 0:09:43,000
than the one I was given.

177
0:09:47.68,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And there will be moments

178
0:09:51.32,000 --> 0:09:52,000
when I cannot protect him

179
0:09:54.24,000 --> 0:09:57,000
when he is seen as a terrorist ...

180
0:10:00.84,000 --> 0:10:04,000
just as black people in America

181
0:10:05.08,000 --> 0:10:07,000
are still seen as criminal.

182
0:10:08.56,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Brown people, illegal.

183
0:10:11.64,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Queer and trans people, immoral.

184
0:10:14.88,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Indigenous people, savage.

185
0:10:17.32,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Women and girls as property.

186
0:10:19.4,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And when they fail to see our bodies as some mother's child,

187
0:10:22.92,000 --> 0:10:25,000
it becomes easier to ban us,

188
0:10:26.52,000 --> 0:10:27,000
detain us,

189
0:10:27.76,000 --> 0:10:28,000
deport us,

190
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:3,000
imprison us,

191
0:10:30.8,000 --> 0:10:33,000
sacrifice us for the illusion of security.

192
0:10:38.64,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Applause)

193
0:10:50.12,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I wanted to abandon my post.

194
0:10:54.92,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But I made a promise,

195
0:10:58.04,000 --> 0:11:01,000
so I returned to the gas station

196
0:11:01.28,000 --> 0:11:05,000
where Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed 15 years to the day.

197
0:11:07.84,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I set down a candle in the spot where he bled to death.

198
0:11:12.04,000 --> 0:11:13,000
His brother, Rana, turned to me

199
0:11:15.32,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and said, "Nothing has changed."

200
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And I asked,

201
0:11:21.48,000 --> 0:11:23,000
"Who have we not yet tried to love?"

202
0:11:27.68,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We decided to call the murderer in prison.

203
0:11:32.8,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The phone rings.

204
0:11:34.64,000 --> 0:11:36,000
My heart is beating in my ears.

205
0:11:37.44,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I hear the voice of Frank Roque,

206
0:11:40.08,000 --> 0:11:41,000
a man who once said ...

207
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
"I'm going to go out and shoot some towel heads.

208
0:11:51.08,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We should kill their children, too."

209
0:11:55.92,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And every emotional impulse in me says, "I can't."

210
0:12:04.24,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It becomes an act of will to wonder.

211
0:12:10.56,000 --> 0:12:12,000
"Why?" I ask.

212
0:12:15.04,000 --> 0:12:17,000
"Why did you agree to speak with us?"

213
0:12:21.24,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Frank says, "I'm sorry for what happened,

214
0:12:24.28,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but I'm also sorry for all the people killed on 9/11."

215
0:12:28.48,000 --> 0:12:3,000
He fails to take responsibility.

216
0:12:30.64,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I become angry to protect Rana,

217
0:12:34.96,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but Rana is still wondering about Frank --

218
0:12:41.08,000 --> 0:12:42,000
listening --

219
0:12:43.08,000 --> 0:12:44,000
responds.

220
0:12:45.76,000 --> 0:12:48,000
"Frank, this is the first time I'm hearing you say

221
0:12:49.64,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that you feel sorry."

222
0:12:55.36,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And Frank --

223
0:12:57.56,000 --> 0:13:,000
Frank says, "Yes.

224
0:13:02.24,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I am sorry for what I did to your brother.

225
0:13:07.64,000 --> 0:13:11,000
One day when I go to heaven to be judged by God,

226
0:13:13.28,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I will ask to see your brother.

227
0:13:16.88,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And I will hug him.

228
0:13:19.72,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And I will ask him for forgiveness."

229
0:13:25.64,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And Rana says ...

230
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
"We already forgave you."

231
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Forgiveness is not forgetting.

232
0:13:40.64,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Forgiveness is freedom from hate.

233
0:13:45.6,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Because when we are free from hate,

234
0:13:48.2,000 --> 0:13:51,000
we see the ones who hurt us not as monsters,

235
0:13:51.44,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but as people who themselves are wounded,

236
0:13:54.12,000 --> 0:13:56,000
who themselves feel threatened,

237
0:13:56.2,000 --> 0:13:58,000
who don't know what else to do with their insecurity

238
0:13:58.68,000 --> 0:14:,000
but to hurt us, to pull the trigger,

239
0:14:00.84,000 --> 0:14:01,000
or cast the vote,

240
0:14:02.12,000 --> 0:14:04,000
or pass the policy aimed at us.

241
0:14:04.2,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But if some of us begin to wonder about them,

242
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
listen even to their stories,

243
0:14:12.36,000 --> 0:14:16,000
we learn that participation in oppression comes at a cost.

244
0:14:18.48,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It cuts them off from their own capacity to love.

245
0:14:27.04,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This was my second lesson in revolutionary love.

246
0:14:34.32,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We love our opponents when we tend the wound in them.

247
0:14:42.24,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Tending to the wound is not healing them --

248
0:14:45.64,000 --> 0:14:46,000
only they can do that.

249
0:14:47.36,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Just tending to it allows us

250
0:14:51.44,000 --> 0:14:52,000
to see our opponents:

251
0:14:54.36,000 --> 0:14:57,000
the terrorist, the fanatic, the demagogue.

252
0:14:59.2,000 --> 0:15:04,000
They've been radicalized by cultures and policies that we together can change.

253
0:15:07.64,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I looked back on all of our campaigns,

254
0:15:12.48,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and I realized that any time we fought bad actors,

255
0:15:16.76,000 --> 0:15:17,000
we didn't change very much.

256
0:15:20.24,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But when we chose to wield our swords and shields

257
0:15:24.68,000 --> 0:15:26,000
to battle bad systems,

258
0:15:27.68,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that's when we saw change.

259
0:15:30.8,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I have worked on campaigns

260
0:15:32.64,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that released hundreds of people out of solitary confinement,

261
0:15:38.2,000 --> 0:15:4,000
reformed a corrupt police department,

262
0:15:40.96,000 --> 0:15:42,000
changed federal hate crimes policy.

263
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The choice to love our opponents is moral and pragmatic,

264
0:15:48.8,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and it opens up the previously unimaginable possibility

265
0:15:54.36,000 --> 0:15:55,000
of reconciliation.

266
0:15:59.8,000 --> 0:16:,000
But remember ...

267
0:16:02.32,000 --> 0:16:04,000
it took 15 years to make that phone call.

268
0:16:06.76,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I had to tend to my own rage and grief first.

269
0:16:12.76,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Loving our opponents requires us to love ourselves.

270
0:16:19.32,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Gandhi, King, Mandela --

271
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:24,000
they taught a lot about how to love others and opponents.

272
0:16:26.72,000 --> 0:16:28,000
They didn't talk a lot about loving ourselves.

273
0:16:30.12,000 --> 0:16:32,000
This is a feminist intervention.

274
0:16:33.946,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Applause)

275
0:16:35.12,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Yes.

276
0:16:37.04,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Yes.

277
0:16:38.28,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Applause)

278
0:16:41.6,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Because for too long have women and women of color been told

279
0:16:45.56,000 --> 0:16:46,000
to suppress their rage,

280
0:16:47.08,000 --> 0:16:5,000
suppress their grief in the name of love and forgiveness.

281
0:16:50.68,000 --> 0:16:52,000
But when we suppress our rage,

282
0:16:52.72,000 --> 0:16:54,000
that's when it hardens into hate directed outward,

283
0:16:55.24,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but usually directed inward.

284
0:16:59.4,000 --> 0:17:03,000
But mothering has taught me that all of our emotions are necessary.

285
0:17:05.92,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Joy is the gift of love.

286
0:17:09.68,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Grief is the price of love.

287
0:17:13.84,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Anger is the force that protects it.

288
0:17:18.96,000 --> 0:17:21,000
This was my third lesson in revolutionary love.

289
0:17:23.48,000 --> 0:17:24,000
We love ourselves

290
0:17:24.8,000 --> 0:17:29,000
when we breathe through the fire of pain

291
0:17:29.96,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and refuse to let it harden into hate.

292
0:17:34.24,000 --> 0:17:35,000
That's why I believe

293
0:17:37.119,000 --> 0:17:4,000
that love must be practiced in all three directions

294
0:17:40.88,000 --> 0:17:41,000
to be revolutionary.

295
0:17:43.24,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Loving just ourselves feels good,

296
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:49,000
but it's narcissism.

297
0:17:49.56,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Laughter)

298
0:17:53.4,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Loving only our opponents is self-loathing.

299
0:17:58.6,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Loving only others is ineffective.

300
0:18:03.88,000 --> 0:18:05,000
This is where a lot of our movements live right now.

301
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
We need to practice all three forms of love.

302
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And so, how do we practice it?

303
0:18:16.8,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Ready?

304
0:18:18.72,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Number one ...

305
0:18:21.88,000 --> 0:18:22,000
in order to love others,

306
0:18:23.64,000 --> 0:18:25,000
see no stranger.

307
0:18:25.68,000 --> 0:18:28,000
We can train our eyes to look upon strangers on the street,

308
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
on the subway, on the screen,

309
0:18:30.92,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and say in our minds,

310
0:18:32.72,000 --> 0:18:33,000
"Brother,

311
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
sister,

312
0:18:35.52,000 --> 0:18:36,000
aunt,

313
0:18:36.96,000 --> 0:18:37,000
uncle."

314
0:18:38.72,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And when we say this, what we are saying is,

315
0:18:40.96,000 --> 0:18:42,000
"You are a part of me I do not yet know.

316
0:18:44.96,000 --> 0:18:46,000
I choose to wonder about you.

317
0:18:48,000 --> 0:18:49,000
I will listen for your stories

318
0:18:50.84,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and pick up a sword when you are in harm's way."

319
0:18:55.68,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And so, number two:

320
0:18:58.2,000 --> 0:19:,000
in order to love our opponents,

321
0:19:00.72,000 --> 0:19:01,000
tend the wound.

322
0:19:03.52,000 --> 0:19:05,000
Can you see the wound in the ones who hurt you?

323
0:19:07.56,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Can you wonder even about them?

324
0:19:11.8,000 --> 0:19:14,000
And if this question sends panic through your body,

325
0:19:15.64,000 --> 0:19:17,000
then your most revolutionary act

326
0:19:18.04,000 --> 0:19:21,000
is to wonder, listen and respond to your own needs.

327
0:19:22.68,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Number three:

328
0:19:25,000 --> 0:19:27,000
in order to love ourselves,

329
0:19:27.24,000 --> 0:19:28,000
breathe and push.

330
0:19:30.12,000 --> 0:19:32,000
When we are pushing into the fires in our bodies

331
0:19:32.84,000 --> 0:19:33,000
or the fires in the world,

332
0:19:35.36,000 --> 0:19:36,000
we need to be breathing together

333
0:19:38.08,000 --> 0:19:39,000
in order to be pushing together.

334
0:19:40.84,000 --> 0:19:42,000
How are you breathing each day?

335
0:19:44.04,000 --> 0:19:46,000
Who are you breathing with?

336
0:19:48.6,000 --> 0:19:49,000
Because ...

337
0:19:51.36,000 --> 0:19:56,000
when executive orders and news of violence hits our bodies hard,

338
0:19:56.68,000 --> 0:19:58,000
sometimes less than a minute apart,

339
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
it feels like dying.

340
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:04,000
In those moments,

341
0:20:05.44,000 --> 0:20:08,000
my son places his hand on my cheek and says,

342
0:20:09.36,000 --> 0:20:1,000
"Dance time, mommy?"

343
0:20:13.12,000 --> 0:20:14,000
And we dance.

344
0:20:15.8,000 --> 0:20:17,000
In the darkness, we breathe and we dance.

345
0:20:18.52,000 --> 0:20:21,000
Our family becomes a pocket of revolutionary love.

346
0:20:21.72,000 --> 0:20:23,000
Our joy is an act of moral resistance.

347
0:20:24.6,000 --> 0:20:26,000
How are you protecting your joy each day?

348
0:20:26.72,000 --> 0:20:3,000
Because in joy we see even darkness with new eyes.

349
0:20:33.32,000 --> 0:20:37,000
And so the mother in me asks,

350
0:20:39.12,000 --> 0:20:43,000
what if this darkness is not the darkness of the tomb,

351
0:20:45.16,000 --> 0:20:47,000
but the darkness of the womb?

352
0:20:49.68,000 --> 0:20:51,000
What if our future is not dead,

353
0:20:53.08,000 --> 0:20:55,000
but still waiting to be born?

354
0:20:57.08,000 --> 0:21:,000
What if this is our great transition?

355
0:21:01.68,000 --> 0:21:03,000
Remember the wisdom of the midwife.

356
0:21:04.8,000 --> 0:21:05,000
"Breathe," she says.

357
0:21:06.12,000 --> 0:21:07,000
And then --

358
0:21:07.68,000 --> 0:21:08,000
"push."

359
0:21:09.04,000 --> 0:21:11,000
Because if we don't push, we will die.

360
0:21:11.4,000 --> 0:21:13,000
If we don't breathe, we will die.

361
0:21:13.48,000 --> 0:21:17,000
Revolutionary love requires us to breathe and push through the fire

362
0:21:18.24,000 --> 0:21:2,000
with a warrior's heart and a saint's eyes

363
0:21:20.64,000 --> 0:21:21,000
so that one day ...

364
0:21:24.2,000 --> 0:21:28,000
one day you will see my son as your own

365
0:21:29.84,000 --> 0:21:31,000
and protect him when I am not there.

366
0:21:34.08,000 --> 0:21:37,000
You will tend to the wound in the ones who want to hurt him.

367
0:21:39.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
You will teach him how to love himself

368
0:21:42.4,000 --> 0:21:43,000
because you love yourself.

369
0:21:46.48,000 --> 0:21:47,000
You will whisper in his ear,

370
0:21:49.4,000 --> 0:21:5,000
as I whisper in yours,

371
0:21:52.6,000 --> 0:21:53,000
"You are brave."

372
0:21:55.24,000 --> 0:21:56,000
You are brave.

373
0:21:58.2,000 --> 0:21:59,000
Thank you.

374
0:21:59.44,000 --> 0:22:,000
(Applause)

375
0:22:00.48,000 --> 0:22:01,000
(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa,

376
0:22:02.4,000 --> 0:22:03,000
Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.

377
0:22:03.92,000 --> 0:22:04,000

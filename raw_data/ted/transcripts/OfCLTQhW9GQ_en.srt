1
0:00:13.333,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Like many teachers,

2
0:00:14.635,000 --> 0:00:16,000
every year on the first day of school,

3
0:00:16.659,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I lead a sort of icebreaker activity with my students.

4
0:00:20.389,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I teach at Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska,

5
0:00:24.001,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and we are one of the oldest and most diverse high schools

6
0:00:27.638,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in our state.

7
0:00:30.079,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Also, to our knowledge,

8
0:00:31.391,000 --> 0:00:35,000
we're the only high school in the world whose mascot is the Links.

9
0:00:36.069,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Like, a chain.

10
0:00:37.879,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:39.427,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And with that being our mascot,

12
0:00:41.331,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we have a statue out front of our building

13
0:00:43.673,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of four links connected like a chain.

14
0:00:47.665,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And each link means something.

15
0:00:50.676,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Our links stand for tradition,

16
0:00:53.406,000 --> 0:00:56,000
excellence, unity and diversity.

17
0:00:58.724,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So on the first day of school,

18
0:01:00.178,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I teach my new ninth-graders about the meaning behind those links,

19
0:01:04.919,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I give them each a slip of paper.

20
0:01:07.736,000 --> 0:01:09,000
On that paper, I ask them to write something about themselves.

21
0:01:10.673,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It can be something that they love,

22
0:01:13.18,000 --> 0:01:15,000
something that they hope for --

23
0:01:15.577,000 --> 0:01:17,000
anything that describes their identity.

24
0:01:19.553,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And then I go around the room with a stapler,

25
0:01:21.673,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I staple each of those slips together

26
0:01:23.765,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to make a chain.

27
0:01:25.48,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And we hang that chain up in our classroom as a decoration, sure,

28
0:01:29.735,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but also as a reminder that we are all connected.

29
0:01:33.593,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We are all links.

30
0:01:36.752,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So what happens when one of those links feels weak?

31
0:01:41.196,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And what happens when that weakness

32
0:01:44.109,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is in the person holding the stapler?

33
0:01:48.061,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The person who's supposed to make those connections.

34
0:01:52.133,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The teacher.

35
0:01:54.927,000 --> 0:01:56,000
As teachers, we work every day

36
0:01:57.238,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to provide support socially, emotionally and academically

37
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances.

38
0:02:08.822,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Like most teachers,

39
0:02:09.997,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I have students who go home every day,

40
0:02:11.923,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and they sit around the kitchen table

41
0:02:14.065,000 --> 0:02:19,000
while one or both parents makes a healthy, well-rounded meal for them.

42
0:02:20.948,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They spend suppertime summarizing the story they read

43
0:02:23.857,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in ninth-grade English that day,

44
0:02:26.133,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or explaining how Newton's laws of motion work.

45
0:02:30.752,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But I also have students who go to the homeless shelter

46
0:02:35.451,000 --> 0:02:36,000
or to the group home.

47
0:02:37.974,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They go to the car that their family is sleeping in right now.

48
0:02:42.871,000 --> 0:02:44,000
They come to school with trauma,

49
0:02:45.236,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and when I go home every day, that goes home with me.

50
0:02:49.307,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And see, that's the hard part about teaching.

51
0:02:51.477,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's not the grading, the lesson-planning, the meetings,

52
0:02:55.688,000 --> 0:02:59,000
though sure, those things do occupy a great deal of teachers' time and energy.

53
0:03:01.077,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The tough part about teaching

54
0:03:02.521,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is all the things you can't control for your kids,

55
0:03:06.776,000 --> 0:03:09,000
all the things you can't change for them once they walk out your door.

56
0:03:12.735,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And so I wonder if it's always been this way.

57
0:03:15.292,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I think back to my undergraduate training at the University of Georgia,

58
0:03:19.315,000 --> 0:03:21,000
where we were taught in our methods classes

59
0:03:21.387,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that the concept of good teaching has changed.

60
0:03:25.247,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We're not developing learners

61
0:03:27.128,000 --> 0:03:29,000
who are going to go out into a workforce

62
0:03:29.168,000 --> 0:03:31,000
where they'll stand on a line in a factory.

63
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Rather, we're sending our kids out into a workforce

64
0:03:34.744,000 --> 0:03:36,000
where they need to be able to communicate,

65
0:03:36.95,000 --> 0:03:38,000
collaborate and problem-solve.

66
0:03:40.481,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And that has caused teacher-student relationships

67
0:03:44.18,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to morph into something stronger

68
0:03:46.641,000 --> 0:03:49,000
than the giver of content and the receiver of knowledge.

69
0:03:51.978,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Lectures and sitting in silent rows just doesn't cut it anymore.

70
0:03:58.645,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We have to be able to build relationships with and among our students

71
0:04:03.038,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to help them feel connected

72
0:04:05.085,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in a world that depends on it.

73
0:04:10.306,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I think back to my second year teaching.

74
0:04:12.576,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I had a student who I'll call "David."

75
0:04:15.599,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And I remember feeling like I'd done a pretty good job

76
0:04:18.218,000 --> 0:04:19,000
at teaching that year:

77
0:04:19.53,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"Hey, I ain't no first-year teacher.

78
0:04:22.093,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I know what I'm doing."

79
0:04:26.093,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And it was on the last day of school,

80
0:04:27.958,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I told David to have a great summer.

81
0:04:31.093,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I watched him walk down the hall,

82
0:04:34.069,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and I thought to myself,

83
0:04:35.387,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I don't even know what his voice sounds like.

84
0:04:40.085,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And that's when I realized I wasn't doing it right.

85
0:04:43.165,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So I changed almost everything about my teaching.

86
0:04:46.339,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I built in plenty of opportunities for my students to talk to me

87
0:04:50.891,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and to talk to each other,

88
0:04:52.827,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to share their writing and to verbalize their learning.

89
0:04:56.748,000 --> 0:05:,000
And it was through those conversations I began not only to know their voice

90
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but to know their pain.

91
0:05:05.356,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I had David in class again that next year,

92
0:05:08.403,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I learned that his father was undocumented

93
0:05:11.966,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and had been deported.

94
0:05:15.017,000 --> 0:05:16,000
He started acting out in school

95
0:05:16.842,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because all he wanted was for his family to be together again.

96
0:05:21.334,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In so many ways, I felt his pain.

97
0:05:26.44,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I needed someone to listen,

98
0:05:29.797,000 --> 0:05:31,000
somebody to provide support for me

99
0:05:32.711,000 --> 0:05:37,000
so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend.

100
0:05:39.673,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And we recognize that need

101
0:05:42.109,000 --> 0:05:46,000
for police officers who've witnessed a gruesome crime scene

102
0:05:46.347,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and nurses who have lost a patient.

103
0:05:50.783,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But when it comes to teaching professionals,

104
0:05:53.506,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that urgency is lagging.

105
0:05:57.753,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I believe it's paramount

106
0:06:00.078,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that students and teachers,

107
0:06:03.411,000 --> 0:06:08,000
administrators, paraprofessionals and all other support staff

108
0:06:08.513,000 --> 0:06:13,000
have convenient and affordable access to mental wellness supports.

109
0:06:14.87,000 --> 0:06:16,000
When we are constantly serving others,

110
0:06:17.498,000 --> 0:06:21,000
often between 25 and 125 students each day,

111
0:06:22.149,000 --> 0:06:25,000
our emotional piggy banks are constantly being drawn upon.

112
0:06:27.134,000 --> 0:06:29,000
After a while, it can become so depleted,

113
0:06:30.086,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that we just can't bear it anymore.

114
0:06:35.007,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They call it "secondary trauma" and "compassion fatigue,"

115
0:06:39.264,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the concept that we absorb the traumas our students share with us each day.

116
0:06:46.542,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And after a while,

117
0:06:48.005,000 --> 0:06:53,000
our souls become weighed down by the heaviness of it all.

118
0:06:55.18,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The Buffett Institute at the University of Nebraska

119
0:06:57.99,000 --> 0:06:59,000
recently found that most teachers --

120
0:07:00.577,000 --> 0:07:03,000
86 percent across early childhood settings --

121
0:07:04.335,000 --> 0:07:08,000
experienced some depressive symptoms during the prior week.

122
0:07:09.613,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They found that approximately one in 10

123
0:07:12.117,000 --> 0:07:16,000
reported clinically significant depressive symptoms.

124
0:07:17.593,000 --> 0:07:2,000
My interactions with colleagues and my own experiences

125
0:07:20.815,000 --> 0:07:23,000
make me feel like this is a universal struggle

126
0:07:24.482,000 --> 0:07:26,000
across all grade levels.

127
0:07:28.58,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So what are we missing?

128
0:07:31.183,000 --> 0:07:34,000
What are we allowing to break the chain and how do we repair it?

129
0:07:36.842,000 --> 0:07:37,000
In my career,

130
0:07:38.016,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I've experienced the death by suicide of two students

131
0:07:41.32,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and one amazing teacher

132
0:07:45.352,000 --> 0:07:46,000
who loved his kids;

133
0:07:48.934,000 --> 0:07:51,000
countless students experiencing homelessness;

134
0:07:52.815,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and kids entering and exiting the justice system.

135
0:07:58.07,000 --> 0:07:59,000
When these events happen,

136
0:07:59.372,000 --> 0:08:03,000
protocol is to say, "If you need someone to talk to, then ..."

137
0:08:04.14,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And I say that's not enough.

138
0:08:07.823,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I am so lucky.

139
0:08:09.426,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I work in an amazing school with great leadership.

140
0:08:13.633,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I serve a large district

141
0:08:15.95,000 --> 0:08:18,000
with so many healthy partnerships with community agencies.

142
0:08:19.855,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They have provided steadily increasing numbers

143
0:08:23.212,000 --> 0:08:25,000
of school counselors and therapists

144
0:08:26.022,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and support staff to help our students.

145
0:08:31.031,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They even provide staff members with access to free counseling

146
0:08:34.892,000 --> 0:08:36,000
as part of our employment plan.

147
0:08:38.85,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But many small districts and even some large ones

148
0:08:41.601,000 --> 0:08:44,000
simply cannot foot the bill without aid.

149
0:08:48.76,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Exhales)

150
0:08:53.141,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Not only does every school need social and emotional support staff,

151
0:08:58.87,000 --> 0:09:02,000
trained professionals who can navigate the needs of the building --

152
0:09:03.411,000 --> 0:09:08,000
not just the students, not just the teachers, but both --

153
0:09:08.514,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we also need these trained professionals

154
0:09:10.82,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to intentionally seek out those closest to the trauma

155
0:09:14.688,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and check in with them.

156
0:09:18.069,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Many schools are doing what they can

157
0:09:20.641,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to fill in the gaps,

158
0:09:22.332,000 --> 0:09:24,000
starting with acknowledging that the work that we do

159
0:09:24.88,000 --> 0:09:25,000
is downright hard.

160
0:09:27.768,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Another school in Lincoln, Schoo Middle School,

161
0:09:30.122,000 --> 0:09:32,000
has what they call "Wellness Wednesdays."

162
0:09:33.006,000 --> 0:09:35,000
They invite in community yoga teachers,

163
0:09:35.506,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch

164
0:09:38.823,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and organize social events

165
0:09:40.254,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that are all meant to bring people together.

166
0:09:44.032,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Zachary Elementary School in Zachary, Louisiana,

167
0:09:47.333,000 --> 0:09:49,000
has something they call a "Midweek Meetup,"

168
0:09:49.905,000 --> 0:09:51,000
where they invite teachers to share lunch

169
0:09:52.088,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and to talk about the things that are going well

170
0:09:54.998,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and the things that are weighing heavy on their hearts.

171
0:09:59.553,000 --> 0:10:04,000
These schools are making space for conversations that matter.

172
0:10:05.792,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Finally, my friend and colleague Jen Highstreet

173
0:10:08.625,000 --> 0:10:1,000
takes five minutes out of each day

174
0:10:10.792,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to write an encouraging note to a colleague,

175
0:10:13.355,000 --> 0:10:15,000
letting them know that she sees their hard work

176
0:10:15.784,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and the heart that they share with others.

177
0:10:18.605,000 --> 0:10:2,000
She knows that those five minutes

178
0:10:21.107,000 --> 0:10:24,000
can have an invaluable and powerful ripple effect

179
0:10:24.155,000 --> 0:10:25,000
across our school.

180
0:10:27.782,000 --> 0:10:33,000
The chain that hangs in my classroom is more than just a decoration.

181
0:10:35.676,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Those links hang over our heads

182
0:10:37.352,000 --> 0:10:4,000
for the entire four years that our students walk our halls.

183
0:10:41.55,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And every year,

184
0:10:42.757,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I have seniors come back to my classroom, room 340,

185
0:10:47.55,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and they can still point out where their link hangs.

186
0:10:51.887,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They remember what they wrote on it.

187
0:10:55.403,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They feel connected and supported.

188
0:10:59.452,000 --> 0:11:,000
And they have hope.

189
0:11:01.817,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Isn't that what we all need?

190
0:11:04.698,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Somebody to reach out and make sure that we're OK.

191
0:11:09.357,000 --> 0:11:1,000
To check in with us

192
0:11:11.269,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and remind us that we are a link.

193
0:11:16.736,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Every now and then, we all just need a little help

194
0:11:20.269,000 --> 0:11:21,000
holding the stapler.

195
0:11:23.46,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Thank you.

196
0:11:24.635,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

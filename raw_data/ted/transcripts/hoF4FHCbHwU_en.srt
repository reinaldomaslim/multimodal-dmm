1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In Africa we say,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"God gave the white man a watch

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and gave the black man time."

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I think, how is it possible

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for a man with so much time

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to tell his story in 18 minutes?

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I think it will be quite a challenge for me.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Most African stories these days,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
they talk about famine,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
HIV and AIDS,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
poverty or war.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But my story that I would like to share with you today

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is the one about success.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It is about a country

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in the southwest of Africa

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
called Namibia.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Namibia has got 2.1 million people,

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but it is only twice the size of California.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I come from a region

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in the remote northwest part of the country.

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's called Kunene region.

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And in the center of Kunene region

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
This is where I'm coming from.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Most people that are following the story

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of Angelina Jolie

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and Brad Pitt

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
will know where Namibia is.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They love Namibia

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
for its beautiful dunes,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that are even taller

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
than the Empire State Building.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Wind and time have twisted our landscape

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
into very strange shapes,

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and these shapes are speckled with wildlife

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that has become so adapted

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to this harsh and strange land.

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I'm a Himba.

40
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes?

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'm a Himba and Namibian.

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
A Himba is one of the 29

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
ethnic groups in Namibia.

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We live a very traditional lifestyle.

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I grew up herding,

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
looking after our livestock --

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
goats, sheep and cattle.

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And one day,

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
my father actually took me into the bush.

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
He said, "John,

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I want you to become a good herder.

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Boy, if you are looking after our livestock

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and you see a cheetah

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
eating our goat --

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
cheetah is very nervous --

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
just walk up to it.

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"And he will let go of the goat

60
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and run off."

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But then he said,

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Boy, if you run into a lion,

63
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
don't move.

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Don't move. Stand your ground.

65
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Puff up and just look it in the eye

66
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and it may not want to fight you."

67
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But then, he said,

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"If you see a leopard,

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
boy, you better run like hell."

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after."

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In this way --

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In this way, I actually started to learn about nature.

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In addition to being an ordinary Namibian

77
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and in addition to being a Himba

78
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I'm also a trained conservationist.

79
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And it is very important if you are in the field

80
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to know what to confront

81
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and what to run from.

82
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I was born in 1971.

83
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We lived under apartheid regime.

84
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
The whites could farm, graze

85
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and hunt as they wished,

86
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but we black, we were not regarded as responsible

87
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to use wildlife.

88
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Whenever we tried to hunt,

89
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we were called poachers.

90
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail.

91
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Between 1966 and 1990,

92
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the U.S. and Soviet interests

93
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
fought for control over my country.

94
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And you know, during war time,

95
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
there are militaries, armies, that are moving around.

96
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns

97
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and tusks.

98
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They could sell these things for anything between

99
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
$5,000 a kilo.

100
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
During the same year

101
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
almost every Himba had a rifle.

102
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Because it was wartime,

103
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the British .303 rifle

104
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was just all over the whole country.

105
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Then in the same time, around 1980,

106
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we had a very big drought.

107
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It killed almost everything that was left.

108
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Our livestock was

109
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
almost at the brink of extinction,

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
protected as well.

111
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We were hungry.

112
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I remember a night

113
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
when a hungry leopard

114
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
went into the house

115
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of one of our neighbors

116
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and took a sleeping child out of the bed.

117
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's a very sad story.

118
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But even today,

119
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that memory is still in people's minds.

120
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They can pinpoint the exact location

121
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
where this all happened.

122
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And then, in the same year,

123
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we almost lost everything.

124
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?"

125
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there.

126
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And the year I went to school,

127
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization

128
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation.

129
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.

130
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They were trusted by the local communities

131
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
like our leader, Joshua Kangombe.

132
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening:

133
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
wildlife disappearing,

134
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
poaching was skyrocketing,

135
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and the situation seemed very hopeless.

136
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Death and despair surrounded Joshua

137
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and our entire communities.

138
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But then, the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua:

139
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
What if we pay people that you trust

140
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to look after wildlife?

141
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Do you have anybody in your communities, or people,

142
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that know the bush very well

143
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and that know wildlife very well?

144
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The headman said: "Yes. Our poachers."

145
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"Eh? The poachers?"

146
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"Yes. Our poachers."

147
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And that was my father.

148
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
My father has been a poacher for quite a long time.

149
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Instead of shooting poachers dead

150
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
like they were doing elsewhere in Africa,

151
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities

152
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to manage their peoples

153
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and their rights to own and manage wildlife.

154
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife,

155
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
wildlife numbers started coming back,

156
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.

157
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
With independence, the whole approach of community getting involved

158
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was embraced by our new government.

159
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Three things that actually help to build on this foundation:

160
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The very first one is

161
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas.

162
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Here is our tradition:

163
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
At every Himba village, there is a sacred fire.

164
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And at this sacred fire, the spirit of our ancestors

165
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
speak through the headman

166
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and advise us where to get water,

167
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
where to get grazings,

168
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and where to go and hunt.

169
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves

170
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
on the environment.

171
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And here are the new ideas.

172
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Transporting rhinos using helicopters

173
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I think is much easier

174
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
than talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it?

175
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And these things we were taught by outsiders.

176
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We learned these things from outsiders.

177
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands;

178
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we needed to learn more things like GPS

179
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
just to see whether --

180
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land

181
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West?

182
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And we then wanted to see whether we can match our

183
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world.

184
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And through this,

185
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we actually started realizing our dreams,

186
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and we maintained honoring our traditions

187
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but we were still open to new ideas.

188
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
The second element is that we wanted to have a life,

189
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
a better life where we can benefit through many things.

190
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Most poachers, like my father,

191
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
were people from our own community.

192
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They were not people from outside.

193
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
These were our own people.

194
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And sometimes, once they were caught,

195
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
they were treated with respect, brought back into the communities

196
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and they were made part of the bigger dreams.

197
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The best one, like my father -- I'm not campaigning for my father --

198
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

199
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they were put in charge to stop others from poaching.

200
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And when this thing started going on,

201
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
we started becoming one community,

202
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
renewing our connection to nature.

203
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia.

204
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The last element that actually helped develop these things

205
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
was the partnerships.

206
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands.

207
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The other partners that we have got

208
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
is business communities.

209
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map

210
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and they have also helped make wildlife

211
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
a very valuable land use like any other land uses

212
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
such as agriculture.

213
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And most of my conservation colleagues today

214
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that you find in Namibia

215
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
have been trained through the initiative,

216
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund

217
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in the most up-to-date conservation practices.

218
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
They have also given funding for two decades

219
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to this whole program.

220
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund,

221
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
we've been able to scale up the very small programs

222
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to national programs today.

223
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Namibia ... or Sesfontein

224
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
was no more an isolated village somewhere,

225
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
hidden away in Namibia.

226
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
With these assets we are now part of the global village.

227
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Thirty years have passed

228
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
since my father's first job as a community game guard.

229
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success

230
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
as I and my children see it today.

231
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
When I finished school in 1995,

232
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
there were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest -- in our area.

233
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But today, there are more than 130 lions.

234
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Applause)

235
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So please, if you go to Namibia,

236
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
make sure that you stay in the tents.

237
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Don't walk out at night!

238
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Laughter)

239
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982.

240
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino --

241
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
free-roaming black rhinos -- in the world.

242
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
This is outside the protected area.

243
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Applause)

244
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The leopard -- they are now in big numbers

245
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but they are now far away from our village,

246
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
because the natural plain has multiplied,

247
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
like zebras, springboks and everything.

248
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They stay very much far away

249
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
because this other thing has multiplied

250
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.

251
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
What started as very small,

252
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
community rangers getting community involved,

253
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
has now grown into something that we call conservancies.

254
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Conservancies are legally instituted institutions

255
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
by the government,

256
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.

257
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Today, we have got 60 conservancies

258
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that manage and protect over 13 million hectares

259
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
of land in Namibia.

260
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country.

261
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Nowhere else in the world

262
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
has community-adopted conservation at this scale.

263
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Applause)

264
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
In 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars.

265
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
This is our new economy --

266
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
an economy based on the respect of our natural resources.

267
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And we are able to use this money for many things:

268
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Very importantly, we put it in education.

269
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.

270
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education.

271
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses.

272
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And this is the good news from Africa

273
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that we have to shout from the rooftops.

274
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Applause)

275
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And now, what the world really needs

276
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is for you to help me and our partners

277
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
take some of what we have learned in Namibia

278
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to other places with similar problems:

279
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
places like Mongolia,

280
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
or even in your own backyards,

281
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the Northern Great Plains,

282
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
where buffalo and other animals have suffered

283
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and many communities are in decline.

284
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I like that one:

285
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Namibia serving as a model to Africa,

286
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and Africa serving as a model to the United States.

287
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
(Applause)

288
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We were successful in Namibia

289
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
because we dreamed of a future

290
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that was much more than just a healthy wildlife.

291
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We knew conservation would fail

292
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities.

293
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So, come and talk to me about Namibia,

294
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and better yet, come to Namibia

295
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and see for yourself how we have done it.

296
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And please, do visit our website

297
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM

298
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
in Africa and across the world.

299
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Thank you very much.

300
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.18,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I have a confession to make.

2
0:00:13.519,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a business professor

3
0:00:15.309,000 --> 0:00:17,000
whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead.

4
0:00:17.839,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But recently, I've discovered

5
0:00:19.28,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that what many of us think of as great leadership

6
0:00:22.239,000 --> 0:00:25,000
does not work when it comes to leading innovation.

7
0:00:25.519,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm an ethnographer.

8
0:00:26.92,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I use the methods of anthropology

9
0:00:28.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to understand the questions in which I'm interested.

10
0:00:31.22,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So along with three co-conspirators,

11
0:00:33.38,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal

12
0:00:37.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
exceptional leaders of innovation.

13
0:00:39.679,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We studied 16 men and women,

14
0:00:41.88,000 --> 0:00:43,000
located in seven countries across the globe,

15
0:00:44.439,000 --> 0:00:46,000
working in 12 different industries.

16
0:00:46.92,000 --> 0:00:49,000
In total, we spent hundreds of hours on the ground,

17
0:00:49.92,000 --> 0:00:52,000
on-site, watching these leaders in action.

18
0:00:53.2,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes

19
0:00:56.559,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did.

20
0:00:59.92,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The bottom line?

21
0:01:01.979,000 --> 0:01:04,000
If we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again,

22
0:01:05.14,000 --> 0:01:08,000
we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership.

23
0:01:08.959,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Leading innovation is not about creating a vision,

24
0:01:11.56,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and inspiring others to execute it.

25
0:01:14.76,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But what do we mean by innovation?

26
0:01:16.718,000 --> 0:01:19,000
An innovation is anything that is both new and useful.

27
0:01:20.079,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It can be a product or service.

28
0:01:21.84,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It can be a process or a way of organizing.

29
0:01:24.519,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It can be incremental, or it can be breakthrough.

30
0:01:27.359,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We have a pretty inclusive definition.

31
0:01:29.28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
How many of you recognize this man?

32
0:01:31.879,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Put your hands up.

33
0:01:34.56,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Keep your hands up, if you know who this is.

34
0:01:42.319,000 --> 0:01:44,000
How about these familiar faces?

35
0:01:44.599,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:46.68,000 --> 0:01:47,000
From your show of hands,

37
0:01:47.84,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it looks like many of you have seen a Pixar movie,

38
0:01:50.28,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,

39
0:01:53.239,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the founder and CEO of Pixar --

40
0:01:55.879,000 --> 0:01:57,000
one of the companies I had the privilege of studying.

41
0:01:58.799,000 --> 0:02:,000
My first visit to Pixar was in 2005,

42
0:02:01.479,000 --> 0:02:02,000
when they were working on "Ratatouille,"

43
0:02:03.4,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef.

44
0:02:06.52,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Computer-generated movies are really mainstream today,

45
0:02:10.439,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but it took Ed and his colleagues nearly 20 years

46
0:02:13.12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to create the first full-length C.G. movie.

47
0:02:16.96,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In the 20 years hence, they've produced 14 movies.

48
0:02:20.24,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I was recently at Pixar, and I'm here to tell you

49
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that number 15 is sure to be a winner.

50
0:02:26.069,000 --> 0:02:28,000
When many of us think about innovation, though,

51
0:02:28.28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we think about an Einstein having an 'Aha!' moment.

52
0:02:31.919,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But we all know that's a myth.

53
0:02:34.28,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Innovation is not about solo genius,

54
0:02:37.24,000 --> 0:02:4,000
it's about collective genius.

55
0:02:40.479,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Let's think for a minute about what it takes to make a Pixar movie:

56
0:02:44.159,000 --> 0:02:49,000
No solo genius, no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies.

57
0:02:49.68,000 --> 0:02:53,000
On the contrary, it takes about 250 people four to five years,

58
0:02:54.08,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to make one of those movies.

59
0:02:55.639,000 --> 0:02:57,000
To help us understand the process,

60
0:02:58.319,000 --> 0:03:01,000
an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture.

61
0:03:01.96,000 --> 0:03:02,000
He did so reluctantly,

62
0:03:03.469,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because it suggested that the process was a neat series of steps

63
0:03:07.84,000 --> 0:03:09,000
done by discrete groups.

64
0:03:10.13,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Even with all those arrows, he thought it failed to really tell you

65
0:03:13.99,000 --> 0:03:17,000
just how iterative, interrelated and, frankly, messy their process was.

66
0:03:18.84,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Throughout the making of a movie at Pixar, the story evolves.

67
0:03:24.94,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So think about it.

68
0:03:26.52,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Some shots go through quickly.

69
0:03:29.28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They don't all go through in order.

70
0:03:31.56,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It depends on how vexing the challenges are

71
0:03:34.199,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that they come up with when they are working on a particular scene.

72
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So if you think about that scene in "Up"

73
0:03:40.919,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird,

74
0:03:44.12,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that 10 seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect.

75
0:03:50.259,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The other thing about a Pixar movie

76
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is that no part of the movie is considered finished

77
0:03:54.4,000 --> 0:03:55,000
until the entire movie wraps.

78
0:03:56.319,000 --> 0:04:,000
Partway through one production, an animator drew a character

79
0:04:00.759,000 --> 0:04:04,000
with an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side.

80
0:04:04.76,000 --> 0:04:07,000
When the director saw that drawing, he thought it was great.

81
0:04:07.77,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It was beautiful, but he said,

82
0:04:09.199,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"You've got to lose it; it doesn't fit the character."

83
0:04:12.02,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Two weeks later, the director came back and said,

84
0:04:14.48,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"Let's put in those few seconds of film."

85
0:04:16.56,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Because that animator was allowed to share

86
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:22,000
what we referred to as his slice of genius,

87
0:04:22.8,000 --> 0:04:25,000
he was able to help that director reconceive the character

88
0:04:26.12,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in a subtle but important way that really improved the story.

89
0:04:30.759,000 --> 0:04:34,000
What we know is, at the heart of innovation is a paradox.

90
0:04:35.399,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You have to unleash the talents and passions of many people

91
0:04:39.079,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and you have to harness them into a work that is actually useful.

92
0:04:43.809,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Innovation is a journey.

93
0:04:46.049,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's a type of collaborative problem solving,

94
0:04:48.879,000 --> 0:04:5,000
usually among people who have different expertise

95
0:04:51.639,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and different points of view.

96
0:04:53.759,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Innovations rarely get created full-blown.

97
0:04:56.319,000 --> 0:04:58,000
As many of you know,

98
0:04:58.449,000 --> 0:05:,000
they're the result, usually, of trial and error.

99
0:05:01.199,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Lots of false starts, missteps and mistakes.

100
0:05:05.399,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Innovative work can be very exhilarating,

101
0:05:08.199,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but it also can be really downright scary.

102
0:05:13.73,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So when we look at why it is that Pixar is able to do what it does,

103
0:05:19.079,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we have to ask ourselves, what's going on here?

104
0:05:23.839,000 --> 0:05:25,000
For sure, history and certainly Hollywood,

105
0:05:26.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is full of star-studded teams that have failed.

106
0:05:29.93,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Most of those failures are attributed

107
0:05:31.79,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to too many stars or too many cooks, if you will, in the kitchen.

108
0:05:36.879,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So why is it that Pixar, with all of its cooks,

109
0:05:40.519,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is able to be so successful time and time again?

110
0:05:45.36,000 --> 0:05:48,000
When we studied an Islamic Bank in Dubai,

111
0:05:48.439,000 --> 0:05:52,000
or a luxury brand in Korea, or a social enterprise in Africa,

112
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we found that innovative organizations

113
0:05:55.079,000 --> 0:05:57,000
are communities that have three capabilities:

114
0:05:57.879,000 --> 0:06:02,000
creative abrasion, creative agility and creative resolution.

115
0:06:02.959,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Creative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas

116
0:06:07.96,000 --> 0:06:09,000
through debate and discourse.

117
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In innovative organizations, they amplify differences,

118
0:06:13.079,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they don't minimize them.

119
0:06:14.319,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Creative abrasion is not about brainstorming,

120
0:06:17.36,000 --> 0:06:19,000
where people suspend their judgment.

121
0:06:19.48,000 --> 0:06:22,000
No, they know how to have very heated but constructive arguments

122
0:06:23.439,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to create a portfolio of alternatives.

123
0:06:26.6,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Individuals in innovative organizations

124
0:06:28.879,000 --> 0:06:32,000
learn how to inquire, they learn how to actively listen, but guess what?

125
0:06:33.169,000 --> 0:06:35,000
They also learn how to advocate for their point of view.

126
0:06:35.959,000 --> 0:06:38,000
They understand that innovation rarely happens

127
0:06:39.879,000 --> 0:06:41,000
unless you have both diversity and conflict.

128
0:06:43.96,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas

129
0:06:48.76,000 --> 0:06:51,000
through quick pursuit, reflection and adjustment.

130
0:06:52.12,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's about discovery-driven learning

131
0:06:53.959,000 --> 0:06:56,000
where you act, as opposed to plan, your way to the future.

132
0:06:57.199,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination

133
0:07:00.68,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of the scientific method and the artistic process.

134
0:07:04.399,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's about running a series of experiments, and not a series of pilots.

135
0:07:08.879,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Experiments are usually about learning.

136
0:07:10.76,000 --> 0:07:11,000
When you get a negative outcome,

137
0:07:12.31,000 --> 0:07:15,000
you're still really learning something that you need to know.

138
0:07:15.472,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Pilots are often about being right.

139
0:07:17.959,000 --> 0:07:21,000
When they don't work, someone or something is to blame.

140
0:07:22.319,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The final capability is creative resolution.

141
0:07:25.279,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is about doing decision making

142
0:07:26.99,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas

143
0:07:30.519,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to reconfigure them in new combinations

144
0:07:33.04,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to produce a solution that is new and useful.

145
0:07:36.319,000 --> 0:07:39,000
When you look at innovative organizations, they never go along to get along.

146
0:07:40.12,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They don't compromise.

147
0:07:42.199,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They don't let one group or one individual dominate,

148
0:07:45.639,000 --> 0:07:49,000
even if it's the boss, even if it's the expert.

149
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Instead, they have developed

150
0:07:51.839,000 --> 0:07:54,000
a rather patient and more inclusive decision making process

151
0:07:55.399,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that allows for both/and solutions to arise

152
0:07:59.079,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and not simply either/or solutions.

153
0:08:01.879,000 --> 0:08:05,000
These three capabilities are why we see

154
0:08:05.879,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that Pixar is able to do what it does.

155
0:08:10.24,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Let me give you another example,

156
0:08:12.209,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and that example is the infrastructure group of Google.

157
0:08:14.839,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The infrastructure group of Google is the group

158
0:08:17.519,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that has to keep the website up and running 24/7.

159
0:08:21.569,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So when Google was about to introduce Gmail and YouTube,

160
0:08:25.439,000 --> 0:08:28,000
they knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate.

161
0:08:28.759,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time

162
0:08:32.919,000 --> 0:08:34,000
was a man named Bill Coughran.

163
0:08:35.48,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Bill and his leadership team, who he referred to as his brain trust,

164
0:08:39.24,000 --> 0:08:42,000
had to figure out what to do about this situation.

165
0:08:43.12,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They thought about it for a while.

166
0:08:44.96,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Instead of creating a group to tackle this task,

167
0:08:48.44,000 --> 0:08:52,000
they decided to allow groups to emerge spontaneously

168
0:08:52.72,000 --> 0:08:53,000
around different alternatives.

169
0:08:54.159,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Two groups coalesced.

170
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
One became known as Big Table,

171
0:09:00.159,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the other became known as Build It From Scratch.

172
0:09:03.679,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Big Table proposed that they build on the current system.

173
0:09:06.6,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Build It From Scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system.

174
0:09:10.96,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Separately, these two teams were allowed to work full-time

175
0:09:14.759,000 --> 0:09:16,000
on their particular approach.

176
0:09:16.799,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In engineering reviews, Bill described his role as,

177
0:09:19.919,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"Injecting honesty into the process by driving debate."

178
0:09:24.879,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Early on, the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could

179
0:09:28.879,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"bump them up against reality and discover for themselves

180
0:09:32.32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach."

181
0:09:35.12,000 --> 0:09:38,000
When Build It From Scratch shared their prototype with the group

182
0:09:38.14,000 --> 0:09:4,000
whose beepers would have to go off in the middle of the night

183
0:09:41.06,000 --> 0:09:43,000
if something went wrong with the website,

184
0:09:43.27,000 --> 0:09:47,000
they heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design.

185
0:09:48.12,000 --> 0:09:5,000
As the need for a solution became more urgent

186
0:09:51.039,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and as the data, or the evidence, began to come in,

187
0:09:54.32,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it became pretty clear that the Big Table solution

188
0:09:57.6,000 --> 0:09:59,000
was the right one for the moment.

189
0:10:00.11,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So they selected that one.

190
0:10:02.2,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But to make sure that they did not lose the learning

191
0:10:04.96,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of the Build it From Scratch team,

192
0:10:06.84,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging

193
0:10:10.25,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to work on the next-generation system.

194
0:10:13.24,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This whole process took nearly two years,

195
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but I was told that they were all working at breakneck speed.

196
0:10:21.399,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Early in that process, one of the engineers had gone to Bill and said,

197
0:10:24.72,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"We're all too busy for this inefficient system

198
0:10:27.759,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of running parallel experiments."

199
0:10:30.24,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But as the process unfolded, he began to understand

200
0:10:33.32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions.

201
0:10:37.24,000 --> 0:10:4,000
He admitted, "If you had forced us to all be on one team,

202
0:10:41.039,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we might have focused on proving who was right, and winning,

203
0:10:44.48,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for Google."

204
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Why is it that Pixar and Google are able to innovate time and again?

205
0:10:53.559,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's because they've mastered the capabilities required for that.

206
0:10:57.229,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They know how to do collaborative problem solving,

207
0:10:59.619,000 --> 0:11:01,000
they know how to do discovery-driven learning

208
0:11:01.759,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and they know how to do integrated decision making.

209
0:11:04.46,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Some of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now,

210
0:11:07.679,000 --> 0:11:09,000
"We don't know how to do those things in my organization.

211
0:11:10.519,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So why do they know how to do those things at Pixar,

212
0:11:13.12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and why do they know how to do those things at Google?"

213
0:11:16.559,000 --> 0:11:18,000
When many of the people that worked for Bill told us,

214
0:11:19.08,000 --> 0:11:25,000
in their opinion, that Bill was one of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley,

215
0:11:25.48,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we completely agreed; the man is a genius.

216
0:11:29.649,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Leadership is the secret sauce.

217
0:11:32.559,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But it's a different kind of leadership,

218
0:11:34.96,000 --> 0:11:39,000
not the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership.

219
0:11:40.29,000 --> 0:11:42,000
One of the leaders I met with early on said to me,

220
0:11:42.96,000 --> 0:11:45,000
"Linda, I don't read books on leadership.

221
0:11:46.12,000 --> 0:11:48,000
All they do is make me feel bad." (Laughter)

222
0:11:49.039,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"In the first chapter they say I'm supposed to create a vision.

223
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But if I'm trying to do something that's truly new, I have no answers.

224
0:11:56.24,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I don't know what direction we're going in

225
0:11:58.24,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and I'm not even sure I know how to figure out how to get there."

226
0:12:01.899,000 --> 0:12:03,000
For sure, there are times when visionary leadership

227
0:12:04.44,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is exactly what is needed.

228
0:12:06.48,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again,

229
0:12:09.879,000 --> 0:12:13,000
we must recast our understanding of what leadership is about.

230
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Leading innovation is about creating the space

231
0:12:17.72,000 --> 0:12:2,000
where people are willing and able to do the hard work

232
0:12:20.919,000 --> 0:12:22,000
of innovative problem solving.

233
0:12:23.399,000 --> 0:12:26,000
At this point, some of you may be wondering,

234
0:12:27.24,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"What does that leadership really look like?"

235
0:12:29.559,000 --> 0:12:33,000
At Pixar, they understand that innovation takes a village.

236
0:12:34.48,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The leaders focus on building a sense of community

237
0:12:37.919,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and building those three capabilities.

238
0:12:40.2,000 --> 0:12:42,000
How do they define leadership?

239
0:12:42.48,000 --> 0:12:44,000
They say leadership is about creating a world

240
0:12:44.759,000 --> 0:12:45,000
to which people want to belong.

241
0:12:46.72,000 --> 0:12:48,000
What kind of world do people want to belong in at Pixar?

242
0:12:49.36,000 --> 0:12:51,000
A world where you're living at the frontier.

243
0:12:51.44,000 --> 0:12:53,000
What do they focus their time on?

244
0:12:53.759,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Not on creating a vision.

245
0:12:55.23,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Instead they spend their time thinking about,

246
0:12:57.36,000 --> 0:13:01,000
"How do we design a studio that has the sensibility of a public square

247
0:13:02.2,000 --> 0:13:04,000
so that people will interact?

248
0:13:04.36,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Let's put in a policy that anyone, no matter what their level or role,

249
0:13:08.03,000 --> 0:13:09,000
is allowed to give notes to the director

250
0:13:09.96,000 --> 0:13:11,000
about how they feel about a particular film.

251
0:13:12.519,000 --> 0:13:14,000
What can we do to make sure

252
0:13:14.519,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that all the disruptors, all the minority voices in this organization,

253
0:13:18.399,000 --> 0:13:2,000
speak up and are heard?

254
0:13:20.399,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And, finally, let's bestow credit in a very generous way."

255
0:13:24.02,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a Pixar movie,

256
0:13:27.32,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but the babies born during a production are listed there.

257
0:13:30.48,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Laughter)

258
0:13:31.879,000 --> 0:13:34,000
How did Bill think about what his role was?

259
0:13:34.879,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Bill said, "I lead a volunteer organization.

260
0:13:38.36,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Talented people don't want to follow me anywhere.

261
0:13:42.12,000 --> 0:13:45,000
They want to cocreate with me the future.

262
0:13:45.679,000 --> 0:13:47,000
My job is to nurture the bottom-up

263
0:13:48.159,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and not let it degenerate into chaos."

264
0:13:51.519,000 --> 0:13:52,000
How did he see his role?

265
0:13:52.84,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"I'm a role model, I'm a human glue,

266
0:13:55.639,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I'm a connector, I'm an aggregator of viewpoints.

267
0:13:58.279,000 --> 0:14:,000
I'm never a dictator of viewpoints."

268
0:14:00.519,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Advice about how you exercise the role?

269
0:14:02.639,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Hire people who argue with you.

270
0:14:05.139,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And, guess what?

271
0:14:06.509,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Sometimes it's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague.

272
0:14:11.22,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Some of you may be wondering now,

273
0:14:12.969,000 --> 0:14:13,000
what are these people thinking?

274
0:14:14.84,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They're thinking,

275
0:14:15.85,000 --> 0:14:17,000
"I'm not the visionary, I'm the social architect.

276
0:14:18.84,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I'm creating the space where people are willing and able

277
0:14:22.44,000 --> 0:14:25,000
to share and combine their talents and passions."

278
0:14:25.789,000 --> 0:14:28,000
If some of you are worrying now that you don't work at a Pixar,

279
0:14:28.919,000 --> 0:14:29,000
or you don't work at a Google,

280
0:14:30.559,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I want to tell you there's still hope.

281
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We've studied many organizations

282
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that were really not organizations you'd think of

283
0:14:37.29,000 --> 0:14:39,000
as ones where a lot of innovation happens.

284
0:14:40.22,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company

285
0:14:43.279,000 --> 0:14:45,000
who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers,

286
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
19 competitors, to collaborate and innovate.

287
0:14:48.759,000 --> 0:14:51,000
We studied the head of marketing at a German automaker

288
0:14:52.609,000 --> 0:14:55,000
where, fundamentally, they believed that it was the design engineers,

289
0:14:55.89,000 --> 0:14:58,000
not the marketeers, who were allowed to be innovative.

290
0:14:59.009,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies,

291
0:15:03.12,000 --> 0:15:05,000
an Indian outsourcing company.

292
0:15:05.18,000 --> 0:15:06,000
When we met Vineet,

293
0:15:06.729,000 --> 0:15:09,000
his company was about, in his words, to become irrelevant.

294
0:15:10.08,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation.

295
0:15:16.6,000 --> 0:15:18,000
At HCL technologies, like at many companies,

296
0:15:19.56,000 --> 0:15:23,000
the leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction

297
0:15:23.72,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and making sure that no one deviated from it.

298
0:15:27.139,000 --> 0:15:31,000
What he did is tell them it was time for them

299
0:15:31.32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do.

300
0:15:34.74,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Because what was happening is that everybody was looking up

301
0:15:37.6,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and you weren't seeing the kind of bottom-up innovation

302
0:15:40.759,000 --> 0:15:42,000
we saw at Pixar or Google.

303
0:15:43.119,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So they began to work on that.

304
0:15:44.679,000 --> 0:15:48,000
They stopped giving answers, they stopped trying to provide solutions.

305
0:15:48.84,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Instead, what they did is they began to see

306
0:15:51.679,000 --> 0:15:54,000
the people at the bottom of the pyramid, the young sparks,

307
0:15:55.556,000 --> 0:15:57,000
the people who were closest to the customers,

308
0:15:58.03,000 --> 0:16:,000
as the source of innovation.

309
0:16:00.58,000 --> 0:16:03,000
They began to transfer the organization's growth

310
0:16:03.713,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to that level.

311
0:16:07.126,000 --> 0:16:1,000
In Vineet's language, this was about inverting the pyramid

312
0:16:10.879,000 --> 0:16:13,000
so that you could unleash the power of the many

313
0:16:13.919,000 --> 0:16:15,000
by loosening the stranglehold of the few,

314
0:16:16.84,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and increase the quality and the speed of innovation

315
0:16:19.96,000 --> 0:16:21,000
that was happening every day.

316
0:16:23.6,000 --> 0:16:26,000
For sure, Vineet and all the other leaders that we studied

317
0:16:27.389,000 --> 0:16:3,000
were in fact visionaries.

318
0:16:30.52,000 --> 0:16:34,000
For sure, they understood that that was not their role.

319
0:16:35.06,000 --> 0:16:4,000
So I don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize Ed.

320
0:16:40.24,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Because Ed, like Vineet, understands that our role as leaders

321
0:16:44.919,000 --> 0:16:48,000
is to set the stage, not perform on it.

322
0:16:49.08,000 --> 0:16:51,000
If we want to invent a better future,

323
0:16:51.96,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and I suspect that's why many of us are here,

324
0:16:55.24,000 --> 0:16:58,000
then we need to reimagine our task.

325
0:16:59.12,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Our task is to create the space

326
0:17:01.799,000 --> 0:17:03,000
where everybody's slices of genius

327
0:17:04.44,000 --> 0:17:08,000
can be unleashed and harnessed,

328
0:17:08.96,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and turned into works of collective genius.

329
0:17:11.72,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Thank you.

330
0:17:13.79,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Applause)

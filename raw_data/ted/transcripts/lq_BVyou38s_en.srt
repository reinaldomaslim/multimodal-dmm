1
0:00:12.577,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.

2
0:00:14.074,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I've always had stage fright,

3
0:00:15.567,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and not just a little bit,

4
0:00:17.395,000 --> 0:00:18,000
it's a big bit.

5
0:00:19.186,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And it didn't even matter until I was 27.

6
0:00:21.979,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That's when I started writing songs, and even then

7
0:00:24.537,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I only played them for myself.

8
0:00:26.339,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable.

9
0:00:30.084,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But after a couple of years, just writing songs wasn't enough.

10
0:00:32.891,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I had all these stories and ideas, and I wanted to share them with people,

11
0:00:35.91,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but physiologically, I couldn't do it.

12
0:00:39.216,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I had this irrational fear.

13
0:00:42.142,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,

14
0:00:44.301,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the more I wanted to perform.

15
0:00:45.491,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So on the week of my 30th birthday,

16
0:00:47.548,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I decided I was going to go to this local open mic,

17
0:00:50.501,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and put this fear behind me.

18
0:00:52.216,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Well, when I got there, it was packed.

19
0:00:55.073,000 --> 0:00:56,000
There were like 20 people there.

20
0:00:57.047,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

21
0:00:58.93,000 --> 0:01:,000
And they all looked angry.

22
0:01:01.537,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,

23
0:01:05.138,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I felt pretty good.

24
0:01:06.63,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,

25
0:01:09.691,000 --> 0:01:14,000
when my whole body rebelled, and this wave of anxiety just washed over me.

26
0:01:15.155,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, when you experience fear, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.

27
0:01:18.71,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So you have a rush of adrenaline, your heart rate increases,

28
0:01:21.553,000 --> 0:01:22,000
your breathing gets faster.

29
0:01:23.006,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Next your non-essential systems start to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter)

30
0:01:29.178,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities,

31
0:01:32.542,000 --> 0:01:34,000
so your fingers don't work anymore.

32
0:01:35.142,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract, your Spidey sense tingles,

33
0:01:38.274,000 --> 0:01:43,000
basically your whole body is trigger-happy. (Laughter)

34
0:01:43.448,000 --> 0:01:47,000
That condition is not conducive to performing folk music.

35
0:01:48.231,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.

37
0:01:52.432,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference

38
0:01:56.242,000 --> 0:01:58,000
between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers

39
0:01:58.614,000 --> 0:02:,000
on a Tuesday night open mic?

40
0:02:00.685,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:02.116,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I have never been more terrified -- until now.

42
0:02:06.173,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter and cheers)

43
0:02:15.248,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So then it was my turn,

44
0:02:17.757,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and somehow, I get myself onto the stage, I start my song,

45
0:02:20.843,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I open my mouth to sing the first line,

46
0:02:23.48,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and this completely horrible vibrato --

47
0:02:25.443,000 --> 0:02:27,000
you know, when your voice wavers -- comes streaming out.

48
0:02:27.93,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And this is not the good kind of vibrato, like an opera singer has,

49
0:02:30.543,000 --> 0:02:32,000
this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.

50
0:02:33.237,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I mean, it's a nightmare.

51
0:02:34.888,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I'm embarrassed, the audience is clearly uncomfortable,

52
0:02:37.356,000 --> 0:02:39,000
they're focused on my discomfort.

53
0:02:39.709,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It was so bad.

54
0:02:43.484,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter.

55
0:02:47.421,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And something good did happen -- I had the tiniest little glimpse

56
0:02:50.436,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of that audience connection that I was hoping for.

57
0:02:52.919,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And I wanted more. But I knew I had to get past this nervousness.

58
0:02:56.927,000 --> 0:02:59,000
That night I promised myself: I would go back every week

59
0:03:00.097,000 --> 0:03:01,000
until I wasn't nervous anymore.

60
0:03:02.032,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I did. I went back every single week,

61
0:03:04.915,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and sure enough, week after week,

62
0:03:08.73,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it didn't get any better. The same thing happened every week. (Laughter)

63
0:03:12.9,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I couldn't shake it.

64
0:03:14.848,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that's when I had an epiphany.

65
0:03:16.521,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And I remember it really well, because I don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter)

66
0:03:22.532,000 --> 0:03:25,000
All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness.

67
0:03:26.161,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That only seems authentic when I have stage fright,

68
0:03:28.283,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and the more nervous I was,

69
0:03:29.571,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the better the song would be. Easy.

70
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So I started writing a song about having stage fright.

71
0:03:36.989,000 --> 0:03:38,000
First, fessing up to the problem,

72
0:03:39.05,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the physical manifestations, how I would feel,

73
0:03:40.878,000 --> 0:03:41,000
how the listener might feel.

74
0:03:42.307,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And then accounting for things like my shaky voice,

75
0:03:44.915,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal,

76
0:03:47.847,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because I was nervous.

77
0:03:49.961,000 --> 0:03:52,000
By having a song that explained what was happening to me,

78
0:03:53.033,000 --> 0:03:54,000
while it was happening,

79
0:03:54.52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that gave the audience permission to think about it.

80
0:03:56.383,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous,

81
0:03:59.144,000 --> 0:04:,000
they could experience that with me,

82
0:04:00.862,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and we were all one big happy, nervous, uncomfortable family. (Laughter)

83
0:04:06.111,000 --> 0:04:1,000
By thinking about my audience, by embracing and exploiting my problem,

84
0:04:10.92,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I was able to take something that was blocking my progress,

85
0:04:13.855,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and turn it into something that was essential for my success.

86
0:04:17.792,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue

87
0:04:20.812,000 --> 0:04:21,000
right in the beginning of a performance.

88
0:04:22.63,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And then I could move on, and play the rest of my songs

89
0:04:24.174,000 --> 0:04:27,000
with just a little bit more ease.

90
0:04:27.428,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And eventually, over time, I didn't have to play the stage fright song at all.

91
0:04:33.704,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Except for when I was really nervous, like now. (Laughter)

92
0:04:40.945,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you?

93
0:04:43.67,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Applause)

94
0:04:52.753,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Can I have a sip of water?

95
0:04:55.715,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Music)

96
0:05:00.143,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Thank you.

97
0:05:07.442,000 --> 0:05:09,000

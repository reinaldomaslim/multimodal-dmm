1
0:00:25.23,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I can't help but this wish:

2
0:00:26.583,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you,

3
0:00:31.04,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"If a genie could give you one wish in the world,

4
0:00:33.652,000 --> 0:00:34,000
what would it be?"

5
0:00:35.183,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And I always answered,

6
0:00:36.596,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"Well, I'd want the wish

7
0:00:37.93,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for."

8
0:00:41.772,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Well, then you'd be screwed,

9
0:00:43.147,000 --> 0:00:46,000
because you'd know what to wish for, and you'd use up your wish,

10
0:00:46.186,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and now, since we only have one wish -- unlike last year they had three wishes --

11
0:00:50.033,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'm not going to wish for that.

12
0:00:51.543,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So let's get to what I would like, which is world peace.

13
0:00:56.57,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And I know what you're thinking:

14
0:00:58.626,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You're thinking, "The poor girl up there,

15
0:01:00.614,000 --> 0:01:01,000
she thinks she's at a beauty pageant.

16
0:01:02.415,000 --> 0:01:04,000
She's not. She's at the TED Prize."

17
0:01:04.69,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:07.824,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But I really do think it makes sense.

19
0:01:10.244,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I think that the first step to world peace

20
0:01:12.863,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is for people to meet each other.

21
0:01:14.707,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I've met a lot of different people over the years,

22
0:01:17.219,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I've filmed some of them,

23
0:01:18.645,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world,

24
0:01:23.565,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to a military press officer in Qatar,

25
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
who would rather not take over the world.

26
0:01:28.529,000 --> 0:01:3,000
If you've seen the film "Control Room" that was sent out,

27
0:01:31.238,000 --> 0:01:32,000
you'd understand a little bit why.

28
0:01:32.887,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Applause)

29
0:01:34.062,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Thank you.

30
0:01:35.244,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Wow! Some of you watched it. That's great. That's great.

31
0:01:38.54,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So basically what I'd like to talk about today

32
0:01:43.134,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is a way for people to travel,

33
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to meet people in a different way than --

34
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because you can't travel all over the world at the same time.

35
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And a long time ago -- well, about 40 years ago --

36
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
my mom had an exchange student.

37
0:02:01.897,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student.

38
0:02:04.739,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is Donna.

39
0:02:05.914,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.

40
0:02:09.446,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike.

41
0:02:13.538,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is Donna eating ice cream.

42
0:02:16.284,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance.

43
0:02:22.882,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I really think as the world is getting smaller,

44
0:02:25.123,000 --> 0:02:26,000
it becomes more and more important

45
0:02:26.79,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that we learn each other's dance moves,

46
0:02:28.676,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that we meet each other, we get to know each other,

47
0:02:31.106,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we are able to figure out a way to cross borders,

48
0:02:34.769,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to understand each other, to understand people's hopes and dreams,

49
0:02:37.917,000 --> 0:02:38,000
what makes them laugh and cry.

50
0:02:39.397,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I know that we can't all do exchange programs,

51
0:02:42.442,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and I can't force everybody to travel;

52
0:02:44.291,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I've already talked about that to Chris and Amy,

53
0:02:46.634,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and they said that there's a problem with this:

54
0:02:48.86,000 --> 0:02:49,000
You can't force people, free will.

55
0:02:50.619,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I totally support that, so we're not forcing people to travel.

56
0:02:53.75,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But I'd like to talk about another way to travel

57
0:02:56.028,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that doesn't require a ship or an airplane,

58
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen.

59
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.

60
0:03:08.857,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from,

61
0:03:13.612,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and Cameron, I don't know how you managed to get out of that one,

62
0:03:16.739,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but I think that building bridges is important to me

63
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because of where I come from.

64
0:03:23.171,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I'm the daughter of an American mother

65
0:03:26.574,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.

66
0:03:29.709,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together.

67
0:03:33.805,000 --> 0:03:34,000
No pun intended.

68
0:03:34.981,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:36.012,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And I've also been called,

70
0:03:37.293,000 --> 0:03:39,000
as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American with a Persian name,

71
0:03:40.166,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the "Middle East Peace Crisis."

72
0:03:42.08,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way

73
0:03:46.58,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to bring both sides of my family together --

74
0:03:50.056,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a way to take the worlds with me, a way to tell stories visually.

75
0:03:55.453,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It all kind of started that way,

76
0:03:57.073,000 --> 0:04:,000
but I think that I really realized the power of the image

77
0:04:00.693,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when I first went to the garbage-collecting village

78
0:04:03.929,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in Egypt, when I was about 16.

79
0:04:06.326,000 --> 0:04:08,000
My mother took me there.

80
0:04:08.905,000 --> 0:04:1,000
She's somebody who believes strongly in community service,

81
0:04:11.688,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and decided that this was something that I needed to do.

82
0:04:14.355,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And so I went there and I met some amazing women there.

83
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
There was a center there,

84
0:04:20.954,000 --> 0:04:23,000
where they were teaching people how to read and write,

85
0:04:24.016,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and get vaccinations against the many diseases

86
0:04:26.254,000 --> 0:04:28,000
you can get from sorting through garbage.

87
0:04:28.373,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And I began teaching there.

88
0:04:29.962,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I taught English, and I met some incredible women there.

89
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I met people that live seven people to a room,

90
0:04:37.812,000 --> 0:04:39,000
barely can afford their evening meal,

91
0:04:40.168,000 --> 0:04:43,000
yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor

92
0:04:43.715,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and just incredible qualities.

93
0:04:46.421,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there.

94
0:04:50.199,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I took pictures of weddings and older family members --

95
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
things that they wanted memories of.

96
0:05:00.141,000 --> 0:05:03,000
About two years after I started taking these pictures,

97
0:05:03.57,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the UN Conference on Population and Development

98
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
asked me to show them at the conference.

99
0:05:10.92,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So I was 18; I was very excited.

100
0:05:13.892,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there,

101
0:05:19.273,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and after about two days, they all came down except for three.

102
0:05:25.789,000 --> 0:05:26,000
People were very upset,

103
0:05:27.663,000 --> 0:05:3,000
very angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo,

104
0:05:31.297,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame?

105
0:05:34.778,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And as I sat there, I got very depressed.

106
0:05:37.039,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs

107
0:05:42.661,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that were, you know, very pretty photographs

108
0:05:46.939,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and I was like, "I failed at this."

109
0:05:49.854,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling

110
0:05:55.001,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that had come out of people just seeing these photographs.

111
0:05:58.478,000 --> 0:06:,000
Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak that nobody listened to,

112
0:06:01.483,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and all of a sudden, I put these photographs on the wall,

113
0:06:04.285,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and there were arguments, and they had to be taken down.

114
0:06:06.941,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And I saw the power of the image, and it was incredible.

115
0:06:10.313,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually from people

116
0:06:14.171,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves,

117
0:06:17.07,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive

118
0:06:19.959,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in such difficult circumstances.

119
0:06:22.067,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And I think it was at that point

120
0:06:23.623,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that I decided I wanted to use photography and film

121
0:06:27.909,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to somehow bridge gaps, to bridge cultures,

122
0:06:30.375,000 --> 0:06:32,000
bring people together, cross borders.

123
0:06:35.713,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And so that's what really kind of started me off.

124
0:06:39.373,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Did a stint at MTV, made a film called "Startup.com,"

125
0:06:42.702,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and I've done a couple of music films.

126
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start,

127
0:06:54.465,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it was a very surreal feeling for me,

128
0:06:56.701,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because before the war started,

129
0:06:58.601,000 --> 0:07:,000
there was kind of this media war that was going on.

130
0:07:01.037,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And I was watching television in New York,

131
0:07:03.077,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across,

132
0:07:06.738,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and the coverage went from the US State Department

133
0:07:11.589,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to embedded troops.

134
0:07:14.087,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And what was coming across on the news

135
0:07:16.731,000 --> 0:07:2,000
was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings,

136
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators,

137
0:07:24.798,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad.

138
0:07:28.098,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And I knew that there was a completely other story

139
0:07:30.995,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that was taking place in the Middle East, where my parents were.

140
0:07:34.037,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I knew that there was a completely other story being told,

141
0:07:37.126,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and I was thinking, "How are people supposed to communicate with each other

142
0:07:40.682,000 --> 0:07:42,000
when they're getting completely different messages,

143
0:07:43.099,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and nobody knows what the other's being told?

144
0:07:45.23,000 --> 0:07:48,000
How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding

145
0:07:48.271,000 --> 0:07:5,000
or know how to move together into the future?

146
0:07:50.93,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So I knew that I had to go there.

147
0:07:53.202,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I just wanted to be in the center.

148
0:07:55.266,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I had no plan. I had no funding.

149
0:07:57.791,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I didn't even have a camera at the time -- I had somebody bring it there,

150
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera,

151
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:06,000
George Bush's favorite channel,

152
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked

153
0:08:12.265,000 --> 0:08:14,000
by many governments across the Arab world,

154
0:08:14.78,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden

155
0:08:18.406,000 --> 0:08:2,000
by some people in the US government.

156
0:08:20.611,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So I was thinking, this station that's hated by so many people

157
0:08:24.909,000 --> 0:08:25,000
has to be doing something right.

158
0:08:26.466,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I've got to go see what this is all about.

159
0:08:29.999,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And I also wanted to go see Central Command,

160
0:08:32.12,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which was 10 minutes away.

161
0:08:33.688,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And that way, I could get access to how this news was being created --

162
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,

163
0:08:41.232,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and on the US and Western side, reaching the US.

164
0:08:44.015,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And when I went there and sat there,

165
0:08:45.78,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and met these people that were in the center of it,

166
0:08:48.861,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and sat with these characters,

167
0:08:52.491,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I met some surprising, very complex people.

168
0:08:56.792,000 --> 0:09:,000
And I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience

169
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of when you sit with somebody

170
0:09:02.498,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and you film them, and you listen to them,

171
0:09:04.546,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and you allow them more than a five-second sound bite.

172
0:09:08.314,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The amazing complexity of people emerges.

173
0:09:16.701,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Samir Khader: Business as usual.

174
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.

175
0:09:25.897,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But between us, if I'm offered a job with Fox, I'll take it.

176
0:09:35.977,000 --> 0:09:39,000
To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream.

177
0:09:45.979,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I still have that dream.

178
0:09:48.229,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Maybe I will never be able to do it,

179
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but I have plans for my children.

180
0:09:55.524,000 --> 0:09:56,000
When they finish high school,

181
0:09:56.938,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I will send them to America to study there.

182
0:09:58.978,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I will pay for their study.

183
0:10:01.641,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And they will stay there.

184
0:10:10.175,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Josh Rushing: The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers --

185
0:10:14.052,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Al Jazeera showed them --

186
0:10:15.292,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it was powerful, because America doesn't show those kinds of images.

187
0:10:18.52,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Most of the news in America won't show really gory images

188
0:10:21.229,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and this showed American soldiers in uniform, strewn about a floor,

189
0:10:24.428,000 --> 0:10:25,000
a cold tile floor.

190
0:10:25.627,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And it was revolting.

191
0:10:28.387,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It was absolutely revolting.

192
0:10:29.897,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It made me sick at my stomach.

193
0:10:31.373,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And then what hit me was, the night before,

194
0:10:34.723,000 --> 0:10:37,000
there had been some kind of bombing in Basra,

195
0:10:38.342,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and Al Jazeera had shown images of the people.

196
0:10:43.182,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And they were equally, if not more, horrifying -- the images were.

197
0:10:47.4,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office,

198
0:10:50.039,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and thought to myself, "Wow, that's gross.

199
0:10:53.252,000 --> 0:10:54,000
That's bad."

200
0:10:55.067,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And then going away, and probably eating dinner or something.

201
0:10:58.001,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And it didn't affect me as much.

202
0:10:59.628,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So, the impact that had on me --

203
0:11:02.475,000 --> 0:11:05,000
me realizing that I just saw people on the other side,

204
0:11:06.157,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and those people in the Al Jazeera office

205
0:11:08.993,000 --> 0:11:1,000
must have felt the way I was feeling that night,

206
0:11:11.304,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and it upset me on a profound level

207
0:11:14.447,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before.

208
0:11:18.65,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It makes me hate war.

209
0:11:20.65,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world

210
0:11:23.252,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that can live without war yet.

211
0:11:24.787,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed by the response of the film.

212
0:11:27.904,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We didn't know whether it would be able to get out there.

213
0:11:30.611,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We had no funding for it.

214
0:11:31.851,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We were incredibly lucky that it got picked up.

215
0:11:36.053,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And when we showed the film

216
0:11:38.558,000 --> 0:11:4,000
in both the United States and the Arab world,

217
0:11:41.258,000 --> 0:11:43,000
we had such incredible reactions.

218
0:11:43.399,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film.

219
0:11:46.431,000 --> 0:11:48,000
In the Arab world --

220
0:11:48.618,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and it's not really by the film, it's by the characters --

221
0:11:51.479,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I mean, Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person

222
0:11:55.534,000 --> 0:11:56,000
who was thinking about things.

223
0:11:57.085,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And when I showed the film in the Middle East,

224
0:11:59.378,000 --> 0:12:01,000
people wanted to meet Josh.

225
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
He kind of redefined us as an American population.

226
0:12:05.894,000 --> 0:12:09,000
People started to ask me, "Where is this guy now?"

227
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Al Jazeera offered him a job.

228
0:12:12.023,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Laughter)

229
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And Samir, on the other hand,

230
0:12:16.274,000 --> 0:12:19,000
was also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see,

231
0:12:19.632,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because it brought out the complexities of this love-hate relationship

232
0:12:23.313,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that the Arab world has with the West.

233
0:12:26.257,000 --> 0:12:31,000
In the United States, I was blown away by the motivations,

234
0:12:31.472,000 --> 0:12:33,000
the positive motivations of the American people

235
0:12:34.32,000 --> 0:12:36,000
when they'd see this film.

236
0:12:36.414,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You know, we're criticized abroad

237
0:12:38.033,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way,

238
0:12:41.548,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but the flip side of it is that, actually,

239
0:12:44.891,000 --> 0:12:46,000
when people do see what is happening abroad

240
0:12:47.249,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad,

241
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:52,000
we feel this power, that we need to --

242
0:12:52.294,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we feel like we have to get the power to change things.

243
0:12:54.913,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And I saw this with audiences.

244
0:12:56.492,000 --> 0:12:59,000
This woman came up to me after the screening and said,

245
0:13:00.272,000 --> 0:13:01,000
"You know, I know this is crazy.

246
0:13:01.889,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes,

247
0:13:03.936,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I saw the military going out to war,

248
0:13:05.699,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but you don't understand people's anger towards us

249
0:13:08.085,000 --> 0:13:12,000
until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war,

250
0:13:12.272,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and how do we get out of this bubble?

251
0:13:14.241,000 --> 0:13:17,000
How do we understand what the other person is thinking?"

252
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Now, I don't know whether a film can change the world.

253
0:13:23.095,000 --> 0:13:25,000
But I know the power of it,

254
0:13:25.596,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world.

255
0:13:29.613,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Now, I'm not a philosopher,

256
0:13:31.327,000 --> 0:13:33,000
so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this,

257
0:13:34.209,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world.

258
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders,

259
0:13:42.124,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes

Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater,

346

in a dark room, with other strangers, watching a very powerful film,

347
0:19:14.308,000 --> 0:19:16,000
and they felt that feeling of transformation.

348
0:19:17.34,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And what I'd like to talk about is

349
0:19:20.316,000 --> 0:19:22,000
how can we use that feeling

350
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:26,000
to actually create a movement through film?

351
0:19:27.837,000 --> 0:19:31,000
I've been listening to the talks in the conference,

352
0:19:32.382,000 --> 0:19:34,000
and Robert Wright said yesterday

353
0:19:34.461,000 --> 0:19:37,000
that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity,

354
0:19:38.053,000 --> 0:19:4,000
then they will have an appreciation for ours.

355
0:19:40.609,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And that's what this is about.

356
0:19:42.431,000 --> 0:19:44,000
It's about connecting people through film,

357
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:47,000
getting these independent voices out there.

358
0:19:48.4,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Now, Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military

359
0:19:53.208,000 --> 0:19:55,000
and taking a job with Al Jazeera.

360
0:19:55.279,000 --> 0:19:56,000
(Laughter)

361
0:19:56.596,000 --> 0:19:59,000
So his feeling is that he's at Al Jazeera International

362
0:20:00.207,000 --> 0:20:02,000
because he feels like he can actually use media

363
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:05,000
to bridge the gap between East and West.

364
0:20:06.415,000 --> 0:20:07,000
And that's an amazing thing.

365
0:20:08.408,000 --> 0:20:1,000
But I've been trying to think about ways

366
0:20:11.264,000 --> 0:20:13,000
to give power to these independent voices,

367
0:20:13.948,000 --> 0:20:14,000
to give power to the filmmakers,

368
0:20:15.565,000 --> 0:20:19,000
to give power to people who are trying to use film for change.

369
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:21,000
And there are incredible organizations

370
0:20:21.873,000 --> 0:20:23,000
that are out there doing this already.

371
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:26,000
There's Witness, that you heard from earlier.

372
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:3,000
There's Just Vision, that are working with Palestinians and Israelis

373
0:20:30.594,000 --> 0:20:33,000
who are working together for peace, and documenting that process

374
0:20:33.95,000 --> 0:20:35,000
and getting interviews out there and using this film

375
0:20:36.75,000 --> 0:20:38,000
to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool,

376
0:20:39.722,000 --> 0:20:43,000
to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack,

377
0:20:44.285,000 --> 0:20:47,000
and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this.

378
0:20:47.435,000 --> 0:20:5,000
There's Working Films and there's Current TV,

379
0:20:51.269,000 --> 0:20:54,000
which is an incredible platform for people around the world

380
0:20:54.6,000 --> 0:20:55,000
to be able to put their --

381

382
0:20:56.9,000 --> 0:20:57,000

383
0:20:58.075,000 --> 0:21:01,000
I've watched it and I'm blown away by it

384
0:21:01.526,000 --> 0:21:04,000
and its potential to bring voices from around the world --

385
0:21:04.834,000 --> 0:21:06,000
independent voices from around the world --

386
0:21:06.866,000 --> 0:21:09,000
and create a truly democratic, global television.

387
0:21:10.326,000 --> 0:21:13,000
So what can we do to create a platform for these organizations,

388
0:21:14.101,000 --> 0:21:15,000
to create some momentum,

389
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
to get everybody in the world involved in this movement?

390
0:21:21.494,000 --> 0:21:24,000
I'd like for us to imagine for a second.

391
0:21:26.198,000 --> 0:21:32,000
Imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world.

392
0:21:33.8,000 --> 0:21:39,000
You have towns and villages and theaters --

393
0:21:40.732,000 --> 0:21:42,000
all from around the world,

394
0:21:43.31,000 --> 0:21:45,000
getting together, and sitting in the dark,

395
0:21:46.073,000 --> 0:21:5,000
and sharing a communal experience of watching a film,

396
0:21:50.597,000 --> 0:21:52,000
or a couple of films, together.

397
0:21:54,000 --> 0:21:59,000
Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live,

398
0:21:59.506,000 --> 0:22:02,000
or just a character that defies stereotypes,

399
0:22:02.704,000 --> 0:22:04,000
makes a joke, sings a song.

400
0:22:04.797,000 --> 0:22:06,000
Comedies, documentaries, shorts.

401
0:22:07.1,000 --> 0:22:09,000
This amazing power can be used to change people

402
0:22:09.803,000 --> 0:22:11,000
and to bond people together; to cross borders,

403
0:22:12.651,000 --> 0:22:15,000
and have people feel like they're having a communal experience.

404
0:22:16.19,000 --> 0:22:18,000
So if you imagine this day when all around the world,

405
0:22:19.16,000 --> 0:22:24,000
you have theaters and places where we project films.

406
0:22:24.703,000 --> 0:22:27,000
If you imagine projecting from Times Square

407
0:22:28.322,000 --> 0:22:3,000
to Tahrir Square in Cairo,

408
0:22:31.124,000 --> 0:22:34,000
the same film in Ramallah, the same film in Jerusalem.

409
0:22:34.824,000 --> 0:22:37,000
You know, we've been talking to a friend of mine

410
0:22:38.148,000 --> 0:22:4,000
about using the side of the Great Pyramid

411
0:22:40.846,000 --> 0:22:41,000
and the Great Wall of China.

412
0:22:45.175,000 --> 0:22:47,000
It's endless what you can imagine,

413
0:22:48,000 --> 0:22:5,000
in terms of where you can project films

414
0:22:50.136,000 --> 0:22:52,000
and where you can have this communal experience.

415
0:22:52.884,000 --> 0:22:55,000
And I believe that this one day, if we can create it,

416
0:22:56,000 --> 0:23:,000
this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices.

417
0:23:00.375,000 --> 0:23:05,000
There isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices

418
0:23:05.428,000 --> 0:23:06,000
of the world to get out there,

419
0:23:07,000 --> 0:23:09,000
and yet I'm hearing throughout this conference

420
0:23:09.204,000 --> 0:23:11,000
that the biggest challenge in our future

421
0:23:11.258,000 --> 0:23:12,000
is understanding the other,

422
0:23:12.894,000 --> 0:23:15,000
and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders.

423
0:23:16.851,000 --> 0:23:17,000
And if film can do that,

424
0:23:18.748,000 --> 0:23:21,000
and if we can get all of these different locations in the world

425
0:23:21.95,000 --> 0:23:23,000
to watch these films together --

426
0:23:24.578,000 --> 0:23:26,000
this could be an incredible day.

427
0:23:27.226,000 --> 0:23:3,000
So we've already made a partnership,

428
0:23:30.564,000 --> 0:23:33,000
set up through somebody from the TED community,

429
0:23:34.477,000 --> 0:23:36,000
John Camen, who introduced me to Steven Apkon,

430
0:23:37.371,000 --> 0:23:39,000
from the Jacob Burns Film Center.

431
0:23:4,000 --> 0:23:41,000
And we started calling up everybody.

432
0:23:41.914,000 --> 0:23:42,000
And in the last week,

433
0:23:43.297,000 --> 0:23:46,000
there have been so many people that have responded to us,

434
0:23:47,000 --> 0:23:51,000
from as close as Palo Alto, to Mongolia and to India.

435
0:23:52,000 --> 0:23:56,000
There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film;

436
0:23:56.58,000 --> 0:23:59,000
to be able to provide a platform for independent voices

437
0:24:,000 --> 0:24:02,000
and independent films to get out there.

438
0:24:04.183,000 --> 0:24:07,000
Now, we've thought about a name for this day,

439
0:24:07.87,000 --> 0:24:09,000
and I'd like to share this with you.

440
0:24:10.353,000 --> 0:24:12,000
Now, the most amazing part of this whole process

441
0:24:12.638,000 --> 0:24:15,000
has been sharing ideas and wishes,

442
0:24:15.99,000 --> 0:24:17,000
and so I invite you to give brainstorms onto

443
0:24:19,000 --> 0:24:22,000
how does this day echo into the future?

444
0:24:22.545,000 --> 0:24:26,000
How do we use technology to make this day echo into the future,

445
0:24:27.3,000 --> 0:24:28,000
so that we can build community

446
0:24:29,000 --> 0:24:33,000
and have these communities working together, through the Internet?

447
0:24:34.151,000 --> 0:24:36,000
There was a time, many, many years ago,

448
0:24:36.714,000 --> 0:24:38,000
when all of the continents were stuck together.

449
0:24:39.925,000 --> 0:24:41,000
And we call that landmass Pangea.

450
0:24:42.894,000 --> 0:24:46,000
So what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day.

451
0:24:48.614,000 --> 0:24:49,000
And if you just imagine

452
0:24:50.137,000 --> 0:24:53,000
that all of these people in these towns would be watching,

453
0:24:53.644,000 --> 0:24:56,000
then I think that we can actually really make a movement

454
0:24:57.657,000 --> 0:24:59,000
towards people understanding each other better.

455
0:25:,000 --> 0:25:03,000
I know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls,

456
0:25:03.843,000 --> 0:25:05,000
but the only way that I know how to do it,

457
0:25:05.9,000 --> 0:25:09,000
the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul

458
0:25:10.509,000 --> 0:25:12,000
all across the world, is by showing them a film.

459
0:25:13.04,000 --> 0:25:16,000
And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there

460
0:25:16.425,000 --> 0:25:18,000
that can really make this happen.

461
0:25:19.072,000 --> 0:25:2,000
And that's my wish.

462
0:25:21.154,000 --> 0:25:25,000
I guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish,

463
0:25:25.625,000 --> 0:25:26,000

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Have you ever wondered

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
what is inside your dental plaque?

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Probably not, but people like me do.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm an archeological geneticist

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
at the University of Zurich,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
by conducting genetic research

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And through this work, I hope to better understand

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies,

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
so that we can improve

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and better manage our health in the future.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
There are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and one way is to extract human DNA

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
from ancient bones.

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And from these extracts,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and look for changes that might be related to adaptations,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
risk factors and inherited diseases.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But this is only one half of the story.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The most important health challenges today

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
are not caused by simple mutations in our genome,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
between genetic variation,

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
diet, microbes and parasites

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and our immune response.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
All of these diseases

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
have a strong evolutionary component

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that directly relates to the fact

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that we live today in a very different environment

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
than the ones in which our bodies evolved.

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And in order to understand these diseases,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we need to move past studies of the human genome alone

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and towards a more holistic approach

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to human health in the past.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But there are a lot of challenges for this.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And first of all, what do we even study?

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Skeletons are ubiquitous; they're found all over the place.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But of course, all of the soft tissue has decomposed,

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and the skeleton itself

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
has limited health information.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Mummies are a great source of information,

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
except that they're really geographically limited

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and limited in time as well.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Coprolites are fossilized human feces,

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and they're actually extremely interesting.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease,

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but they are very rare.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So to address this problem,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I put together a team of international researchers

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in Switzerland, Denmark and the U.K.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to study a very poorly studied, little known material

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that's found on people everywhere.

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's a type of fossilized dental plaque

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that is called officially dental calculus.

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Many of you may know it by the term tartar.

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's what the dentist cleans off your teeth

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
every time that you go in for a visit.

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And in a typical dentistry visit,

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed.

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But in ancient times before tooth brushing,

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
over a lifetime.

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And what's really important about dental calculus

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton,

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it's abundant in quantity before the present day

69
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and it's ubiquitous worldwide.

70
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We find it in every population around the world at all time periods

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
going back tens of thousands of years.

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And we even find it in neanderthals and animals.

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And so previous studies

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
had only focused on microscopy.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope,

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and what they had found was things like pollen

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and plant starches,

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and they'd found muscle cells from animal meats

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and bacteria.

80
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And so what my team of researchers, what we wanted to do,

81
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is say, can we apply

82
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
genetic and proteomic technology

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to go after DNA and proteins,

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to really understand what's going on?

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And what we found

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth.

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We also have found immune proteins

90
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
related to infection and inflammation

91
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and proteins and DNA related to diet.

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But what was surprising to us, and also quite exciting,

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is we also found bacteria

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems.

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So it gives us virtual access to the lungs,

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which is where many important diseases reside.

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And we also found bacteria

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that normally inhabit the gut.

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And so we can also now virtually gain access

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to this even more distant organ system

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that, from the skeleton alone,

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
has long decomposed.

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and protein mass spectrometry technologies

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to ancient dental calculus,

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we can generate immense quantities of data

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of the dynamic interplay

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
between diet, infection and immunity

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
thousands of years ago.

111
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So what started out as an idea,

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is now being implemented

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to churn out millions of sequences

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that we can use to investigate

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease,

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens.

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And from this information

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
we can learn about how pathogens evolve

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and also why they continue to make us sick.

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And I hope I have convinced you

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of the value of dental calculus.

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And as a final parting thought,

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
on behalf of future archeologists,

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I would like to ask you to please think twice

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
before you go home and brush your teeth.

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Applause)

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Thank you.

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Applause)

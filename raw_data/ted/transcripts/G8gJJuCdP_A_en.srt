1
0:00:12.644,000 --> 0:00:13,000
OK, so, confession:

2
0:00:14.502,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising.

3
0:00:20.238,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons,

4
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
paying more attention to the commercials

5
0:00:25.487,000 --> 0:00:26,000
than to the shows,

6
0:00:26.818,000 --> 0:00:29,000
trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head.

7
0:00:29.932,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.

8
0:00:32.035,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I became a partner at a big New York ad agency.

9
0:00:35.337,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997,

10
0:00:41.55,000 --> 0:00:44,000
when my little brother Matt was shot in the head

11
0:00:44.922,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in a shooting that happened on the observation deck

12
0:00:47.771,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of the Empire State Building.

13
0:00:49.911,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Suddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare,

14
0:00:55.097,000 --> 0:00:59,000
being told that my brother was going to die,

15
0:00:59.251,000 --> 0:01:02,000
actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him,

16
0:01:02.951,000 --> 0:01:04,000
then several emergency brain surgeries

17
0:01:05.325,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and now what's amounted, for Matt,

18
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury.

19
0:01:14.27,000 --> 0:01:16,000
He is definitely my hero.

20
0:01:17.101,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But as much as (Applause) -- yeah, deserves it --

21
0:01:19.467,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Applause)

22
0:01:24.597,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family,

23
0:01:30.224,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I often think about how much worse it could have been;

24
0:01:32.799,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day

25
0:01:37.882,000 --> 0:01:38,000
who aren't as fortunate,

26
0:01:39.786,000 --> 0:01:45,000
who lose loved ones -- brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents.

27
0:01:46.018,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They don't all make national headlines.

28
0:01:48.543,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In fact, most of them don't.

29
0:01:50.209,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They go largely unnoticed,

30
0:01:52.305,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic

31
0:01:58.928,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as some kind of new normal.

32
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So I quit my job in advertising

33
0:02:05.17,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic,

34
0:02:10.296,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because I came to realize

35
0:02:11.517,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that the challenges to preventing gun violence

36
0:02:14.654,000 --> 0:02:17,000
are actually the same ones that made me love advertising,

37
0:02:18.343,000 --> 0:02:2,000
which is to try to figure out how to engage people.

38
0:02:20.85,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Only instead of doing it to sell products,

39
0:02:23.477,000 --> 0:02:24,000
doing it to save lives.

40
0:02:25.726,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And that comes down to finding common ground,

41
0:02:30.673,000 --> 0:02:34,000
where what I want overlaps with what you want.

42
0:02:34.706,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence,

43
0:02:37.936,000 --> 0:02:39,000
just how much common ground there is.

44
0:02:40.007,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Let's look, for example, at people who love to hunt,

45
0:02:43.016,000 --> 0:02:46,000
a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.

46
0:02:46.222,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's a proud tradition. Families.

47
0:02:48.886,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In some places,

48
0:02:50.064,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday.

49
0:02:53.821,000 --> 0:02:54,000
What do hunters want?

50
0:02:55.285,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Well, they want to hunt. They love their guns.

51
0:02:57.657,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They believe deeply

52
0:02:58.881,000 --> 0:03:,000
in the Second Amendment right to own those guns.

53
0:03:01.397,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.

54
0:03:03.7,000 --> 0:03:04,000
In fact, there's a lot of it,

55
0:03:05.152,000 --> 0:03:1,000
starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.

56
0:03:10.58,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people.

57
0:03:15.418,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It's about keeping all guns away from certain people,

58
0:03:18.318,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns:

59
0:03:21.807,000 --> 0:03:23,000
convicted violent criminals, domestic abusers,

60
0:03:24.311,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the dangerously mentally ill.

61
0:03:27.205,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We can all appreciate

62
0:03:28.38,000 --> 0:03:3,000
how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective

63
0:03:31.311,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands.

64
0:03:33.603,000 --> 0:03:37,000
In 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers

65
0:03:38.034,000 --> 0:03:41,000
have blocked 2.4 million gun sales

66
0:03:41.823,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.

67
0:03:45.463,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:49.41,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate

69
0:03:53.631,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day

70
0:03:56.831,000 --> 0:03:57,000
at guns shows or online

71
0:03:58.701,000 --> 0:03:59,000
without those Brady background checks,

72
0:04:00.584,000 --> 0:04:03,000
just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane --

73
0:04:03.608,000 --> 0:04:05,000
one with security and one with no security.

74
0:04:06.256,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And --

75
0:04:07.431,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Applause)

76
0:04:10.957,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public:

77
0:04:14.744,000 --> 0:04:18,000
90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks

78
0:04:19.051,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to all gun sales -- including 90 percent of Republicans,

79
0:04:21.709,000 --> 0:04:22,000
more than 80 percent of gun owners,

80
0:04:23.653,000 --> 0:04:25,000
more than 70 percent of NRA members.

81
0:04:25.929,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is not a controversial idea.

82
0:04:27.867,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees.

83
0:04:31.467,000 --> 0:04:33,000
That's about the percentage of the American public

84
0:04:33.856,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that believes the moon landing was a fake.

85
0:04:36.069,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:37.458,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And it's also about the percentage that believes the government

87
0:04:40.454,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals.

88
0:04:44.437,000 --> 0:04:46,000
That's the extent to which we agree about background checks.

89
0:04:47.288,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But what about the 300 million guns

90
0:04:50.86,000 --> 0:04:52,000
already out there in homes across America?

91
0:04:53.28,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Well first, it's important to realize

92
0:04:55.074,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes

93
0:04:59.436,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of decent, law-abiding people like you and me,

94
0:05:02.4,000 --> 0:05:06,000
who want what we all want -- including keeping our families safe.

95
0:05:06.695,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns.

96
0:05:10.704,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Ten years ago, 42 percent of the American public

97
0:05:15.063,000 --> 0:05:19,000
believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun makes your home safer.

98
0:05:19.364,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Today, that number is 63 percent.

99
0:05:23.784,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Why?

100
0:05:24.96,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I kind of hate to say it,

101
0:05:26.182,000 --> 0:05:28,000
because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising,

102
0:05:28.796,000 --> 0:05:3,000
which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times,

103
0:05:31.248,000 --> 0:05:32,000
eventually that lie becomes the truth.

104
0:05:33.113,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And that's exactly what's happened here.

105
0:05:35.084,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars

106
0:05:37.65,000 --> 0:05:4,000
blocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic

107
0:05:40.999,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of gun violence;

108
0:05:42.684,000 --> 0:05:44,000
blocking pediatricians from talking to parents

109
0:05:44.868,000 --> 0:05:45,000
about the dangers of guns in the home;

110
0:05:46.703,000 --> 0:05:48,000
blocking smart-gun technology and other technology

111
0:05:49.096,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that would prevent kids from firing parents' guns

112
0:05:51.791,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and would save lives.

113
0:05:53.812,000 --> 0:05:55,000
They're desperate to hide the truth,

114
0:05:56.105,000 --> 0:06:,000
because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line.

115
0:06:00.407,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And every day,

116
0:06:01.592,000 --> 0:06:02,000
people are dying as a result.

117
0:06:03.211,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And a lot of those people are children.

118
0:06:06.108,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Every day in the US,

119
0:06:08.469,000 --> 0:06:11,000
nine kids are just shot unintentionally.

120
0:06:12.309,000 --> 0:06:17,000
900 children and teens take their own lives every year.

121
0:06:17.476,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun.

122
0:06:21.874,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Even two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home,

123
0:06:28.259,000 --> 0:06:29,000
including the terrible tragedy

124
0:06:29.968,000 --> 0:06:3,000
at Sandy Hook.

125
0:06:31.562,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I meet so many of these parents;

126
0:06:33.549,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it's the most heartbreaking part of my job.

127
0:06:36.379,000 --> 0:06:38,000
These are not bad people.

128
0:06:39.476,000 --> 0:06:44,000
They're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision,

129
0:06:44.715,000 --> 0:06:46,000
made based on very bad information

130
0:06:47.61,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that was put into their minds by very bad people,

131
0:06:50.522,000 --> 0:06:53,000
who know good and well the misery that they're causing,

132
0:06:53.751,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but just don't care.

133
0:06:56.577,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And the result is a nightmare --

134
0:06:59.063,000 --> 0:07:01,000
not only for families like mine,

135
0:07:01.657,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but for, really, at the end of the day, all of us.

136
0:07:05.472,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence.

137
0:07:08.41,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream we all share,

138
0:07:11.47,000 --> 0:07:13,000
which is the dream of a better, safer, future.

139
0:07:13.97,000 --> 0:07:15,000
For my organization, for the Brady Campaign,

140
0:07:16.696,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that dream is reflected in the bold goal

141
0:07:19.308,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by 2025.

142
0:07:24.102,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And I hope to leave all of you here tonight

143
0:07:26.628,000 --> 0:07:31,000
with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach.

144
0:07:32.525,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Because folks,

145
0:07:33.915,000 --> 0:07:35,000
for every great movement around the world,

146
0:07:36.751,000 --> 0:07:38,000
there's a moment where you can look back and say,

147
0:07:39.562,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"That's when things really started to change."

148
0:07:43.065,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And I'm here to say

149
0:07:44.313,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that for the movement to end gun violence in America,

150
0:07:47.258,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that moment is here.

151
0:07:50.308,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Applause)

152
0:07:55.993,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We are so clearly at a tipping point,

153
0:07:58.898,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because the American public has come together by the millions

154
0:08:02.033,000 --> 0:08:04,000
like never before, based on that common ground,

155
0:08:04.271,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to say, "Enough."

156
0:08:05.69,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Enough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters

157
0:08:08.921,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and churches and schools.

158
0:08:10.851,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Enough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets

159
0:08:15.768,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that's claimed the lives of women and young black men

160
0:08:18.999,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in staggering proportions.

161
0:08:20.445,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Enough of easy access to guns

162
0:08:22.252,000 --> 0:08:24,000
by the people that we all agree shouldn't have them.

163
0:08:24.752,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And enough of a small group of craven politicians

164
0:08:27.811,000 --> 0:08:29,000
putting the interests of the corporate gun lobby

165
0:08:30.124,000 --> 0:08:32,000
ahead of the people they have been elected to represent.

166
0:08:33.147,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Enough.

167
0:08:34.322,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Applause)

168
0:08:40.5,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And the really exciting thing is, it's not just the usual suspects like me

169
0:08:44.428,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that are saying it anymore.

170
0:08:45.984,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's so much bigger than that.

171
0:08:47.912,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And if you want proof,

172
0:08:49.087,000 --> 0:08:52,000
let's start where most conversations in the US seem to start --

173
0:08:52.663,000 --> 0:08:53,000
with Kim Kardashian.

174
0:08:54.091,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:55.305,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And here's the thing: it's not really a joke.

176
0:08:57.448,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I mean, think about when issues change.

177
0:08:59.345,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's when they go from being political and advocacy issues

178
0:09:02.138,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to being part of pop culture,

179
0:09:03.568,000 --> 0:09:06,000
voices coming from everywhere, celebrities using their platforms,

180
0:09:07.161,000 --> 0:09:08,000
musicians, athletes.

181
0:09:08.786,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The NBA has come forward.

182
0:09:10.066,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Conservative pundits that you never would have imagined

183
0:09:12.744,000 --> 0:09:13,000
have come forward.

184
0:09:13.919,000 --> 0:09:14,000
There's real cultural change --

185
0:09:15.485,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year.

186
0:09:17.875,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That's the extent to which this cultural change is happening.

187
0:09:22.444,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And yes, Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal

188
0:09:26.396,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to her 35 million Twitter followers

189
0:09:29.534,000 --> 0:09:31,000
for expanded background checks.

190
0:09:31.906,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Let's look at the political elections that are heating up.

191
0:09:34.845,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This used to be the classic third-rail issue for Democrats.

192
0:09:37.726,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Couldn't run from it fast enough.

193
0:09:39.464,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now candidates are running on it.

194
0:09:41.171,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Some are being forced to reverse very bad positions

195
0:09:44.162,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they defended very comfortably, until very recently.

196
0:09:48.408,000 --> 0:09:49,000
For somebody like me,

197
0:09:50.062,000 --> 0:09:55,000
watching people wave around their negative NRA ratings --

198
0:09:55.148,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it's almost surreal to watch.

199
0:09:58.391,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We're still outfunded, yes, by the corporate gun lobby,

200
0:10:02.138,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and ultimately that needs to change.

201
0:10:04.531,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But you know what?

202
0:10:05.716,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We're smarter and we're scrappier, and we have the truth on our side.

203
0:10:10.099,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And we're on offense.

204
0:10:11.843,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You know, they say that the Internet democratizes information.

205
0:10:15.277,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Social media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it

206
0:10:19.039,000 --> 0:10:2,000
have democratized activism.

207
0:10:20.936,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It's allowed us to show what 90 percent support really looks like.

208
0:10:24.327,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Sometimes I think of it --

209
0:10:25.598,000 --> 0:10:28,000
you know, we're converging and attacking instantly by the millions,

210
0:10:28.859,000 --> 0:10:29,000
kind of like white blood cells.

211
0:10:30.486,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It's enabled us to start to really close -- and this is the bottom line --

212
0:10:35.069,000 --> 0:10:37,000
close that disgraceful disconnect

213
0:10:37.299,000 --> 0:10:39,000
between what the American public wants

214
0:10:39.735,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and what our elected leaders are doing about it.

215
0:10:42.006,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Until recently,

216
0:10:43.554,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the narrative in Congress was that calls from the other side,

217
0:10:46.83,000 --> 0:10:47,000
from that six percent,

218
0:10:48.014,000 --> 0:10:51,000
outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.

219
0:10:51.218,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We're flipping that narrative on its head.

220
0:10:53.281,000 --> 0:10:55,000
After that recent terrible tragedy in San Bernardino,

221
0:10:55.915,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we jammed Congressional switchboards.

222
0:10:57.744,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We put 15,000 calls into Congress in 24 hours.

223
0:11:03.141,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And you know what?

224
0:11:04.316,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We got a vote on a bill

225
0:11:05.491,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that nobody thought was going to see the light of day anytime soon.

226
0:11:08.729,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We're seeing real movement to repeal some of the most evil,

227
0:11:11.594,000 --> 0:11:15,000
ugly gun lobby legislation passed over the last dark decade.

228
0:11:16.257,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken.

229
0:11:19.188,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We've seen President Obama's historic executive actions.

230
0:11:22.514,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They don't go all the way,

231
0:11:23.928,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but they are going to save lives,

232
0:11:25.539,000 --> 0:11:27,000
because they expand Brady background checks

233
0:11:27.61,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to thousands of gun sales that didn't have them previously.

234
0:11:31.206,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And we're marching across the country -- we're not just waiting

235
0:11:34.238,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for Congress to act; that would almost be the definition of insanity.

236
0:11:37.647,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We're marching across the country,

237
0:11:39.316,000 --> 0:11:41,000
state by state, marriage-equality style.

238
0:11:41.939,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And you know what? We're winning.

239
0:11:43.537,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Congress is almost always the last to wake up and realize

240
0:11:47.228,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that it's on the wrong side of history.

241
0:11:49.441,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And when they do, it's always because the American public shakes them.

242
0:11:53.086,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And that's exactly what we're doing right now,

243
0:11:55.292,000 --> 0:11:56,000
as we're in this tipping point.

244
0:11:56.854,000 --> 0:11:59,000
You know, recently I was flying cross-country to give a speech

245
0:12:00.827,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to a large group like this, although far less intimidating,

246
0:12:04.283,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and the woman sitting next to me happened to be binge-watching

247
0:12:08.048,000 --> 0:12:12,000
one of my all-time favorite TV shows, "Mad Men,"

248
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
a period TV show about advertising

249
0:12:15.238,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in the 1960s.

250
0:12:17.08,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And as I was trying to think about how to end my remarks,

251
0:12:20.701,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I'd glance up at her screen every now and then,

252
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and it seemed that every time I did,

253
0:12:25.317,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children

254
0:12:29.666,000 --> 0:12:31,000
or while pregnant or drinking and driving

255
0:12:32.103,000 --> 0:12:35,000
or driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker.

256
0:12:36.098,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And ultimately it dawned on me:

257
0:12:38.496,000 --> 0:12:39,000
what tremendous inspiration

258
0:12:39.882,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to those of us who have this dream to end gun violence.

259
0:12:43.865,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I mean, think about how much the world has changed

260
0:12:46.46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in a relatively short period of time,

261
0:12:49.263,000 --> 0:12:52,000
how all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace or normal --

262
0:12:52.92,000 --> 0:12:54,000
some even glamorous or sexy --

263
0:12:55.161,000 --> 0:12:59,000
have become stigmatized in just a generation or two,

264
0:12:59.292,000 --> 0:13:03,000
once they became conversations about our common ground.

265
0:13:03.799,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That is the magnitude of the change we have the potential to create

266
0:13:08.637,000 --> 0:13:09,000
around gun violence.

267
0:13:10.296,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And that's my dream,

268
0:13:11.884,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that maybe someday,

269
0:13:13.376,000 --> 0:13:18,000
some period TV show will depict the terrible nightmare of gun violence,

270
0:13:18.895,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and a future generation of children might only be able to imagine

271
0:13:22.293,000 --> 0:13:23,000
how terrible it must have been.

272
0:13:24.166,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Thank you.

273
0:13:25.341,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Applause)

274
0:13:31.079,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Thank you.

275
0:13:32.254,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Applause)

276
0:13:33.771,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Thank you.

277
0:13:34.946,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Applause)

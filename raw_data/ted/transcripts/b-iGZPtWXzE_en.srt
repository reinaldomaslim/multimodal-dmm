1
0:00:15.482,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Running: it's basically just right, left, right, left, yeah?

2
0:00:18.855,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I mean, we've been doing it for two million years,

3
0:00:21.308,000 --> 0:00:24,000
so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say

4
0:00:24.878,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago.

5
0:00:28.494,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But the cool thing about running, as I've discovered,

6
0:00:31.076,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time.

7
0:00:34.685,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Case in point: A couple months ago, if you saw the New York City Marathon,

8
0:00:38.284,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I guarantee you, you saw something that no one has ever seen before.

9
0:00:42.487,000 --> 0:00:45,000
An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line.

10
0:00:47.022,000 --> 0:00:48,000
She's 37 years old.

11
0:00:48.398,000 --> 0:00:5,000
She hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years,

12
0:00:51.108,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and a few months previously,

13
0:00:52.56,000 --> 0:00:53,000
she had almost died in childbirth.

14
0:00:54.56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport,

15
0:00:58.075,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but she decided she'd go for broke

16
0:00:59.971,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and try for one last big payday in the marquee event,

17
0:01:03.783,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the New York City Marathon.

18
0:01:05.422,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu -- some other people had the same idea,

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
including the Olympic gold medalist,

20
0:01:11.038,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,

21
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the fastest woman marathoner in history by far.

22
0:01:17.756,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Only 10 minutes off the men's world record,

23
0:01:20.057,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.

24
0:01:23.603,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That's her competition.

25
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The gun goes off, and -- I mean, she's not even an underdog;

26
0:01:28.132,000 --> 0:01:29,000
she's, like, under the underdogs.

27
0:01:29.971,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But the under-underdog hangs tough,

28
0:01:32.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and 22 miles into a 26-mile race,

29
0:01:34.875,000 --> 0:01:36,000
there is Derartu Tulu, up there with the lead pack.

30
0:01:38.564,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now, this is when something really bizarre happens.

31
0:01:41.279,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Paula Radcliffe, the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck

32
0:01:45.065,000 --> 0:01:48,000
from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,

33
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back.

34
0:01:50.581,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So we all know what to do in this situation, right?

35
0:01:53.016,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow

36
0:01:55.726,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and blaze for the finish line.

37
0:01:57.549,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Derartu Tulu ruins the script.

38
0:01:59.763,000 --> 0:02:,000
Instead of taking off,

39
0:02:01.236,000 --> 0:02:03,000
she falls back and she grabs Paula Radcliffe,

40
0:02:03.509,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and says, "Come on. Come with us. You can do it."

41
0:02:05.871,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So Paula Radcliffe, unfortunately, does it.

42
0:02:08.306,000 --> 0:02:09,000
She catches up with the lead pack

43
0:02:09.943,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and is pushing toward the finish line.

44
0:02:11.83,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But then she falls back again.

45
0:02:13.373,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The second time, Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her.

46
0:02:16.389,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And Paula Radcliffe, at that point, says, "I'm done. Go."

47
0:02:19.771,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So that's a fantastic story, and we all know how it ends.

48
0:02:22.551,000 --> 0:02:23,000
She loses the check,

49
0:02:23.865,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but she goes home with something bigger and more important.

50
0:02:26.814,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again.

51
0:02:29.334,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Instead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins.

52
0:02:32.858,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Wins the New York City Marathon,

53
0:02:34.544,000 --> 0:02:35,000
goes home with a big fat check.

54
0:02:36.937,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's a heartwarming story,

55
0:02:38.497,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but if you drill a little bit deeper,

56
0:02:40.498,000 --> 0:02:43,000
you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there.

57
0:02:43.93,000 --> 0:02:45,000
When you have two outliers in one organism,

58
0:02:46.089,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it's not a coincidence.

59
0:02:47.487,000 --> 0:02:5,000
When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate

60
0:02:51.002,000 --> 0:02:53,000
than anybody else in the race, again, it's not a coincidence.

61
0:02:54.003,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills;

62
0:02:56.47,000 --> 0:02:57,000
somehow water's involved.

63
0:02:58.142,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Someone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there.

64
0:03:01.548,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And the answer to it, I think, can be found

65
0:03:04.139,000 --> 0:03:06,000
down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,

66
0:03:06.572,000 --> 0:03:09,000
where there's a reclusive tribe, called the Tarahumara Indians.

67
0:03:10.473,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now, the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things.

68
0:03:14.056,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Number one is:

69
0:03:15.555,000 --> 0:03:19,000
they have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years.

70
0:03:19.785,000 --> 0:03:22,000
When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices:

71
0:03:23.423,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you either fight back and engage or you could take off.

72
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The Mayans and Aztecs engaged,

73
0:03:28.042,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs.

74
0:03:30.512,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The Tarahumara had a different strategy.

75
0:03:32.521,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They took off and hid

76
0:03:34.409,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in this labyrinthine, networking, spider-webbing system of canyons

77
0:03:39.288,000 --> 0:03:4,000
called the Copper Canyons.

78
0:03:40.713,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And there they've remained since the 1600s,

79
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
essentially the same way they've always been.

80
0:03:47.581,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is:

81
0:03:50.762,000 --> 0:03:53,000
deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --

82
0:03:53.914,000 --> 0:03:54,000
these guys aren't running marathons;

83
0:03:55.915,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they're running mega-marathons.

84
0:03:57.786,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They're not doing 26 miles,

85
0:03:59.455,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,

86
0:04:02.101,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and apparently without injury, without problems.

87
0:04:05.216,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is:

88
0:04:07.956,000 --> 0:04:09,000
all the things we're going to be talking about today,

89
0:04:10.497,000 --> 0:04:12,000
all the things we're trying to use all of our technology

90
0:04:13.326,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and brain power to solve --

91
0:04:14.688,000 --> 0:04:16,000
things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer;

92
0:04:17.262,000 --> 0:04:2,000
crime, warfare and violence; clinical depression -- all this stuff --

93
0:04:20.884,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about.

94
0:04:23.38,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They are free from all of these modern ailments.

95
0:04:27.988,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So what's the connection?

96
0:04:29.241,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Again, we're talking about outliers;

97
0:04:31.003,000 --> 0:04:33,000
there's got to be some kind of cause and effect.

98
0:04:33.318,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Well, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah

99
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that are bending their brains and trying to figure out

100
0:04:39.764,000 --> 0:04:4,000
what the Tarahumara have known forever.

101
0:04:41.731,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries.

102
0:04:44.419,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And once again, a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery --

103
0:04:47.866,000 --> 0:04:5,000
perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara

104
0:04:51.009,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is wrapped in three other mysteries, which go like this:

105
0:04:53.67,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Three things -- if you have the answer, come up and take the microphone,

106
0:04:57.103,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because nobody else knows the answer.

107
0:04:58.956,000 --> 0:05:,000
If you know it, you're smarter than anybody on planet Earth.

108
0:05:01.865,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Mystery number one is this:

109
0:05:03.312,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Two million years ago, the human brain exploded in size.

110
0:05:06.09,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain.

111
0:05:08.225,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Suddenly humans show up, Homo erectus, big old melon head.

112
0:05:11.295,000 --> 0:05:12,000
To have a brain of that size,

113
0:05:12.842,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy.

114
0:05:16.469,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In other words, early humans are eating dead animals --

115
0:05:19.114,000 --> 0:05:2,000
no argument, that's a fact.

116
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The only problem is,

117
0:05:22.401,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago.

118
0:05:26.015,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So somehow, for nearly two million years,

119
0:05:28.734,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we are killing animals without any weapons.

120
0:05:31.429,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, we're not using our strength,

121
0:05:33.153,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle.

122
0:05:35.535,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Every other animal is stronger than we are,

123
0:05:37.601,000 --> 0:05:4,000
they have fangs, they have claws, they have nimbleness, they have speed.

124
0:05:41.055,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We think Usain Bolt is fast.

125
0:05:42.45,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel.

126
0:05:44.818,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We're not fast.

127
0:05:45.993,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That would be an Olympic event:

128
0:05:47.508,000 --> 0:05:49,000
turn a squirrel loose, whoever catches it gets a gold medal.

129
0:05:50.369,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:51.408,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws.

131
0:05:54.15,000 --> 0:05:56,000
How were we killing these animals? Mystery number one.

132
0:05:56.816,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Mystery number two:

133
0:05:58.281,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now,

134
0:06:01.358,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters:

135
0:06:04.19,000 --> 0:06:05,000
they all suck; they're terrible.

136
0:06:05.969,000 --> 0:06:08,000
There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been.

137
0:06:09.721,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15.

138
0:06:12.722,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I could throw a rock and hit a high-school boy

139
0:06:14.964,000 --> 0:06:15,000
who can run faster than 4:15.

140
0:06:16.484,000 --> 0:06:18,000
For some reason, you guys are just really slow.

141
0:06:18.699,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But --

142
0:06:19.881,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:20.964,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But, you get to the marathon we were just talking about --

144
0:06:23.734,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you've only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years,

145
0:06:26.536,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because prior to the 1980s, medical science said

146
0:06:28.831,000 --> 0:06:31,000
if a woman tried to run 26 miles -- does anyone know what would happen

147
0:06:32.219,000 --> 0:06:33,000
if you tried to run 26 miles?

148
0:06:33.676,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Why you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s?

149
0:06:36.316,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.

150
0:06:38.426,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Christopher McDougall: Her uterus would be torn, yes.

151
0:06:40.978,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Torn reproductive organs.

152
0:06:42.242,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The uterus would literally fall out of the body.

153
0:06:44.525,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:45.57,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now, I've been to a lot of marathons,

155
0:06:47.413,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and I've yet to see any ...

156
0:06:49.078,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

157
0:06:52.011,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So it's only been 20 years

158
0:06:53.402,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that women have been allowed to run the marathon.

159
0:06:55.805,000 --> 0:06:59,000
In that very short learning curve, you've gone from broken organs

160
0:06:59.85,000 --> 0:07:02,000
up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record.

161
0:07:03.675,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Then you go beyond 26 miles, into the distance

162
0:07:06.004,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans --

163
0:07:08.961,000 --> 0:07:1,000
remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles --

164
0:07:11.351,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you get to 50 and 100 miles, and suddenly, it's a different game.

165
0:07:14.643,000 --> 0:07:17,000
You take a runner like Ann Trason or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,

166
0:07:17.91,000 --> 0:07:2,000
put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world,

167
0:07:21.361,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and it's a coin toss who's going to win.

168
0:07:23.362,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I'll give you an example.

169
0:07:24.732,000 --> 0:07:26,000
A couple years ago, Emily Baer signed up for a race

170
0:07:27.271,000 --> 0:07:28,000
called the Hardrock 100,

171
0:07:28.985,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which tells you all you need to know about the race.

172
0:07:31.571,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They give you 48 hours to finish this race.

173
0:07:33.634,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Well, Emily Baer -- 500 runners --

174
0:07:35.563,000 --> 0:07:37,000
she finishes in eighth place, in the top 10,

175
0:07:37.934,000 --> 0:07:39,000
even though she stopped at all the aid stations

176
0:07:40.212,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to breastfeed her baby during the race.

177
0:07:42.131,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Laughter)

178
0:07:43.169,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And yet, she beat 492 other people.

179
0:07:45.391,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The last mystery:

180
0:07:46.572,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer?

181
0:07:49.38,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The third mystery is this:

182
0:07:50.74,000 --> 0:07:53,000
At the University of Utah, they started tracking finishing times

183
0:07:54.232,000 --> 0:07:55,000
for people running the marathon.

184
0:07:55.916,000 --> 0:07:58,000
What they found is that if you start running the marathon at age 19,

185
0:07:59.747,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you'll get progressively faster, year by year,

186
0:08:02.024,000 --> 0:08:03,000
until you reach your peak at age 27.

187
0:08:04.025,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And then after that, you succumb to the rigors of time.

188
0:08:08.025,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And you'll get slower and slower,

189
0:08:09.641,000 --> 0:08:12,000
until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19.

190
0:08:13.254,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So about seven, eight years to reach your peak,

191
0:08:15.519,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and then gradually you fall off your peak,

192
0:08:17.619,000 --> 0:08:19,000
until you go back to the starting point.

193
0:08:19.921,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You'd think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed,

194
0:08:23.165,000 --> 0:08:25,000
maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.

195
0:08:25.921,000 --> 0:08:26,000
64-year-old men and women

196
0:08:27.922,000 --> 0:08:3,000
are running as fast as they were at age 19.

197
0:08:30.985,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, I defy you to come up with any other physical activity --

198
0:08:33.997,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and please don't say golf -- something that's actually hard --

199
0:08:36.983,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter)

200
0:08:38.055,000 --> 0:08:42,000
where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers.

201
0:08:42.626,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So you have these three mysteries.

202
0:08:44.921,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up?

203
0:08:49.201,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You've got to be careful anytime someone looks back in prehistory

204
0:08:52.313,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and tries to give you a global answer because,

205
0:08:54.643,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it being prehistory, you can say whatever the hell you want

206
0:08:57.454,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and get away with it.

207
0:08:58.637,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But I'll submit this to you:

208
0:09:00.027,000 --> 0:09:02,000
If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle,

209
0:09:02.752,000 --> 0:09:04,000
suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture.

210
0:09:05.154,000 --> 0:09:07,000
If you're wondering why the Tarahumara don't fight

211
0:09:07.566,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and don't die of heart disease,

212
0:09:09.114,000 --> 0:09:11,000
why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu

213
0:09:11.898,000 --> 0:09:13,000
can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive,

214
0:09:14.751,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons,

215
0:09:18.598,000 --> 0:09:19,000
perhaps it's because humans,

216
0:09:20.599,000 --> 0:09:23,000
as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe,

217
0:09:23.845,000 --> 0:09:26,000
actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs.

218
0:09:27.668,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.

219
0:09:31.493,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness --

220
0:09:34.093,000 --> 0:09:36,000
again, it's not our fangs, our claws or our speed --

221
0:09:36.573,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the only thing we do really well is sweat.

222
0:09:38.922,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We're really good at being sweaty and smelly.

223
0:09:41.724,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Better than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well.

224
0:09:44.986,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort

225
0:09:48.874,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances,

226
0:09:54.005,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we're superb -- the best on the planet.

227
0:09:56.273,000 --> 0:09:58,000
You take a horse on a hot day,

228
0:09:58.382,000 --> 0:10:,000
and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice:

229
0:10:01.294,000 --> 0:10:03,000
it's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off.

230
0:10:03.971,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But it ain't doing both. We can.

231
0:10:05.938,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals?

232
0:10:08.939,000 --> 0:10:11,000
What if the only natural advantage we had in the world

233
0:10:12.588,000 --> 0:10:14,000
was the fact that we could get together as a group,

234
0:10:15.009,000 --> 0:10:17,000
go out there on that African savanna, pick out an antelope,

235
0:10:18.021,000 --> 0:10:2,000
go out as a pack, and run that thing to death?

236
0:10:21.276,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That's all we could do.

237
0:10:22.756,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We could run really far on a hot day.

238
0:10:24.757,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Well, if that's true, a couple other things had to be true as well.

239
0:10:27.981,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word "pack."

240
0:10:30.834,000 --> 0:10:32,000
If you go out by yourself and try to chase an antelope,

241
0:10:33.466,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I guarantee there will be two cadavers out in the savanna.

242
0:10:36.347,000 --> 0:10:37,000
You need a pack to pull together.

243
0:10:38.014,000 --> 0:10:4,000
You need to have those 64- and 65-year-olds

244
0:10:40.266,000 --> 0:10:41,000
who have been doing this for a long time

245
0:10:42.269,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to understand which antelope you're trying to catch.

246
0:10:44.785,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The herd explodes and it gathers back again.

247
0:10:46.91,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Those expert trackers have to be part of the pack.

248
0:10:49.302,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They can't be 10 miles behind.

249
0:10:50.79,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You need the women and the adolescents there,

250
0:10:52.998,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein

251
0:10:56.414,000 --> 0:10:58,000
is when you're a nursing mother and a developing adolescent.

252
0:10:59.309,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It makes no sense to have the antelope over there, dead,

253
0:11:01.983,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away.

254
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They need to be part of the pack.

255
0:11:05.867,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You need those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers

256
0:11:08.728,000 --> 0:11:09,000
ready to drop the kill,

257
0:11:09.908,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and you need those teenagers who are learning the whole thing involved.

258
0:11:13.363,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The pack stays together.

259
0:11:14.543,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Another thing that has to be true: this pack cannot be materialistic.

260
0:11:17.923,000 --> 0:11:2,000
You can't be hauling all your crap around, trying to chase the antelope.

261
0:11:21.376,000 --> 0:11:22,000
You can't be a pissed-off pack.

262
0:11:22.886,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You can't be bearing grudges, like, "I'm not chasing that guy's antelope.

263
0:11:26.349,000 --> 0:11:28,000
He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope."

264
0:11:28.895,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego,

265
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
be cooperative, and pull together.

266
0:11:33.279,000 --> 0:11:35,000
What you end up with, in other words,

267
0:11:35.931,000 --> 0:11:38,000
is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara,

268
0:11:39.728,000 --> 0:11:42,000
a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age.

269
0:11:43.944,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's a really compelling argument

270
0:11:45.595,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done

271
0:11:49.267,000 --> 0:11:5,000
for two million years,

272
0:11:50.449,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path.

273
0:11:53.517,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing,

274
0:11:56.822,000 --> 0:11:59,000
this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before.

275
0:12:00.315,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But maybe it's something different.

276
0:12:02.031,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had

277
0:12:05.152,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and we spoiled it.

278
0:12:07.064,000 --> 0:12:09,000
How do we spoil it? Well, how do we spoil anything?

279
0:12:09.632,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We try to cash in on it. Right?

280
0:12:11.22,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We try to can it and package it and make it "better"

281
0:12:14.01,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and then sell it to people.

282
0:12:15.423,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And then what happened was, we started creating

283
0:12:17.941,000 --> 0:12:2,000
these fancy cushioned things which can make running "better,"

284
0:12:21.399,000 --> 0:12:22,000
called running shoes.

285
0:12:22.839,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes

286
0:12:25.795,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt.

287
0:12:28.796,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And I think if anybody in here runs --

288
0:12:30.797,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I just had a conversation with Carol.

289
0:12:32.601,000 --> 0:12:35,000
We talked for two minutes backstage, and she talked about plantar fasciitis.

290
0:12:36.256,000 --> 0:12:38,000
You talk to a runner, I guarantee within 30 seconds,

291
0:12:38.831,000 --> 0:12:39,000
the conversation turns to injury.

292
0:12:40.484,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So if humans evolved as runners, if that's our one natural advantage,

293
0:12:43.795,000 --> 0:12:44,000
then why are we so bad at it?

294
0:12:45.292,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Why do we keep getting hurt?

295
0:12:46.927,000 --> 0:12:48,000
A curious thing about running and running injuries

296
0:12:49.323,000 --> 0:12:51,000
is that the running injury is new to our time.

297
0:12:51.835,000 --> 0:12:52,000
If you read folklore and mythology,

298
0:12:53.683,000 --> 0:12:55,000
any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,

299
0:12:55.708,000 --> 0:12:58,000
running is always associated with freedom and vitality

300
0:12:59.34,000 --> 0:13:,000
and youthfulness and eternal vigor.

301
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated

302
0:13:04.078,000 --> 0:13:05,000
with fear and pain.

303
0:13:05.257,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Geronimo used to say, "My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs."

304
0:13:09.392,000 --> 0:13:12,000
That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles

305
0:13:13.035,000 --> 0:13:14,000
across the desert,

306
0:13:14.21,000 --> 0:13:16,000
engage in hand-to-hand combat, steal a bunch of horses,

307
0:13:16.846,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and slap leather for home.

308
0:13:18.2,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Geronimo was never saying, "You know something, my Achilles -- I'm tapering.

309
0:13:21.949,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I've got to take this week off."

310
0:13:23.533,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Or, "I need to cross-train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready."

311
0:13:26.574,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Laughter)

312
0:13:28.001,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Humans ran and ran all the time.

313
0:13:29.85,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We are here today. We have our digital technology.

314
0:13:32.371,000 --> 0:13:33,000
All of our science comes from the fact

315
0:13:34.306,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day,

316
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
which was just rely on their naked feet and legs

317
0:13:40.613,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to run long distances.

318
0:13:42.083,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So how do we get back to that again?

319
0:13:43.906,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Well, I would submit to you the first thing is:

320
0:13:46.142,000 --> 0:13:48,000
get rid of all packaging, all the sales, all the marketing.

321
0:13:48.991,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes.

322
0:13:51.087,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Stop focusing on urban marathons,

323
0:13:53.064,000 --> 0:13:55,000
which, if you do four hours, you suck,

324
0:13:55.884,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,

325
0:13:57.861,000 --> 0:13:59,000
because you qualified for another race.

326
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness

327
0:14:03.184,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and, I would say, nakedness,

328
0:14:06.078,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that has made the Tarahumara

329
0:14:08.004,000 --> 0:14:1,000
one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time.

330
0:14:11.384,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So what's the benefit? So what?

331
0:14:13.029,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So you burn off the Häagen-Dazs from the night before.

332
0:14:15.922,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But maybe there's another benefit there as well.

333
0:14:18.368,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Without getting too extreme about this,

334
0:14:21.525,000 --> 0:14:25,000
imagine a world where everybody could go out the door

335
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and engage in the kind of exercise

336
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that's going to make them more relaxed, more serene,

337
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
more healthy,

338
0:14:32.489,000 --> 0:14:33,000
burn off stress --

339
0:14:33.825,000 --> 0:14:36,000
where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore,

340
0:14:37.038,000 --> 0:14:39,000
or go home with a lot of stress on top of you again.

341
0:14:39.546,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Maybe there's something between what we are today

342
0:14:41.901,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and what the Tarahumara have always been.

343
0:14:44.433,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons

344
0:14:46.686,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and live on corn and maize, which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,

345
0:14:50.095,000 --> 0:14:52,000
but maybe there's somewhere in between.

346
0:14:52.199,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And if we find that thing,

347
0:14:53.89,000 --> 0:14:55,000
maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there.

348
0:14:56.494,000 --> 0:15:,000
Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability

349
0:15:01.405,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that we all enjoyed for most of our existence

350
0:15:03.601,000 --> 0:15:04,000
up until the 1970s or so,

351
0:15:05.196,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the benefits -- social and physical and political and mental --

352
0:15:10.611,000 --> 0:15:11,000
could be astounding.

353
0:15:11.908,000 --> 0:15:15,000
What I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture

354
0:15:16.001,000 --> 0:15:18,000
of barefoot runners, people who've gotten rid of their shoes.

355
0:15:18.944,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And what they have found uniformly is,

356
0:15:20.854,000 --> 0:15:22,000
you get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress,

357
0:15:23.405,000 --> 0:15:25,000
you get rid of the injuries and the ailments.

358
0:15:25.897,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known

359
0:15:28.711,000 --> 0:15:29,000
for a very long time:

360
0:15:29.9,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that this can be a whole lot of fun.

361
0:15:31.686,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I've experienced it personally myself.

362
0:15:33.537,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I was injured all my life; then in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes

363
0:15:36.917,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and my running ailments have gone away, too.

364
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from.

365
0:15:41.742,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I appreciate your listening to this story.

366
0:15:43.808,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Thanks very much.

367
0:15:44.983,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Applause)

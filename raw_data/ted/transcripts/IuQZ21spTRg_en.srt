2
0:00:16.063,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So little Billy goes to school,

3
0:00:18.847,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and he sits down and the teacher says,

4
0:00:21.604,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"What does your father do?"

5
0:00:24.609,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And little Billy says, "My father plays the piano

6
0:00:28.266,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in an opium den."

7
0:00:31.372,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So the teacher rings up the parents, and says,

8
0:00:33.361,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Very shocking story from little Billy today.

9
0:00:36.615,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano

10
0:00:40.364,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in an opium den."

11
0:00:42.524,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And the father says, "I'm very sorry. Yes, it's true, I lied.

12
0:00:46.383,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But how can I tell an eight-year-old boy

13
0:00:50.014,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that his father is a politician?" (Laughter)

14
0:00:54.423,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, as a politician myself, standing in front of you,

15
0:00:57.671,000 --> 0:01:,000
or indeed, meeting any stranger anywhere in the world,

16
0:01:01.326,000 --> 0:01:03,000
when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession,

17
0:01:03.902,000 --> 0:01:06,000
they look at me as though I'm somewhere between

18
0:01:06.996,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a snake, a monkey and an iguana,

19
0:01:11.75,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and through all of this, I feel, strongly,

20
0:01:15.692,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that something is going wrong.

21
0:01:18.674,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Four hundred years of maturing democracy,

22
0:01:21.87,000 --> 0:01:23,000
colleagues in Parliament who seem to me, as individuals,

23
0:01:24.738,000 --> 0:01:27,000
reasonably impressive, an increasingly educated,

24
0:01:28.316,000 --> 0:01:32,000
energetic, informed population, and yet

25
0:01:32.963,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a deep, deep sense of disappointment.

26
0:01:37.867,000 --> 0:01:4,000
My colleagues in Parliament include, in my new intake,

27
0:01:41.839,000 --> 0:01:45,000
family doctors, businesspeople, professors,

28
0:01:46.593,000 --> 0:01:5,000
distinguished economists, historians, writers,

29
0:01:50.816,000 --> 0:01:55,000
army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors.

30
0:01:55.818,000 --> 0:01:58,000
All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath

31
0:01:59.479,000 --> 0:02:03,000
those strange stone gargoyles just down the road,

32
0:02:03.587,000 --> 0:02:07,000
feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts,

33
0:02:07.613,000 --> 0:02:12,000
feel as though we have become profoundly diminished.

34
0:02:13.286,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And this isn't just a problem in Britain.

35
0:02:17.414,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's a problem across the developing world,

36
0:02:20.147,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica,

37
0:02:22.781,000 --> 0:02:25,000
for example -- look at Jamaican members of Parliament,

38
0:02:26.089,000 --> 0:02:28,000
you meet them, and they're often people who are

39
0:02:29.069,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Rhodes Scholars, who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton,

40
0:02:34.513,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and yet, you go down to downtown Kingston,

41
0:02:37.574,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites

42
0:02:41.218,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that you can see in any middle-income country in the world:

43
0:02:45.303,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a dismal, depressing landscape

44
0:02:48.066,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of burnt and half-abandoned buildings.

45
0:02:51.256,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And this has been true for 30 years, and the handover

46
0:02:54.384,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in 1979, 1980, between one Jamaican leader who was

47
0:02:58.65,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another

48
0:03:02.125,000 --> 0:03:05,000
who'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard,

49
0:03:05.355,000 --> 0:03:08,000
over 800 people were killed in the streets

50
0:03:08.358,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in drug-related violence.

51
0:03:11.885,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Ten years ago, however, the promise of democracy

52
0:03:15.367,000 --> 0:03:18,000
seemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up

53
0:03:19.35,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in his State of the Union address in 2003

54
0:03:22.51,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and said that democracy was the force that would beat

55
0:03:26.539,000 --> 0:03:29,000
most of the ills of the world. He said,

56
0:03:29.565,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because democratic governments respect their own people

57
0:03:33.338,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and respect their neighbors, freedom will bring peace.

58
0:03:39.072,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Distinguished academics at the same time argued that

59
0:03:42.706,000 --> 0:03:45,000
democracies had this incredible range of side benefits.

60
0:03:46.384,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They would bring prosperity, security,

61
0:03:49.684,000 --> 0:03:51,000
overcome sectarian violence,

62
0:03:52.505,000 --> 0:03:56,000
ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists.

63
0:03:56.97,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Since then, what's happened?

64
0:03:59.324,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well, what we've seen is the creation, in places like Iraq

65
0:04:02.518,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and Afghanistan, of democratic systems of government

66
0:04:06.506,000 --> 0:04:08,000
which haven't had any of those side benefits.

67
0:04:09.396,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election

68
0:04:12.389,000 --> 0:04:14,000
or two elections. We've gone through three elections,

69
0:04:15.056,000 --> 0:04:18,000
presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find?

70
0:04:18.183,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Do we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law

71
0:04:21.794,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and good security? No. What we find in Afghanistan

72
0:04:25.255,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt,

73
0:04:29.4,000 --> 0:04:33,000
a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective,

74
0:04:33.585,000 --> 0:04:36,000
a media which is beginning to get onto its feet

75
0:04:36.589,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but a government that's deeply unpopular,

76
0:04:39.414,000 --> 0:04:42,000
perceived as being deeply corrupt, and security

77
0:04:43.182,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that is shocking, security that's terrible.

78
0:04:46.995,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In Pakistan, in lots of sub-Saharan Africa,

79
0:04:51.653,000 --> 0:04:53,000
again you can see democracy and elections are compatible

80
0:04:54.645,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with corrupt governments, with states that are unstable

81
0:04:58.494,000 --> 0:05:,000
and dangerous.

82
0:05:01.351,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And when I have conversations with people, I remember

83
0:05:03.635,000 --> 0:05:05,000
having a conversation, for example, in Iraq,

84
0:05:06.516,000 --> 0:05:08,000
with a community that asked me

85
0:05:09.205,000 --> 0:05:12,000
whether the riot we were seeing in front of us,

86
0:05:12.715,000 --> 0:05:15,000
this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building,

87
0:05:16.538,000 --> 0:05:2,000
was a sign of the new democracy.

88
0:05:21.23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The same, I felt, was true in almost every single one

89
0:05:25.371,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of the middle and developing countries that I went to,

90
0:05:28.319,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and to some extent the same is true of us.

91
0:05:32.37,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Well, what is the answer to this? Is the answer to just

92
0:05:34.946,000 --> 0:05:36,000
give up on the idea of democracy?

93
0:05:37.604,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Well, obviously not. It would be absurd

94
0:05:41.346,000 --> 0:05:43,000
if we were to engage again in the kind of operations

95
0:05:44.133,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we were engaged in, in Iraq and Afghanistan

96
0:05:47.209,000 --> 0:05:5,000
if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation

97
0:05:50.729,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in which we were imposing

98
0:05:53.404,000 --> 0:05:55,000
anything other than a democratic system.

99
0:05:55.843,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Anything else would run contrary to our values,

100
0:05:58.395,000 --> 0:06:,000
it would run contrary to the wishes of the people

101
0:06:00.646,000 --> 0:06:03,000
on the ground, it would run contrary to our interests.

102
0:06:04.269,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I remember in Iraq, for example, that we went through

103
0:06:07.576,000 --> 0:06:09,000
a period of feeling that we should delay democracy.

104
0:06:10.117,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned

105
0:06:12.809,000 --> 0:06:15,000
from Bosnia was that elections held too early

106
0:06:16.387,000 --> 0:06:2,000
enshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties,

107
0:06:20.621,000 --> 0:06:22,000
so in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made,

108
0:06:23.439,000 --> 0:06:26,000
let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in

109
0:06:26.556,000 --> 0:06:3,000
voter education. Let's invest in democratization.

110
0:06:30.728,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The result was that I found stuck outside my office

111
0:06:34.746,000 --> 0:06:36,000
a huge crowd of people, this is actually a photograph

112
0:06:36.918,000 --> 0:06:39,000
taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq

113
0:06:40.398,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of people standing outside screaming for the elections,

114
0:06:44.523,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and when I went out and said, "What is wrong

115
0:06:47.289,000 --> 0:06:49,000
with the interim provincial council?

116
0:06:50.249,000 --> 0:06:53,000
What is wrong with the people that we have chosen?

117
0:06:53.917,000 --> 0:06:55,000
There is a Sunni sheikh, there's a Shiite sheikh,

118
0:06:56.662,000 --> 0:06:59,000
there's the seven -- leaders of the seven major tribes,

119
0:06:59.813,000 --> 0:07:01,000
there's a Christian, there's a Sabian,

120
0:07:02.367,000 --> 0:07:06,000
there are female representatives, there's every political party in this council,

121
0:07:06.611,000 --> 0:07:08,000
what's wrong with the people that we chose?"

122
0:07:09.251,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The answer came, "The problem isn't the people

123
0:07:12.349,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that you chose. The problem is that you chose them."

124
0:07:18.15,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I have not met, in Afghanistan, in even the most

125
0:07:21.582,000 --> 0:07:24,000
remote community, anybody who does not want

126
0:07:24.709,000 --> 0:07:26,000
a say in who governs them.

127
0:07:27.493,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Most remote community, I have never met a villager

128
0:07:29.554,000 --> 0:07:32,000
who does not want a vote.

129
0:07:33.136,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So we need to acknowledge

130
0:07:36.416,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that despite the dubious statistics, despite the fact that

131
0:07:39.998,000 --> 0:07:44,000
84 percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken,

132
0:07:45.421,000 --> 0:07:47,000
despite the fact that when I was in Iraq, we did an opinion poll

133
0:07:48.393,000 --> 0:07:52,000
in 2003 and asked people what political systems they preferred,

134
0:07:52.651,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and the answer came back that

135
0:07:54.975,000 --> 0:07:57,000
seven percent wanted the United States,

136
0:07:58.036,000 --> 0:08:,000
five percent wanted France,

137
0:08:00.759,000 --> 0:08:02,000
three percent wanted Britain,

138
0:08:03.414,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and nearly 40 percent wanted Dubai, which is, after all,

139
0:08:07.769,000 --> 0:08:09,000
not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous

140
0:08:10.535,000 --> 0:08:14,000
minor monarchy, democracy is a thing of value

141
0:08:15.238,000 --> 0:08:18,000
for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so

142
0:08:18.4,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we need to get away from instrumental arguments.

143
0:08:21.752,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We need to get away from saying democracy matters

144
0:08:25.32,000 --> 0:08:28,000
because of the other things it brings.

145
0:08:28.427,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We need to get away from feeling, in the same way,

146
0:08:30.552,000 --> 0:08:33,000
human rights matters because of the other things it brings,

147
0:08:34.149,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or women's rights matters for the other things it brings.

148
0:08:37.841,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Why should we get away from those arguments?

149
0:08:40.145,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying,

150
0:08:42.549,000 --> 0:08:46,000
for example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract

151
0:08:47.242,000 --> 0:08:52,000
good information, or we say, you need women's rights

152
0:08:52.44,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force,

153
0:08:57.12,000 --> 0:08:58,000
you leave yourself open to the position where

154
0:08:58.777,000 --> 0:09:,000
the government of North Korea can turn around and say,

155
0:09:00.87,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting

156
0:09:03.733,000 --> 0:09:05,000
good information with our torture at the moment,"

157
0:09:06.234,000 --> 0:09:07,000
or the government of Saudi Arabia to say, "Well,

158
0:09:08.194,000 --> 0:09:09,000
our economic growth's okay, thank you very much,

159
0:09:09.923,000 --> 0:09:1,000
considerably better than yours,

160
0:09:11.383,000 --> 0:09:15,000
so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights."

161
0:09:16.189,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The point about democracy is not instrumental.

162
0:09:19.87,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's not about the things that it brings.

163
0:09:22.659,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The point about democracy is not that it delivers

164
0:09:25.224,000 --> 0:09:31,000
legitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law.

165
0:09:31.468,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors.

166
0:09:36.113,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The point about democracy is intrinsic.

167
0:09:39.03,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality

168
0:09:44.361,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity,

169
0:09:48.769,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual

170
0:09:52.639,000 --> 0:09:55,000
should have an equal vote, an equal say,

171
0:09:56.24,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in the formation of their government.

172
0:10:00.235,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again,

173
0:10:04.301,000 --> 0:10:06,000
if we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved

174
0:10:06.914,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in a new project of the citizens and the politicians.

175
0:10:11.715,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Democracy is not simply a question of structures.

176
0:10:16.103,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It is a state of mind. It is an activity.

177
0:10:20.12,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And part of that activity is honesty.

178
0:10:23.911,000 --> 0:10:26,000
After I speak to you today, I'm going on a radio program

179
0:10:27.449,000 --> 0:10:29,000
called "Any Questions," and the thing you will have noticed

180
0:10:29.752,000 --> 0:10:32,000
about politicians on these kinds of radio programs

181
0:10:33.552,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is that they never, ever say that they don't know the answer

182
0:10:37.017,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to a question. It doesn't matter what it is.

183
0:10:38.652,000 --> 0:10:41,000
If you ask about child tax credits, the future of the penguins

184
0:10:42.004,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in the south Antarctic, asked to hold forth on whether or not

185
0:10:46.626,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the developments in Chongqing contribute

186
0:10:49.258,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to sustainable development in carbon capture,

187
0:10:51.592,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and we will have an answer for you.

188
0:10:54.354,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We need to stop that, to stop pretending to be

189
0:10:57.539,000 --> 0:10:58,000
omniscient beings.

190
0:10:59.424,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Politicians also need to learn, occasionally, to say that

191
0:11:02.984,000 --> 0:11:05,000
certain things that voters want, certain things that voters

192
0:11:06.73,000 --> 0:11:09,000
have been promised, may be things

193
0:11:10.593,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that we cannot deliver

194
0:11:13.738,000 --> 0:11:16,000
or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver.

195
0:11:17.52,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And the second thing we should do is understand

196
0:11:20.411,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the genius of our societies.

197
0:11:23.403,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Our societies have never been so educated, have never

198
0:11:27.432,000 --> 0:11:29,000
been so energized, have never been so healthy,

199
0:11:30.368,000 --> 0:11:32,000
have never known so much, cared so much,

200
0:11:33.316,000 --> 0:11:38,000
or wanted to do so much, and it is a genius of the local.

201
0:11:39.212,000 --> 0:11:41,000
One of the reasons why we're moving away

202
0:11:41.91,000 --> 0:11:44,000
from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand,

203
0:11:45.411,000 --> 0:11:49,000
banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling

204
0:11:49.887,000 --> 0:11:5,000
of kings enthroned,

205
0:11:51.662,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the entire drama played out here on this space,

206
0:11:54.814,000 --> 0:11:56,000
where the King of England had his head lopped off,

207
0:11:57.673,000 --> 0:12:01,000
why we've moved from spaces like this, thrones like that,

208
0:12:02.004,000 --> 0:12:05,000
towards the town hall, is we're moving more and more

209
0:12:05.729,000 --> 0:12:08,000
towards the energies of our people, and we need to tap that.

210
0:12:09.677,000 --> 0:12:11,000
That can mean different things in different countries.

211
0:12:12.467,000 --> 0:12:15,000
In Britain, it could mean looking to the French,

212
0:12:15.78,000 --> 0:12:16,000
learning from the French,

213
0:12:17.523,000 --> 0:12:2,000
getting directly elected mayors in place

214
0:12:21.152,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in a French commune system.

215
0:12:23.64,000 --> 0:12:25,000
In Afghanistan, it could have meant instead of concentrating

216
0:12:26.474,000 --> 0:12:28,000
on the big presidential and parliamentary elections,

217
0:12:29.028,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution

218
0:12:31.345,000 --> 0:12:35,000
from the very beginning, which is to get direct local elections going

219
0:12:36.025,000 --> 0:12:41,000
at a district level and elect people's provincial governors.

220
0:12:41.572,000 --> 0:12:43,000
But for any of these things to work,

221
0:12:44.295,000 --> 0:12:46,000
the honesty in language, the local democracy,

222
0:12:47.118,000 --> 0:12:49,000
it's not just a question of what politicians do.

223
0:12:49.886,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's a question of what the citizens do.

224
0:12:51.954,000 --> 0:12:55,000
For politicians to be honest, the public needs to allow them to be honest,

225
0:12:56.861,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and the media, which mediates between the politicians

226
0:12:59.44,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and the public, needs to allow those politicians to be honest.

227
0:13:04.071,000 --> 0:13:07,000
If local democracy is to flourish, it is about the active

228
0:13:07.693,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and informed engagement of every citizen.

229
0:13:11.929,000 --> 0:13:15,000
In other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt,

230
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
is to become again vigorous and vibrant,

231
0:13:20.654,000 --> 0:13:23,000
it is necessary not just for the public

232
0:13:23.8,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to learn to trust their politicians,

233
0:13:26.714,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but for the politicians to learn to trust the public.

234
0:13:31.586,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)

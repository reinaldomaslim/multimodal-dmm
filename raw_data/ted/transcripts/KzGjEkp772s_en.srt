1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
How many Creationists do we have in the room?

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy --

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:43,000
would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes.

5
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's all right.

6
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution.

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The World Wide Web? Not so sure.

8
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.

9
0:00:55,000 --> 0:01:01,000
What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity

10
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life,

11
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules?

12
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And yet people are interestingly resistant

13
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking.

14
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that,

15
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.

16
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture,

17
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.

18
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It climbs up to the top, and it falls,

19
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs --

20
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.

21
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of?

22
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?

23
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
What's in it for the ant?

24
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.

25
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Well then, why is it doing this?

26
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Is it just a fluke?

27
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.

28
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's a little brain worm.

29
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow

30
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in order to continue its life cycle.

31
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,

32
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,

33
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:42,000
crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.

34
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So there's nothing in it for the ant.

35
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,

36
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
inducing suicidal behavior.

37
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
Pretty scary.

38
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, does anything like that happen with human beings?

39
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.

40
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Well, it may already have occurred to you

41
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah."

42
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Well, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.

43
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population

44
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:42,000
has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?

45
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
No, it's worse than that.

46
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Most people have.

47
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

48
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
There are a lot of ideas to die for.

49
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire.

50
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

51
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Justice. Truth. Communism.

52
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Many people have laid down their lives for communism,

53
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and many have laid down their lives for capitalism.

54
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.

55
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.

56
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They're infectious.

57
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about "infectious repititis."

58
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It was a term of abuse, in effect.

59
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is unthinking engineering.

60
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on

61
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.

62
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's "infectious repetitis,"

63
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens

64
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so that we can understand the conditions of infection.

65
0:04:54,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.

66
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards

67
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is that people ask us what the meaning of life is.

68
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And you have to have a bumper sticker,

69
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you know. You have to have a statement.

70
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, this is mine.

71
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are

72
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and dedicate your life to it.

73
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Most of us -- now that the "Me Decade" is well in the past --

74
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
now we actually do this.

75
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:34,000
One set of ideas or another

76
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.

77
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This is what our summum bonum is.

78
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.

79
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, this is a profound biological effect.

80
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.

81
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And no other species does anything at all like it.

82
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Well, how are we going to think about this?

83
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.

84
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Unmistakable.

85
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this?

86
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together?

87
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The idea of replicating ideas;

88
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.

89
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term "memes,"

90
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea

91
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in his book "The Selfish Gene."

92
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now here am I talking about his idea.

93
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.

94
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But it's everybody's idea now.

95
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And he's not responsible for what I say about memes.

96
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I'm responsible for what I say about memes.

97
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Actually, I think we're all responsible

98
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:59,000
for not just the intended effects of our ideas,

99
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but for their likely misuses.

100
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,

101
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that these ideas not be abused and misused.

102
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.

103
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And it's just about a full-time job

104
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:2,000
trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas

105
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:28,000
from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.

106
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So we have to keep plugging away,

107
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
trying to correct the misapprehensions

108
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.

109
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But it is a problem.

110
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,

111
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.

112
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So let me just point out: memes are like viruses.

113
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:,000
That's what Richard said, back in '93.

114
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And you might think, "Well, how can that be?

115
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?"

116
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications

117
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but -- what's a virus?

118
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.

119
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

120
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
That is, there is something about it

121
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.

122
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.

123
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:36,000
What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?

124
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Not silicon.

125
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.

126
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
What's a word made of?

127
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Sometimes when people say, "Do memes exist?"

128
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I say, "Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?"

129
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:58,000
If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.

130
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.

131
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
There are different species of memes.

132
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?

133
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Simple, beautiful furniture?

134
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And, of course, they're basically extinct now.

135
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom

136
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is that one should be celibate.

137
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Not just the priests. Everybody.

138
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter)

139
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But in fact that's not why they went extinct.

140
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
They survived as long as they did

141
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
at a time when the social safety nets weren't there.

142
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And there were lots of widows and orphans,

143
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
people like that, who needed a foster home.

144
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And so they had a ready supply of converts.

145
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And they could keep it going.

146
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
And, in principle, it could've gone on forever,

147
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.

148
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The idea being passed on through proselytizing,

149
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
instead of through the gene line.

150
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact

151
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that they're not being passed on genetically.

152
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:24,000
A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.

153
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:32,000
After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.

154
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.

155
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's part of their plan.

156
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They don't have to have minds to have a plan.

157
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I'm just going to draw your attention to just one

158
0:10:52,000 --> 0:11:,000
of the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.

159
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I've not time to go into more of it.

160
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, "Guns, Germs and Steel,"

161
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:13,000
he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,

162
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere --

163
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that conquered the rest of the world.

164
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:27,000
When European explorers and travelers spread out,

165
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
they brought with them the germs

166
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that they had become essentially immune to,

167
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that they had learned how to tolerate over

168
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:38,000
hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,

169
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.

170
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people,

171
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
who had no immunity to them at all.

172
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And we're doing it again.

173
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We're doing it this time with toxic ideas.

174
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others --

175
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
spoke about all the wonderful things

176
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that are happening when our ideas get spread out,

177
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:11,000
thanks to all the new technology all over the world.

178
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.

179
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world

180
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:3,000
thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.

181
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Now, this has been realized for some time.

182
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,

183
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:44,000
one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.

184
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:49,000
"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests,

185
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:55,000
ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations." Memes.

186
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:59,000
These memes are spreading around the world

187
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and they are wiping out whole cultures.

188
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They are wiping out languages.

189
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They are wiping out traditions and practices.

190
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste

191
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to people that haven't developed the immunity.

192
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.

193
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off.

194
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
They're like a mild cold.

195
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
They're not a big deal for us.

196
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But we should recognize that for many people in the world,

197
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:46,000
they are a big deal.

198
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And we should be very alert to this.

199
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
As we spread our education and our technology,

200
0:13:52,000 --> 0:14:,000
one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes

201
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes

202
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
as a dire threat to their favorite memes --

203
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
the memes that they are prepared to die for.

204
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?

205
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
That is not the job of the science of memetics.

206
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.

207
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This is not the place for hate and anger.

208
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:36,000
If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.

209
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But the way to deal with that is to do science,

210
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.

211
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Get the facts.

212
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Work out the implications.

213
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:57,000
There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts

214
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and can figure out the best thing to do.

215
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.

216
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
You will never annihilate the germs.

217
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:13,000
What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like

218
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that will encourage the evolution of avirulence.

219
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:26,000
That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations

220
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
of the most toxic varieties.

221
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
That's all the time I have,

222
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
so thank you very much for your attention.

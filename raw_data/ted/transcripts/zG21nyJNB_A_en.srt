2
0:00:15.662,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I grew up in Bihar, India's poorest state,

3
0:00:20.671,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I remember when I was six years old,

4
0:00:24.137,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I remember coming home one day to find a cart

5
0:00:27.903,000 --> 0:00:32,000
full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep.

6
0:00:33.224,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My brothers and I dug in,

7
0:00:36.713,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and that's when my father came home.

8
0:00:40.001,000 --> 0:00:45,000
He was livid, and I still remember how we cried

9
0:00:45.465,000 --> 0:00:49,000
when that cart with our half-eaten sweets

10
0:00:49.529,000 --> 0:00:52,000
was pulled away from us.

11
0:00:52.746,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Later, I understood why my father got so upset.

12
0:00:57.547,000 --> 0:01:,000
Those sweets were a bribe

13
0:01:00.772,000 --> 0:01:03,000
from a contractor who was trying to get my father

14
0:01:04.353,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to award him a government contract.

15
0:01:07.816,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar,

16
0:01:12.477,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and he had developed a firm stance against corruption,

17
0:01:17.08,000 --> 0:01:21,000
even though he was harassed and threatened.

18
0:01:21.128,000 --> 0:01:24,000
His was a lonely struggle, because Bihar

19
0:01:24.496,000 --> 0:01:27,000
was also India's most corrupt state,

20
0:01:28.233,000 --> 0:01:31,000
where public officials were enriching themselves,

21
0:01:31.995,000 --> 0:01:35,000
[rather] than serving the poor who had no means

22
0:01:36.088,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to express their anguish if their children

23
0:01:40.034,000 --> 0:01:43,000
had no food or no schooling.

24
0:01:43.867,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I experienced this most viscerally

25
0:01:48.224,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty.

26
0:01:54.522,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And as I went village to village,

27
0:01:58.339,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I remember one day, when I was famished and exhausted,

28
0:02:04.851,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I was almost collapsing

29
0:02:07.17,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in a scorching heat under a tree,

30
0:02:10.2,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and just at that time, one of the poorest men in that village

31
0:02:16.259,000 --> 0:02:21,000
invited me into his hut and graciously fed me.

32
0:02:22.175,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Only I later realized that what he fed me

33
0:02:26.823,000 --> 0:02:31,000
was food for his entire family for two days.

34
0:02:32.566,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This profound gift of generosity

35
0:02:36.989,000 --> 0:02:41,000
challenged and changed the very purpose of my life.

36
0:02:42.267,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I resolved to give back.

37
0:02:46.039,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Later, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight

38
0:02:50.343,000 --> 0:02:55,000
such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries.

39
0:02:56.111,000 --> 0:03:01,000
My initial work focused on Uganda, where I focused

40
0:03:01.143,000 --> 0:03:05,000
on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda

41
0:03:05.371,000 --> 0:03:07,000
so they could access our loans.

42
0:03:08.2,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But after we disbursed the loans, I remember

43
0:03:11.331,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools

44
0:03:16.049,000 --> 0:03:18,000
without textbooks or teachers,

45
0:03:18.833,000 --> 0:03:2,000
new health clinics without drugs,

46
0:03:21.753,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the poor once again without any voice or recourse.

47
0:03:27.536,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It was Bihar all over again.

48
0:03:31.112,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Bihar represents the challenge of development:

49
0:03:35.072,000 --> 0:03:38,000
abject poverty surrounded by corruption.

50
0:03:38.983,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Globally, 1.3 billion people live on less than

51
0:03:43.243,000 --> 0:03:47,000
$1.25 a day, and the work I did in Uganda

52
0:03:47.952,000 --> 0:03:51,000
represents the traditional approach to these problems

53
0:03:52.883,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that has been practiced since 1944,

54
0:03:57.175,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when winners of World War II, 500 founding fathers,

55
0:04:02.795,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and one lonely founding mother,

56
0:04:06.231,000 --> 0:04:08,000
gathered in New Hampshire, USA,

57
0:04:08.658,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to establish the Bretton Woods institutions,

58
0:04:11.277,000 --> 0:04:12,000
including the World Bank.

59
0:04:13.082,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And that traditional approach to development

60
0:04:16.382,000 --> 0:04:19,000
had three key elements. First, transfer of resources

61
0:04:20.318,000 --> 0:04:21,000
from rich countries in the North

62
0:04:22.269,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to poorer countries in the South,

63
0:04:24.766,000 --> 0:04:26,000
accompanied by reform prescriptions.

64
0:04:27.659,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Second, the development institutions that channeled

65
0:04:31.225,000 --> 0:04:35,000
these transfers were opaque, with little transparency

66
0:04:35.987,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of what they financed or what results they achieved.

67
0:04:39.787,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And third, the engagement in developing countries

68
0:04:43.7,000 --> 0:04:46,000
was with a narrow set of government elites

69
0:04:46.982,000 --> 0:04:49,000
with little interaction with the citizens, who are

70
0:04:50.296,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance.

71
0:04:54.581,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Today, each of these elements is opening up

72
0:04:58.782,000 --> 0:05:01,000
due to dramatic changes in the global environment.

73
0:05:02.142,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Open knowledge, open aid, open governance,

74
0:05:05.837,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and together, they represent three key shifts

75
0:05:09.582,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that are transforming development

76
0:05:12.352,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and that also hold greater hope for the problems

77
0:05:16.065,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.

78
0:05:20.638,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The first key shift is open knowledge.

79
0:05:23.604,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You know, developing countries today will not simply

80
0:05:27.165,000 --> 0:05:3,000
accept solutions that are handed down to them

81
0:05:30.762,000 --> 0:05:33,000
by the U.S., Europe or the World Bank.

82
0:05:34.389,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They get their inspiration, their hope,

83
0:05:37.224,000 --> 0:05:39,000
their practical know-how,

84
0:05:39.624,000 --> 0:05:42,000
from successful emerging economies in the South.

85
0:05:43.175,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They want to know how China lifted 500 million people

86
0:05:47.855,000 --> 0:05:5,000
out of poverty in 30 years,

87
0:05:51.518,000 --> 0:05:53,000
how Mexico's Oportunidades program

88
0:05:54.464,000 --> 0:05:58,000
improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children.

89
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows,

90
0:06:04.822,000 --> 0:06:08,000
not just traveling North to South, but South to South,

91
0:06:09.755,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and even South to North,

92
0:06:12.058,000 --> 0:06:17,000
with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City.

93
0:06:17.8,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up,

94
0:06:21.648,000 --> 0:06:23,000
so too are the development institutions

95
0:06:24.488,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that channeled these transfers.

96
0:06:27.015,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is the second shift: open aid.

97
0:06:30.884,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Recently, the World Bank opened its vault of data

98
0:06:34.434,000 --> 0:06:38,000
for public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators

99
0:06:39.297,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for 200 countries over 50 years,

100
0:06:43.666,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and it launched a global competition to crowdsource

101
0:06:47.644,000 --> 0:06:5,000
innovative apps using this data.

102
0:06:51.311,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Development institutions today are also opening

103
0:06:54.484,000 --> 0:06:57,000
for public scrutiny the projects they finance.

104
0:06:58.298,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya,

105
0:07:02.563,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors

106
0:07:07.282,000 --> 0:07:1,000
are located, and the darker the shade of green,

107
0:07:11.274,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the more the number of out-of-school children.

108
0:07:14.634,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So this simple mashup reveals that donors

109
0:07:18.77,000 --> 0:07:2,000
have not financed any schools in the areas

110
0:07:21.746,000 --> 0:07:23,000
with the most out-of-school children,

111
0:07:23.854,000 --> 0:07:27,000
provoking new questions. Is development assistance

112
0:07:27.946,000 --> 0:07:31,000
targeting those who most need our help?

113
0:07:32.565,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In this manner, the World Bank has now GeoMapped

114
0:07:35.467,000 --> 0:07:39,000
30,000 project activities in 143 countries,

115
0:07:40.409,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and donors are using a common platform

116
0:07:43.585,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to map all their projects.

117
0:07:46.53,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency

118
0:07:51.392,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and accountability of aid.

119
0:07:54.234,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And this leads me to the third, and in my view,

120
0:07:57.23,000 --> 0:08:,000
the most significant shift in development:

121
0:08:00.562,000 --> 0:08:04,000
open governance. Governments today are opening up

122
0:08:04.777,000 --> 0:08:07,000
just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability.

123
0:08:08.754,000 --> 0:08:12,000
From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India,

124
0:08:12.784,000 --> 0:08:14,000
using mobile phones and social media

125
0:08:15.518,000 --> 0:08:17,000
not just for political accountability

126
0:08:18.132,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but also for development accountability.

127
0:08:22.277,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Are governments delivering services to the citizens?

128
0:08:26.749,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So for instance, several governments in Africa

129
0:08:30.894,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public.

130
0:08:35.918,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But, you know, there is a big difference between a budget

131
0:08:39.321,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that's public and a budget that's accessible.

132
0:08:43.358,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is a public budget. (Laughter)

133
0:08:48.278,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And as you can see, it's not really accessible

134
0:08:51.383,000 --> 0:08:53,000
or understandable to an ordinary citizen

135
0:08:54.102,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.

136
0:08:59.1,000 --> 0:09:02,000
To tackle this problem, governments are using new tools

137
0:09:03.035,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to visualize the budget so it's more understandable

138
0:09:07.718,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to the public.

139
0:09:09.918,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In this map from Moldova, the green color shows

140
0:09:13.852,000 --> 0:09:17,000
those districts that have low spending on schools

141
0:09:17.94,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but good educational outcomes,

142
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and the red color shows the opposite.

143
0:09:23.509,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents

144
0:09:30.036,000 --> 0:09:33,000
into a publicly understandable visual,

145
0:09:33.79,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and what's exciting is that with this openness,

146
0:09:37.556,000 --> 0:09:4,000
there are today new opportunities for citizens

147
0:09:41.414,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to give feedback and engage with government.

148
0:09:44.94,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So in the Philippines today, parents and students

149
0:09:49.323,000 --> 0:09:53,000
can give real-time feedback on a website,

150
0:09:53.47,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Checkmyschool.org, or using SMS, whether teachers

151
0:09:58.562,000 --> 0:10:,000
and textbooks are showing up in school,

152
0:10:01.356,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.

153
0:10:06.007,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And the government is responsive. So for instance,

154
0:10:08.859,000 --> 0:10:12,000
when it was reported on this website that 800 students

155
0:10:13.369,000 --> 0:10:17,000
were at risk because school repairs had stalled

156
0:10:17.555,000 --> 0:10:19,000
due to corruption, the Department of Education

157
0:10:20.146,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in the Philippines took swift action.

158
0:10:23.1,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And you know what's exciting is that this innovation

159
0:10:26.797,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines

160
0:10:31.459,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond.

161
0:10:35.804,000 --> 0:10:39,000
In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished

162
0:10:40.063,000 --> 0:10:43,000
community was able to use these tools

163
0:10:43.617,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to voice its aspirations.

164
0:10:46.589,000 --> 0:10:48,000
This is what the map of Tandale looked like

165
0:10:49.508,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in August, 2011. But within a few weeks,

166
0:10:53.861,000 --> 0:10:57,000
university students were able to use mobile phones

167
0:10:58.327,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and an open-source platform to dramatically map

168
0:11:02.877,000 --> 0:11:05,000
the entire community infrastructure.

169
0:11:06.364,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And what is very exciting is that citizens were then

170
0:11:10.829,000 --> 0:11:15,000
able to give feedback as to which health or water points

171
0:11:15.836,000 --> 0:11:17,000
were not working, aggregated

172
0:11:18.71,000 --> 0:11:2,000
in the red bubbles that you see,

173
0:11:21.31,000 --> 0:11:25,000
which together provides a graphic visual

174
0:11:25.908,000 --> 0:11:29,000
of the collective voices of the poor.

175
0:11:30.363,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Today, even Bihar is turning around and opening up

176
0:11:35.973,000 --> 0:11:37,000
under a committed leadership that is making government

177
0:11:38.845,000 --> 0:11:43,000
transparent, accessible and responsive to the poor.

178
0:11:44.013,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But, you know, in many parts of the world,

179
0:11:47.541,000 --> 0:11:49,000
governments are not interested in opening up

180
0:11:50.519,000 --> 0:11:55,000
or in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge

181
0:11:55.636,000 --> 0:11:59,000
for those who want to change the system.

182
0:11:59.98,000 --> 0:12:02,000
These are the lonely warriors

183
0:12:03.549,000 --> 0:12:06,000
like my father and many, many others,

184
0:12:07.013,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and a key frontier of development work

185
0:12:10.137,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is to help these lonely warriors join hands

186
0:12:15.333,000 --> 0:12:18,000
so they can together overcome the odds.

187
0:12:18.874,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So for instance, today, in Ghana, courageous reformers

188
0:12:23.617,000 --> 0:12:26,000
from civil society, Parliament and government,

189
0:12:26.817,000 --> 0:12:3,000
have forged a coalition for transparent contracts

190
0:12:31.009,000 --> 0:12:35,000
in the oil sector, and, galvanized by this,

191
0:12:35.065,000 --> 0:12:4,000
reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts.

192
0:12:40.745,000 --> 0:12:44,000
These examples give new hope, new possibility

193
0:12:45.673,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to the problems I witnessed in Uganda

194
0:12:48.785,000 --> 0:12:53,000
or that my father confronted in Bihar.

195
0:12:53.887,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Two years ago, on April 8th, 2010, I called my father.

196
0:13:00.856,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It was very late at night, and at age 80,

197
0:13:06.254,000 --> 0:13:1,000
he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation

198
0:13:11.055,000 --> 0:13:14,000
against corruption in a road project.

199
0:13:14.669,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Though he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court

200
0:13:19.287,000 --> 0:13:23,000
himself the next day. He won the ruling,

201
0:13:23.501,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but later that very evening,

202
0:13:25.523,000 --> 0:13:29,000
he fell, and he died.

203
0:13:30.117,000 --> 0:13:34,000
He fought till the end, increasingly passionate

204
0:13:35.061,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that to combat corruption and poverty,

205
0:13:39.006,000 --> 0:13:43,000
not only did government officials need to be honest,

206
0:13:43.013,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but citizens needed to join together

207
0:13:46.262,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to make their voices heard.

208
0:13:49.157,000 --> 0:13:53,000
These became the two bookends of his life,

209
0:13:54.018,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and the journey he traveled in between

210
0:13:56.732,000 --> 0:14:,000
mirrored the changing development landscape.

211
0:14:01.517,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Today, I'm inspired by these changes, and I'm excited

212
0:14:06.47,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that at the World Bank, we are embracing

213
0:14:09.574,000 --> 0:14:12,000
these new directions, a significant departure

214
0:14:12.663,000 --> 0:14:15,000
from my work in Uganda 20 years ago.

215
0:14:16.541,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We need to radically open up development

216
0:14:20.082,000 --> 0:14:22,000
so knowledge flows in multiple directions,

217
0:14:22.886,000 --> 0:14:26,000
inspiring practitioners, so aid becomes transparent,

218
0:14:27.677,000 --> 0:14:31,000
accountable and effective, so governments open up

219
0:14:31.836,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and citizens are engaged and empowered

220
0:14:35.782,000 --> 0:14:36,000
with reformers in government.

221
0:14:37.441,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We need to accelerate these shifts.

222
0:14:40.638,000 --> 0:14:45,000
If we do, we will find that the collective voices

223
0:14:45.638,000 --> 0:14:49,000
of the poor will be heard in Bihar,

224
0:14:50.028,000 --> 0:14:52,000
in Uganda, and beyond.

225
0:14:52.25,000 --> 0:14:56,000
We will find that textbooks and teachers

226
0:14:56.325,000 --> 0:14:59,000
will show up in schools for their children.

227
0:14:59.362,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We will find that these children, too,

228
0:15:03.445,000 --> 0:15:09,000
have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty.

229
0:15:09.563,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Thank you. (Applause)

230
0:15:12.778,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)

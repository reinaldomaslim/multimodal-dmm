1
0:00:12.719,000 --> 0:00:19,000
malaria is still one of the biggest

2
0:00:16.36,000 --> 0:00:22,000
killers on the planet despite us making

3
0:00:19.93,000 --> 0:00:24,000
significant progress in the last 20

4
0:00:22.54,000 --> 0:00:28,000
years half the world's population is

5
0:00:25.57,000 --> 0:00:29,000
still at risk from this disease in fact

6
0:00:28.689,000 --> 0:00:33,000
every two minutes

7
0:00:29.829,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a child under the age of two dies from

8
0:00:33.82,000 --> 0:00:39,000
malaria our progress has undoubtedly

9
0:00:36.43,000 --> 0:00:43,000
stalled now we face many challenges when

10
0:00:40.06,000 --> 0:00:45,000
it comes to tackling malaria but one of

11
0:00:44.08,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the problems that we have is actually

12
0:00:45.82,000 --> 0:00:49,000
finding people who are infected with

13
0:00:48.37,000 --> 0:00:52,000
malaria in the first place so for

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
example if people have some level of

15
0:00:52.63,000 --> 0:00:56,000
immunity to the disease then they can

16
0:00:55.03,000 --> 0:00:59,000
develop an infection and become

17
0:00:57.31,000 --> 0:01:01,000
infectious and still pass it on but not

18
0:00:59.5,000 --> 0:01:03,000
actually develop any symptoms and that

19
0:01:01.329,000 --> 0:01:04,000
can be a big problem because how do you

20
0:01:03.61,000 --> 0:01:07,000
find those people it's like looking for

21
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a needle in a haystack now scientists

22
0:01:08.229,000 --> 0:01:12,000
have been trying to solve this problem

23
0:01:10.09,000 --> 0:01:14,000
for some years but what I want to talk

24
0:01:13.03,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to you about today is that that solution

25
0:01:14.95,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to this problem may have been right

26
0:01:17.38,000 --> 0:01:22,000
under our noses this whole time now that

27
0:01:21.009,000 --> 0:01:24,000
was a bit of a heavy start with lots of

28
0:01:22.509,000 --> 0:01:25,000
really important and serious statistics

29
0:01:24.249,000 --> 0:01:28,000
so I want us all to just relax a little

30
0:01:26.38,000 --> 0:01:29,000
bit now help me to relax a little bit as

31
0:01:28.389,000 --> 0:01:34,000
well so why don't we all just take a

32
0:01:29.74,000 --> 0:01:37,000
nice deep breath in Wow and sigh okay

33
0:01:35.259,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and for I'm gonna get blown away okay

34
0:01:38.229,000 --> 0:01:41,000
now I want you to do it again but this

35
0:01:39.729,000 --> 0:01:43,000
time I want you to do it just through

36
0:01:41.77,000 --> 0:01:46,000
your nose and I want you to really sense

37
0:01:43.959,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the environment around you and in fact I

38
0:01:47.02,000 --> 0:01:5,000
want you to really smell the person

39
0:01:48.85,000 --> 0:01:5,000
who's sitting next to you even if you

40
0:01:50.139,000 --> 0:01:53,000
don't know them I don't care

41
0:01:51.429,000 --> 0:01:55,000
lean in get your nose right into their

42
0:01:53.529,000 --> 0:01:57,000
armpit come on stop being so British

43
0:01:55.81,000 --> 0:01:59,000
about it get your nose into the armpit

44
0:01:57.939,000 --> 0:02:06,000
have a good old sniff see what you can

45
0:02:00.729,000 --> 0:02:08,000
smell now each and every one of us would

46
0:02:07.359,000 --> 0:02:11,000
have had a very different sensory

47
0:02:09.63,000 --> 0:02:12,000
experience there some of us will have

48
0:02:11.5,000 --> 0:02:15,000
smelt something rather pleasant perhaps

49
0:02:13.51,000 --> 0:02:16,000
somebody's perfume some of us might have

50
0:02:15.7,000 --> 0:02:19,000
smelt something a little bit less

51
0:02:17.41,000 --> 0:02:21,000
pleasant perhaps perhaps somebody's bad

52
0:02:20.62,000 --> 0:02:23,000
breath or

53
0:02:21.43,000 --> 0:02:27,000
or body order maybe you even smelled

54
0:02:23.65,000 --> 0:02:28,000
your own body order but you know there's

55
0:02:27.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
probably a good reason that some of us

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
don't like certain body smells

57
0:02:33.18,000 --> 0:02:39,000
throughout history there have been many

58
0:02:37.06,000 --> 0:02:42,000
examples of diseases being associated

59
0:02:39.43,000 --> 0:02:44,000
with a smell so for example typhoid

60
0:02:42.099,000 --> 0:02:46,000
apparently smells like baked brown bread

61
0:02:45.31,000 --> 0:02:48,000
well that's quite a nice smell isn't it

62
0:02:46.93,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but it starts to get a little bit worse

63
0:02:48.9,000 --> 0:02:54,000
TB smells like stale beer and yellow

64
0:02:52.239,000 --> 0:02:56,000
fever smells like the inside of a

65
0:02:55.09,000 --> 0:02:58,000
butcher shop like raw meat and in fact

66
0:02:57.19,000 --> 0:03:01,000
when you look at the sort of words that

67
0:02:59.019,000 --> 0:03:05,000
are used to describe diseases you tend

68
0:03:01.569,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to find these words rotting foul putrid

69
0:03:05.29,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or pungent so it's no surprise then that

70
0:03:08.98,000 --> 0:03:12,000
smell and body odour gets a bit of a bad

71
0:03:11.079,000 --> 0:03:17,000
reputation if I was to say to you

72
0:03:13.569,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you smell No you're gonna take that not

73
0:03:17.379,000 --> 0:03:21,000
exactly as a compliment are you but you

74
0:03:20.019,000 --> 0:03:25,000
do smell you've just found that out you

75
0:03:21.879,000 --> 0:03:26,000
do smell it's a scientific fact and I'd

76
0:03:25.359,000 --> 0:03:28,000
quite like to turn that on its head what

77
0:03:27.069,000 --> 0:03:3,000
if we can actually think about smell in

78
0:03:28.419,000 --> 0:03:31,000
a positive way what if we could put it

79
0:03:30.43,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to good use what if we could detect the

80
0:03:31.84,000 --> 0:03:36,000
chemicals that are given off by our

81
0:03:33.639,000 --> 0:03:39,000
bodies when we're ill and use that to

82
0:03:36.97,000 --> 0:03:41,000
diagnose people now we need to develop

83
0:03:40.12,000 --> 0:03:44,000
good sensors that would allow us to do

84
0:03:42.01,000 --> 0:03:48,000
this but it turns out that the world's

85
0:03:44.68,000 --> 0:03:5,000
best sensors actually already exist and

86
0:03:48.099,000 --> 0:03:53,000
they're called animals now animals are

87
0:03:51.37,000 --> 0:03:56,000
built to smell they live their everyday

88
0:03:53.229,000 --> 0:03:58,000
lives according to their nose they sense

89
0:03:56.56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the environment which tells them really

90
0:03:58.359,000 --> 0:04:02,000
important information about how to stay

91
0:04:00.4,000 --> 0:04:03,000
alive essentially just imagine a

92
0:04:02.409,000 --> 0:04:05,000
mosquito imagine you're a mosquito and

93
0:04:03.76,000 --> 0:04:06,000
you've just flown in from outside and

94
0:04:05.47,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you've entered this room now you're

95
0:04:07.359,000 --> 0:04:11,000
going to be entering a really complex

96
0:04:09.099,000 --> 0:04:13,000
world you can be bombarded with smells

97
0:04:11.44,000 --> 0:04:14,000
from everywhere we've just find out that

98
0:04:13.18,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we are really smelly beasts each one of

99
0:04:15.37,000 --> 0:04:18,000
us is producing different volatile

100
0:04:17.169,000 --> 0:04:21,000
chemicals it's not just one chemical Ibo

101
0:04:19.18,000 --> 0:04:22,000
lots and lots of chemicals but it's not

102
0:04:21.549,000 --> 0:04:24,000
just you it's the seats you're sitting

103
0:04:23.05,000 --> 0:04:26,000
on the carpet the glue that holds the

104
0:04:25.21,000 --> 0:04:28,000
carpet to the floor the paint on the

105
0:04:26.77,000 --> 0:04:3,000
walls the trees outside everything

106
0:04:28.75,000 --> 0:04:32,000
around you is producing an order and

107
0:04:31.27,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it's a really complex world that the

108
0:04:32.86,000 --> 0:04:37,000
mosquito has to fly through

109
0:04:35.05,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and it has to to find you within that

110
0:04:38.319,000 --> 0:04:41,000
really complex world and each and every

111
0:04:40.15,000 --> 0:04:43,000
one of you will know come on hands up

112
0:04:42.099,000 --> 0:04:46,000
who always gets bitten by mosquitoes and

113
0:04:44.009,000 --> 0:04:48,000
hands up who never gets bitten there's

114
0:04:46.24,000 --> 0:04:5,000
always one or two really annoying people

115
0:04:48.039,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that never get bitten but the mosquito

116
0:04:50.68,000 --> 0:04:54,000
has a really hard job to find you and

117
0:04:52.78,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that's all to do with the way you smell

118
0:04:55.15,000 --> 0:04:58,000
people who don't attract mosquitoes

119
0:04:56.83,000 --> 0:05:01,000
smell repellent and what we know is

120
0:04:59.139,000 --> 0:05:06,000
there I should clarify repellent to

121
0:05:02.74,000 --> 0:05:08,000
mosquitoes not to people and what we

122
0:05:06.759,000 --> 0:05:11,000
know now is that that is actually

123
0:05:09.03,000 --> 0:05:13,000
controlled by our genes but mosquitoes

124
0:05:12.13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
are able to do that because they have a

125
0:05:13.659,000 --> 0:05:17,000
highly sophisticated sense of smell and

126
0:05:16.06,000 --> 0:05:2,000
they're able to see through all this

127
0:05:17.71,000 --> 0:05:22,000
sort of order sludge to find you that

128
0:05:20.38,000 --> 0:05:26,000
individual and bite you as a blood meal

129
0:05:23.49,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but what would happen if one of you was

130
0:05:26.979,000 --> 0:05:29,000
infected with malaria well let's just

131
0:05:29.38,000 --> 0:05:32,000
have a quick look at the malaria

132
0:05:30.4,000 --> 0:05:34,000
lifecycle so it's quite complex but

133
0:05:33.19,000 --> 0:05:37,000
basically what happens is a mosquito has

134
0:05:35.199,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to bite somebody to become infected once

135
0:05:37.389,000 --> 0:05:41,000
it bites an infected person the parasite

136
0:05:39.789,000 --> 0:05:42,000
travels through the mouth part into the

137
0:05:41.68,000 --> 0:05:45,000
gut and then bursts through the gut

138
0:05:43.539,000 --> 0:05:47,000
creates cysts and then the parasites

139
0:05:46.18,000 --> 0:05:49,000
replicates and then they make a journey

140
0:05:48.4,000 --> 0:05:52,000
from the gut all the way to the saliva

141
0:05:50.11,000 --> 0:05:54,000
glands where they are then injected back

142
0:05:52.99,000 --> 0:05:55,000
into another person when the mosquito

143
0:05:54.819,000 --> 0:05:57,000
bites because it injects saliva as it

144
0:05:56.349,000 --> 0:05:59,000
bites then inside the human it goes

145
0:05:58.479,000 --> 0:06:01,000
through a whole other cycle a whole

146
0:06:00.159,000 --> 0:06:03,000
other part of the life cycle so it goes

147
0:06:01.93,000 --> 0:06:04,000
through a liver stage change of shape

148
0:06:03.49,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and then comes out into the bloodstream

149
0:06:05.05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
again and eventually that person will

150
0:06:07.509,000 --> 0:06:11,000
become infectious now one thing we know

151
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
about the parasite world is that they

152
0:06:11.86,000 --> 0:06:15,000
are incredibly good at manipulating

153
0:06:13.84,000 --> 0:06:16,000
their hosts to enhance their own

154
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
transmission to make sure that they get

155
0:06:17.56,000 --> 0:06:21,000
passed onwards if this was to happen in

156
0:06:20.169,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the malaria system it might make sense

157
0:06:22.029,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that it would be something to do with

158
0:06:23.8,000 --> 0:06:27,000
order that they manipulate because order

159
0:06:26.469,000 --> 0:06:29,000
is the key or does the thing that links

160
0:06:27.969,000 --> 0:06:31,000
us between mosquitoes that's how they

161
0:06:29.68,000 --> 0:06:34,000
find us this is what we call the malaria

162
0:06:32.74,000 --> 0:06:35,000
manipulation hypothesis and it's

163
0:06:34.99,000 --> 0:06:38,000
something that we've been working on

164
0:06:36.19,000 --> 0:06:41,000
over the last few years so one of the

165
0:06:39.49,000 --> 0:06:43,000
first things that we wanted to do in our

166
0:06:41.77,000 --> 0:06:45,000
study was to find out whether an

167
0:06:44.08,000 --> 0:06:48,000
infection with malaria actually makes

168
0:06:46.27,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you more attractive to mosquitoes or not

169
0:06:48.67,000 --> 0:06:51,000
so in Kenya with our colleagues we

170
0:06:50.89,000 --> 0:06:54,000
designed an experiment where we had

171
0:06:52.57,000 --> 0:06:56,000
participants children in Kenya sleep

172
0:06:55.21,000 --> 0:06:58,000
inside tents the order from the tent was

173
0:06:57.46,000 --> 0:07:,000
blown to a chamber which contained

174
0:06:59.08,000 --> 0:07:03,000
mosquitoes and the mosquitoes would

175
0:07:01.42,000 --> 0:07:05,000
behaviorally respond they would fly

176
0:07:03.49,000 --> 0:07:06,000
towards or fly away from the orders

177
0:07:05.71,000 --> 0:07:07,000
depending on whether they liked them or

178
0:07:07.18,000 --> 0:07:09,000
not

179
0:07:07.9,000 --> 0:07:1,000
now some of the participants were

180
0:07:09.49,000 --> 0:07:14,000
infected with malaria and some of them

181
0:07:11.59,000 --> 0:07:17,000
were uninfected but importantly none of

182
0:07:14.71,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the children had any symptoms whatsoever

183
0:07:17.88,000 --> 0:07:22,000
now when we find and saw the results it

184
0:07:21.25,000 --> 0:07:24,000
was really quite staggering people who

185
0:07:23.05,000 --> 0:07:27,000
were infected with malaria were

186
0:07:24.94,000 --> 0:07:27,000
significantly more attractive than

187
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
people who were uninfected so let me

188
0:07:28.93,000 --> 0:07:31,000
explain this graph we have a number of

189
0:07:30.4,000 --> 0:07:33,000
mosquitoes attracted to the child and we

190
0:07:32.5,000 --> 0:07:35,000
have two sets of data before treatment

191
0:07:34.21,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and after treatment on the far left hand

192
0:07:36.46,000 --> 0:07:4,000
side that bar represents a group of

193
0:07:38.44,000 --> 0:07:42,000
people who are uninfected and as we move

194
0:07:40.6,000 --> 0:07:43,000
towards the right hand side these people

195
0:07:42.55,000 --> 0:07:45,000
have become infected and they're moving

196
0:07:44.41,000 --> 0:07:47,000
towards the stage that they're

197
0:07:45.7,000 --> 0:07:49,000
infectious so right at the stage when

198
0:07:48.01,000 --> 0:07:52,000
people are infectious it's when they are

199
0:07:49.96,000 --> 0:07:53,000
significantly more attractive in this

200
0:07:52.87,000 --> 0:07:56,000
study then what we did is we obviously

201
0:07:54.52,000 --> 0:07:58,000
gave the children treatment to clear the

202
0:07:56.95,000 --> 0:08:,000
parasites and then we tested them again

203
0:07:58.66,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and what we find was that highly

204
0:08:01.21,000 --> 0:08:04,000
attractive trait that was there

205
0:08:03.22,000 --> 0:08:06,000
disappeared after they had cleared the

206
0:08:05.14,000 --> 0:08:08,000
infection so it wasn't just that the

207
0:08:06.55,000 --> 0:08:1,000
people were more attractive it was that

208
0:08:08.23,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the parasite was manipulating its host

209
0:08:11.08,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in some way to make it more attractive

210
0:08:13.45,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to mosquitoes standing out like a beacon

211
0:08:15.48,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to attract more mosquitoes so that it

212
0:08:18.01,000 --> 0:08:21,000
could continue its life cycle the next

213
0:08:20.32,000 --> 0:08:22,000
thing we wanted to do was find out what

214
0:08:21.79,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it was the mosquito was actually

215
0:08:23.23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
smelling what was it detecting so to do

216
0:08:25.96,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that we had to collect the body order

217
0:08:27.46,000 --> 0:08:31,000
from the participants and we did this by

218
0:08:30.07,000 --> 0:08:33,000
wrapping bags around their feet which

219
0:08:31.63,000 --> 0:08:34,000
allowed us to collect the volatile

220
0:08:33.13,000 --> 0:08:36,000
orders from their feet and feats really

221
0:08:35.08,000 --> 0:08:4,000
important to mosquitoes they really love

222
0:08:36.79,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the smell of feet especially cheesy feet

223
0:08:40.54,000 --> 0:08:44,000
anybody got cheesy feet right there

224
0:08:42.01,000 --> 0:08:46,000
mosquitoes love that smell so we focused

225
0:08:45.4,000 --> 0:08:47,000
on the feet and we collected the body

226
0:08:46.69,000 --> 0:08:5,000
order now when it comes to mosquitoes

227
0:08:48.37,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and olfaction their sense of smell it's

228
0:08:51.28,000 --> 0:08:53,000
very complex it would be really nice if

229
0:08:52.57,000 --> 0:08:56,000
there was just one chemical that they

230
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
detected but it's not that simple they

231
0:08:57.34,000 --> 0:09:02,000
have to detect a number of chemicals in

232
0:08:59.86,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the right concentration the right ratios

233
0:09:02.41,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the right combinations of chemicals so

234
0:09:05.769,000 --> 0:09:09,000
you can sort of think about it like a

235
0:09:07.029,000 --> 0:09:12,000
musical composition so you know if you

236
0:09:10.389,000 --> 0:09:13,000
get they're not wrong or you play it too

237
0:09:12.22,000 --> 0:09:15,000
loud or too soft it doesn't sound right

238
0:09:13.779,000 --> 0:09:17,000
or a recipe if you get an ingredient

239
0:09:15.73,000 --> 0:09:2,000
wrong or you cook it too long or too

240
0:09:18.04,000 --> 0:09:22,000
little it doesn't taste right or smell

241
0:09:20.829,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is the same it's made up of a suite of

242
0:09:22.81,000 --> 0:09:26,000
chemicals in the right combination

243
0:09:24.85,000 --> 0:09:28,000
now our machines in the lab are not

244
0:09:27.009,000 --> 0:09:31,000
particularly good at picking out this

245
0:09:29.019,000 --> 0:09:33,000
sort of signal it's quite complex but

246
0:09:31.36,000 --> 0:09:36,000
animals can and what we do in my

247
0:09:33.699,000 --> 0:09:39,000
laboratory is we connect micro

248
0:09:36.97,000 --> 0:09:42,000
electrodes to the antenna of a mosquito

249
0:09:40.029,000 --> 0:09:45,000
imagine how fiddly that is but what we

250
0:09:43.629,000 --> 0:09:47,000
also do is connect them to individual

251
0:09:45.459,000 --> 0:09:48,000
cells within the antenna which is

252
0:09:47.649,000 --> 0:09:49,000
incredibly definitely not want to sneeze

253
0:09:48.97,000 --> 0:09:52,000
when you're doing this experiment that's

254
0:09:50.23,000 --> 0:09:55,000
for sure but what this does is it allows

255
0:09:53.139,000 --> 0:09:57,000
us to measure the electrical response of

256
0:09:55.24,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the smell receptors in the antennae and

257
0:09:57.22,000 --> 0:10:01,000
so that we can see what a mosquito is

258
0:09:59.74,000 --> 0:10:02,000
smelling so I'm going to show you what

259
0:10:01.66,000 --> 0:10:04,000
this looks like here's an insect cell

260
0:10:03.22,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and it's responding it will respond in a

261
0:10:05.439,000 --> 0:10:08,000
second when I press this button and

262
0:10:06.819,000 --> 0:10:09,000
you'll see it sort of ticking over with

263
0:10:08.86,000 --> 0:10:11,000
this response and order will be blown

264
0:10:10.779,000 --> 0:10:12,000
over the cell and it will sort of go a

265
0:10:11.98,000 --> 0:10:14,000
bit crazy it'll sort of blow raspberry

266
0:10:13.63,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and then it will go back to its resting

267
0:10:15.61,000 --> 0:10:18,000
potential when we stop the order

268
0:10:36.86,000 --> 0:10:39,000
okay there we go so you can go home now

269
0:10:39.72,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and say that you've now seen that an

270
0:10:40.8,000 --> 0:10:44,000
insect smelling and even hearing an

271
0:10:43.77,000 --> 0:10:46,000
insect smell it's a weird concept isn't

272
0:10:45.3,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it but this works really well and this

273
0:10:47.04,000 --> 0:10:51,000
allows us to see what the insect is

274
0:10:48.63,000 --> 0:10:53,000
detecting now using this method with our

275
0:10:51.18,000 --> 0:10:55,000
malaria samples we were able to find out

276
0:10:53.76,000 --> 0:10:57,000
what the mosquito was detecting and we

277
0:10:56.07,000 --> 0:11:,000
find the malaria associated compounds

278
0:10:58.02,000 --> 0:11:02,000
mainly aldehydes a group of compounds

279
0:11:00.24,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that smelled that signified the malaria

280
0:11:02.82,000 --> 0:11:06,000
a signal here so now we know what the

281
0:11:05.25,000 --> 0:11:09,000
smell of malaria is and we've used the

282
0:11:06.9,000 --> 0:11:12,000
mosquito as a bio sensor to tell us what

283
0:11:10.11,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the smell of malaria actually is now I'd

284
0:11:13.71,000 --> 0:11:17,000
like to imagine that you could I don't

285
0:11:16.23,000 --> 0:11:2,000
know put a harness on a little mosquito

286
0:11:18.12,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and you know put it on a lead and take

287
0:11:20.55,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it out and see if we can sniff so if

288
0:11:23.04,000 --> 0:11:27,000
people in a community that goes on in my

289
0:11:25.35,000 --> 0:11:29,000
head and see whether we could actually

290
0:11:27.72,000 --> 0:11:32,000
find people with malaria but of course

291
0:11:29.91,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that's not really possible but there is

292
0:11:33.45,000 --> 0:11:37,000
an animal that we can do that with no

293
0:11:36.45,000 --> 0:11:39,000
dogs have an incredible sense of smell

294
0:11:38.43,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but there's something a little bit more

295
0:11:40.11,000 --> 0:11:43,000
special about them they have an ability

296
0:11:41.7,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to learn and most of you will be

297
0:11:43.8,000 --> 0:11:47,000
familiar with this concept at airports

298
0:11:45.81,000 --> 0:11:49,000
where dogs will go down a line and sniff

299
0:11:48.27,000 --> 0:11:53,000
out your luggage or yourself for drugs

300
0:11:50.31,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and explosives or even food as well so

301
0:11:53.61,000 --> 0:11:57,000
we wanted to know could we actually

302
0:11:54.99,000 --> 0:11:59,000
train dogs to learn the smell of malaria

303
0:11:58.56,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and so we've been working with a charity

304
0:12:00.9,000 --> 0:12:06,000
called medical detection dogs to see

305
0:12:04.95,000 --> 0:12:07,000
whether we can train them to learn the

306
0:12:06.9,000 --> 0:12:09,000
smell of malaria and we went out to the

307
0:12:08.79,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Gambia and did some more order

308
0:12:10.29,000 --> 0:12:14,000
collection on children that were

309
0:12:11.61,000 --> 0:12:15,000
infected and uninfected but this time we

310
0:12:14.43,000 --> 0:12:18,000
collected their order by making them

311
0:12:16.47,000 --> 0:12:2,000
wear socks nylon stockings to collect

312
0:12:19.2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
their body order and we brought them

313
0:12:20.73,000 --> 0:12:25,000
back to the UK and then we handed them

314
0:12:22.86,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to this charity to run the experiment

315
0:12:26.39,000 --> 0:12:31,000
now I could show you a graph and tell

316
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
you about how that experiment works but

317
0:12:31.83,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that'd be a bit dull would let now they

318
0:12:35.19,000 --> 0:12:4,000
do say never work with children or

319
0:12:37.05,000 --> 0:12:44,000
animals live but we're going to break

320
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that rule today so please welcome on

321
0:12:44.74,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the stage freya and her trainer Mark and

322
0:12:52.45,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Sarah of course this is the real star of

323
0:12:58.029,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the show

324
0:12:59.31,000 --> 0:13:04,000
okay so now what I'm gonna ask is if you

325
0:13:02.32,000 --> 0:13:06,000
can all just be just a little bit quiet

326
0:13:04.51,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and don't move around too much this is a

327
0:13:06.76,000 --> 0:13:09,000
very very strange environment for Freya

328
0:13:08.709,000 --> 0:13:12,000
she's having a good look at you guys now

329
0:13:10.38,000 --> 0:13:15,000
so let's stay as calm as possible that

330
0:13:13.27,000 --> 0:13:16,000
would be great so what we're going to do

331
0:13:15.76,000 --> 0:13:18,000
here is basically we're going to ask

332
0:13:16.959,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Freya to move down this line of

333
0:13:19.029,000 --> 0:13:23,000
contraptions here and in each one of

334
0:13:20.98,000 --> 0:13:23,000
these contraptions we have a pot and in

335
0:13:23.23,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the part is a sock that's been worn by a

336
0:13:24.91,000 --> 0:13:28,000
child in The Gambia now three of the

337
0:13:27.61,000 --> 0:13:31,000
socks had been worn by children who were

338
0:13:29.56,000 --> 0:13:34,000
uninfected and just one of the socks was

339
0:13:32.29,000 --> 0:13:35,000
worn by a child who was infected with

340
0:13:34.81,000 --> 0:13:36,000
malaria so just as you would see an

341
0:13:36.279,000 --> 0:13:39,000
airport imagine these were people and

342
0:13:37.779,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the dog is going to go down and have a

343
0:13:40.24,000 --> 0:13:45,000
good sniff and let's see if you can see

344
0:13:42.07,000 --> 0:13:46,000
when she senses the malaria and if she

345
0:13:45.31,000 --> 0:13:47,000
senses than there's there's a really

346
0:13:46.54,000 --> 0:13:48,000
tough test for her in this very strange

347
0:13:47.86,000 --> 0:13:51,000
environment so I'm going to hand over

348
0:13:49.329,000 --> 0:13:52,000
now to mark

349
0:14:08.44,000 --> 0:14:14,000
the first three okay there we go

350
0:14:12.38,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I didn't know which pot that was in mark

351
0:14:14.81,000 --> 0:14:17,000
didn't know which products and this was

352
0:14:16.07,000 --> 0:14:2,000
a blind test genuinely Sarah was that

353
0:14:18.2,000 --> 0:14:26,000
correct that was correct well done Freya

354
0:14:20.99,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that is fantastic that is really

355
0:14:26.81,000 --> 0:14:28,000
wonderful okay so that's brilliant know

356
0:14:28.64,000 --> 0:14:3,000
what we're going to do is Sarah is going

357
0:14:29.78,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to actually change the pots around a

358
0:14:31.1,000 --> 0:14:34,000
little bit and she's going to take the

359
0:14:32.24,000 --> 0:14:36,000
one with malaria away and we're just

360
0:14:34.1,000 --> 0:14:38,000
going to have four pots that are

361
0:14:36.41,000 --> 0:14:4,000
containing socks from children that had

362
0:14:39.08,000 --> 0:14:43,000
no malaria so in theory fear should go

363
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
down the line and and not stop at all

364
0:14:43.22,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and this is really important because we

365
0:14:44.48,000 --> 0:14:47,000
also need to know people who are not

366
0:14:45.89,000 --> 0:14:48,000
infected she needs to be able to do that

367
0:14:47.6,000 --> 0:14:5,000
correctly as well and this is a really

368
0:14:49.34,000 --> 0:14:52,000
tough test these socks have been in the

369
0:14:51.08,000 --> 0:14:55,000
freezer for a couple of years now

370
0:14:53.21,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and and this is a tiny bit of a shock as

371
0:14:55.64,000 --> 0:14:58,000
well so imagine if this was a whole

372
0:14:57.65,000 --> 0:14:59,000
person and they were giving off a big

373
0:14:59.03,000 --> 0:15:04,000
signal so this is really quite

374
0:15:00.32,000 --> 0:15:03,000
incredible okay over to you Mike

375
0:15:11.02,000 --> 0:15:19,000
brilliant fantastic really super thank

376
0:15:17.63,000 --> 0:15:23,000
you so much guys big round of applause

377
0:15:19.34,000 --> 0:15:23,000
for Freya mark and Sara well done guys

378
0:15:24.8,000 --> 0:15:31,000
what a good girl she's gonna get a treat

379
0:15:27.38,000 --> 0:15:33,000
later fantastic so you've just seen that

380
0:15:32.209,000 --> 0:15:35,000
for your own eyes that was a real live

381
0:15:33.83,000 --> 0:15:39,000
demonstration I was quite nervous about

382
0:15:35.6,000 --> 0:15:41,000
it I'm so glad that it worked but it is

383
0:15:40.13,000 --> 0:15:44,000
really incredible and when we do this

384
0:15:41.779,000 --> 0:15:45,000
what we find is that these dogs can

385
0:15:44.51,000 --> 0:15:48,000
correctly tell us when somebody is

386
0:15:45.98,000 --> 0:15:5,000
infected with malaria 81% of the time

387
0:15:48.529,000 --> 0:15:52,000
it's incredible 92% of the time they can

388
0:15:51.47,000 --> 0:15:55,000
tell us correctly when somebody does not

389
0:15:53.45,000 --> 0:15:57,000
have an infection and those numbers are

390
0:15:55.52,000 --> 0:15:59,000
actually above the criteria set by the

391
0:15:57.86,000 --> 0:16:01,000
World Health Organization for a

392
0:15:59.72,000 --> 0:16:04,000
diagnostic so we really are looking at

393
0:16:02.39,000 --> 0:16:07,000
deploying dogs in countries and

394
0:16:04.79,000 --> 0:16:09,000
particularly at ports of entry to detect

395
0:16:07.52,000 --> 0:16:13,000
people who have malaria this could be a

396
0:16:10.58,000 --> 0:16:14,000
reality but we can't deploy dogs

397
0:16:13.58,000 --> 0:16:17,000
everywhere and so what we're also

398
0:16:15.5,000 --> 0:16:19,000
looking to do and working on at the

399
0:16:18.05,000 --> 0:16:23,000
moment is the development of technology

400
0:16:20.39,000 --> 0:16:24,000
wearable tech that would empower the

401
0:16:23.12,000 --> 0:16:27,000
individual to allow them to

402
0:16:24.97,000 --> 0:16:29,000
self-diagnose imagine a patch that you

403
0:16:27.83,000 --> 0:16:31,000
wear on the skin that we detect in your

404
0:16:30.29,000 --> 0:16:34,000
sweat when you're infected with malaria

405
0:16:31.94,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and change color or something a little

406
0:16:34.61,000 --> 0:16:37,000
bit more technical perhaps a SmartWatch

407
0:16:36.74,000 --> 0:16:4,000
that would alert you when you're

408
0:16:38.24,000 --> 0:16:43,000
infected with malaria and if we can do

409
0:16:41.12,000 --> 0:16:45,000
this digitally and we can collect data

410
0:16:43.43,000 --> 0:16:48,000
imagine the amount of data that we can

411
0:16:46.01,000 --> 0:16:5,000
collect on a global scale this could

412
0:16:49.19,000 --> 0:16:52,000
completely revolutionize the way that we

413
0:16:50.93,000 --> 0:16:53,000
track the spread of diseases the way

414
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:57,000
that we target our control efforts and

415
0:16:54.77,000 --> 0:16:59,000
respond to disease outbreaks ultimately

416
0:16:57.829,000 --> 0:17:01,000
helping to lead to the eradication of

417
0:17:00.32,000 --> 0:17:04,000
malaria and even beyond malaria for

418
0:17:02.81,000 --> 0:17:06,000
other diseases that we already know have

419
0:17:04.88,000 --> 0:17:07,000
a smell if we can harness the power of

420
0:17:06.92,000 --> 0:17:11,000
nature to find out what those smells are

421
0:17:08.63,000 --> 0:17:13,000
we could do this and make this a reality

422
0:17:12.069,000 --> 0:17:16,000
now as scientists

423
0:17:14.54,000 --> 0:17:19,000
we're tasked with coming up with new

424
0:17:16.91,000 --> 0:17:21,000
ideas new concepts new technologies to

425
0:17:20.089,000 --> 0:17:25,000
tackle some of the world's greatest

426
0:17:22.61,000 --> 0:17:28,000
problems but what never ceases to amaze

427
0:17:25.28,000 --> 0:17:32,000
me is that often nature has already done

428
0:17:29.24,000 --> 0:17:36,000
this for us and the answer is right

429
0:17:32.78,000 --> 0:17:37,000
under our nose thank you

430
0:17:36.44,000 --> 0:17:38,000
you

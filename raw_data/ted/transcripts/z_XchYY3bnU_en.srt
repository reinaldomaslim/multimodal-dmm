1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The big residual

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is always value for money.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
All the time we are trying to get value for money.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
What we don't look for

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is value for many,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
while we are generating value for money.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Do we care about those four billion people

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
whose income levels are less than two dollars a day,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the so-called bottom of the pyramid?

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
What are the challenges in getting value for money

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
as well as value for many?

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We have described here

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in terms of the performance

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and the price.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
If you have money, of course, you can get the value.

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
You can get a Mercedes

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for a very high price,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
very high performance.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But if you don't have money, what happens?

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Well, you are to ride a bicycle,

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
carrying your own weight and also some other weight,

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so that you can earn the bread for the day.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Well, poor do not remain poor;

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
they become lower-middle-class.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And if they do so,

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
then, of course, the conditions improve,

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and they start riding on scooters.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because they can't afford anything more than the scooter.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The issue is, at that price,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
can you give them some extra value?

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
A super value,

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in terms of their ability to ride in a car,

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to get that dignity, to get that safety,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
looks practically impossible, isn't it.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, this is something

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that we see on Indian streets

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
all the time.

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But many people see the same thing

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and think things differently,

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and one of them is here, Ratan Tata.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The great thing about our leaders

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is that, should they not only have passion in their belly,

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which practically all of them have,

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
they're also very innovative.

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They believe that things can be done.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But great leaders like Ratan

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
have compassion.

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it's not just Ratan Tata,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it's the house of Tatas over time.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Let me confirm what she said.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Yes, I went barefoot

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
until I was 12.

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I struggled to [unclear] day

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
was a huge issue.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I stood eleventh among 125,000 students.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But I was about to leave the school,

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
almost a dollar per month for six years.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That's how I'm standing before you.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So that is the House of Tata.

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Applause)

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Innovation, compassion and passion.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They combine all that.

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And it was that compassion which bothered them,

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
how he was driving his own car --

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
he drives his own car by the way --

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and he saw in the rain,

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a family like the one that I showed to you

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
getting drenched with an infant.

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
one lakh car, $2,000 car."

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Of course, as soon as you say something like this

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
people say it is impossible,

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and that's what was said by Suzuki.

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
He said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with stepney.

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And you can see the cartoon here.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Ratan is taller than me,

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and we have ample space in the front

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and ample space in the back in this particular car.

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And incredible car.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And of course, nothing succeeds like success;

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the cynics then turned around,

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and one after the other

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
they also started saying, "Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment."

95
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
How did this great story unfold,

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the making of Nano?

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Let me tell you a bit about it.

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
For example, how we started:

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Ratan just began with a five-engineer team,

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
young people in their mid-twenties.

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And he said,

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but I will define the cost for you.

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and you are to make it within that."

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And he told them,

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"Question the unquestionable.

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Stretch the envelope."

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And at a point in time,

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
he got so engrossed in the whole challenge,

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that he himself became a member of the team.

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Can you believe it?

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I still am told about this story

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of that single wiper design in which he participated.

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Until midnight, he'd be thinking.

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.

117
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But who was the team leader?

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
The team leader was Girish Wagh,

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
a 34 year-old boy in [unclear].

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And the Nano team average age

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
was just 27 years.

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And they did innovation in design and beyond.

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
For example, that a two-cylinder gas engine

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
was used in a car with a single balancer shaft.

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Adhesives were replacing the rivets.

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
with vendors and suppliers.

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
All ideas on board were welcome.

130
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.

132
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Imagine that a fellow

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.

134
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I mean, it was incredible innovation.

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors.

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It was an open innovation,

137
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
ideas from all over were welcome.

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,

139
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
as well as a dashboard

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that was inspired by two-wheelers.

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The fuel lines and lamps

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
were as in two-wheelers.

143
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And the crux of the matter was, however,

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
getting more from less.

145
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
All the time, you have been given an envelope.

146
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
You can't cross that envelope,

147
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And therefore, each component

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
had to have a dual functionality.

150
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And the seat riser, for example,

151
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
serving as a mounting for the seat

152
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
as well as a structural part

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of the functional rigidity.

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Half the number of parts

155
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
are contained in Nano

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in comparison to a typical passenger car.

157
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way.

158
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But the current entry-level cars

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in comparison to that is eight percent less,

160
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but 21 percent more inside space.

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And what happened

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
was that -- more from less --

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
you can see how much more for how much less.

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
When the Model T was launched --

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and this is, by the way, all the figures

166
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices --

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Model T was 19,700 by Ford.

168
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Volkswagon was 11,333.

169
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And British Motor was around 11,000.

170
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.

171
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is why

172
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you started

173
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
actually a new paradigm shift,

174
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
where the same people

175
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
who could not dream of sitting in a car,

176
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
who were carrying their entire family in a scooter,

177
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
started dreaming of being in a car.

178
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And those dreams are getting fulfilled.

179
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
This is a photograph

180
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of a house and a driver and a car

181
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
near my own home.

182
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The driver's name is Naran.

183
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
He has bought his own Nano.

184
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And you can see, there is a physical space

185
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that has been created for him,

186
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
parking that car, along with the owner's car,

187
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but more importantly, they've created

188
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
a space in their mind that

189
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it."

190
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And that's why I call it a transformational innovation.

191
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It is not just technological,

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
it is social innovation that we talk about.

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And that is where, ladies and gentlemen,

194
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
this famous theme

195
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
of getting more from less for more

196
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
becomes important.

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,

198
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
about one and a half years ago,

199
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
when their academy honored me with a fellowship.

200
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And unbelievably, in 40 years,

201
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I was the first Indian to be honored.

202
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And the title of my talk

203
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
was therefore "Indian innovation

204
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering."

205
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And I titled this more from less for more and more people

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
as Gandhian engineering.

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,

208
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
is the one which is going to take the world forward,

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is going to make a difference,

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
not just for a few, but for everyone.

211
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility

212
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
for those unfortunates

213
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
who have lost their legs.

214
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Here is an American citizen and his son

215
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
having an artificial foot.

216
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What is its price? 20,000 dollars.

217
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And of course, these feet are so designed

218
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that they can walk only on

219
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
such perfect pavement or roads.

220
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Unfortunately, that's not the case in India.

221
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You can see him walk barefoot

222
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
on an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,

223
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and so on and so forth.

224
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
More importantly,

225
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
they not only walk far to work,

226
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and not only do they cycle to work,

227
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but they cycle for work, as you can see here.

228
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And they climb up for their work.

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.

230
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
A challenge, of course.

231
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.

232
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,

233
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you're talking about 10,000 days of income.

234
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
You just don't have it.

235
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.

236
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.

237
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,

238
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a quick molding and modular components,

239
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.

240
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,

241
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
whereas the equivalent other feet

242
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
took something like a day, as so on.

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,

244
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
rather than using heated sheets.

245
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,

246
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
[unclear] and functions.

247
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I like to show how it looks

248
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and how it works.

249
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Music)

250
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.

251
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this.

252
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ...

253
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
"Did it hurt?"

254
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"No ... not at all."

255
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)

256
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
One kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds.

257
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Applause)

258
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So that's what it is all about.

259
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And therefore Time took notice

260
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
of this 28-dollar foot, basically.

261
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Applause)

262
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
An incredible story.

263
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Let's move on to something else.

264
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I've been talking about getting more from less for more.

265
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Let's move to health.

266
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.

267
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What's happening in the area of health?

268
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.

269
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,

270
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
what has happened?

271
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.

272
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars.

273
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,

274
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
after all the human and animal testing,

275
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
was 10 years, now it is 15 years.

276
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?

277
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
No, I'm sorry.

278
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.

279
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So actually we are getting less from more

280
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
for less and less people.

281
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive,

282
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
so very few will be able to basically afford that.

283
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Let us just take an example.

284
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Psoriasis is very dreadful

285
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
disease of the skin.

286
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.

287
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,

288
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and 20 of them.

289
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Time for development -- it took around 10 years

290
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and 700 million dollars.

291
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Let's start in the spirit

292
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
of more from less and more for more

293
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and start putting some targets.

294
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.

295
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Can we do it [for] 100 dollars?

296
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Time for development, not 10 years.

297
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We are in a hurry. Five years.

298
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars.

299
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars.

300
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Looks absolutely audacious.

301
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Looks absolutely ridiculous.

302
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
You know something? This has been achieved in India.

303
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
These targets have been achieved in India.

304
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And how they have been achieved ...

305
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Sir Francis Bacon once said,

306
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
"When you wish to achieve results

307
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that have not been achieved before,

308
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it is an unwise fancy to think

309
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that they can be achieved by using methods

310
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that have been used before."

311
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And therefore, the standard process,

312
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men,

313
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
are not yielding those results --

314
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the billions of dollars that have been spent.

315
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The Indian cleverness

316
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
was using its traditional knowledge,

317
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
however, scientifically validating it

318
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and making that journey from men to mice to men,

319
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
not molecule to mice to men, you know.

320
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And that is how this difference has come.

321
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And you can see this blending

322
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
of traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.

323
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I launched a big program

324
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
[unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.

325
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
He is giving us not just for Psoriasis,

326
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm.

327
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough

328
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
obtained by this reverse form of [unclear]

329
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
by doing things differently.

330
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
You can see before treatment and after treatment.

331
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
This is really getting more from less for more and more people,

332
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
because these are all affordable treatments now.

333
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Let me just remind you

334
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of what Mahatma Gandhi had said.

335
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
He had said, "Earth provides enough

336
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed."

337
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So the message he was giving us

338
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
was you must get more from less and less and less

339
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
so that you can share it for more and more people,

340
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
not only the current generation,

341
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
but the future generations.

342
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And he also said, "I would prize every invention of science

343
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
made for the benefit for all."

344
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people,

345
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
not just a few people.

346
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And therefore, ladies and gentlemen,

347
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
this is the theme, getting more

348
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
from less for more.

349
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And mind you,

350
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
it is not getting just a little more for just a little less.

351
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
It's not about low cost.

352
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It's about ultra-low cost.

353
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars,

354
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000.

355
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars.

356
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way,

357
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
for certain other different reasons.

358
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.

359
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
You are not talking about affordability,

360
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
you are talking about extreme affordability.

361
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day.

362
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
You're not talking exclusive innovation.

363
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
You're talking about inclusive innovation.

364
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation,

365
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
you're talking about disruptive innovation.

366
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
The ideas have to be such

367
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that you think in completely different terms.

368
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And I would also add,

369
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
it is not only getting more from less for more

370
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
by more and more people, the whole world working for it.

371
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day.

372
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
You know, incubators for infants, for example.

373
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
They're not available in Africa.

374
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
They're not available in Indian villages.

375
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And infants die.

376
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars.

377
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And there's a 25-dollar incubator

378
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
giving that performance that had been created.

379
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And by whom?

380
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
By young students from Standford University

381
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
on an extreme affordability project that they had, basically.

382
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata.

383
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
It's not just innovation, compassion and passion --

384
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
compassion in the heart and passion in the belly.

385
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
That's the new world that we want to create.

386
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering.

387
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time.

388
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes.

389
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I've still one and a half to go.

390
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The message, the final message, is this:

391
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
India gave a great gift to the world.

392
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
What was that?

393
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world.

394
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
The 21st century gift,

395
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
which is very, very important for the whole world,

396
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
whether it is global economic meltdown,

397
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
whether it is climate change --

398
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
any problem that you talk about

399
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
is gaining more from less for more and more --

400
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
not only the current generations,

401
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
for the future generations.

402
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering.

403
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce,

404
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
this gift of the 21st century

405
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
to the world from India,

406
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Gandhian engineering.

407
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Applause)

408
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Lakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.)

409
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
LP: A quick question for you.

410
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Now, when you were a young boy in this school,

411
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become?

412
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
What do you think that drove you?

413
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you?

414
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
RAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life.

415
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I remember, I went to a poor school,

416
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees,

417
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that half a dollar that was required

418
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
within the stipulated time.

419
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
It was [unclear] high school.

420
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.

421
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.

422
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
One day he took us out into the sun

423
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and tried to show us how to find

424
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
the focal length of a convex lens.

425
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.

426
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And there was a bright spot up there.

427
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And then he said, "This is the focal length."

428
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi.

429
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
And then the paper burned.

430
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
When the paper burned, for some reason he turned to me,

431
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and he said, "Mashelkar, like this,

432
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
if you do not diffuse your energies,

433
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
if you focus your energies,

434
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
you can achieve anything in the world."

435
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
That gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve.

436
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
I said, "Whoa, science is so wonderful,

437
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
I have to become a scientist."

438
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
But more importantly, focus and you can achieve.

439
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
And that message, very frankly,

440
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
is valuable for society today.

441
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
What does that focal length do?

442
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
It has parallel lines, which are sun rays.

443
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And the property of parallel lines

444
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
is that they never meet.

445
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
What does that convex lens do?

446
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
It makes them meet.

447
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
This is convex lens leadership.

448
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length.

449
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
They divide them farther.

450
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
So I learned the lesson

451
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
of convex lens leadership from that.

452
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear].

453
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research --

454
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other,

455
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
I would [unclear].

456
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance,

457
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S.

458
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
I'm trying to build a global team,

459
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.

460
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment.

461
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
LP: Thank you very much. (RAM: Thank you.)

462
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
(Applause)

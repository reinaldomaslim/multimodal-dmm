1
0:00:13.658,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Imagine you are a part of a crew of astronauts

2
0:00:18.124,000 --> 0:00:21,000
traveling to Mars or some distant planet.

3
0:00:21.854,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The travel time could take a year

4
0:00:24.91,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or even longer.

5
0:00:26.836,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The space on board and the resources

6
0:00:29.797,000 --> 0:00:3,000
would be limited.

7
0:00:31.361,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food

8
0:00:35.972,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with minimal inputs.

9
0:00:38.169,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds,

10
0:00:42.965,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and grow crops in a matter of hours?

11
0:00:46.914,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And what if those crops would then make more seeds,

12
0:00:50.375,000 --> 0:00:53,000
enabling you to feed the entire crew

13
0:00:53.453,000 --> 0:00:56,000
with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip?

14
0:00:58.465,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Well, the scientists at NASA actually figured out a way to do this.

15
0:01:03.546,000 --> 0:01:05,000
What they came up with was actually quite interesting.

16
0:01:06.213,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It involved microorganisms,

17
0:01:08.133,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which are single-celled organisms.

18
0:01:10.732,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And they also used hydrogen from water.

19
0:01:13.511,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The types of microbes that they used were called hydrogenotrophs,

20
0:01:17.623,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and with these hydrogenotrophs, you can create a virtuous carbon cycle

21
0:01:22.937,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft.

22
0:01:26.525,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide,

23
0:01:30.241,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes

24
0:01:34.066,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and converted into a nutritious, carbon-rich crop.

25
0:01:38.287,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The astronauts would then eat that carbon-rich crop

26
0:01:41.902,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide,

27
0:01:45.916,000 --> 0:01:47,000
which would then be captured by the microbes,

28
0:01:48.164,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to create a nutritious crop,

29
0:01:49.823,000 --> 0:01:51,000
which then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide

30
0:01:52.742,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by the astronauts.

31
0:01:54.176,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So in this way, a closed-loop carbon cycle is created.

32
0:01:57.821,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So why is this important?

33
0:02:00.158,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We need carbon to survive as humans,

34
0:02:02.872,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and we get our carbon from food.

35
0:02:05.237,000 --> 0:02:06,000
On a long space journey,

36
0:02:06.944,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you simply wouldn't be able to pick up any carbon along the way,

37
0:02:10.287,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so you'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board.

38
0:02:13.817,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is a clever solution, right?

39
0:02:16.825,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But the thing is, that research didn't really go anywhere.

40
0:02:20.553,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We haven't yet gone to Mars. We haven't yet gone to another planet.

41
0:02:24.299,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And this was actually done in the '60s and '70s.

42
0:02:27.365,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So a colleague of mine, Dr. John Reed, and I,

43
0:02:30.746,000 --> 0:02:33,000
were interested, actually, in carbon recycling here on Earth.

44
0:02:34.741,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We wanted to come up with technical solutions

45
0:02:36.996,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to address climate change.

46
0:02:38.78,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And we discovered this research

47
0:02:41.025,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by reading some papers published in the '60s -- 1967 and later --

48
0:02:45.469,000 --> 0:02:47,000
articles about this work.

49
0:02:48.292,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And we thought it was a really good idea.

50
0:02:50.774,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So we said, well, Earth is actually like a spaceship.

51
0:02:54.37,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We have limited space and limited resources,

52
0:02:57.806,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and on Earth, we really do need to figure out

53
0:03:00.013,000 --> 0:03:01,000
how to recycle our carbon better.

54
0:03:03.202,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So we had the idea,

55
0:03:05.373,000 --> 0:03:11,000
can we take some of these NASA-type ideas and apply them

56
0:03:12.147,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to our carbon problem here on Earth?

57
0:03:14.936,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Could we cultivate these NASA-type microbes

58
0:03:17.592,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in order to make valuable products here on Earth?

59
0:03:21.241,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We started a company to do it.

60
0:03:23.717,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And in that company, we discovered that these hydrogenotrophs --

61
0:03:28.421,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which I'll actually call nature's supercharged carbon recyclers --

62
0:03:32.382,000 --> 0:03:34,000
we found that they are a powerful class of microbes

63
0:03:35.225,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that had been largely overlooked and understudied,

64
0:03:39.077,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and that they could make some really valuable products.

65
0:03:42.544,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So we began cultivating these products, these microbes, in our lab.

66
0:03:47.115,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide

67
0:03:50.994,000 --> 0:03:51,000
using these microbes.

68
0:03:52.483,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we even made a protein-rich meal

69
0:03:55.552,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find

70
0:04:00.047,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in some animal proteins.

71
0:04:02.523,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We began cultivating them even further,

72
0:04:04.957,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and we found that we can make oil.

73
0:04:06.898,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Oils are used to manufacture many products.

74
0:04:09.738,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil,

75
0:04:13.095,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which can be used for flavoring and for fragrances,

76
0:04:16.204,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner

77
0:04:18.855,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or even as a jet fuel.

78
0:04:21.236,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And we made an oil that's similar to palm oil.

79
0:04:24.065,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Palm oil is used to manufacture

80
0:04:26.049,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a wide range of consumer and industrial goods.

81
0:04:30.873,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology,

82
0:04:35.639,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and we're currently working with them

83
0:04:37.47,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to bring some of these products to market.

84
0:04:40.756,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We believe this type of technology can indeed help us

85
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:46,000
profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products --

86
0:04:47.777,000 --> 0:04:49,000
something that's beneficial for the planet

87
0:04:49.839,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but also beneficial for business.

88
0:04:52.383,000 --> 0:04:53,000
That's what we're doing today.

89
0:04:54.225,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But tomorrow, this type of technology and using these types of microbes

90
0:04:58.479,000 --> 0:05:,000
actually could help us do something even greater

91
0:05:01.266,000 --> 0:05:02,000
if we take it to the next level.

92
0:05:04.045,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We believe that this type of technology

93
0:05:06.487,000 --> 0:05:09,000
can actually help us address an issue with agriculture

94
0:05:09.75,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and allow us to create a type of agriculture that's sustainable,

95
0:05:14.299,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow.

96
0:05:18.585,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And why might we need a sustainable agriculture?

97
0:05:22.325,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Well, actually, it is estimated

98
0:05:24.537,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that the population will reach about 10 billion by 2050,

99
0:05:29.798,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and we're projecting that we will need to increase food production

100
0:05:33.003,000 --> 0:05:34,000
by 70 percent.

101
0:05:35.182,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In addition, we will need many more resources and raw materials

102
0:05:38.444,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to make consumer goods and industrial goods.

103
0:05:41.571,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So how will we scale to meet that demand?

104
0:05:44.669,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Well, modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand.

105
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:52,000
There are a number of reasons why.

106
0:05:53.309,000 --> 0:05:57,000
One of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters

107
0:05:58.169,000 --> 0:05:59,000
of greenhouse gases.

108
0:05:59.774,000 --> 0:06:02,000
In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases

109
0:06:03.421,000 --> 0:06:06,000
than our cars, our trucks, our planes

110
0:06:06.549,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and our trains combined.

111
0:06:09.009,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Another reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land.

112
0:06:14.549,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We have cleared 19.4 million square miles for crops and livestock.

113
0:06:21.446,000 --> 0:06:22,000
What does that look like?

114
0:06:23.118,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Well, that's roughly the size of South America and Africa combined.

115
0:06:29.041,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Let me give you a specific example.

116
0:06:31.324,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In Indonesia, an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared

117
0:06:36.304,000 --> 0:06:39,000
totaling the size of approximately Ireland,

118
0:06:39.71,000 --> 0:06:41,000
between 2000 and 2012.

119
0:06:42.717,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Just think of all of the species, the diversity,

120
0:06:45.947,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that was removed in the process,

121
0:06:47.861,000 --> 0:06:49,000
whether plant life, insects or animal life.

122
0:06:51.145,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And a natural carbon sink was also removed.

123
0:06:54.437,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So let me make this real for you.

124
0:06:56.896,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations.

125
0:07:01.399,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And as I mentioned before,

126
0:07:02.798,000 --> 0:07:05,000
palm oil is used to manufacture many products.

127
0:07:06.371,000 --> 0:07:09,000
In fact, it is estimated that over 50 percent of consumer products

128
0:07:10.322,000 --> 0:07:12,000
are manufactured using palm oil.

129
0:07:13.671,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And that includes things like ice cream, cookies ...

130
0:07:17.506,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It includes cooking oils.

131
0:07:19.397,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It also includes detergents, lotions, soaps.

132
0:07:23.594,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You and I both probably have numerous items

133
0:07:28.395,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in our kitchens and our bathrooms

134
0:07:30.92,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that were manufactured using palm oil.

135
0:07:33.45,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So you and I are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests.

136
0:07:39.691,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Modern ag has some problems,

137
0:07:41.804,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably.

138
0:07:47.151,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I believe that microbes can be a part of the answer --

139
0:07:51.701,000 --> 0:07:54,000
specifically, these supercharged carbon recyclers.

140
0:07:55.708,000 --> 0:07:57,000
These supercharged carbon recyclers,

141
0:07:58.254,000 --> 0:08:02,000
like plants, serve as the natural recyclers

142
0:08:02.309,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in their ecosystems where they thrive.

143
0:08:04.454,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And they thrive in exotic places on Earth,

144
0:08:06.674,000 --> 0:08:08,000
like hydrothermal vents and hot springs.

145
0:08:09.543,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In those ecosystems, they take carbon and recycle it

146
0:08:12.83,000 --> 0:08:14,000
into the nutrients needed for those ecosystems.

147
0:08:15.916,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And they're rich in nutrients,

148
0:08:17.399,000 --> 0:08:22,000
such as oils and proteins, minerals and carbohydrates.

149
0:08:24.025,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And actually, microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives.

150
0:08:29.335,000 --> 0:08:33,000
If you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a Friday night,

151
0:08:33.566,000 --> 0:08:34,000
after a long, hard work week,

152
0:08:35.534,000 --> 0:08:37,000
then you are enjoying a product of microbes.

153
0:08:39.176,000 --> 0:08:41,000
If you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery --

154
0:08:41.882,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a product of microbes.

155
0:08:43.526,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt.

156
0:08:47.06,000 --> 0:08:49,000
These are all products of microbes.

157
0:08:49.729,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers

158
0:08:55.038,000 --> 0:09:,000
lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours

159
0:09:00.162,000 --> 0:09:01,000
versus months.

160
0:09:01.512,000 --> 0:09:02,000
That means we can make crops

161
0:09:03.479,000 --> 0:09:06,000
much faster than we're making them today.

162
0:09:07.685,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They grow in the dark,

163
0:09:09.344,000 --> 0:09:11,000
so they can grow in any season

164
0:09:11.915,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and in any geography and any location.

165
0:09:15.159,000 --> 0:09:18,000
They can grow in containers that require minimal space.

166
0:09:19.562,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And we can get to a type of vertical agriculture.

167
0:09:23.54,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture

168
0:09:26.221,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that requires so much land,

169
0:09:27.974,000 --> 0:09:28,000
we can scale vertically,

170
0:09:29.571,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and as a result produce much more product per area.

171
0:09:36.187,000 --> 0:09:4,000
If we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers,

172
0:09:40.675,000 --> 0:09:43,000
then we wouldn't have to remove any more rainforests

173
0:09:43.995,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to make the food and the goods that we consume.

174
0:09:48.524,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Because, at a large scale,

175
0:09:50.761,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you can actually make 10,000 times more output per land area

176
0:09:56.093,000 --> 0:09:59,000
than you could -- for instance, if you used soybeans --

177
0:09:59.272,000 --> 0:10:02,000
if you planted soybeans on that same area of land

178
0:10:02.356,000 --> 0:10:03,000
over a period of a year.

179
0:10:04.531,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Ten thousand times over a period of a year.

180
0:10:08.3,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So this is what I mean by a new type of agriculture.

181
0:10:12.613,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And this is what I mean by developing a system

182
0:10:15.945,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of 10 billion.

183
0:10:22.704,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And what would be the products of this new type of agriculture?

184
0:10:26.323,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Well, we've already made a protein meal,

185
0:10:28.53,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal,

186
0:10:31.817,000 --> 0:10:32,000
or even cornmeal, or wheat flour.

187
0:10:34.203,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We've already made oils,

188
0:10:35.58,000 --> 0:10:38,000
so you can imagine something similar to coconut oil

189
0:10:39.282,000 --> 0:10:41,000
or olive oil or soybean oil.

190
0:10:42.042,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients

191
0:10:46.304,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that would give us pasta and bread,

192
0:10:48.623,000 --> 0:10:51,000
cakes, nutritional items of many sorts.

193
0:10:52.226,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Furthermore, since oil is used to manufacture multiple other goods,

194
0:10:59.162,000 --> 0:11:01,000
industrial products and consumer products,

195
0:11:01.242,000 --> 0:11:05,000
you can imagine being able to make detergents, soaps, lotions, etc.,

196
0:11:06.069,000 --> 0:11:07,000
using these types of crops.

197
0:11:09.382,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Not only are we running out of space,

198
0:11:12.286,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but if we continue to operate under the status quo

199
0:11:15.478,000 --> 0:11:16,000
with modern agriculture,

200
0:11:16.975,000 --> 0:11:2,000
we run the risk of robbing our progeny of a beautiful planet.

201
0:11:22.216,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But it doesn't have to be this way.

202
0:11:24.627,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We can imagine a future of abundance.

203
0:11:28.154,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Let us create systems that keep planet Earth, our spaceship,

204
0:11:34.054,000 --> 0:11:35,000
not only from not crashing,

205
0:11:36.41,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but let us also develop systems and ways of living

206
0:11:40.564,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves

207
0:11:44.746,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and the 10 billion that will be on this planet by 2050.

208
0:11:48.817,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Thank you very much.

209
0:11:50.056,000 --> 0:11:54,000

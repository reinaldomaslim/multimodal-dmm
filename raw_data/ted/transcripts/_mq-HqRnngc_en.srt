1
0:00:18.701,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Music)

2
0:01:45.636,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Applause)

3
0:01:56.329,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Trevor Copp: When "Dancing With the Stars" first hit the airwaves,

4
0:01:59.457,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that is not what it looked like.

5
0:02:01.56,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

6
0:02:03.121,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Jeff and I were full-time ballroom dance instructors

7
0:02:06.172,000 --> 0:02:09,000
when the big TV ballroom revival hit,

8
0:02:09.609,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and this was incredible.

9
0:02:13.132,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I mean, one day we would say "foxtrot,"

10
0:02:15.76,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and people were like "Foxes trotting."

11
0:02:18.821,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

12
0:02:20.575,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And the next day they were telling us

13
0:02:22.553,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the finer points of a good feather step.

14
0:02:24.965,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And this blew our minds.

15
0:02:27.342,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I mean, all of the ballroom dance geeking out that we had always done

16
0:02:32.588,000 --> 0:02:35,000
on why salsa worked differently than the competitive rumba

17
0:02:36.251,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and why tango traveled unlike the waltz,

18
0:02:38.779,000 --> 0:02:42,000
all of that just hit the public consciousness,

19
0:02:43.383,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it changed everything.

20
0:02:45.834,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But running parallel to this excitement,

21
0:02:48.224,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the excitement that suddenly, somehow, we were cool --

22
0:02:52.599,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

23
0:02:55.044,000 --> 0:02:57,000
there was also this reservation.

24
0:02:57.914,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Why this and why now?

25
0:03:01.556,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Jeff Fox: When Trevor and I would get together for training seminars

26
0:03:04.813,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or just for fun,

27
0:03:05.996,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we'd toss each other around, mix it up,

28
0:03:07.886,000 --> 0:03:09,000
take a break from having to lead all the time.

29
0:03:10.097,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We even came up with a system for switching lead and follow

30
0:03:12.891,000 --> 0:03:13,000
while we were dancing,

31
0:03:14.066,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as a way of taking turns and playing fair.

32
0:03:16.099,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It wasn't until we used that system as part of a performance

33
0:03:19.08,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in a small festival

34
0:03:20.265,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that we got an important tap on the shoulder.

35
0:03:22.416,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Lisa O'Connell, a dramaturge and director of a playwright center,

36
0:03:25.748,000 --> 0:03:26,000
pulled us aside after the show and said,

37
0:03:28.154,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"Do you have any idea how political that was?"

38
0:03:30.858,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

39
0:03:32.898,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So that began an eight-year collaboration to create a play

40
0:03:35.691,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which not only further developed our system for switching

41
0:03:38.476,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but also explored the impact of being locked into a single role,

42
0:03:42.258,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and what's worse,

43
0:03:43.446,000 --> 0:03:45,000
being defined by that single role.

44
0:03:45.599,000 --> 0:03:46,000
TC: Because, of course,

45
0:03:47.968,000 --> 0:03:51,000
classic Latin and ballroom dancing isn't just a system of dancing;

46
0:03:52.719,000 --> 0:03:54,000
it's a way of thinking, of being,

47
0:03:55.924,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of relating to each other

48
0:03:57.571,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that captured a whole period's values.

49
0:04:00.599,000 --> 0:04:02,000
There's one thing that stayed consistent, though:

50
0:04:02.99,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the man leads

51
0:04:04.34,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and the woman follows.

52
0:04:06.126,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So street salsa, championship tango, it's all the same --

53
0:04:08.878,000 --> 0:04:09,000
he leads, she follows.

54
0:04:11.335,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So this was gender training.

55
0:04:13.623,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You weren't just learning to dance --

56
0:04:15.449,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you were learning to "man" and to "woman."

57
0:04:19.813,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's a relic.

58
0:04:21.59,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And in the way of relics, you don't throw it out,

59
0:04:23.92,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but you need to know that this is the past.

60
0:04:26.327,000 --> 0:04:27,000
This isn't the present.

61
0:04:28.866,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's like Shakespeare: respect it, revive it -- great!

62
0:04:31.969,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But know that this is history.

63
0:04:33.479,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This doesn't represent how we think today.

64
0:04:37.045,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So we asked ourselves:

65
0:04:38.609,000 --> 0:04:39,000
If you strip it all down,

66
0:04:40.672,000 --> 0:04:42,000
what is at the core of partner dancing?

67
0:04:44.094,000 --> 0:04:46,000
JF: Well, the core principle of partner dancing

68
0:04:46.353,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is that one person leads, the other one follows.

69
0:04:49.094,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The machine works the same, regardless of who's playing which role.

70
0:04:52.388,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The physics of movement doesn't really give a crap about your gender.

71
0:04:55.683,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:56.747,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So if we were to update the existing form,

73
0:04:58.801,000 --> 0:05:,000
we would need to make it more representative

74
0:05:00.919,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of how we interact here, now, in 2015.

75
0:05:04.031,000 --> 0:05:06,000
When you watch ballroom, don't just watch what's there.

76
0:05:07.517,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Watch what's not.

77
0:05:09.089,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The couple is always only a man and a woman.

78
0:05:12.125,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Together.

79
0:05:13.307,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Only.

80
0:05:14.603,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Ever.

81
0:05:15.778,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, same-sex and gender nonconformist couples just disappear.

82
0:05:19.884,000 --> 0:05:21,000
In most mainstream international ballroom competitions,

83
0:05:22.54,000 --> 0:05:24,000
same-sex couples are rarely recognized on the floor,

84
0:05:25.183,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and in many cases,

85
0:05:26.391,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the rules prohibit them completely.

86
0:05:28.152,000 --> 0:05:32,000
TC: Try this: Google-image, "professional Latin dancer,"

87
0:05:33.504,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and then look for an actual Latino person.

88
0:05:35.739,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:37.13,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You'll be there for days.

90
0:05:39.145,000 --> 0:05:43,000
What you will get is page after page of white, straight Russian couples

91
0:05:43.194,000 --> 0:05:44,000
spray-tanned to the point of mahogany.

92
0:05:45.183,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:47.108,000 --> 0:05:49,000
There are no black people, there are no Asians,

94
0:05:49.392,000 --> 0:05:5,000
no mixed-race couples,

95
0:05:50.7,000 --> 0:05:53,000
so basically, non-white people just disappeared.

96
0:05:54.727,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Even within the white-straight- couple-only paradigm --

97
0:06:00.008,000 --> 0:06:01,000
she can't be taller,

98
0:06:01.413,000 --> 0:06:02,000
he can't be shorter.

99
0:06:02.905,000 --> 0:06:03,000
She can't be bolder,

100
0:06:05.025,000 --> 0:06:06,000
he can't be gentler.

101
0:06:07.261,000 --> 0:06:09,000
If you were to take a ballroom dance

102
0:06:09.505,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and translate that into a conversation

103
0:06:11.822,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and drop that into a movie,

104
0:06:13.288,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we, as a culture, would never stand for this.

105
0:06:16.934,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He dictates, she reacts.

106
0:06:20.674,000 --> 0:06:23,000
No relationship -- gay, straight or anything --

107
0:06:23.703,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that,

108
0:06:28.134,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and yet somehow,

109
0:06:29.744,000 --> 0:06:31,000
you put it on prime time, you slap some makeup on it,

110
0:06:32.382,000 --> 0:06:35,000
throw the glitter on, put it out there as movement, not as text,

111
0:06:36.832,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and we, as a culture,

112
0:06:38.974,000 --> 0:06:39,000
tune in and clap.

113
0:06:41.805,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We are applauding our own absence.

114
0:06:46.13,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Too many people have disappeared from partner dancing.

115
0:06:50.334,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Music)

116
0:07:34.276,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

117
0:07:40.957,000 --> 0:07:42,000
JF: Now, you just saw two men dancing together.

118
0:07:43.52,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

119
0:07:44.557,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And you thought it looked ...

120
0:07:46.412,000 --> 0:07:47,000
a little strange.

121
0:07:48.13,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Interesting -- appealing, even --

122
0:07:50.199,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but a little bit odd.

123
0:07:52.372,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Even avid followers of the same-sex ballroom circuit can attest

124
0:07:55.38,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that while same-sex partner dancing can be dynamic and strong and exciting,

125
0:07:59.514,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it just doesn't quite seem to fit.

126
0:08:02.446,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Aesthetically speaking,

127
0:08:03.687,000 --> 0:08:07,000
if Alida and I take the classic closed ballroom hold ...

128
0:08:09.637,000 --> 0:08:1,000
this is considered beautiful.

129
0:08:14.204,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

130
0:08:16.703,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But why not this?

131
0:08:17.985,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

132
0:08:19.699,000 --> 0:08:22,000
See, the standard image that the leader must be larger and masculine

133
0:08:23.391,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the follower smaller and feminine --

134
0:08:25.95,000 --> 0:08:26,000
this is a stumbling point.

135
0:08:27.978,000 --> 0:08:3,000
TC: So we wanted to look at this from a totally different angle.

136
0:08:33.467,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So, what if we could keep the idea of lead and follow

137
0:08:37.059,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but toss the idea that this was connected to gender?

138
0:08:40.824,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Further, what if a couple could lead and follow each other

139
0:08:45.851,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and then switch?

140
0:08:47.513,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And then switch back?

141
0:08:49.69,000 --> 0:08:51,000
What if it could be like a conversation,

142
0:08:52.949,000 --> 0:08:55,000
taking turns listening and speaking, just like we do in life?

143
0:08:56.042,000 --> 0:08:59,000
What if we could dance like that?

144
0:09:00.418,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We call it "Liquid Lead Dancing."

145
0:09:04.542,000 --> 0:09:05,000
JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance,

146
0:09:07.045,000 --> 0:09:08,000
salsa.

147
0:09:08.524,000 --> 0:09:11,000
In salsa, there's a key transitional step, called the cross-body lead.

148
0:09:12.185,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We use it as punctuation to break up the improvisation.

149
0:09:14.969,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It can be a little tricky to spot if you're not used to looking for it,

150
0:09:18.363,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so here it is.

151
0:09:25.191,000 --> 0:09:26,000
One more time for the cheap seats.

152
0:09:26.869,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

153
0:09:32.378,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And here's the action one more time,

154
0:09:34.407,000 --> 0:09:35,000
nice and slow.

155
0:09:40.842,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now, if we apply liquid-lead thinking to this transitional step,

156
0:09:44.953,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the cross-body lead becomes a point

157
0:09:46.659,000 --> 0:09:47,000
where the lead and the follow can switch.

158
0:09:48.668,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The person following can elect to take over the lead,

159
0:09:51.215,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or the person leading can choose to surrender it,

160
0:09:53.592,000 --> 0:09:55,000
essentially making it a counter-cross-body lead.

161
0:09:56.208,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Here's how that looks in slow motion.

162
0:10:05.913,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And here's how it looked when we danced it in the opening dance.

163
0:10:14.789,000 --> 0:10:17,000
With this simple tweak, the dance moves from being a dictation

164
0:10:18.186,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to a negotiation.

165
0:10:19.761,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow.

166
0:10:22.278,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And more importantly, you can change your mind.

167
0:10:25.523,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now, this is only one example of how this applies,

168
0:10:27.913,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but once the blinkers come off, anything can happen.

169
0:10:31.09,000 --> 0:10:36,000
TC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinking could apply to a classic waltz.

170
0:10:36.297,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Because, of course,

171
0:10:37.549,000 --> 0:10:39,000
it isn't just a system of switching leads;

172
0:10:40.164,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it's a way of thinking

173
0:10:41.354,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that can actually make the dance itself more efficient.

174
0:10:44.981,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So: the waltz.

175
0:10:46.891,000 --> 0:10:47,000
The waltz is a turning dance.

176
0:10:48.984,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This means that for the lead,

177
0:10:50.62,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you spend half of the dance traveling backwards,

178
0:10:53.856,000 --> 0:10:54,000
completely blind.

179
0:10:55.35,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And because of the follower's position,

180
0:10:57.923,000 --> 0:10:59,000
basically, no one can see where they're going.

181
0:11:00.755,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Laughter)

182
0:11:02.127,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So you're out here on the floor,

183
0:11:04.163,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and then imagine that coming right at you.

184
0:11:06.851,000 --> 0:11:07,000
JF: Raaaaaah!

185
0:11:08.224,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

186
0:11:09.772,000 --> 0:11:12,000
TC: There are actually a lot of accidents out there

187
0:11:13.092,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that happen as a result of this blind spot.

188
0:11:16.08,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But what if the partners were to just allow for

189
0:11:19.346,000 --> 0:11:21,000
a switch of posture for a moment?

190
0:11:21.519,000 --> 0:11:23,000
A lot of accidents could be avoided.

191
0:11:24.253,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Even if one person led the whole dance but allowed this switch to happen,

192
0:11:29.117,000 --> 0:11:3,000
it would be a lot safer,

193
0:11:30.527,000 --> 0:11:33,000
while at the same time, offering new aesthetics into the waltz.

194
0:11:34.221,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Because physics doesn't give a damn about your gender.

195
0:11:37.678,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Laughter)

196
0:11:40.154,000 --> 0:11:43,000
JF: Now, we've danced Liquid Lead in clubs, convention centers

197
0:11:43.179,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and as part of "First Dance," the play we created with Lisa,

198
0:11:46.021,000 --> 0:11:48,000
on stages in North America and in Europe.

199
0:11:48.387,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And it never fails to engage.

200
0:11:50.736,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I mean, beyond the unusual sight of seeing two men dancing together,

201
0:11:54.241,000 --> 0:11:56,000
it always evokes and engages.

202
0:11:57.174,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But why?

203
0:11:58.485,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The secret lies in what made Lisa see our initial demonstration

204
0:12:01.604,000 --> 0:12:02,000
as "political."

205
0:12:02.931,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It wasn't just that we were switching lead and follow;

206
0:12:05.53,000 --> 0:12:08,000
it's that we stayed consistent in our presence, our personality

207
0:12:08.611,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and our power, regardless of which role we were playing.

208
0:12:11.564,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We were still us.

209
0:12:13.816,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And that's where the true freedom lies --

210
0:12:15.875,000 --> 0:12:16,000
not just the freedom to switch roles,

211
0:12:17.888,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but the freedom from being defined by whichever role you're playing,

212
0:12:21.527,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the freedom to always remain true to yourself.

213
0:12:24.457,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Forget what a lead is supposed to look like, or a follow.

214
0:12:27.581,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Be a masculine follow

215
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
or a feminine lead.

216
0:12:30.795,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Just be yourself.

217
0:12:32.873,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Obviously, this applies off the dance floor as well,

218
0:12:35.614,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but on the floor, it gives us the perfect opportunity

219
0:12:38.177,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to update an old paradigm, reinvigorate an old relic,

220
0:12:41.498,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and make it more representative of our era and our current way of being.

221
0:12:46.63,000 --> 0:12:49,000
TC: Jeff and I dance partner dancing all the time with women and men

222
0:12:49.995,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and we love it.

223
0:12:51.407,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But we dance with a consciousness that this is a historic form

224
0:12:55.994,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that can produce silence and produce invisibility

225
0:13:00.328,000 --> 0:13:02,000
across the spectrum of identity that we enjoy today.

226
0:13:03.82,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We invented Liquid Lead

227
0:13:05.338,000 --> 0:13:1,000
as a way of stripping out all the ideas that don't belong to us

228
0:13:10.527,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and taking partner dancing back to what it really always was:

229
0:13:15.83,000 --> 0:13:17,000
the fine art of taking care of each other.

230
0:13:20.829,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Music)

231
0:15:20.91,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Applause)

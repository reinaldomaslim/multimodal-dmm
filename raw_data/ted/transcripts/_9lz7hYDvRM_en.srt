(Music)

2
0:00:21.357,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We are the tribe that they cannot see

3
0:00:25.228,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We live on an industrial reservation

4
0:00:29.244,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We are the Halluci Nation

5
0:00:33.331,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We have been called the Indians

6
0:00:36.513,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We have been called Native American

7
0:00:40.108,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We have been called hostile

8
0:00:43.292,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We have been called pagan

9
0:00:46.741,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We have been called militant

10
0:00:49.511,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We have been called many names

11
0:00:53.145,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We are the Halluci Nation

12
0:00:57.15,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We are the human beings

13
0:01:01.17,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The callers of names cannot see us

14
0:01:04.577,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but we can see them

15
0:01:08.014,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We are the Halluci Nation

16
0:01:11.268,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Our DNA is of earth and sky

17
0:01:15.196,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Our DNA is of past and future

18
0:01:19.834,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We are the Halluci Nation

19
0:01:23.919,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We are the evolution,

20
0:01:27.067,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the continuation

21
0:01:35.181,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The Halluci Nation

22
0:01:37.497,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Music)

23
0:02:27.052,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The virus took on many shapes

24
0:02:28.768,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The bear, the elk, the antelope, the elephant, the deer

25
0:02:31.448,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The mineral, the iron, the copper, the coltan, the rubber

26
0:02:34.236,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The coffee, the cotton, the sugar

27
0:02:37.41,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The people

28
0:02:40.909,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The germ traveled faster than the bullet

29
0:02:44.196,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They harvest the mountainside,

30
0:02:45.649,000 --> 0:02:46,000
protect the crops, herd the cattle

31
0:02:47.885,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The people

32
0:02:53.276,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The women and children were separated from the men

33
0:02:55.991,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They divided us according to the regional filters of their minds

34
0:02:59.815,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The violence of arrogance crawls into the air,

35
0:03:02.538,000 --> 0:03:04,000
nestles into the geospatial cortex

36
0:03:07.306,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We are not a conquered people

37
0:03:13.449,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The compound was on fire

38
0:03:17.077,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The missionaries never hid their perspective

39
0:03:20.474,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Prospectors of land

40
0:03:22.053,000 --> 0:03:23,000
would rather see us disappear

41
0:03:26.185,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Recyclable prayers

42
0:03:28.796,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The people

43
0:03:32.597,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This is my body which is given for you

44
0:03:35.859,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The people

45
0:03:37.768,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This is my blood

46
0:03:40.982,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We are not a conquered people

47
0:03:42.95,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Electronic music and chanting)

48
0:03:59.911,000 --> 0:04:,000
I was wakened by my elder brother

49
0:04:03.013,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The compound was on fire

50
0:04:06.641,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Awakened by my elder brother

51
0:04:09.656,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The compound was on fire

52
0:04:11.585,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Music)

53
0:04:23.772,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The compound was on fire

54
0:04:37.794,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The compound was on fire

55
0:04:54.937,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The Halluci Nation

56
0:04:57.911,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The human beings

57
0:05:00.716,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The people

58
0:05:02.641,000 --> 0:05:04,000
See the spiritual in the natural

59
0:05:06.404,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Through sense and feeling

60
0:05:09.513,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Everything is related

61
0:05:11.757,000 --> 0:05:12,000
All the things of earth

62
0:05:14.083,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And in the sky have spirit

63
0:05:16.718,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Everything is sacred

64
0:05:20.085,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Confronted by the ALie Nation

65
0:05:25.364,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The subjects and the citizens

66
0:05:28.022,000 --> 0:05:29,000
See the material religions

67
0:05:30.458,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Through trauma and numb

68
0:05:33.355,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Nothing is related

69
0:05:35.68,000 --> 0:05:38,000
All the things of the earth and in the sky

70
0:05:39.53,000 --> 0:05:41,000
have energy to be exploited

71
0:05:43.117,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Even themselves, mining their spirits

72
0:05:46.624,000 --> 0:05:48,000
into souls sold

73
0:05:50.339,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Into nothing is sacred

74
0:05:52.596,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Not even their self

75
0:05:56.712,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The ALie Nation

76
0:05:59.022,000 --> 0:06:,000
Alienation

77
0:06:53.615,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Ancestors

78
0:06:55.481,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Live in the DNA

79
0:06:58.256,000 --> 0:06:59,000
In genetic memory

80
0:07:00.558,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The evolution of descendants

81
0:07:03.676,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Human being is our natural identity

82
0:07:08.236,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Natural identity is where the power of being

83
0:07:12.385,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Waits for human recognition

84
0:07:15.442,000 --> 0:07:16,000
To understand

85
0:07:18.356,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Not to just know

86
0:07:20.214,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But to understand sacred

87
0:07:24.896,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Without religion we evolve

88
0:07:28.062,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Back into our ancestors

89
0:07:31.363,000 --> 0:07:33,000
With religion we disappear

90
0:07:34.292,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Into religious heaven and hell

91
0:07:37.165,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Electronic music and chanting)

92
0:07:40.896,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Human beings

93
0:07:43.175,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We are human, we are of the earth

94
0:07:46.508,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Electronic music and chanting)

95
0:10:27.128,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Human beings

96
0:10:29.291,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We are human

97
0:10:31.577,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We are of the earth

98
0:10:33.64,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Our bone, flesh, blood,

99
0:10:36.482,000 --> 0:10:38,000
metals, minerals, liquids, of earth

100
0:10:40.12,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We are earth

101
0:10:43.121,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We are being

102
0:10:45.092,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We are of the sky

103
0:10:47.47,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The sun, moon, stars

104
0:10:49.855,000 --> 0:10:53,000
A reality of how ancestors live

105
0:10:55.063,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We are the children of earth and sky

106
0:11:07.376,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We are the Halluci Nation

107
0:11:12.495,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Applause)

108
0:11:17.11,000 --> 0:11:2,000

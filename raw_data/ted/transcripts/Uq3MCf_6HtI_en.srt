1
0:00:12.906,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My story starts in the northern Galapagos Islands,

2
0:00:16.01,000 --> 0:00:19,000
under 50 feet of water and a big school of sharks.

3
0:00:20.148,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'd been scuba diving with a group of friends for about a week,

4
0:00:23.143,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it had been glorious:

5
0:00:24.496,000 --> 0:00:26,000
manta rays, whale sharks,

6
0:00:27.148,000 --> 0:00:29,000
penguins and, of course, hammerhead sharks.

7
0:00:30.675,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Today's dive was particularly tricky.

8
0:00:34.101,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The surge was terrible.

9
0:00:35.356,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You had to have your camera rig tight in

10
0:00:37.57,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and your arm out,

11
0:00:38.746,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because the surge kept throwing you into the rocks

12
0:00:41.128,000 --> 0:00:43,000
while you're scanning up for that beautiful photograph.

13
0:00:43.772,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It was going OK, until ...

14
0:00:46.326,000 --> 0:00:47,000
not OK.

15
0:00:47.915,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Something was terribly, terribly wrong.

16
0:00:51.552,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I pulled my hand back,

17
0:00:53.412,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I had long, black sea urchin spines

18
0:00:56.078,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all the way through my gloves,

19
0:00:57.702,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which meant all the way through my hand.

20
0:01:00.344,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, this is bad.

21
0:01:02.38,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I mean, obviously when you have something all the way through your hand,

22
0:01:05.889,000 --> 0:01:06,000
it's kind of bad anyway,

23
0:01:07.127,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but in this case, sea urchins have a venom on them that,

24
0:01:11.331,000 --> 0:01:12,000
if you've ever tangled with them,

25
0:01:12.948,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you know that a sea urchin spine in you gives you horrible, painful inflammation.

26
0:01:17.619,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But that wasn't even topmost in my mind at this point.

27
0:01:20.34,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This did not look real.

28
0:01:22.515,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I could not believe that this was my hand.

29
0:01:25.003,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, in a crisis, I tend to disassociate into, like, little scientists,

30
0:01:29.786,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and I start talking very analytically.

31
0:01:32.927,000 --> 0:01:34,000
All analysis was gone, adrenaline brain kicked in,

32
0:01:35.93,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I just yanked the spines out.

33
0:01:38.793,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I don't remember doing it.

34
0:01:41.665,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I just remember thinking, "I can't get my glove off with these in here."

35
0:01:45.546,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I do remember taking the glove off

36
0:01:47.666,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and a big plume of black coming up in front of my face.

37
0:01:51.875,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And biologist brain now shows up and starts freaking out.

38
0:01:56.327,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"How could all that toxin have gotten into that wound already?"

39
0:01:59.52,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Well, physicist brain then shows up and very calmly explains,

40
0:02:03.665,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"No, no, no, we're at 50 feet,

41
0:02:05.387,000 --> 0:02:06,000
red wavelengths are attenuated.

42
0:02:06.888,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That's blood -- not black.

43
0:02:10.566,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And sharks.

44
0:02:12.793,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So what are you gonna do?"

45
0:02:14.965,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, I cranked my cummerbund down really hard over my hand,

46
0:02:19.555,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I simply swam away.

47
0:02:23.078,000 --> 0:02:28,000
"Let's let that big old cloud of blood dissipate a bit before we have to surface

48
0:02:28.416,000 --> 0:02:29,000
through all of these sharks."

49
0:02:30.248,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So when I did surface,

50
0:02:31.739,000 --> 0:02:32,000
my warm-blooded-mammal brain

51
0:02:33.664,000 --> 0:02:35,000
was in an absolute gibbering panic:

52
0:02:35.74,000 --> 0:02:39,000
"They don't feed when they're schooling. They don't feed when they're schooling.

53
0:02:39.892,000 --> 0:02:4,000
All the way up."

54
0:02:41.243,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And they didn't.

55
0:02:42.451,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So apparently, they have read the same books that I have.

56
0:02:45.691,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:47.107,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, it turns out,

58
0:02:48.559,000 --> 0:02:5,000
when you've been stabbed with sea urchin spines,

59
0:02:50.895,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and you're two days away from any medical help,

60
0:02:53.597,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the thing that you've got to do is, unfortunately, cook your hand.

61
0:02:58.621,000 --> 0:03:,000
So you put it in water as hot as you can stand,

62
0:03:01.289,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and you keep adding boiling water

63
0:03:02.948,000 --> 0:03:05,000
until you think you will go absolutely insane.

64
0:03:06.286,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, it worked --

65
0:03:08.249,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the hand itself did not work so well for several weeks after that,

66
0:03:12.41,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but eventually, fine motor skills returned.

67
0:03:15.572,000 --> 0:03:19,000
All except for one spot, that stayed stiff and painful for weeks

68
0:03:20.19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
after the other things had gotten better.

69
0:03:22.416,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So it turned out, I'd broken off a tip of the urchin spine

70
0:03:26.684,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in the joint itself,

71
0:03:28.811,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and that's why it wasn't getting better.

72
0:03:30.785,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So the orthopedist says, "You know, we should get this out.

73
0:03:33.768,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Nothing too urgent, not an emergency."

74
0:03:36.438,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So we scheduled a small surgery for a few weeks out on a Monday.

75
0:03:40.476,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And on the Friday before,

76
0:03:42.952,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I broke my pelvis in a horseback riding accident.

77
0:03:46.044,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:47.767,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Yeah.

79
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So we kind of postponed that surgery.

80
0:03:52.461,000 --> 0:03:56,000
My broken pelvis and I were now facing six weeks on the couch,

81
0:03:57.042,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and I would have gone absolutely insane if it hadn't been for my friends.

82
0:04:02.17,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Spontaneous parties broke out at my house every night for weeks.

83
0:04:05.653,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I was fed. I was entertained.

84
0:04:07.953,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It was great.

85
0:04:10.015,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But that kind of enthusiasm is sort of hard to sustain over the long term,

86
0:04:13.96,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and eventually it petered down to just one friend,

87
0:04:17.28,000 --> 0:04:18,000
who would send me jokes during the day

88
0:04:19.296,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and come and keep me company in the evenings --

89
0:04:21.924,000 --> 0:04:25,000
someone I got to know a whole lot better during this period of convalescence.

90
0:04:26.314,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And when I was finally pronounced well enough

91
0:04:28.454,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to do weight-bearing activities,

92
0:04:30.168,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we loaded a telescope in the car and drove up into the mountains

93
0:04:33.231,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to look at the Hale–Bopp comet.

94
0:04:35.371,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Yes, we are geeks.

95
0:04:37.489,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And got caught in a landslide.

96
0:04:39.213,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:41.182,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I know -- like, really?

98
0:04:44.051,000 --> 0:04:45,000
No. Just kidding.

99
0:04:45.537,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:46.743,000 --> 0:04:48,000
No more disasters. No. Just the opposite, in fact.

101
0:04:49.699,000 --> 0:04:5,000
That was 21 years ago,

102
0:04:51.263,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and for 19 of those years,

103
0:04:53.174,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I have been married to that marvelous introvert

104
0:04:56.798,000 --> 0:04:58,000
who never in a million years would have approached me

105
0:04:59.334,000 --> 0:05:,000
under other circumstances.

106
0:05:01.049,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We have a wonderful 14-year-old daughter,

107
0:05:03.133,000 --> 0:05:04,000
who did all my illustrations.

108
0:05:04.764,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Cheers and applause)

109
0:05:06.364,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Yeah.

110
0:05:07.55,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So, pro tip:

111
0:05:08.912,000 --> 0:05:1,000
apparently, nothing makes you sexier than needing a walker

112
0:05:11.72,000 --> 0:05:12,000
on your first date.

113
0:05:13.393,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So this isn't a story about piercings

114
0:05:16.03,000 --> 0:05:18,000
or sharks or boilings or breakings.

115
0:05:18.839,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's a love story.

116
0:05:20.758,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's a love story with a funny little epilogue.

117
0:05:24.845,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now I was weight-bearing again, I could reschedule that surgery,

118
0:05:28.899,000 --> 0:05:29,000
get the spine out.

119
0:05:30.219,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But I didn't need it anymore.

120
0:05:32.407,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Turns out, when you break a bone,

121
0:05:34.131,000 --> 0:05:37,000
your body scavenges calcium from all the bones in your body --

122
0:05:38.081,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and from the little sea urchin spine that you happen to have lodged

123
0:05:41.994,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in the joint of your finger.

124
0:05:44.022,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So yes,

125
0:05:46.094,000 --> 0:05:49,000
my pelvis is now part sea urchin.

126
0:05:49.506,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:51.355,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So to biology brain, physicist brain,

128
0:05:54.469,000 --> 0:05:56,000
adrenaline brain, warm-blooded-mammal brain,

129
0:05:56.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I get to add "urchin brain,"

130
0:05:58.672,000 --> 0:06:01,000
with all of the superpowers that that confers.

131
0:06:02.393,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You don't need to worry, though:

132
0:06:03.953,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that I am not fully human is one of the things

133
0:06:06.136,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that my family loves the most about me.

134
0:06:08.153,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:09.264,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Thank you very much.

136
0:06:10.483,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

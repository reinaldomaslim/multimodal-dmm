1
0:00:13.841,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I thought I'd talk about identity.

2
0:00:15.627,000 --> 0:00:17,000
That's sort of an interesting enough topic to me.

3
0:00:18.06,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And the reason was, because when I was asked to do this,

4
0:00:21.238,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'd just read, in one of the papers, I can't remember,

5
0:00:24.801,000 --> 0:00:27,000
something from someone at Facebook saying, well,

6
0:00:28.204,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"we need to make everybody use their real names."

7
0:00:29.844,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and then that's basically all the problems solved.

8
0:00:32.202,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And that's so wrong,

9
0:00:34.147,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that's such a fundamentally, reactionary view of identity,

10
0:00:38.09,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and it's going to get us into all sorts of trouble.

11
0:00:40.495,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And so what I thought I'd do

12
0:00:41.853,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is I'll explain four sort of problems about it,

13
0:00:45.858,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and then I'll suggest a solution,

14
0:00:47.821,000 --> 0:00:49,000
which hopefully you might find interesting.

15
0:00:49.893,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So just to frame the problem,

16
0:00:51.944,000 --> 0:00:52,000
what does authenticity mean?

17
0:00:53.534,000 --> 0:00:58,000
That's me, that's a camera phone picture of me

18
0:00:58.624,000 --> 0:00:58,000
looking at a painting.

19
0:00:59.604,000 --> 0:00:59,000
[What's the Problem?]

20
0:01:00.369,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's a painting that was painted

21
0:01:01.501,000 --> 0:01:03,000
by a very famous forger,

22
0:01:03.543,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and because I'm not very good at presentations,

23
0:01:05.806,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card.

24
0:01:08.545,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And he was incarcerated in, I think, Wakefield Prison

25
0:01:12.423,000 --> 0:01:15,000
for forging masterpieces by, I think, French Impressionists.

26
0:01:15.989,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And he's so good at it, that when he was in prison,

27
0:01:19.168,000 --> 0:01:2,000
everybody in prison, the governor and whatever,

28
0:01:20.544,000 --> 0:01:22,000
wanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls,

29
0:01:23.391,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because they were so good.

30
0:01:24.683,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And so that's a masterpiece,

31
0:01:26.067,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which is a fake of a masterpiece,

32
0:01:28.066,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake,

33
0:01:34.729,000 --> 0:01:35,000
if you see what I mean.

34
0:01:36.261,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:37.453,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So when we're talking about authenticity,

36
0:01:39.696,000 --> 0:01:44,000
it's a little more fractal than it appears and that's a good example to show it.

37
0:01:45.158,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly.

38
0:01:49.139,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So the first problem, I thought,

39
0:01:50.687,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Chip and PIN, right?

40
0:01:52.239,000 --> 0:01:53,000
[Banks and legacies bringing down the system from within]

41
0:01:53.753,000 --> 0:01:53,000
[Offline solutions do not work online]

42
0:01:54.625,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I'm guessing everyone's got a chip and PIN card, right?

43
0:01:57.241,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So why is that a good example?

44
0:01:59.007,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That's the example of how legacy thinking about identity

45
0:02:02.482,000 --> 0:02:04,000
subverts the security of a well-constructed system.

46
0:02:05.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That chip and PIN card that's in your pocket

47
0:02:08.191,000 --> 0:02:11,000
has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop,

48
0:02:11.433,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is extremely secure,

49
0:02:13.01,000 --> 0:02:15,000
you can put scanning electron microscopes on it,

50
0:02:15.273,000 --> 0:02:17,000
you can try and grind it down, blah blah blah.

51
0:02:17.449,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Those chips have never been broken, whatever you read in the paper.

52
0:02:20.938,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And for a joke, we take that super-secure chip

53
0:02:24.172,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe

54
0:02:27.686,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and for very lazy criminals, we still emboss the card.

55
0:02:31.308,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card,

56
0:02:34.815,000 --> 0:02:36,000
you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it

57
0:02:37.016,000 --> 0:02:38,000
just to sort of speed things up.

58
0:02:38.899,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And even more amusingly, and on my debit card too,

59
0:02:41.995,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we print the name and the SALT code and everything else on the front too.

60
0:02:44.386,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Why?

61
0:02:47.725,000 --> 0:02:51,000
There is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and PIN card.

62
0:02:51.834,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And if you think about it,

63
0:02:53.469,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first.

64
0:02:56.587,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Because the only people that benefit

65
0:02:58.401,000 --> 0:03:,000
from having the name on the card are criminals.

66
0:03:00.975,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You know what your name is, right?

67
0:03:02.616,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:03.517,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And when you go into a shop and buy something,

69
0:03:05.769,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it's a PIN, he doesn't care what the name is.

70
0:03:08.729,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The only place where you ever have to write your name on the back

71
0:03:11.388,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is in America at the moment.

72
0:03:12.558,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And whenever I go to America,

73
0:03:13.769,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and I have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card,

74
0:03:15.569,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway,

75
0:03:17.451,000 --> 0:03:18,000
just as a security mechanism,

76
0:03:19.259,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because if a transaction ever gets disputed,

77
0:03:21.497,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and it comes back and it says Dave Birch,

78
0:03:23.474,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I know it must have been a criminal,

79
0:03:25.213,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because I would never sign it Dave Birch.

80
0:03:28.048,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:29.738,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So if you drop your card in the street,

82
0:03:31.529,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it means a criminal can pick it up and read it.

83
0:03:33.301,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They know the name,

84
0:03:34.006,000 --> 0:03:35,000
from the name they can find the address,

85
0:03:35.935,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and then they can go off and buy stuff online.

86
0:03:38.35,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Why do we put the name on the card?

87
0:03:40.562,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Because we think identity is something to do with names,

88
0:03:44.281,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card,

89
0:03:47.976,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which obsesses us.

90
0:03:49.092,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago,

91
0:03:51.688,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but if you're someone in politics or the home office or whatever,

92
0:03:56.243,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and you think about identity,

93
0:03:57.648,000 --> 0:04:,000
you can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on them.

94
0:04:00.863,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And that's very subversive in a modern world.

95
0:04:04.009,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So the second example I thought I'd use

96
0:04:06.265,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is chatrooms.

97
0:04:08.331,000 --> 0:04:08,000
[Chatrooms and Children]

I'm very proud of that picture, that's my son

playing in his band with his friends for the first-ever gig,

100

I believe you call it, where he got paid.

And I love that picture.

103
0:04:20.035,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better,

(Laughter)

105
0:04:23.501,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I like that picture for the moment.

106
0:04:25.614,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Why do I use that picture?

107
0:04:26.589,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Because that was very interesting, watching that experience as an old person.

108
0:04:31.678,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So him and his friends,

109
0:04:33.121,000 --> 0:04:35,000
they get together, they booked a room, like a church hall,

110
0:04:35.999,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and they got all their friends who had bands,

111
0:04:37.849,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and they got them together,

112
0:04:39.159,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and they do it all on Facebook,

113
0:04:40.66,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and then they sell tickets, and the first band on the -

114
0:04:44.458,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I was going to say "menu,"

115
0:04:45.343,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that's probably the wrong word for it, isn't it?

116
0:04:47.653,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The first band on the list of bands

117
0:04:49.583,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that appears at some public music performance of some kind

118
0:04:54.14,000 --> 0:04:56,000
gets the sales from the first 20 tickets,

119
0:04:56.309,000 --> 0:04:57,000
then the next band gets the next 20,

120
0:04:58.129,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and so on.

121
0:04:59.115,000 --> 0:05:,000
They were at the bottom of the menu,

122
0:05:00.451,000 --> 0:05:02,000
they were like fifth, I thought they had no chance.

He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?

124
0:05:04.831,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But my point is, that all worked perfectly,

125
0:05:06.928,000 --> 0:05:08,000
except on the web.

126
0:05:09.709,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So they're sitting on Facebook,

127
0:05:11.902,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and they're sending these messages and arranging things

128
0:05:14.768,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and they don't know who anybody is, right?

129
0:05:17.087,000 --> 0:05:18,000
That's the big problem we're trying to solve.

130
0:05:18.718,000 --> 0:05:19,000
If only they were using the real names,

131
0:05:20.685,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Then you wouldn't be worried about them on the Internet.

132
0:05:23.376,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And so when he says to me,

133
0:05:24.621,000 --> 0:05:28,000
"Oh, I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars" or something,

134
0:05:28.987,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I'm like, "oh, well, I don't want you to go into a chatroom

135
0:05:32.236,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to talk about guitars, because they might not all be your friends,

136
0:05:35.594,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and some of the people that are in the chatroom

137
0:05:37.857,000 --> 0:05:4,000
might be perverts and teachers and vicars."

138
0:05:41.414,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:43.239,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I mean, they generally are, when you look in the paper, right?

140
0:05:46.168,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So I want to know who all the people in the chatroom are.

141
0:05:49.224,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So okay, you can go in the chatroom,

142
0:05:50.963,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names,

143
0:05:53.987,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and they submit full copies of their police report.

144
0:05:58.352,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But of course, if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name,

145
0:06:01.472,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I'd say no. You can't give them your real name.

146
0:06:03.714,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Because what happens if they turn out to be perverts,

147
0:06:06.414,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and teachers and whatever.

148
0:06:09.087,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So you have this odd sort of paradox

149
0:06:10.826,000 --> 0:06:12,000
where I'm happy for him to go into this space

150
0:06:13.157,000 --> 0:06:14,000
if I know who everybody else is,

151
0:06:15.099,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but I don't want anybody else to know who he is.

152
0:06:17.462,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And so you get this sort of logjam around identity

153
0:06:19.638,000 --> 0:06:2,000
where you want full disclosure from everybody else,

154
0:06:21.274,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but not from yourself.

155
0:06:22.569,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And there's no progress, we get stuck.

156
0:06:24.576,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And so the chatroom thing doesn't work properly,

157
0:06:26.886,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it's a very bad way of thinking about identity.

158
0:06:31.251,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So on my RSS feed, I saw this thing about -

159
0:06:34.186,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I just said something bad about my RSS feed, didn't I?

160
0:06:36.782,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I should stop saying it like that.

161
0:06:38.537,000 --> 0:06:39,000
For some random reason, I can't imagine,

162
0:06:40.07,000 --> 0:06:42,000
something about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox.

163
0:06:42.226,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And I read this story about cheerleaders,

164
0:06:44.203,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and it's a fascinating story.

165
0:06:45.652,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This happened a couple of years ago in the U.S.

166
0:06:47.867,000 --> 0:06:49,000
There were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school

167
0:06:50.592,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in the U.S., and they said mean things

168
0:06:53.475,000 --> 0:06:54,000
about their cheerleading coach,

169
0:06:54.661,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as I'm sure kids do about all of their teachers

170
0:06:56.872,000 --> 0:06:57,000
all of the time,

171
0:06:58.199,000 --> 0:07:,000
and somehow the cheerleading coach found out about this.

172
0:07:00.279,000 --> 0:07:01,000
She was very upset.

173
0:07:01.743,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And so she went to one of the girls, and said,

174
0:07:03.91,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"you have to give me your Facebook password."

175
0:07:06.03,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I read this all the time, where even at some universities

176
0:07:09.719,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and places of education,

177
0:07:10.619,000 --> 0:07:11,000
kids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords.

178
0:07:12.348,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So you've got to give them your Facebook password.

179
0:07:15.103,000 --> 0:07:15,000
She was a kid!

180
0:07:15.976,000 --> 0:07:16,000
What she should have said

181
0:07:17.162,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is, "my lawyer will be calling you

182
0:07:18.392,000 --> 0:07:18,000
first thing in the morning.

183
0:07:19.182,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's an outrageous imposition

184
0:07:21.303,000 --> 0:07:22,000
on my 4th Amendment right to privacy,

185
0:07:23.162,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and you're going to be sued

186
0:07:23.947,000 --> 0:07:23,000
for all the money you've got."

187
0:07:24.542,000 --> 0:07:25,000
That's what she should have said.

188
0:07:25.598,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But she's a kid,

189
0:07:26.577,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so she hands over the password.

190
0:07:28.396,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The teacher can't log into Facebook,

191
0:07:30.446,000 --> 0:07:33,000
because the school has blocked access to Facebook.

192
0:07:33.618,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So the teacher can't log into Facebook until she gets home.

193
0:07:35.531,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So the girl tells her friends,

194
0:07:37.229,000 --> 0:07:37,000
guess what happened?

195
0:07:37.79,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The teacher logged in, she knows.

196
0:07:39.386,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones,

197
0:07:41.227,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and deleted their profiles.

198
0:07:43.094,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And so when the teacher logged in, there was nothing there.

199
0:07:45.979,000 --> 0:07:5,000
My point is, those identities, they don't think about them the same way.

200
0:07:51.631,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Identity is, especially when you're a teenager, a fluid thing.

201
0:07:55.36,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You have lots of identities.

202
0:07:56.965,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And you can have an identity, you don't like it,

203
0:07:59.215,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because it's subverted in some way, or it's insecure, or it's inappropriate,

204
0:08:02.811,000 --> 0:08:04,000
you just delete it and get another one.

205
0:08:04.893,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone,

206
0:08:08.217,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the government or whatever,

207
0:08:09.036,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places,

208
0:08:11.155,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that's absolutely wrong.

209
0:08:12.863,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Why would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook,

210
0:08:15.895,000 --> 0:08:17,000
unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way?

211
0:08:18.777,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And it just doesn't work properly.

212
0:08:21.408,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And my fourth example is there are some cases

213
0:08:23.622,000 --> 0:08:25,000
where you really want to be -

214
0:08:26.055,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In case you're wondering, that's me at the G20 protest.

215
0:08:29.625,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I wasn't actually at the G20 protest, but I had a meeting at a bank

216
0:08:33.301,000 --> 0:08:36,000
on the day of the G20 protest, and I got an email from the bank

217
0:08:36.734,000 --> 0:08:4,000
saying please don't wear a suit, because it'll inflame the protesters.

218
0:08:41.295,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I look pretty good in a suit, frankly,

219
0:08:43.069,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so you can see why it would drive them

220
0:08:44.759,000 --> 0:08:45,000
into an anti-capitalist frenzy.

221
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

222
0:08:46.795,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So I thought, well, look.

223
0:08:47.724,000 --> 0:08:5,000
If I don't want to inflame the protesters,

224
0:08:50.893,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the obvious thing to do

225
0:08:51.809,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is go dressed as a protester.

226
0:08:53.214,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So I went dressed completely in black,

227
0:08:55.232,000 --> 0:08:56,000
you know, with a black balaclava,

228
0:08:57.116,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I had black gloves on,

229
0:08:57.95,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but I've taken them off to sign the visitor's book.

230
0:08:59.587,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

231
0:09:00.159,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I'm wearing black trousers, black boots,

232
0:09:02.342,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I'm dressed completely in black.

233
0:09:03.748,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I go into the bank at 10 o'clock,

234
0:09:04.922,000 --> 0:09:04,000
go, "Hi, I'm Dave Birch,

235
0:09:05.887,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I've got a 3 o'clock with so and so there."

236
0:09:07.163,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Sure. They sign me in.

237
0:09:08.604,000 --> 0:09:1,000
There's my visitor's badge.

238
0:09:11.375,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Laughter)

239
0:09:12.266,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So this nonsense

240
0:09:13.584,000 --> 0:09:15,000
about you've got to have real names on Facebook and whatever,

241
0:09:15.638,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that gets you that kind of security.

242
0:09:17.873,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That gets you security theater, where there's no actual security,

243
0:09:22.392,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security.

244
0:09:25.73,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And as long as everybody learns their lines,

245
0:09:26.855,000 --> 0:09:27,000
everyone's happy.

246
0:09:28.391,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But it's not real security.

247
0:09:31.255,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Especially because I hate banks more than the G20 protesters do,

248
0:09:34.497,000 --> 0:09:35,000
because I work for them.

249
0:09:35.682,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I know that things are actually worse than these guys think.

250
0:09:38.509,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Laughter)

251
0:09:41.872,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank

252
0:09:46.966,000 --> 0:09:49,000
who was doing something.

253
0:09:56.744,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Suppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader,

254
0:09:58.934,000 --> 0:10:,000
and I want to report it to the boss of the bank.

255
0:10:01.237,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So I log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing.

256
0:10:02.653,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I send a message, this guy's a rogue trader.

257
0:10:05.118,000 --> 0:10:06,000
That message is meaningless

258
0:10:06.916,000 --> 0:10:08,000
if you don't know that I'm a trader at the bank.

259
0:10:09.864,000 --> 0:10:1,000
If that message just comes from anybody,

260
0:10:11.793,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it has zero information value.

261
0:10:14.45,000 --> 0:10:16,000
There's no point in sending that message.

262
0:10:18.463,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But if I have to prove who I am,

263
0:10:21.23,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I'll never send that message.

264
0:10:22.635,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon.

265
0:10:26.488,000 --> 0:10:28,000
That message will only happen if I'm anonymous.

266
0:10:29.409,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there,

267
0:10:34.2,000 --> 0:10:36,000
otherwise we don't get where we want to get to.

268
0:10:36.463,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So four issues. So what are we going to do about it?

269
0:10:39.133,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Well, what we tend to do about it

270
0:10:43.82,000 --> 0:10:45,000
is we think about Orwell space.

271
0:10:46.208,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And we try to make electronic versions

272
0:10:49.354,000 --> 0:10:51,000
of the identity card that we got rid of in 1953.

273
0:10:51.661,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So we think if we had a card,

274
0:10:54.418,000 --> 0:10:55,000
call it a Facebook login,

275
0:10:55.757,000 --> 0:10:56,000
which proves who you are,

276
0:10:57.054,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and I make you carry it all the time,

277
0:10:58.945,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that solves the problem.

278
0:10:59.763,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And of course, for all those reasons I've just outlined,

279
0:11:01.921,000 --> 0:11:01,000
it doesn't, and it might, actually,

280
0:11:02.913,000 --> 0:11:03,000
make some problems worse.

281
0:11:03.985,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The more times you're forced to use your real identity,

282
0:11:06.808,000 --> 0:11:08,000
certainly in transactional terms,

283
0:11:09.048,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted.

284
0:11:11.93,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The goal is to stop people from using identity

285
0:11:14.194,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in transactions which don't need identity,

286
0:11:16.371,000 --> 0:11:18,000
which is actually almost all transactions.

287
0:11:18.88,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Almost all of the transactions you do

288
0:11:21.177,000 --> 0:11:22,000
are not, who are you?

289
0:11:22.865,000 --> 0:11:24,000
They're, are you allowed to drive the car,

290
0:11:24.999,000 --> 0:11:25,000
are you allowed in the building,

291
0:11:26.547,000 --> 0:11:26,000
are you over 18,

292
0:11:27.404,000 --> 0:11:29,000
etcetera, etcetera.

293
0:11:29.519,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So my suggestion-I, like James,

294
0:11:31.35,000 --> 0:11:34,000
think that there should be a resurgence of interest in R & D.

295
0:11:34.511,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I think this is a solvable problem.

296
0:11:35.296,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's something we can do about.

297
0:11:37.116,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Naturally, in these circumstances,

298
0:11:39.064,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I turn to Doctor Who.

299
0:11:40.438,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Because in this,

300
0:11:42.574,000 --> 0:11:43,000
as in so many other walks of life,

301
0:11:44.218,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Doctor Who has already shown us the answer.

302
0:11:47.171,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So I should say,

303
0:11:47.985,000 --> 0:11:49,000
for some of our foreign visitors,

304
0:11:50.316,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Doctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England,

305
0:11:54.17,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

306
0:11:55.747,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us.

307
0:11:58.547,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And this is Doctor Who with his psychic paper.

308
0:12:02.617,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Come on, you guys must have seen Doctor Who's psychic paper.

309
0:12:04.787,000 --> 0:12:05,000
You're not nerds if you say yes.

310
0:12:06.787,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper?

311
0:12:08.923,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Oh right, you were in the library the whole time studying I guess.

312
0:12:11.353,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Is that what you're going to tell us?

313
0:12:13.423,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Doctor Who's psychic paper

314
0:12:14.685,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is when you hold up the psychic paper,

315
0:12:16.805,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the person, in their brain,

316
0:12:18.343,000 --> 0:12:2,000
sees the thing that they need to see.

317
0:12:20.692,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So I want to show you a British passport,

318
0:12:23.051,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I hold up the psychic paper,

319
0:12:24.077,000 --> 0:12:25,000
you see a British passport.

320
0:12:25.557,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I want to get into a party,

321
0:12:27.353,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I hold up the psychic paper,

322
0:12:28.96,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I show you a party invitation.

323
0:12:30.413,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You see what you want to see.

324
0:12:32.488,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So what I'm saying is we need to make an electronic version of that,

325
0:12:35.703,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but with one tiny, tiny change,

326
0:12:37.9,000 --> 0:12:39,000
which is that it'll only show you the British passport

327
0:12:40.496,000 --> 0:12:41,000
if I've actually got one.

328
0:12:41.712,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It'll only show you the party invitation

329
0:12:42.931,000 --> 0:12:43,000
if I actually have one.

330
0:12:44.328,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It will only show you that I'm over 18 if I actually am over 18.

331
0:12:47.352,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But nothing else.

332
0:12:49.676,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So you're the bouncer at the pub, you need to know that I'm over 18,

333
0:12:54.451,000 --> 0:12:56,000
instead of showing you my driving license,

334
0:12:56.475,000 --> 0:12:57,000
which shows you I know how to drive,

335
0:12:58.316,000 --> 0:13:,000
what my name is, my address, all these kind of things,

336
0:13:00.912,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I show you my psychic paper,

337
0:13:02.491,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and all it tells you is am I over 18 or not.

338
0:13:05.657,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Right.

339
0:13:07.093,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Is that just a pipe dream?

340
0:13:08.431,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Of course not, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you.

341
0:13:10.124,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So in order to build that and make it work,

342
0:13:13.208,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I'm only going to name these things, I'll not go into them,

343
0:13:15.979,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we need a plan,

344
0:13:17.156,000 --> 0:13:18,000
which is we're going to build this

345
0:13:18.405,000 --> 0:13:2,000
as an infrastructure for everybody to use,

346
0:13:20.429,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to solve all of these problems.

347
0:13:22.283,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We're going to make a utility,

348
0:13:24.331,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the utility has to be universal,

349
0:13:25.879,000 --> 0:13:25,000
you can use it everywhere,

350
0:13:26.762,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along.

351
0:13:29.977,000 --> 0:13:3,000
That's a Japanese ATM,

352
0:13:31.36,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone.

353
0:13:34.468,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So when you want to draw money out,

354
0:13:35.455,000 --> 0:13:36,000
you put the mobile phone on the ATM,

355
0:13:36.952,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and touch your finger,

356
0:13:38.217,000 --> 0:13:4,000
your fingerprint goes through to the phone,

357
0:13:40.289,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the phone says yes, that's whoever,

358
0:13:41.98,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and the ATM then gives you some money.

359
0:13:44.184,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It has to be a utility that you can use everywhere.

360
0:13:47.221,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It has to be absolutely convenient,

361
0:13:49.007,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that's me going into the pub.

362
0:13:52.174,000 --> 0:13:54,000
All the device on the door of the pub is allowed is,

363
0:13:54.967,000 --> 0:13:57,000
is this person over 18 and not barred from the pub?

364
0:13:58.64,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And so the idea is, you touch your ID card to the door,

365
0:14:01.97,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and if I am allowed in, it shows my picture,

366
0:14:03.929,000 --> 0:14:04,000
if I'm not allowed in, it shows a red cross.

367
0:14:05.39,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It doesn't disclose any other information.

368
0:14:07.005,000 --> 0:14:08,000
It has to have no special gadgets.

369
0:14:08.917,000 --> 0:14:09,000
That can only mean one thing,

370
0:14:10.552,000 --> 0:14:11,000
following on from Ross's statement,

371
0:14:12.243,000 --> 0:14:13,000
which I agree with completely.

372
0:14:13.721,000 --> 0:14:14,000
If it means no special gadgets,

373
0:14:14.833,000 --> 0:14:15,000
it has to run on a mobile phone.

374
0:14:16.207,000 --> 0:14:17,000
That's the only choice we have,

375
0:14:17.31,000 --> 0:14:18,000
we have to make it work on mobile phones.

376
0:14:19.189,000 --> 0:14:19,000
There are 6.6 billion

377
0:14:20.123,000 --> 0:14:2,000
mobile phone subscriptions.

378
0:14:21.047,000 --> 0:14:23,000
My favorite statistic of all time,

379
0:14:23.083,000 --> 0:14:24,000
only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world.

380
0:14:25.06,000 --> 0:14:26,000
That means something,

381
0:14:26.119,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I don't know what.

382
0:14:27.376,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Laughter)

383
0:14:27.754,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I rely on our futurologists to tell me.

384
0:14:31.217,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It has to be a utility which is extensible.

385
0:14:32.927,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So it has to be something

386
0:14:34.212,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that anybody could build on.

387
0:14:35.802,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Anybody should be able to use this infrastructure,

388
0:14:37.69,000 --> 0:14:39,000
you don't need permissions, licenses, whatever,

389
0:14:40.144,000 --> 0:14:43,000
anyone should be able to write some code to do this.

390
0:14:45.176,000 --> 0:14:46,000
You know what symmetry is,

391
0:14:46.441,000 --> 0:14:48,000
so you don't need a picture of it.

392
0:14:48.788,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This is how we're going to do it.

393
0:14:49.952,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We're going to do it using phones,

394
0:14:50.986,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and we're going to do it

395
0:14:51.612,000 --> 0:14:52,000
using mobile proximity.

396
0:14:52.768,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I'm going to suggest to you

397
0:14:53.904,000 --> 0:14:54,000
the technology to implement

398
0:14:55.24,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Doctor Who's psychic paper

399
0:14:56.526,000 --> 0:14:57,000
is already here, and if any of you

400
0:14:58.17,000 --> 0:15:,000
have got one of the new Barclay's debit cards

401
0:15:00.649,000 --> 0:15:01,000
with the contactless interface on it,

402
0:15:01.878,000 --> 0:15:02,000
you've already got that technology.

403
0:15:03.569,000 --> 0:15:04,000
If you've ever been up to the big city,

404
0:15:05.493,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and used an Oyster card at all,

405
0:15:06.994,000 --> 0:15:08,000
does that ring any bells to anybody?

406
0:15:09.089,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The technology already exists.

407
0:15:09.835,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The first phones

408
0:15:11.225,000 --> 0:15:11,000
that have the technology built in,

409
0:15:11.855,000 --> 0:15:13,000
the Google Nexus, the S2,

410
0:15:14.154,000 --> 0:15:14,000
the Samsung Wifi 7.9,

411
0:15:14.863,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the first phones that have

412
0:15:16.355,000 --> 0:15:17,000
the technology built into them

413
0:15:17.447,000 --> 0:15:17,000
are already in the shops.

414
0:15:18.281,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So the idea that the gas man

415
0:15:19.993,000 --> 0:15:21,000
can turn up at my mom's door

416
0:15:22.185,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and he can show my mom his phone,

417
0:15:24.387,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and she can tap it with her phone,

418
0:15:25.722,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and it will come up with green if he really is from British Gas

419
0:15:28.029,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and allowed in,

420
0:15:29.241,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and it'll come up with red if he isn't,

421
0:15:30.911,000 --> 0:15:3,000
end of story.

422
0:15:31.521,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We have the technology to do that.

423
0:15:33.371,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And what's more,

424
0:15:34.606,000 --> 0:15:36,000
although some of those things sounded a bit counter-intuitive,

425
0:15:36.751,000 --> 0:15:38,000
like proving I'm over 18 without proving who I am,

426
0:15:39.539,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the cryptography to do that not only exists,

427
0:15:41.764,000 --> 0:15:43,000
it's extremely well-known and well-understood.

428
0:15:43.993,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Digital signatures, the blinding of public key certificates,

429
0:15:46.648,000 --> 0:15:47,000
these technologies have been around for a while,

430
0:15:48.392,000 --> 0:15:5,000
we've just had no way of packaging them up.

431
0:15:50.464,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So the technology already exists.

432
0:15:53.181,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We know it works,

433
0:15:56.869,000 --> 0:15:57,000
There are a few examples of the technology being used

434
0:15:58.617,000 --> 0:15:59,000
in experimental places.

435
0:16:00.287,000 --> 0:16:01,000
That's London Fashion Week,

436
0:16:01.615,000 --> 0:16:02,000
where we built a system with O2,

437
0:16:03.489,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park,

438
0:16:06.256,000 --> 0:16:07,000
you can see the persons

439
0:16:07.379,000 --> 0:16:08,000
walking in with their VIP band,

440
0:16:09.14,000 --> 0:16:09,000
it's just being checked

441
0:16:09.624,000 --> 0:16:1,000
by the Nokia phone that's reading the band.

442
0:16:10.724,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I'm only putting those up to show you

443
0:16:12.422,000 --> 0:16:13,000
these things are prosaic,

444
0:16:13.651,000 --> 0:16:14,000
this stuff works in these environments.

445
0:16:15.533,000 --> 0:16:16,000
They don't need to be special.

446
0:16:16.986,000 --> 0:16:21,000
So finally, I know that you can do this,

447
0:16:23.789,000 --> 0:16:25,000
because if you saw the episode of Doctor Who,

448
0:16:26.693,000 --> 0:16:27,000
the Easter special of Doctor Who,

449
0:16:28.593,000 --> 0:16:31,000
where he went to Mars in a bus,

450
0:16:31.969,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I should say again for our foreign students,

451
0:16:33.531,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that doesn't happen every episode.

452
0:16:35.204,000 --> 0:16:36,000
This was a very special case.

453
0:16:36.675,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus,

454
0:16:39.916,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I can't show you the clip,

455
0:16:41.589,000 --> 0:16:44,000
due to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne-style copyright

456
0:16:44.613,000 --> 0:16:45,000
by the BBC,

457
0:16:46.506,000 --> 0:16:48,000
but in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus,

458
0:16:49.245,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Doctor Who is clearly shown getting on to the bus

459
0:16:53.379,000 --> 0:16:54,000
with the Oyster card reader

460
0:16:54.679,000 --> 0:16:55,000
using his psychic paper.

461
0:16:56.247,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Which proves that psychic paper

462
0:16:58.339,000 --> 0:16:59,000
has an MSE interface.

463
0:17:00.054,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I'm here to explain

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And to do that, I'd like to talk first

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
about environmental toxins in our bodies.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So some of you may know

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that's found in the lining of canned foods

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and some plastics.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So BPA mimics the body's own hormones

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and causes neurological and reproductive problems.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And it's everywhere.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
A recent study found BPA

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in 93 percent of people six and older.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But it's just one chemical.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies,

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and this includes preservatives, pesticides

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and heavy metals like lead and mercury.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
To me, this says three things.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
First, don't become a cannibal.

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Second, we are both responsible for and the victims of

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
our own pollution.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And third,

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
our bodies are filters and storehouses

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
for environmental toxins.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So what happens to all these toxins when we die?

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The short answer is:

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They return to the environment in one way or another,

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
continuing the cycle of toxicity.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But our current funeral practices

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
make the situation much worse.

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
If you're cremated,

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
from our dental fillings alone every year.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And in a traditional American funeral,

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to make it look alive.

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to slow decomposition --

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in funeral personnel.

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies,

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we deny death, poison the living

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and further harm the environment.

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming,

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are a step in the right direction,

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I think there's a better solution.

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I'm an artist,

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so I'd like to offer a modest proposal

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
at the intersection

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of art, science and culture.

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The Infinity Burial Project,

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
an alternative burial system

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that uses mushrooms

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to decompose and clean toxins in bodies.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The Infinity Burial Project

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
began a few years ago with a fantasy

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to create the Infinity Mushroom --

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
a new hybrid mushroom

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and deliver nutrients to plant roots,

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
leaving clean compost.

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But I learned it's nearly impossible

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to create a new hybrid mushroom.

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I also learned

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that some of our tastiest mushrooms

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
can clean environmental toxins in soil.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So I thought maybe I could train an army

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to eat my body.

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off --

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
my hair, skin and nails --

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
As the mushrooms grow,

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I pick the best feeders

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to become Infinity Mushrooms.

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
for the afterlife.

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So when I die,

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and be able to eat it.

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
All right, so for some of you,

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
this may be really, really out there.

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Just a little.

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I realize this is not the kind of relationship

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that we usually aspire to have with our food.

91
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But as I watch the mushrooms grow

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and digest my body,

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I imagine the Infinity Mushroom

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the relationship between my body and the environment.

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
See for me,

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
cultivating the Infinity Mushroom

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is more than just scientific experimentation

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or gardening or raising a pet,

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
it's a step towards accepting the fact

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that someday I will die and decay.

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's also a step

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
towards taking responsibility

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for my own burden on the planet.

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
of cultivating decomposing organisms

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
called decompiculture,

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a concept that was developed by an entomologist,

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Timothy Myles.

111
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation --

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the cultivation of organisms that decompose

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and clean toxins in bodies.

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And now about these ninja pajamas.

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Once it's completed,

117
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
First, a burial suit

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
infused with mushroom spores,

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the Mushroom Death Suit.

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I'm wearing the second prototype

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of this burial suit.

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It's covered with a crocheted netting

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that is embedded with mushroom spores.

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The dendritic pattern you see

127
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia,

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which are the equivalent of plant roots.

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I'm also making a decompiculture kit,

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a cocktail of capsules

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that contain Infinity Mushroom spores

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and other elements

133
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that speed decomposition and toxin remediation.

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly,

135
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
a kind of second skin,

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which dissolves quickly

137
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms.

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in the next year or two,

140
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and then I'd like to begin testing them,

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
first with expired meat from the market

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and then with human subjects.

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And believe it or not,

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to be eaten by mushrooms.

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What I've learned from talking to these folks

148
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is that we share a common desire

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to understand and accept death

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I wanted to cultivate this perspective

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
just like the mushrooms,

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so I formed the Decompiculture Society,

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
a group of people called decompinauts

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
who actively explore their postmortem options,

156
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
seek death acceptance

157
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and cultivate decomposing organisms

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
like the Infinity Mushroom.

159
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision

160
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of a cultural shift,

161
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
from our current culture of death denial and body preservation

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to one of decompiculture,

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
a radical acceptance of death and decomposition.

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Accepting death means accepting

165
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that we are physical beings

166
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
who are intimately connected to the environment,

167
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
as the research on environmental toxins confirms.

168
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And the saying goes,

169
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we came from dust and will return to dust.

170
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And once we understand that we're connected to the environment,

171
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we see that the survival of our species

172
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
depends on the survival of the planet.

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I believe this is the beginning

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of true environmental responsibility.

175
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Thank you.

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000

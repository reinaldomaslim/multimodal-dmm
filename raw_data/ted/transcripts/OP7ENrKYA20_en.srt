1
0:00:12.86,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I was born in Taiwan.

2
0:00:14.595,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I grew up surrounded by

3
0:00:16.419,000 --> 0:00:18,000
different types of hardware stores,

4
0:00:19.119,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I like going to night markets.

5
0:00:21.467,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I love the energy of the night markets,

6
0:00:23.307,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the colors, the lights, the toys,

7
0:00:25.859,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and all the unexpected things I find every time I go,

8
0:00:29.302,000 --> 0:00:32,000
things like watermelon with straw antennas

9
0:00:32.672,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or puppies with mohawks.

10
0:00:36.494,000 --> 0:00:38,000
When I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart,

11
0:00:39.304,000 --> 0:00:41,000
any kind of toys I'd find around the house,

12
0:00:41.328,000 --> 0:00:43,000
like my brother's BB gun when he's not home.

13
0:00:43.562,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I also liked to make environments

14
0:00:45.58,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for people to explore and play.

15
0:00:47.668,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In these early installations,

16
0:00:49.618,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags,

17
0:00:52.146,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and things I would find in the hardware store

18
0:00:53.986,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or around the house.

19
0:00:55.202,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I would take things like highlighter pen,

20
0:00:57.938,000 --> 0:01:,000
mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing,

21
0:01:01.39,000 --> 0:01:03,000
creating these glowing circulatory systems

22
0:01:03.902,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for people to walk through and enjoy.

23
0:01:06.286,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I like these materials because of the way they look,

24
0:01:08.794,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the way they feel, and they're very affordable.

25
0:01:12.09,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I also liked to make devices that work with body parts.

26
0:01:14.916,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I would take camera LED lights

27
0:01:17.094,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist

28
0:01:19.235,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I would videotape my belly button,

29
0:01:21.394,000 --> 0:01:22,000
get a different perspective,

30
0:01:22.416,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and see what it does.

31
0:01:24.778,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:26.94,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I also like to modify household appliances.

33
0:01:29.522,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This is an automatic night light.

34
0:01:30.82,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Some of you might have them at home.

35
0:01:32.434,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I would cut out the light sensor,

36
0:01:34.066,000 --> 0:01:35,000
add an extension line,

37
0:01:35.97,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and use modeling clay,

38
0:01:37.466,000 --> 0:01:38,000
stick it onto the television,

39
0:01:39.242,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and then I would videotape my eye,

40
0:01:41.254,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and using the dark part of my eye

41
0:01:43.122,000 --> 0:01:44,000
tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time,

42
0:01:45.002,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so you turn on the lightbulb.

43
0:01:46.754,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The white of the eye and the eyelid

44
0:01:48.674,000 --> 0:01:5,000
will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime,

45
0:01:50.866,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and it will shut off the light.

46
0:01:53.632,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I wanted to collect more different types of eyes,

47
0:01:55.72,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so I built this device using bicycle helmets,

48
0:01:58.464,000 --> 0:02:,000
some lightbulbs and television sets.

49
0:02:00.88,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet

50
0:02:03.271,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and record their eyes.

51
0:02:05.596,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This device allows me to symbolically

52
0:02:08.718,000 --> 0:02:09,000
extract other people's eyes,

53
0:02:10.262,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so I have a diversity of eyes to use

54
0:02:12.159,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for my other sculptures.

55
0:02:20.829,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This sculpture has four eyes.

56
0:02:22.589,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Each eye is controlling a different device.

57
0:02:24.757,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This eye is turning itself around in a television.

58
0:02:28.237,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This eye is inflating a plastic tube.

59
0:02:30.653,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This eye is watching a video of another piece being made.

60
0:02:34.229,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And these two eyes are activating glowing water.

61
0:02:38.191,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Many of these pieces are later on shown

62
0:02:40.173,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions

63
0:02:42.517,000 --> 0:02:44,000
around the world.

64
0:02:44.867,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I love science and biology.

65
0:02:47.23,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship

66
0:02:49.717,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum

67
0:02:51.765,000 --> 0:02:53,000
looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.

68
0:02:54.573,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I love these creatures. I love the way they look, the way they feel.

69
0:02:57.677,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They're soft, they're slimy,

70
0:03:00.535,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I was fascinated by the way they use light

71
0:03:02.725,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in their environment,

72
0:03:03.95,000 --> 0:03:05,000
either to attract mates, for self-defense,

73
0:03:06.02,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or to attract food.

74
0:03:08.818,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This research inspired my work in many different ways,

75
0:03:11.237,000 --> 0:03:15,000
things like movement or different light patterns.

76
0:03:18.184,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So I started gathering a lot of

77
0:03:19.621,000 --> 0:03:21,000
different types of material in my studio

78
0:03:22.352,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and just experimenting

79
0:03:23.547,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and trying this out, trying that out,

80
0:03:25.371,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.

81
0:03:27.995,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I used a lot of computer cooling fans

82
0:03:30.259,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and just kind of put them together and see what happens.

83
0:03:33.755,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is an 8,000-square-foot installation

84
0:03:35.955,000 --> 0:03:36,000
composed of many different creatures,

85
0:03:37.363,000 --> 0:03:4,000
some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor.

86
0:03:40.846,000 --> 0:03:41,000
From afar, they look alien-like,

87
0:03:42.134,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but when you look closer,

88
0:03:43.802,000 --> 0:03:44,000
they're all made out of black garbage bags

89
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or Tupperware containers.

90
0:03:46.95,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I'd like to share with you how ordinary things

91
0:03:49.91,000 --> 0:03:54,000
can become something magical and wondrous.

92
0:04:06.71,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Applause)

93
0:05:04.879,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Thank you.

94
0:05:06.735,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Applause)

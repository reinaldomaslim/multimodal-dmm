1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I grew up to study the brain

2
0:00:20.398,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because I have a brother who has been diagnosed

3
0:00:22.836,000 --> 0:00:24,000
with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.

4
0:00:25.806,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And as a sister and later, as a scientist,

5
0:00:29.771,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I wanted to understand, why is it that I can take my dreams,

6
0:00:34.088,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I can connect them to my reality,

7
0:00:36.347,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I can make my dreams come true?

8
0:00:39.037,000 --> 0:00:42,000
What is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia

9
0:00:42.838,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality,

10
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
so they instead become delusion?

11
0:00:50.703,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses.

12
0:00:55.703,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston,

13
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
where I was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes,

14
0:01:01.881,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.

15
0:01:05.172,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And in the lab, we were asking the question,

16
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"What are the biological differences

17
0:01:11.204,000 --> 0:01:15,000
between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control,

18
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
as compared with the brains of individuals

19
0:01:18.024,000 --> 0:01:22,000
diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"

20
0:01:22.964,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:

21
0:01:27.479,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which cells are communicating with which cells,

22
0:01:30.605,000 --> 0:01:31,000
with which chemicals,

23
0:01:32.163,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and then in what quantities of those chemicals?

24
0:01:35.536,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So there was a lot of meaning in my life

25
0:01:37.789,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because I was performing this type of research during the day,

26
0:01:41.321,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but then in the evenings and on the weekends,

27
0:01:44.447,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I traveled as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

28
0:01:50.034,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But on the morning of December 10, 1996,

29
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own.

30
0:01:57.687,000 --> 0:02:01,000
A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain.

31
0:02:02.254,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And in the course of four hours,

32
0:02:04.448,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I watched my brain completely deteriorate

33
0:02:07.674,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in its ability to process all information.

34
0:02:11.282,000 --> 0:02:12,000
On the morning of the hemorrhage,

35
0:02:13.061,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of my life.

36
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I essentially became an infant in a woman's body.

37
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
If you've ever seen a human brain,

38
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another.

39
0:02:30.199,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And I have brought for you a real human brain.

40
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Groaning, laughter)

41
0:02:43.235,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So this is a real human brain.

42
0:02:46.648,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This is the front of the brain,

43
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down,

44
0:02:51.799,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head.

45
0:02:56.242,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And when you look at the brain,

46
0:02:57.81,000 --> 0:03:,000
it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices

47
0:03:00.843,000 --> 0:03:02,000
are completely separate from one another.

48
0:03:04.029,000 --> 0:03:06,000
For those of you who understand computers,

49
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor,

50
0:03:10.279,000 --> 0:03:13,000
while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor.

51
0:03:14.552,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The two hemispheres do communicate with one another

52
0:03:17.401,000 --> 0:03:18,000
through the corpus callosum,

53
0:03:18.98,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers.

54
0:03:23.198,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But other than that,

55
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the two hemispheres are completely separate.

56
0:03:27.614,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Because they process information differently,

57
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
each of our hemispheres think about different things,

58
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they care about different things, and, dare I say,

59
0:03:37.918,000 --> 0:03:39,000
they have very different personalities.

60
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.

61
0:03:47.116,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Assistant: It has been.

62
0:03:48.44,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:51.532,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment.

64
0:03:56.385,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's all about "right here, right now."

65
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures

66
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.

67
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously

68
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
through all of our sensory systems

69
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and then it explodes into this enormous collage

70
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
of what this present moment looks like,

71
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
what this present moment smells like and tastes like,

72
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
what it feels like and what it sounds like.

73
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me

74
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
through the consciousness of my right hemisphere.

75
0:04:38.568,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We are energy-beings connected to one another

76
0:04:42.21,000 --> 0:04:44,000
through the consciousness of our right hemispheres

77
0:04:45.005,000 --> 0:04:47,000
as one human family.

78
0:04:47.817,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet,

79
0:04:51.878,000 --> 0:04:54,000
here to make the world a better place.

80
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.

81
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different place.

82
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.

83
0:05:12.183,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future.

84
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Our left hemisphere is designed to take

85
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that enormous collage of the present moment

86
0:05:22.946,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and start picking out details, and more details about those details.

87
0:05:28.02,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It then categorizes and organizes all that information,

88
0:05:32.437,000 --> 0:05:35,000
associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned,

89
0:05:35.972,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and projects into the future all of our possibilities.

90
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And our left hemisphere thinks in language.

91
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world

92
0:05:49.282,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to my external world.

93
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's that little voice that says to me,

94
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"Hey, you've got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home.

95
0:05:57.932,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I need them in the morning."

96
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's that calculating intelligence

97
0:06:01.252,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that reminds me when I have to do my laundry.

98
0:06:05.095,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But perhaps most important, it's that little voice that says to me,

99
0:06:09.948,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"I am. I am."

100
0:06:13.803,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me "I am,"

101
0:06:17.822,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I become separate.

102
0:06:19.46,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I become a single solid individual,

103
0:06:21.739,000 --> 0:06:23,000
separate from the energy flow around me

104
0:06:24.058,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and separate from you.

105
0:06:25.914,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke.

106
0:06:30.747,000 --> 0:06:33,000
On the morning of the stroke,

107
0:06:33.826,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye.

108
0:06:38.149,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream.

109
0:06:42.984,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And it just gripped me --

110
0:06:44.853,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and then it released me.

111
0:06:47.088,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And then it just gripped me --

112
0:06:49.223,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and then it released me.

113
0:06:50.974,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain,

114
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
so I thought, "OK, I'll just start my normal routine."

115
0:06:57.926,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider,

116
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which is a full-body, full-exercise machine.

117
0:07:04.545,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I'm jamming away on this thing,

118
0:07:06.779,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws

119
0:07:11.572,000 --> 0:07:13,000
grasping onto the bar.

120
0:07:14.064,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And I thought, "That's very peculiar."

121
0:07:16.079,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And I looked down at my body

122
0:07:17.559,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and I thought, "Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."

123
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away

124
0:07:24.02,000 --> 0:07:26,000
from my normal perception of reality,

125
0:07:26.517,000 --> 0:07:28,000
where I'm the person on the machine having the experience,

126
0:07:29.518,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to some esoteric space

127
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:34,000
where I'm witnessing myself having this experience.

128
0:07:35.266,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse.

129
0:07:38.574,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So I get off the machine,

130
0:07:39.897,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and I'm walking across my living room floor,

131
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down.

132
0:07:46.996,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And every step is very rigid and very deliberate.

133
0:07:50.456,000 --> 0:07:52,000
There's no fluidity to my pace,

134
0:07:53.329,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and there's this constriction in my area of perception,

135
0:07:56.281,000 --> 0:07:59,000
so I'm just focused on internal systems.

136
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I'm standing in my bathroom

137
0:08:00.885,000 --> 0:08:01,000
getting ready to step into the shower,

138
0:08:02.756,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body.

139
0:08:05.529,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I heard a little voice saying, "OK. You muscles, you've got to contract.

140
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You muscles, you relax."

141
0:08:10.742,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And then I lost my balance, and I'm propped up against the wall.

142
0:08:14.9,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And I look down at my arm

143
0:08:16.869,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body.

144
0:08:22.615,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I can't define where I begin and where I end,

145
0:08:26.138,000 --> 0:08:28,000
because the atoms and the molecules of my arm

146
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall.

147
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And all I could detect was this energy -- energy.

148
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And I'm asking myself, "What is wrong with me?

149
0:08:38.497,000 --> 0:08:39,000
What is going on?"

150
0:08:40.3,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And in that moment, my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent.

151
0:08:46.091,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button.

152
0:08:50.037,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Total silence.

153
0:08:51.91,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind.

154
0:08:56.687,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But then I was immediately captivated

155
0:08:59.95,000 --> 0:09:02,000
by the magnificence of the energy around me.

156
0:09:03.734,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body,

157
0:09:07.632,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I felt enormous and expansive.

158
0:09:11.194,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I felt at one with all the energy that was,

159
0:09:14.543,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and it was beautiful there.

160
0:09:16.733,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online

161
0:09:19.599,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and it says to me, "Hey! We've got a problem!

162
0:09:21.83,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We've got to get some help."

163
0:09:23.354,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"

164
0:09:25.406,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

165
0:09:26.957,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem."

166
0:09:28.972,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness --

167
0:09:33.495,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land.

168
0:09:38.123,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But it was beautiful there.

169
0:09:39.736,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected

170
0:09:42.758,000 --> 0:09:45,000
from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world.

171
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So here I am in this space,

172
0:09:48.196,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and my job, and any stress related to my job -- it was gone.

173
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And I felt lighter in my body.

174
0:09:56.203,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And imagine all of the relationships in the external world

175
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and any stressors related to any of those -- they were gone.

176
0:10:02.726,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.

177
0:10:06.631,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And imagine what it would feel like to lose

178
0:10:08.989,000 --> 0:10:11,000
37 years of emotional baggage!

179
0:10:12.751,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --

180
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
euphoria.

181
0:10:20.205,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It was beautiful.

182
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says,

183
0:10:23.98,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"Hey! You've got to pay attention.

184
0:10:25.63,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We've got to get help."

185
0:10:27.052,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help. I've got to focus."

186
0:10:29.931,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress

187
0:10:32.423,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and I'm walking around my apartment,

188
0:10:34.254,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and I'm thinking, "I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"

189
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And in that moment,

190
0:10:39.623,000 --> 0:10:41,000
my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.

191
0:10:41.989,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Then I realized, "Oh my gosh! I'm having a stroke!"

192
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And the next thing my brain says to me is,

193
0:10:48.973,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Wow! This is so cool!

194
0:10:51.363,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:53.331,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This is so cool!

196
0:10:54.918,000 --> 0:10:56,000
How many brain scientists have the opportunity

197
0:10:57.497,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to study their own brain from the inside out?"

198
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Laughter)

199
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And then it crosses my mind, "But I'm a very busy woman!"

200
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

201
0:11:07.504,000 --> 0:11:09,000
"I don't have time for a stroke!"

202
0:11:09.695,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop the stroke from happening,

203
0:11:12.421,000 --> 0:11:15,000
so I'll do this for a week or two, and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.

204
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So I've got to call help. I've got to call work."

205
0:11:18.806,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I couldn't remember the number at work,

206
0:11:20.73,000 --> 0:11:23,000
so I remembered, in my office I had a business card with my number.

207
0:11:24.523,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So I go into my business room, I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards.

208
0:11:28.856,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And I'm looking at the card on top

209
0:11:30.537,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye

210
0:11:33.895,000 --> 0:11:34,000
what my business card looked like,

211
0:11:35.63,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I couldn't tell if this was my card or not,

212
0:11:38.242,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because all I could see were pixels.

213
0:11:40.132,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background

214
0:11:44.236,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and the pixels of the symbols, and I just couldn't tell.

215
0:11:47.568,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity.

216
0:11:50.732,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal reality

217
0:11:55.044,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and I could tell that's not the card... that's not the card.

218
0:11:59.218,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards.

219
0:12:05.25,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In the meantime, for 45 minutes,

220
0:12:07.148,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere.

221
0:12:09.83,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone,

222
0:12:12.854,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but it's the only plan I have.

223
0:12:14.43,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So I take the phone pad and I put it right here.

224
0:12:17.139,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I take the business card, I put it right here,

225
0:12:19.545,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card

226
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad.

227
0:12:26.671,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But then I would drift back out into La La Land,

228
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers.

229
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump

230
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them,

231
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
so that as I would come back to normal reality,

232
0:12:44.044,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I'd be able to tell, "Yes, I've already dialed that number."

233
0:12:48.076,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Eventually, the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the phone,

234
0:12:52.44,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me,

235
0:12:56.027,000 --> 0:12:57,000
"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)

236
0:12:57.694,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter)

237
0:13:01.153,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I think to myself,

238
0:13:03.027,000 --> 0:13:06,000
"Oh my gosh, he sounds like a Golden Retriever!"

239
0:13:06.09,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Laughter)

240
0:13:07.741,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And so I say to him -- clear in my mind, I say to him:

241
0:13:10.926,000 --> 0:13:11,000
"This is Jill! I need help!"

242
0:13:12.592,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And what comes out of my voice is, "Woo woo woo woo woo."

243
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh, I sound like a Golden Retriever."

244
0:13:19.164,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So I couldn't know -- I didn't know

245
0:13:21.109,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried.

246
0:13:24.759,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help.

247
0:13:28.441,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And a little while later, I am riding in an ambulance

248
0:13:32.075,000 --> 0:13:35,000
from one hospital across Boston to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.

249
0:13:36.487,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And I curl up into a little fetal ball.

250
0:13:39.661,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And just like a balloon with the last bit of air,

251
0:13:46.233,000 --> 0:13:48,000
just right out of the balloon,

252
0:13:48.407,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender.

253
0:13:54.295,000 --> 0:14:,000
And in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life.

254
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life,

255
0:14:04.747,000 --> 0:14:07,000
or this was perhaps my moment of transition.

256
0:14:13.049,000 --> 0:14:15,000
When I woke later that afternoon,

257
0:14:15.28,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I was shocked to discover that I was still alive.

258
0:14:20.375,000 --> 0:14:24,000
When I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life.

259
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And my mind was now suspended

260
0:14:27.679,000 --> 0:14:31,000
between two very opposite planes of reality.

261
0:14:31.901,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems

262
0:14:35.212,000 --> 0:14:36,000
felt like pure pain.

263
0:14:37.488,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Light burned my brain like wildfire,

264
0:14:40.726,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and sounds were so loud and chaotic

265
0:14:44.345,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise,

266
0:14:48.551,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and I just wanted to escape.

267
0:14:51.148,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Because I could not identify the position of my body in space,

268
0:14:56.316,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I felt enormous and expansive,

269
0:15:00.157,000 --> 0:15:03,000
like a genie just liberated from her bottle.

270
0:15:04.982,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And my spirit soared free,

271
0:15:07.68,000 --> 0:15:12,000
like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria.

272
0:15:14.885,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Nirvana.

273
0:15:16.593,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I found Nirvana.

274
0:15:21.291,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And I remember thinking,

275
0:15:22.735,000 --> 0:15:26,000
there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself

276
0:15:27.189,000 --> 0:15:29,000
back inside this tiny little body.

277
0:15:32.147,000 --> 0:15:35,000
But then I realized, "But I'm still alive!

278
0:15:35.679,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.

279
0:15:38.806,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive,

280
0:15:42.536,000 --> 0:15:45,000
then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana."

281
0:15:48.758,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And I pictured a world

282
0:15:50.053,000 --> 0:15:55,000
filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people

283
0:15:56.037,000 --> 0:15:59,000
who knew that they could come to this space at any time.

284
0:16:00.497,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And that they could purposely choose

285
0:16:04.004,000 --> 0:16:06,000
to step to the right of their left hemispheres --

286
0:16:08.401,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and find this peace.

287
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And then I realized

288
0:16:11.577,000 --> 0:16:14,000
what a tremendous gift this experience could be,

289
0:16:15.158,000 --> 0:16:2,000
what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives.

290
0:16:22.434,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And it motivated me to recover.

291
0:16:28.259,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the surgeons went in,

292
0:16:32.433,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball

293
0:16:35.005,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that was pushing on my language centers.

294
0:16:37.02,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Here I am with my mama,

295
0:16:38.67,000 --> 0:16:39,000
who is a true angel in my life.

296
0:16:42.146,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It took me eight years to completely recover.

297
0:16:46.996,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So who are we?

298
0:16:49.057,000 --> 0:16:54,000
We are the life-force power of the universe,

299
0:16:54.083,000 --> 0:16:58,000
with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds.

300
0:16:58.956,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And we have the power to choose, moment by moment,

301
0:17:02.281,000 --> 0:17:04,000
who and how we want to be in the world.

302
0:17:05.983,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Right here, right now,

303
0:17:07.562,000 --> 0:17:12,000
I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are.

304
0:17:12.812,000 --> 0:17:15,000
I am the life-force power of the universe.

305
0:17:15.893,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I am the life-force power

306
0:17:17.457,000 --> 0:17:21,000
of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form,

307
0:17:22.315,000 --> 0:17:24,000
at one with all that is.

308
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Or, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere,

309
0:17:30.698,000 --> 0:17:33,000
where I become a single individual, a solid.

310
0:17:34.003,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Separate from the flow, separate from you.

311
0:17:37.586,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:

312
0:17:39.72,000 --> 0:17:41,000
intellectual, neuroanatomist.

313
0:17:44.439,000 --> 0:17:47,000
These are the "we" inside of me.

314
0:17:49.814,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Which would you choose?

315
0:17:53.853,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Which do you choose?

316
0:17:57.167,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And when?

317
0:18:01.107,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I believe that the more time we spend

318
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry

319
0:18:06.331,000 --> 0:18:08,000
of our right hemispheres,

320
0:18:08.575,000 --> 0:18:11,000
the more peace we will project into the world,

321
0:18:11.905,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and the more peaceful our planet will be.

322
0:18:15.528,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And I thought that was an idea worth spreading.

323
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Thank you.

324
0:18:20.43,000 --> 0:18:23,000
(Applause)

Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.

10
0:11:22.78,000 --> 0:11:23,000
That's amazing.

11
0:11:24.532,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Applause)

12
0:11:28.07,000 --> 0:11:29,000
You just don't hear that every day.

13
0:11:29.7,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Laughter)

14
0:11:31.651,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Usman, the official story is that

15
0:11:34.052,000 --> 0:11:35,000
you learned to play the guitar

16
0:11:35.532,000 --> 0:11:36,000
by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.

17
0:11:37.515,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I --

18
0:11:40.687,000 --> 0:11:42,000
That was the first thing I learned,

19
0:11:42.983,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and then I started progressing to other things.

20
0:11:45.614,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And I started watching Kaki King a lot,

21
0:11:48.653,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,

22
0:11:52.406,000 --> 0:11:54,000
so then I started watching his videos,

23
0:11:54.55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and it's very surreal right now to be --

24
0:11:57.794,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Laughter)

25
0:11:59.955,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Applause)

26
0:12:04.655,000 --> 0:12:05,000
CA: Was that piece just now,

27
0:12:06.427,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?

28
0:12:09.617,000 --> 0:12:1,000
UR: I'd never learned it before,

29
0:12:10.713,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,

30
0:12:13.73,000 --> 0:12:17,000
so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.

31
0:12:18.121,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And it finally happened, so ...

32
0:12:20.809,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Laughter)

33
0:12:22.261,000 --> 0:12:23,000
CA: Preston, from your point of view,

34
0:12:23.713,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?

35
0:12:25.577,000 --> 0:12:27,000
How does it feel to see someone like this

36
0:12:28.425,000 --> 0:12:32,000
come along taking your art and doing so much with it?

37
0:12:33.125,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing,

38
0:12:35.474,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and I feel really proud, really honored.

39
0:12:38.769,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.

40
0:12:44.273,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Laughter)

41
0:12:47.193,000 --> 0:12:52,000
CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?

42
0:12:52.505,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?

43
0:12:54.937,000 --> 0:12:56,000
PR: We haven't prepared anything.

44
0:12:57.719,000 --> 0:13:01,000
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.

45
0:13:02.033,000 --> 0:13:05,000
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds,

46
0:13:05.594,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and you have another 30 or 40 seconds,

47
0:13:07.017,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and we just see that, I just think --

48
0:13:08.545,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.

49
0:13:11.361,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.

50
0:13:13.273,000 --> 0:13:16,000
(Applause)

51
0:13:16.705,000 --> 0:13:24,000

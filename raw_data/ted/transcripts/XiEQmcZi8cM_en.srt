1
0:00:13.052,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Last year,

2
0:00:14.739,000 --> 0:00:16,000
three of my family members were gruesomely murdered

3
0:00:17.27,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in a hate crime.

4
0:00:20.094,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It goes without saying that it's really difficult

5
0:00:22.452,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for me to be here today,

6
0:00:24.199,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but my brother Deah,

7
0:00:25.806,000 --> 0:00:26,000
his wife Yusor,

8
0:00:27.246,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and her sister Razan

9
0:00:28.801,000 --> 0:00:29,000
don't give me much of a choice.

10
0:00:31.274,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'm hopeful that by the end of this talk you will make a choice,

11
0:00:34.687,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and join me in standing up against hate.

12
0:00:38.659,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's December 27, 2014:

13
0:00:41.77,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the morning of my brother's wedding day.

14
0:00:44.026,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He asks me to come over and comb his hair

15
0:00:46.114,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in preparation for his wedding photo shoot.

16
0:00:48.614,000 --> 0:00:53,000
A 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball, particularly Steph Curry, fanatic --

17
0:00:53.971,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:57.684,000 --> 0:01:,000
An American kid in dental school ready to take on the world.

19
0:01:01.721,000 --> 0:01:03,000
When Deah and Yusor have their first dance,

20
0:01:04.506,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I see the love in his eyes,

21
0:01:06.336,000 --> 0:01:07,000
her reciprocated joy,

22
0:01:07.99,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and my emotions begin to overwhelm me.

23
0:01:11.175,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I move to the back of the hall and burst into tears.

24
0:01:14.557,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And the second the song finishes playing,

25
0:01:16.569,000 --> 0:01:17,000
he beelines towards me,

26
0:01:17.78,000 --> 0:01:18,000
buries me into his arms

27
0:01:19.055,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and rocks me back and forth.

28
0:01:20.934,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Even in that moment,

29
0:01:22.147,000 --> 0:01:23,000
when everything was so distracting,

30
0:01:24.048,000 --> 0:01:25,000
he was attuned to me.

31
0:01:25.925,000 --> 0:01:26,000
He cups my face and says,

32
0:01:27.78,000 --> 0:01:28,000
"Suzanne,

33
0:01:28.984,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I am who I am because of you.

34
0:01:35.179,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Thank you for everything.

35
0:01:36.867,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I love you."

36
0:01:39.18,000 --> 0:01:42,000
About a month later, I'm back home in North Carolina for a short visit,

37
0:01:42.687,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and on the last evening, I run upstairs to Deah's room,

38
0:01:45.422,000 --> 0:01:48,000
eager to find out how he's feeling being a newly married man.

39
0:01:48.741,000 --> 0:01:5,000
With a big boyish smile he says,

40
0:01:51.066,000 --> 0:01:54,000
"I'm so happy. I love her. She's an amazing girl."

41
0:01:55.201,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And she is.

42
0:01:56.902,000 --> 0:01:58,000
At just 21, she'd recently been accepted to join Deah

43
0:01:59.864,000 --> 0:02:,000
at UNC dental school.

44
0:02:01.974,000 --> 0:02:04,000
She shared his love for basketball, and at her urging,

45
0:02:05.273,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they started their honeymoon off attending their favorite team of the NBA,

46
0:02:09.22,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the LA Lakers.

47
0:02:10.649,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I mean, check out that form.

48
0:02:12.425,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:19.233,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I'll never forget that moment sitting there with him --

50
0:02:22.028,000 --> 0:02:24,000
how free he was in his happiness.

51
0:02:24.552,000 --> 0:02:26,000
My littler brother, a basketball-obsessed kid,

52
0:02:27.041,000 --> 0:02:3,000
had become and transformed into an accomplished young man.

53
0:02:31.448,000 --> 0:02:33,000
He was at the top of his dental school class,

54
0:02:33.623,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and alongside Yusor and Razan,

55
0:02:35.224,000 --> 0:02:39,000
was involved in local and international community service projects

56
0:02:39.464,000 --> 0:02:41,000
dedicated to the homeless and refugees,

57
0:02:41.817,000 --> 0:02:43,000
including a dental relief trip they were planning

58
0:02:44.128,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for Syrian refugees in Turkey.

59
0:02:46.668,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Razan, at just 19,

60
0:02:48.82,000 --> 0:02:51,000
used her creativity as an architectural engineering student

61
0:02:51.998,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to serve those around her,

62
0:02:53.713,000 --> 0:02:55,000
making care packages for the local homeless,

63
0:02:55.984,000 --> 0:02:56,000
among other projects.

64
0:02:58.235,000 --> 0:02:59,000
That is who they were.

65
0:03:01.423,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Standing there that night,

66
0:03:02.687,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I take a deep breath and look at Deah and tell him,

67
0:03:05.652,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"I have never been more proud of you than I am in this moment."

68
0:03:09.575,000 --> 0:03:1,000
He pulls me into his tall frame,

69
0:03:11.404,000 --> 0:03:12,000
hugs me goodnight,

70
0:03:12.591,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and I leave the next morning without waking him

71
0:03:14.845,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to go back to San Francisco.

72
0:03:16.958,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That is the last time I ever hug him.

73
0:03:22.617,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Ten days later, I'm on call at San Francisco General Hospital

74
0:03:25.639,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when I receive a barrage of vague text messages expressing condolences.

75
0:03:29.509,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Confused, I call my father, who calmly intones,

76
0:03:32.341,000 --> 0:03:35,000
"There's been a shooting in Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.

77
0:03:35.366,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's on lock-down. That's all we know."

78
0:03:37.829,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I hang up and quickly Google, "shooting in Chapel Hill."

79
0:03:41.354,000 --> 0:03:42,000
One hit comes up.

80
0:03:42.901,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Quote:

81
0:03:44.347,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"Three people were shot in the back of the head

82
0:03:46.632,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and confirmed dead on the scene."

83
0:03:48.819,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Something in me just knows.

84
0:03:50.49,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I fling out of my chair and faint onto the gritty hospital floor,

85
0:03:53.634,000 --> 0:03:54,000
wailing.

86
0:03:55.419,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I take the first red-eye out of San Francisco,

87
0:03:57.781,000 --> 0:03:58,000
numb and disoriented.

88
0:03:59.443,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents' arms,

89
0:04:02.972,000 --> 0:04:03,000
sobbing.

90
0:04:04.178,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I then run up to Deah's room as I did so many times before,

91
0:04:07.12,000 --> 0:04:09,000
just looking for him,

92
0:04:09.192,000 --> 0:04:11,000
only to find a void that will never be filled.

93
0:04:15.769,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Investigation and autopsy reports eventually revealed

94
0:04:19.03,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the sequence of events.

95
0:04:22.069,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Deah had just gotten off the bus from class,

96
0:04:24.8,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Razan was visiting for dinner,

97
0:04:26.403,000 --> 0:04:27,000
already at home with Yusor.

98
0:04:28.55,000 --> 0:04:3,000
As they began to eat, they heard a knock on the door.

99
0:04:31.408,000 --> 0:04:33,000
When Deah opened it,

100
0:04:33.46,000 --> 0:04:35,000
their neighbor proceeded to fire multiple shots at him.

101
0:04:38.787,000 --> 0:04:39,000
According to 911 calls,

102
0:04:40.341,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the girls were heard screaming.

103
0:04:43.516,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The man turned towards the kitchen and fired a single shot into Yusor's hip,

104
0:04:47.197,000 --> 0:04:48,000
immobilizing her.

105
0:04:48.371,000 --> 0:04:49,000
He then approached her from behind,

106
0:04:50.163,000 --> 0:04:52,000
pressed the barrel of his gun against her head,

107
0:04:52.432,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and with a single bullet, lacerated her midbrain.

108
0:04:56.365,000 --> 0:04:59,000
He then turned towards Razan, who was screaming for her life,

109
0:04:59.478,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and, execution-style, with a single bullet

110
0:05:03.927,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to the back of the head,

111
0:05:05.392,000 --> 0:05:06,000
killed her.

112
0:05:07.754,000 --> 0:05:08,000
On his way out,

113
0:05:08.929,000 --> 0:05:11,000
he shot Deah one last time -- a bullet in the mouth --

114
0:05:12.23,000 --> 0:05:13,000
for a total of eight bullets:

115
0:05:14.105,000 --> 0:05:15,000
two lodged in the head,

116
0:05:15.983,000 --> 0:05:16,000
two in his chest

117
0:05:17.518,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and the rest in his extremities.

118
0:05:21.377,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed

119
0:05:23.686,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in a place that was meant to be safe: their home.

120
0:05:27.821,000 --> 0:05:29,000
For months, this man had been harassing them:

121
0:05:30.339,000 --> 0:05:31,000
knocking on their door,

122
0:05:31.768,000 --> 0:05:33,000
brandishing his gun on a couple of occasions.

123
0:05:34.579,000 --> 0:05:37,000
His Facebook was cluttered with anti-religion posts.

124
0:05:38.634,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Yusor felt particularly threatened by him.

125
0:05:41.947,000 --> 0:05:42,000
As she was moving in,

126
0:05:44.5,000 --> 0:05:47,000
he told Yusor and her mom that he didn't like the way they looked.

127
0:05:48.863,000 --> 0:05:51,000
In response, Yusor's mom told her to be kind to her neighbor,

128
0:05:52.305,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that as he got to know them,

129
0:05:53.686,000 --> 0:05:54,000
he'd see them for who they were.

130
0:05:57.28,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I guess we've all become so numb to the hatred

131
0:05:59.82,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that we couldn't have ever imagined it turning into fatal violence.

132
0:06:05.685,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The man who murdered my brother turned himself in to the police

133
0:06:08.68,000 --> 0:06:09,000
shortly after the murders,

134
0:06:10.516,000 --> 0:06:12,000
saying he killed three kids,

135
0:06:12.77,000 --> 0:06:13,000
execution-style,

136
0:06:14.341,000 --> 0:06:15,000
over a parking dispute.

137
0:06:17.321,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The police issued a premature public statement that morning,

138
0:06:20.228,000 --> 0:06:22,000
echoing his claims without bothering to question it

139
0:06:22.696,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or further investigate.

140
0:06:24.703,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It turns out there was no parking dispute.

141
0:06:27.774,000 --> 0:06:28,000
There was no argument.

142
0:06:29.404,000 --> 0:06:3,000
No violation.

143
0:06:31.197,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But the damage was already done.

144
0:06:33.329,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In a 24-hour media cycle,

145
0:06:35.406,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the words "parking dispute" had already become the go-to sound bite.

146
0:06:41.578,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I sit on my brother's bed and remember his words,

147
0:06:44.763,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the words he gave me so freely and with so much love,

148
0:06:48.026,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"I am who I am because of you."

149
0:06:50.94,000 --> 0:06:53,000
That's what it takes for me to climb through my crippling grief

150
0:06:53.98,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and speak out.

151
0:06:55.161,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I cannot let my family's deaths be diminished to a segment

152
0:06:57.967,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that is barely discussed on local news.

153
0:07:00.73,000 --> 0:07:03,000
They were murdered by their neighbor because of their faith,

154
0:07:04.183,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because of a piece of cloth they chose to don on their heads,

155
0:07:07.665,000 --> 0:07:08,000
because they were visibly Muslim.

156
0:07:13.72,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Some of the rage I felt at the time

157
0:07:15.443,000 --> 0:07:16,000
was that if roles were reversed,

158
0:07:17.388,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and an Arab, Muslim or Muslim-appearing person

159
0:07:21.227,000 --> 0:07:25,000
had killed three white American college students execution-style,

160
0:07:26.105,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in their home,

161
0:07:27.285,000 --> 0:07:28,000
what would we have called it?

162
0:07:30.041,000 --> 0:07:31,000
A terrorist attack.

163
0:07:32.304,000 --> 0:07:35,000
When white men commit acts of violence in the US,

164
0:07:35.499,000 --> 0:07:36,000
they're lone wolves,

165
0:07:36.743,000 --> 0:07:37,000
mentally ill

166
0:07:37.957,000 --> 0:07:38,000
or driven by a parking dispute.

167
0:07:43.323,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I know that I have to give my family voice,

168
0:07:45.935,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and I do the only thing I know how:

169
0:07:48.155,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I send a Facebook message to everyone I know in media.

170
0:07:53.253,000 --> 0:07:54,000
A couple of hours later,

171
0:07:54.728,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in the midst of a chaotic house overflowing with friends and family,

172
0:07:58.546,000 --> 0:08:01,000
our neighbor Neal comes over, sits down next to my parents

173
0:08:01.62,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and asks, "What can I do?"

174
0:08:04.933,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Neal had over two decades of experience in journalism,

175
0:08:08.559,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but he makes it clear that he's not there in his capacity as journalist,

176
0:08:11.988,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but as a neighbor who wants to help.

177
0:08:14.367,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I ask him what he thinks we should do,

178
0:08:16.232,000 --> 0:08:19,000
given the bombardment of local media interview requests.

179
0:08:19.31,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He offers to set up a press conference at a local community center.

180
0:08:25.431,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Even now I don't have the words to thank him.

181
0:08:28.649,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"Just tell me when, and I'll have all the news channels present," he said.

182
0:08:32.87,000 --> 0:08:34,000
He did for us what we could not do for ourselves

183
0:08:35.162,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in a moment of devastation.

184
0:08:37.737,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I delivered the press statement,

185
0:08:39.356,000 --> 0:08:41,000
still wearing scrubs from the previous night.

186
0:08:41.507,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And in under 24 hours from the murders,

187
0:08:43.542,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I'm on CNN being interviewed by Anderson Cooper.

188
0:08:47.03,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The following day, major newspapers --

189
0:08:48.926,000 --> 0:08:5,000
including the New York Times, Chicago Tribune --

190
0:08:51.701,000 --> 0:08:53,000
published stories about Deah, Yusor and Razan,

191
0:08:54.356,000 --> 0:08:56,000
allowing us to reclaim the narrative

192
0:08:56.555,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and call attention the mainstreaming of anti-Muslim hatred.

193
0:09:03.323,000 --> 0:09:04,000
These days,

194
0:09:04.515,000 --> 0:09:08,000
it feels like Islamophobia is a socially acceptable form of bigotry.

195
0:09:09.987,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We just have to put up with it and smile.

196
0:09:12.919,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The nasty stares,

197
0:09:14.527,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the palpable fear when boarding a plane,

198
0:09:16.954,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the random pat downs at airports that happen 99 percent of the time.

199
0:09:22.148,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It doesn't stop there.

200
0:09:24.064,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We have politicians reaping political and financial gains off our backs.

201
0:09:28.288,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Here in the US,

202
0:09:29.472,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we have presidential candidates like Donald Trump,

203
0:09:31.863,000 --> 0:09:33,000
casually calling to register American Muslims,

204
0:09:34.29,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and ban Muslim immigrants and refugees from entering this country.

205
0:09:38.353,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It is no coincidence that hate crimes rise

206
0:09:41.101,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in parallel with election cycles.

207
0:09:46.748,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Just a couple months ago, Khalid Jabara,

208
0:09:49.056,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a Lebanese-American Christian,

209
0:09:50.88,000 --> 0:09:52,000
was murdered in Oklahoma by his neighbor --

210
0:09:53.66,000 --> 0:09:55,000
a man who called him a "filthy Arab."

211
0:09:56.627,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This man was previously jailed for a mere 8 months,

212
0:09:59.362,000 --> 0:10:02,000
after attempting run over Khalid's mother with his car.

213
0:10:03.627,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Chances are you haven't heard Khalid's story,

214
0:10:06.505,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because it didn't make it to national news.

215
0:10:09.232,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The least we can do is call it what it is:

216
0:10:12.029,000 --> 0:10:13,000
a hate crime.

217
0:10:13.369,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The least we can do is talk about it,

218
0:10:16.184,000 --> 0:10:19,000
because violence and hatred doesn't just happen in a vacuum.

219
0:10:23.759,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Not long after coming back to work,

220
0:10:25.478,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I'm the senior on rounds in the hospital,

221
0:10:27.48,000 --> 0:10:29,000
when one of my patients looks over at my colleague,

222
0:10:30.12,000 --> 0:10:33,000
gestures around her face and says, "San Bernardino,"

223
0:10:33.697,000 --> 0:10:34,000
referencing a recent terrorist attack.

224
0:10:36.596,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Here I am having just lost three family members to Islamophobia,

225
0:10:40.184,000 --> 0:10:42,000
having been a vocal advocate within my program

226
0:10:42.38,000 --> 0:10:44,000
on how to deal with such microaggressions,

227
0:10:44.631,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and yet --

228
0:10:45.814,000 --> 0:10:46,000
silence.

229
0:10:47.535,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I was disheartened.

230
0:10:49.207,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Humiliated.

231
0:10:51.413,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Days later rounding on the same patient,

232
0:10:53.372,000 --> 0:10:54,000
she looks at me and says,

233
0:10:54.712,000 --> 0:10:57,000
"Your people are killing people in Los Angeles."

234
0:10:59.216,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I look around expectantly.

235
0:11:01.303,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Again:

236
0:11:02.648,000 --> 0:11:03,000
silence.

237
0:11:04.865,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I realize that yet again,

238
0:11:06.619,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I have to speak up for myself.

239
0:11:09.8,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I sit on her bed and gently ask her,

240
0:11:12.308,000 --> 0:11:15,000
"Have I ever done anything but treat you with respect and kindness?

241
0:11:17.395,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Have I done anything but give you compassionate care?"

242
0:11:21.143,000 --> 0:11:23,000
She looks down and realizes what she said was wrong,

243
0:11:23.602,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and in front of the entire team,

244
0:11:25.361,000 --> 0:11:26,000
she apologizes and says,

245
0:11:26.901,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"I should know better. I'm Mexican-American.

246
0:11:29.511,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I receive this kind of treatment all the time."

247
0:11:35.339,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Many of us experience microaggressions on a daily basis.

248
0:11:39.156,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Odds are you may have experienced it,

249
0:11:41.525,000 --> 0:11:42,000
whether for your race,

250
0:11:42.948,000 --> 0:11:43,000
gender,

251
0:11:44.123,000 --> 0:11:45,000
sexuality

252
0:11:45.298,000 --> 0:11:46,000
or religious beliefs.

253
0:11:46.731,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We've all been in situations where we've witnessed something wrong

254
0:11:49.888,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and didn't speak up.

255
0:11:51.172,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Maybe we weren't equipped with the tools to respond in the moment.

256
0:11:54.853,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Maybe we weren't even aware of our own implicit biases.

257
0:11:59.466,000 --> 0:12:02,000
We can all agree that bigotry is unacceptable,

258
0:12:02.609,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but when we see it,

259
0:12:03.838,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we're silent,

260
0:12:05.029,000 --> 0:12:06,000
because it makes us uncomfortable.

261
0:12:07.834,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But stepping right into that discomfort

262
0:12:10.012,000 --> 0:12:12,000
means you are also stepping into the ally zone.

263
0:12:13.472,000 --> 0:12:16,000
There may be over three million Muslims in America.

264
0:12:16.672,000 --> 0:12:19,000
That's still just one percent of the total population.

265
0:12:20.966,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Martin Luther King once said,

266
0:12:22.591,000 --> 0:12:23,000
"In the end,

267
0:12:23.955,000 --> 0:12:25,000
we will remember not the words of our enemies,

268
0:12:27.098,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but the silence of our friends."

269
0:12:33.65,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So what made my neighbor Neal's allyship so profound?

270
0:12:37.313,000 --> 0:12:38,000
A couple of things.

271
0:12:39.17,000 --> 0:12:41,000
He was there as a neighbor who cared,

272
0:12:41.351,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but he was also bringing in his professional expertise and resources

273
0:12:44.567,000 --> 0:12:45,000
when the moment called for it.

274
0:12:46.926,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Others have done the same.

275
0:12:49.113,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Larycia Hawkins drew on her platform

276
0:12:51.598,000 --> 0:12:54,000
as the first tenured African-American professor at Wheaton College

277
0:12:55.11,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to wear a hijab in solidarity

278
0:12:56.788,000 --> 0:12:58,000
with Muslim women who face discrimination every day.

279
0:13:00.07,000 --> 0:13:02,000
As a result, she lost her job.

280
0:13:03.821,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Within a month,

281
0:13:04.995,000 --> 0:13:06,000
she joined the faculty at the University of Virginia,

282
0:13:07.542,000 --> 0:13:1,000
where she now works on pluralism, race, faith and culture.

283
0:13:12.562,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Reddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian,

284
0:13:14.946,000 --> 0:13:17,000
demonstrated that not all active allyship needs to be so serious.

285
0:13:19.057,000 --> 0:13:21,000
He stepped up to support a 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission

286
0:13:21.957,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to introduce a hijab emoji.

287
0:13:24.028,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Laughter)

288
0:13:26.035,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It's a simple gesture,

289
0:13:27.648,000 --> 0:13:29,000
but it has a significant subconscious impact

290
0:13:30.209,000 --> 0:13:33,000
on normalizing and humanizing Muslims,

291
0:13:33.472,000 --> 0:13:35,000
including the community as a part of an "us"

292
0:13:36.141,000 --> 0:13:37,000
instead of an "other."

293
0:13:39.352,000 --> 0:13:41,000
The editor in chief of Women's Running magazine

294
0:13:41.693,000 --> 0:13:45,000
just put the first hijabi to ever be on the cover of a US fitness magazine.

295
0:13:47.001,000 --> 0:13:48,000
These are all very different examples

296
0:13:48.787,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of people who drew upon their platforms and resources

297
0:13:51.766,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in academia, tech and media,

298
0:13:54.123,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to actively express their allyship.

299
0:13:57.839,000 --> 0:13:59,000
What resources and expertise do you bring to the table?

300
0:14:01.589,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Are you willing to step into your discomfort

301
0:14:03.689,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and speak up when you witness hateful bigotry?

302
0:14:06.826,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Will you be Neal?

303
0:14:09.258,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Many neighbors appeared in this story.

304
0:14:11.576,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And you, in your respective communities, all have a Muslim neighbor,

305
0:14:15.368,000 --> 0:14:16,000
colleague

306
0:14:16.545,000 --> 0:14:18,000
or friend your child plays with at school.

307
0:14:18.9,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Reach out to them.

308
0:14:20.392,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Let them know you stand with them in solidarity.

309
0:14:23.332,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It may feel really small,

310
0:14:24.748,000 --> 0:14:26,000
but I promise you it makes a difference.

311
0:14:29.268,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Nothing will ever bring back Deah, Yusor and Razan.

312
0:14:33.723,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But when we raise our collective voices,

313
0:14:36.094,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that is when we stop the hate.

314
0:14:38.35,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Thank you.

315
0:14:39.536,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Applause)

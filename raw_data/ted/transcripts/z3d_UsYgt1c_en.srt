1
0:00:13.208,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I guess all of you have a smartphone or an iPhone,

2
0:00:18.667,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and this morning, probably you checked on the weather,

3
0:00:22.667,000 --> 0:00:25,000
if its going to be rainy to carry your umbrella,

4
0:00:26.5,000 --> 0:00:29,000
if it is going to be sunny to use your sunglasses,

5
0:00:29.667,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or if it is going to be cold to have an extra coat.

6
0:00:34.167,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's going to give you, sometime, good information and sometime not.

7
0:00:39.917,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Let me tell you,

8
0:00:42.167,000 --> 0:00:45,000
my best app is my grandmother.

9
0:00:45.958,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:49.417,000 --> 0:00:5,000
She's called Mamadda.

11
0:00:51.208,000 --> 0:00:55,000
She can tell you not only today's weather

12
0:00:55.333,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but she can predict the next 12 months,

13
0:00:58.333,000 --> 0:01:02,000
if it's going to be a good rain season or not.

14
0:01:03.208,000 --> 0:01:06,000
She can tell you just by observing her environment,

15
0:01:07.083,000 --> 0:01:09,000
by observing the wind direction,

16
0:01:09.875,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the cloud position,

17
0:01:11.583,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the bird migration,

18
0:01:13.5,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the size of fruits,

19
0:01:15.458,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the plant flowers.

20
0:01:17.292,000 --> 0:01:22,000
She can tell you by observing the behavior of her own cattle.

21
0:01:23.833,000 --> 0:01:27,000
That's how she knows better the weather and the ecosystem

22
0:01:28.417,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that she's living in.

23
0:01:31.208,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'm coming from a pastoralist community

24
0:01:35.542,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who are cattle herders.

25
0:01:37.375,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We are nomadic.

26
0:01:39.458,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We move from one place to another one

27
0:01:42.292,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to find water and pasture.

28
0:01:44.458,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We can move up to a thousand kilometers, the size of California, within one year.

29
0:01:51.792,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And this life helps us to live in harmony with our ecosystem.

30
0:01:58.583,000 --> 0:01:59,000
We understand each other.

31
0:02:01.208,000 --> 0:02:04,000
For us, the nature is our supermarket,

32
0:02:04.667,000 --> 0:02:05,000
where we can collect our food,

33
0:02:06.583,000 --> 0:02:07,000
our water.

34
0:02:07.875,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It's our pharmacy where we can collect our medicinal plants.

35
0:02:12.167,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But it's our school,

36
0:02:13.667,000 --> 0:02:16,000
where we can learn better how to protect it

37
0:02:17.5,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and how it can give us back what we need.

38
0:02:22.333,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But with the climate change impact,

39
0:02:25.542,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we are experiencing a different impact.

40
0:02:32.25,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In my community,

41
0:02:35.208,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we have one of the top five fresh waters in Africa.

42
0:02:40.458,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's Lake Chad.

43
0:02:43.458,000 --> 0:02:45,000
When my mother was born,

44
0:02:45.792,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Lake Chad used to be about 25,000 kilometers square of water.

45
0:02:52.792,000 --> 0:02:58,000
When I was born, 30 years ago, it was 10,000 kilometers square.

46
0:02:59.042,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And actually now,

47
0:03:01.625,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it's about 1,200 kilometers square of water.

48
0:03:06.542,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Ninety percent of this water just evaporated, disappeared.

49
0:03:12.833,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And you have more than 40 million people

50
0:03:16.125,000 --> 0:03:2,000
living around this lake and depending on it.

51
0:03:20.208,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They are pastoralists.

52
0:03:21.625,000 --> 0:03:22,000
They are fishermen.

53
0:03:23.333,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And they are farmers.

54
0:03:25.667,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They do not depend on the end of the month's salary.

55
0:03:29.208,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They depend on the rainfall.

56
0:03:31.458,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They depend on the crops that are growing

57
0:03:34.208,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or the pasture for their cattle.

58
0:03:38.583,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The shrinking resources,

59
0:03:40.958,000 --> 0:03:45,000
you have many communities that are fighting to get access.

60
0:03:46.375,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The first come is the first served.

61
0:03:48.708,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The second have to fight unto death.

62
0:03:54.708,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So climate change is impacting our environment

63
0:03:59.792,000 --> 0:04:01,000
by changing our social life,

64
0:04:04.167,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because the role of man and woman in this region, it's different.

65
0:04:10.208,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Man is supposed to feed his family,

66
0:04:13.625,000 --> 0:04:15,000
take care of his community,

67
0:04:16.167,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and if he cannot do that,

68
0:04:19.75,000 --> 0:04:21,000
his dignity is under threat.

69
0:04:24.708,000 --> 0:04:27,000
He cannot do anything else to pay it back.

70
0:04:29.958,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So climate change takes our men far away from us.

71
0:04:35.625,000 --> 0:04:36,000
That is the migration.

72
0:04:38.5,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They can migrate to a big city where they can stay for six or 12 months,

73
0:04:44.042,000 --> 0:04:48,000
where they get a job, they can send back money.

74
0:04:49.042,000 --> 0:04:5,000
If they didn't get it,

75
0:04:50.375,000 --> 0:04:52,000
they have to jump into the Mediterranean

76
0:04:52.958,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and migrate to Europe.

77
0:04:55.625,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Some of them die there, but none of them stop going.

78
0:05:02.625,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Of course, it's sad for the hosting country,

79
0:05:05.458,000 --> 0:05:06,000
who are developed countries,

80
0:05:08.167,000 --> 0:05:1,000
who have to adapt to host the migrants coming.

81
0:05:12.708,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But how about those who are left behind,

82
0:05:16.167,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the women and the children who have to play the role of men,

83
0:05:20.75,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the role of women,

84
0:05:22.042,000 --> 0:05:23,000
who have to take care of the security,

85
0:05:23.958,000 --> 0:05:26,000
of the food, of the health of the entire family,

86
0:05:27.75,000 --> 0:05:28,000
children and old people?

87
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So those women for me, they are my heroes,

88
0:05:37.667,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because they are innovators, they are solution makers,

89
0:05:42.958,000 --> 0:05:44,000
they are changing the little of the resources

90
0:05:45.708,000 --> 0:05:48,000
into the big for the community.

91
0:05:48.875,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So those are my people.

92
0:05:52.458,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So we use our indigenous people's traditional knowledge

93
0:05:57.875,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to get better resilience to what we need to survive.

94
0:06:05.208,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Our knowledge is not only for our communities.

95
0:06:08.708,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's to share with each and others who are living with us.

96
0:06:14.208,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And indigenous peoples around the world

97
0:06:16.917,000 --> 0:06:19,000
are saving 80 percent of the world's biodiversity.

98
0:06:22.292,000 --> 0:06:23,000
That's the scientists who say that.

99
0:06:25.917,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Indigenous peoples in the Amazon,

100
0:06:29.292,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you can find the most diverse ecosystem, better than the national park.

101
0:06:36.125,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The indigenous peoples from the Pacific,

102
0:06:39.208,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the grandma and the grandpa,

103
0:06:42.333,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they know where to get food after the hurricane hits them.

104
0:06:49.417,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So the knowledge that our peoples know

105
0:06:52.917,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is helping us to survive and helping other peoples also to survive

106
0:06:56.958,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the climate change impact.

107
0:06:58.875,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The world is losing.

108
0:07:00.667,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We lost already 60 percent of the species,

109
0:07:05.708,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and it's increasing every day.

110
0:07:09.208,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So one day, I took a scientist to my community.

111
0:07:14.125,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I said, you are giving the good weather information through the TV and radio,

112
0:07:20.875,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but how about coming to my people?

113
0:07:23.417,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And then they come,

114
0:07:26.042,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they sit around,

115
0:07:27.583,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and suddenly, as we are nomadic, we just start packing our stuff,

116
0:07:32.375,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and then they say, like, "Are we moving?"

117
0:07:34.625,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I'm like, "No, we are not moving. It's going to rain."

118
0:07:37.958,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And they're like, "Oh, there's no cloud. How do you know it's going to rain?"

119
0:07:41.667,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We're like, "Yeah, it's going to rain." We pack our stuff.

120
0:07:45.083,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Suddenly, heavy rain starts coming,

121
0:07:49.458,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and we are seeing the scientist running around, hiding under trees

122
0:07:53.208,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and protecting their stuff.

123
0:07:54.75,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We already packed ours.

124
0:07:56.292,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

125
0:07:58.625,000 --> 0:08:02,000
After the end of the rain, the serious discussion starts.

126
0:08:03.125,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They say, "How do you know that it's going to rain?"

127
0:08:06.792,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We say, "Well, the old woman observed the insects

128
0:08:11.417,000 --> 0:08:13,000
taking the eggs inside their homes,

129
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and while the insect cannot talk or watch TV,

130
0:08:18.375,000 --> 0:08:22,000
they know how to predict to protect their generations,

131
0:08:22.583,000 --> 0:08:24,000
how to protect their food.

132
0:08:24.625,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So for us it's the sign that it's going to rain

133
0:08:28.083,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in at maximum a couple of hours."

134
0:08:30.75,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And then they say,

135
0:08:32.25,000 --> 0:08:35,000
well, we do have knowledge,

136
0:08:35.417,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but we do not combine ecological knowledge and weather knowledge all together.

137
0:08:41.833,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So that's how I started working

138
0:08:44.792,000 --> 0:08:48,000
with meteorological scientists and my communities

139
0:08:49.75,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to give better information to get peoples adapted to climate change.

140
0:08:57.042,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I think, if we put together all the knowledge systems that we have --

141
0:09:03.292,000 --> 0:09:05,000
science, technology,

142
0:09:06.125,000 --> 0:09:07,000
traditional knowledge --

143
0:09:08.042,000 --> 0:09:13,000
we can give the best of us to protect our peoples,

144
0:09:13.208,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to protect our planet,

145
0:09:15.125,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to restore the ecosystem that we are losing.

146
0:09:19.042,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I did that in another way, also.

147
0:09:21.75,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I used a tool that I really love a lot.

148
0:09:25.625,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's called a 3D participatory mapping:

149
0:09:29.833,000 --> 0:09:34,000
participatory, because it can bring women, men,

150
0:09:35.292,000 --> 0:09:37,000
youth, elders,

151
0:09:37.5,000 --> 0:09:4,000
all the intergenerational peoples.

152
0:09:40.708,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Then they use science-based knowledge,

153
0:09:44.083,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and the community comes together, they build this map,

154
0:09:47.333,000 --> 0:09:49,000
they figure out all the knowledge that we have

155
0:09:50.167,000 --> 0:09:53,000
about where is our sacred forest, where is our water point,

156
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:55,000
where is our corridor,

157
0:09:55.542,000 --> 0:09:59,000
where is the place that we move during each season.

158
0:10:01.667,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And these tools are amazing, because it's building capacity of women,

159
0:10:06.458,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because in our communities

160
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
women and men cannot sit together.

161
0:10:11.167,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Men talk always, women just sitting there,

162
0:10:14.917,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but in the back.

163
0:10:16.208,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They are not there to take any decision.

164
0:10:18.167,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So after the men figure out all the knowledge,

165
0:10:21.917,000 --> 0:10:24,000
we say, well, you call the women, "Come and have a look."

166
0:10:25.25,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They say, "Yes, sure,"

167
0:10:26.583,000 --> 0:10:28,000
because they've already done the first work.

168
0:10:28.685,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

169
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:31,000
When the women come,

170
0:10:31.792,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and they look at the map, they're like, "Mm, no."

171
0:10:34.542,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Laughter)

172
0:10:36.042,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"This is wrong.

173
0:10:37.333,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Here's where I collect the medicine. Here's where I collect the food.

174
0:10:40.625,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Here's where I collect --"

175
0:10:42.25,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So we changed the knowledge in the map,

176
0:10:44.708,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and we called the men.

177
0:10:47.208,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Well, they think about what women say.

178
0:10:49.417,000 --> 0:10:5,000
All of them shaking their heads.

179
0:10:51.042,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"They are right. They are right.

180
0:10:53.417,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They are right."

181
0:10:54.833,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So that's how we build the capacity of the women

182
0:10:58.458,000 --> 0:10:59,000
in giving them a voice

183
0:10:59.917,000 --> 0:11:01,000
in this 3D participatory mapping,

184
0:11:02.083,000 --> 0:11:04,000
so women get the detailed knowledge

185
0:11:04.292,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that can help the community to adapt.

186
0:11:07.083,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And man have the bigger picture knowledge.

187
0:11:10.125,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So when we put it together,

188
0:11:12.708,000 --> 0:11:16,000
this map helps them to discuss

189
0:11:17.042,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but to mitigate the conflict between the communities

190
0:11:20.25,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to access the resources,

191
0:11:22.042,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to share better these resources,

192
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to restore it

193
0:11:26.833,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and to manage it for the long term.

194
0:11:31.833,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Our knowledge is very useful.

195
0:11:34.75,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Indigenous peoples' knowledge

196
0:11:36.958,000 --> 0:11:4,000
are very crucial for our planet.

197
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's crucial for all the peoples.

198
0:11:46.042,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Science knowledge was discovered 200 years ago,

199
0:11:51.875,000 --> 0:11:53,000
technology 100 years ago,

200
0:11:54.333,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but indigenous peoples' knowledge, it's thousands of years ago.

201
0:11:59.75,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So why we cannot put all of these together,

202
0:12:03.167,000 --> 0:12:05,000
combine those three knowledges

203
0:12:06.167,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and give the better resilience

204
0:12:07.792,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to the peoples who are getting the impact of climate change?

205
0:12:13.667,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And now it's not only the developing countries.

206
0:12:16.417,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It's the developed countries also.

207
0:12:18.125,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We saw the hurricane. We saw the flood around all the places.

208
0:12:21.958,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We saw the fire, even here in California.

209
0:12:25.375,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So we need all this knowledge to come together.

210
0:12:27.917,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We need the people in the center.

211
0:12:30.25,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And we need the decision makers to change,

212
0:12:32.792,000 --> 0:12:33,000
scientists tell them,

213
0:12:35.417,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and we tell them,

214
0:12:37.292,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and we do have this knowledge.

215
0:12:39.833,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We have 10 years to change it.

216
0:12:43.75,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Ten years is nothing,

217
0:12:45.625,000 --> 0:12:47,000
so we need to act all together

218
0:12:48.167,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and we need to act right now.

219
0:12:50.833,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Thank you.

220
0:12:52.375,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Applause)

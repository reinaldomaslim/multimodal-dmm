1
0:00:13.52,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Beatboxing) Yo, what up?

2
0:00:16.56,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My name is Tom Thum,

3
0:00:18.56,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I've got to say it's a pleasure to be back at TEDx.

4
0:00:22.72,000 --> 0:00:26,000
When I first stepped upon the Sydney stage in 2013

5
0:00:27.08,000 --> 0:00:29,000
as a starry-eyed boy from Brisbane,

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I had no idea that I was about to deliver the most watched TEDx presentation ever.

7
0:00:35.08,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:37.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Applause)

9
0:00:39.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But you know, I was stoked because it was completely unexpected.

10
0:00:44.159,000 --> 0:00:46,000
However, standing before you today

11
0:00:46.4,000 --> 0:00:5,000
as a slightly inflated, time-battered version of myself five years later,

12
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'm very confident.

13
0:00:53.24,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:54.84,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Confident that I'm about deliver

15
0:00:58.08,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the most instantly switched off and walked-out-on,

16
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:06,000
vomit-inducing talk of all time.

17
0:01:09.08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I'm about to show you things

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that I think you'll find hard to unsee,

19
0:01:15.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but all in the name of science.

20
0:01:18.44,000 --> 0:01:21,000
First, for those unfamiliar with what I do,

21
0:01:22.44,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I guess if you distilled it right down to its essence,

22
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you would call me a beatboxer.

23
0:01:27.88,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Beatboxing) Yo, for example ...

24
0:01:31.24,000 --> 0:01:32,000
here's a sample:

25
0:01:32.48,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Beatboxing)

26
0:01:41.64,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Rhythm changes)

27
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Hums a tune)

28
0:01:57.44,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Applause and cheers)

29
0:02:00.4,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Thank you.

30
0:02:01.64,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Applause)

31
0:02:04.44,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And being a beatboxer,

32
0:02:06.2,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it means that professionally,

33
0:02:07.76,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I am 100 percent reliant on the --

34
0:02:10.24,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Beatboxing) flexibility of the unfiltered human voice.

35
0:02:15.52,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And for years, my contemporaries and I have been fielding questions like,

36
0:02:19.48,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Oh my God, that's so cool.

37
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:23,000
When did you figure out you could do that?"

38
0:02:23.56,000 --> 0:02:26,000
After I practiced for thousands and thousands of hours --

39
0:02:27.08,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:28.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"And what do you do for a real job?"

41
0:02:30.4,000 --> 0:02:32,000
"I'm a full-time beatboxer, Your Honor."

42
0:02:32.76,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But there is one question that I get quite a lot

43
0:02:36.64,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that's a little bit more difficult to answer,

44
0:02:39.96,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and that is how are you doing it --

45
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:43,000
how are you making those noises?

46
0:02:44.48,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And I mean, I know muscle memory dictates where I position my lips

47
0:02:48.36,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in order to --

48
0:02:49.6,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Beatboxing)

49
0:02:51.68,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but I have no idea about the inner mechanics of everything.

50
0:02:55.48,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You know, all the flappy bits and kind of dangly things

51
0:02:58.72,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and how they interact in --

52
0:03:00.64,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:01.68,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in a way that allows me to --

54
0:03:03.12,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Beatboxing)

55
0:03:08.72,000 --> 0:03:09,000
To put it metaphorically,

56
0:03:10.12,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I know how to drive,

57
0:03:12.24,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I just don't know what's under the hood.

58
0:03:15.24,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So I decided to find out

59
0:03:17.36,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and invite 5,000 captive strangers,

60
0:03:20.6,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a few uncomfortable cameras,

61
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
everybody watching online and their browser history

62
0:03:26.04,000 --> 0:03:31,000
into a place where not even the most intimate of encounters have been ...

63
0:03:31.2,000 --> 0:03:32,000
my throat.

64
0:03:32.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And to help me do that,

65
0:03:34.48,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I'd like to introduce to the stage a very specialist guest

66
0:03:39.2,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from the Queensland Voice Center,

67
0:03:41.04,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a man that's been in my mouth more times than I'd care to admit,

68
0:03:44.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a legend of the larynx,

69
0:03:46.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
ENT doctor and laryngeal surgeon,

70
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Matthew Broadhurst.

71
0:03:50.52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Applause and cheers)

72
0:03:53.76,000 --> 0:03:55,000
MB: Thank you, Tom, thank you.

73
0:03:55.88,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And a very good evening everyone.

74
0:03:57.56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It is a pleasure to be here on the TEDx stage tonight.

75
0:04:00.44,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:02.08,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Whoo.

77
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:04.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
TT: He's not warming up his hands.

79
0:04:07.4,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It doesn't get that intimate.

80
0:04:10.12,000 --> 0:04:13,000
MB: We set out a little while ago to try to go deep into the world --

81
0:04:13.88,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and the throat --

82
0:04:15.12,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of this beatboxer extraordinaire

83
0:04:17.44,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to try to understand how such a vast array of sounds are humanly possible.

84
0:04:22.96,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And what we found --

85
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:26,000
these are going in the mouth by the way --

86
0:04:26.68,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and what we found was something absolutely amazing.

87
0:04:31.36,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Even after my two years of laryngeal surgery

88
0:04:34.6,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in Harvard Medical School

89
0:04:35.88,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with world-renowned professor Steven Zeitels,

90
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we never saw anything as extraordinary or fascinating as this,

91
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and that's what we're going to show you tonight.

92
0:04:47.32,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:50.72,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Alright, so for those of you who might be a little squeamish,

94
0:04:53.64,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the next 10 minutes or so will get incrementally more graphic

95
0:04:56.84,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and stomach-churning,

96
0:04:58.32,000 --> 0:04:59,000
so let's get into it --

97
0:04:59.6,000 --> 0:05:,000
TT: Feel free to use the bucket.

98
0:05:01.2,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:02.92,000 --> 0:05:04,000
MB: So when we make sound,

100
0:05:05.12,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we use the vocal cords to take air from the lungs

101
0:05:08.08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and then turn it into a vibrating air column in the throat.

102
0:05:11.8,000 --> 0:05:12,000
If you think of it like a trumpet,

103
0:05:13.56,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we've got the mouthpiece -- that's the vocal folds --

104
0:05:16.48,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and then the horn section is the throat.

105
0:05:19.44,000 --> 0:05:2,000
If we took your head off,

106
0:05:20.8,000 --> 0:05:21,000
took a bit of your neck off

107
0:05:22.24,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and left you as a torso with just your vocal folds vibrating,

108
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
this is what you'd sound like.

109
0:05:27.92,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Flatulent sound)

110
0:05:31.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
TT: (High pitch)

111
0:05:32.56,000 --> 0:05:35,000
MB: Pretty hard to communicate, but fortunately we've got a throat.

112
0:05:35.76,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We've got all the soft tissues,

113
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and that actually gives you all the incredible dynamics of sound

114
0:05:40.64,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that you'll hear tonight.

115
0:05:42.88,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now, this is a rigid laryngoscope.

116
0:05:47.64,000 --> 0:05:48,000
TT: Hmm, spicy boy.

117
0:05:48.88,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:49.92,000 --> 0:05:5,000
MB: I know, I know.

119
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:52.68,000 --> 0:05:53,000
10 millimeters in diameter,

121
0:05:54.04,000 --> 0:05:57,000
it gives us the highest resolution image of the larynx we can get.

122
0:05:57.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
And we teed up with a stroboscope here

123
0:06:00.88,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and a trigger microphone.

124
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The mic will pick up the frequency

125
0:06:05.68,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and that will allow us to show you how this all works.

126
0:06:09.32,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So, if we can have the lights down?

127
0:06:13.12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
TT: (Low pitch)

128
0:06:14.36,000 --> 0:06:15,000
MB: Turn the light on here.

129
0:06:16.76,000 --> 0:06:2,000
TT: (High and low pitches)

130
0:06:21.24,000 --> 0:06:24,000
MB: So I've got the frequency of sound matched with the stroboscope.

131
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That's the light you're seeing flickering in the cup.

132
0:06:27.68,000 --> 0:06:28,000
TT: (Low pitch)

133
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:31,000
MB: And that's at about 80 hertz or so.

134
0:06:31.96,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So what we can do then is we can take that

135
0:06:35.36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and put the phase of the strobe and the sound just out of sync.

136
0:06:39.56,000 --> 0:06:44,000
That lets us capture real-time, slow-motion activity of vibrating tissues.

137
0:06:45.36,000 --> 0:06:47,000
When we apply that to the larynx,

138
0:06:47.48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we get this fluid, slow-motion of the vibrating vocal folds.

139
0:06:51.84,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So that's what we're going to get on and do.

140
0:06:58.12,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Alright, you ready?

141
0:06:59.6,000 --> 0:07:,000
TT: Yup.

142
0:07:00.84,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:01.88,000 --> 0:07:02,000
MB: OK, so here we go.

144
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We're going to have a look at the voice box.

145
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:11.76,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's very hard not to gag with this.

147
0:07:14.12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Say, "e."

148
0:07:15.72,000 --> 0:07:16,000
TT: (Singing) E --

149
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:19,000
MB: So down the bottom you see the vocal cords,

150
0:07:19.36,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the little cord-like structures.

151
0:07:20.96,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:23.76,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And now just look at the skin on the neck

153
0:07:26.24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and you'll see how strong the light is to penetrate the skin.

154
0:07:34.36,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Alright, so if you'll have the lights back on?

155
0:07:39.2,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Applause)

157
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Alright, so just give us a comfortable "e."

158
0:07:47.2,000 --> 0:07:48,000
TT: (Singing) E.

159
0:07:49.2,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:50.44,000 --> 0:07:52,000
TT: (Singing) E.

161
0:07:53.12,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Audience gasps)

162
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
MB: So that's the vibrating vocal folds;

163
0:07:57.4,000 --> 0:07:59,000
about 120 hertz.

164
0:07:59.64,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Means they've collided 120 times a second

165
0:08:03.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
just to make that sound.

166
0:08:06.64,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And we can also see that they're absolutely, perfectly normal.

167
0:08:11.44,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So all his beatboxing, all those sounds for years

168
0:08:14.48,000 --> 0:08:15,000
with Tom's way of doing it --

169
0:08:16.2,000 --> 0:08:18,000
absolutely no damage whatsoever.

170
0:08:18.44,000 --> 0:08:19,000
That's really remarkable.

171
0:08:21.2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Well done.

172
0:08:22.84,000 --> 0:08:23,000
OK.

173
0:08:24.08,000 --> 0:08:25,000
TT: (High pitch)

174
0:08:25.32,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We've got this.

175
0:08:26.56,000 --> 0:08:29,000
MB: So watch now as the vocal cords go from high pitch to low pitch.

176
0:08:30.12,000 --> 0:08:33,000
You'll see them go from long and skinny to short and fat.

177
0:08:35.68,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Really think "e."

178
0:08:37.64,000 --> 0:08:43,000
TT: (High to low pitch) E.

179
0:08:46.44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
MB: Right.

180
0:08:47.72,000 --> 0:08:52,000
TT: (High to low pitch) E.

181
0:08:53.159,000 --> 0:08:56,000
MB: And what you can see is that his vocal range is so extreme --

182
0:08:56.68,000 --> 0:08:59,000
much more extreme than any other performer I've worked with --

183
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the machine actually can't capture the really high pitches.

184
0:09:03.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
TT: (High pitch)

185
0:09:05.12,000 --> 0:09:1,000
MB: So we know that whistle register is somewhere around 2,092 hertz.

186
0:09:10.28,000 --> 0:09:11,000
That means the vocal cords,

187
0:09:11.84,000 --> 0:09:13,000
well over 2,000 times a second,

188
0:09:14.28,000 --> 0:09:16,000
are banging together just to make that sound.

189
0:09:16.56,000 --> 0:09:17,000
That's really extraordinary.

190
0:09:18.48,000 --> 0:09:21,000
If you think about them, they're only 15 millimeters long,

191
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
so that's barely the width of your thumb.

192
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
That's incred --

193
0:09:25.4,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:27.2,000 --> 0:09:29,000
That's amazing this organ can do such a thing.

195
0:09:30.68,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So now we're going to swap over to the flexible laryngoscope.

196
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is a little more graphic.

197
0:09:38.88,000 --> 0:09:39,000
TT: He bought it at SEXPO.

198
0:09:40.36,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Laughter)

199
0:09:43.72,000 --> 0:09:44,000
MB: That wasn't in the script.

200
0:09:45.44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

201
0:09:46.68,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Applause)

202
0:09:51.08,000 --> 0:09:52,000
TT: Secondhand.

203
0:09:52.32,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:57.36,000 --> 0:09:59,000
MB: Now, we've had to time this bit perfectly

205
0:09:59.96,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because of the requirement for local anesthetic.

206
0:10:02.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
You've got to numb the nose, get the camera in.

207
0:10:04.92,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It doesn't help for producing a lot of the sounds,

208
0:10:07.6,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but it gives us a really cool view of what's happening.

209
0:10:10.44,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So hold onto the stomachs, and let's see what we can do.

210
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Audience gasps)

211
0:10:17.6,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So we're going to the back of the nose.

212
0:10:22.84,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And there you can see the soft palate.

213
0:10:24.96,000 --> 0:10:26,000
A lot of the sounds we make from day to day,

214
0:10:27.12,000 --> 0:10:28,000
even the simple ones,

215
0:10:28.56,000 --> 0:10:29,000
are incredibly complex.

216
0:10:30.04,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The sound "kh" for example.

217
0:10:32.64,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's the soft palate sealing up precisely against the back of the nose.

218
0:10:36.76,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So if you say it loudly five times,

219
0:10:39.64,000 --> 0:10:42,000
feel your own soft palate snapping against the back of the throat.

220
0:10:43.56,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Kh, kh, kh, kh, kh, kh.

221
0:10:47.28,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Alright, so this is what it looks like when Tom does it.

222
0:10:50.28,000 --> 0:10:53,000
TT: Kh, kh, kh, kh, kh.

223
0:10:53.44,000 --> 0:10:57,000
A cacophony of cackling kookaburras and cockatoos in Kakadu

224
0:10:57.88,000 --> 0:10:58,000
couldn't quite quit ketamine.

225
0:10:59.8,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Laughter)

226
0:11:01.84,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

227
0:11:03.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
MB: Alright, now in the beatboxing world,

228
0:11:05.68,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of course, they can use that for all sorts of different effects.

229
0:11:09.76,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I can help you.

230
0:11:11.72,000 --> 0:11:13,000
TT: This is fine, we're professionals.

231
0:11:14.04,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:16.96,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Beatboxing)

233
0:11:36.6,000 --> 0:11:37,000
MB: Alright.

234
0:11:37.84,000 --> 0:11:39,000
(Applause and cheers)

235
0:11:40.48,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now we're going to slide down a little further.

236
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:47,000
If you'll just have the lights off

237
0:11:47.48,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and just see if you can see the light in the mouth somewhere.

238
0:11:50.4,000 --> 0:11:52,000
You'll be able to see exactly where the camera is at.

239
0:11:53.56,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:56.56,000 --> 0:11:57,000
TT: (Singing)

241
0:11:57.84,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Surprise.

242
0:11:59.08,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

243
0:12:01.4,000 --> 0:12:02,000
MB: Alright.

244
0:12:02.68,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Audience gasps)

245
0:12:04.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So what you can see there, that's the base of the tongue.

246
0:12:07.92,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The side walls of the screen,

247
0:12:09.76,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that's the pharynx.

248
0:12:11.28,000 --> 0:12:12,000
All muscle walls,

249
0:12:12.56,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and in the deep, dark decks is the larynx.

250
0:12:15.12,000 --> 0:12:17,000
TT: Oh, should we have the lights back on?

251
0:12:17.2,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I think it's a good idea.

252
0:12:18.48,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It's getting a bit creepy with them off.

253
0:12:20.44,000 --> 0:12:21,000
MB: Turn the lights on, thanks.

254
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Good.

255
0:12:23.24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Now having examined over 15,000 larynxes and throats in my time,

256
0:12:27.12,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I can tell you that Tom's is as anatomically normal

257
0:12:31.56,000 --> 0:12:32,000
as anyone else's.

258
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It's just his unique use of all the muscles and soft tissues

259
0:12:36.8,000 --> 0:12:4,000
which lets him do all these amazing sounds that you're going to hear.

260
0:12:41.6,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So we will dissect some of these sounds for you now.

261
0:12:45.84,000 --> 0:12:47,000
TT: It's in there really. Definitely.

262
0:12:48.08,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Laughter)

263
0:12:49.2,000 --> 0:12:5,000
OK.

264
0:12:52.12,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(High-pitched sounds)

265
0:12:59.12,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(High-pitched sounds)

266
0:13:02.32,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Hooting)

267
0:13:04.88,000 --> 0:13:06,000
MB: So what he's doing is he's changing the shape

268
0:13:07.24,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and the length of the vibrating air column

269
0:13:09.28,000 --> 0:13:11,000
using rhythmic contractions of all the muscles

270
0:13:11.8,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to generate all those sounds that you're hearing.

271
0:13:15.08,000 --> 0:13:16,000
(Beatboxing)

272
0:13:17.04,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Laughter)

273
0:13:19.8,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Low pitch)

274
0:13:22.68,000 --> 0:13:24,000
MB: And now there's rhythmic movements of the --

275
0:13:25.24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
they're the arytenoid cartilages way down there,

276
0:13:27.503,000 --> 0:13:29,000
rocking back and forth to create that different sound.

277
0:13:30.84,000 --> 0:13:36,000
TT: (Low pitch)

278
0:13:37.08,000 --> 0:13:39,000
MB: And we like to call this "sphincter bass."

279
0:13:39.92,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Laughter)

280
0:13:41.68,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And what you can see is that collapsing all the tissue down --

281
0:13:44.84,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Laughter)

282
0:13:46.8,000 --> 0:13:49,000
allows a different kind of really deep bass note.

283
0:13:50.32,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Alright, so with local anesthetic on board,

284
0:13:52.56,000 --> 0:13:53,000
a big black hose in the nose,

285
0:13:54.56,000 --> 0:13:56,000
we're going to let loose a sliver of his repertoire

286
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and see all this in play.

287
0:14:00.08,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And we'll move --

288
0:14:01.6,000 --> 0:14:02,000
careful.

289
0:14:06.84,000 --> 0:14:08,000
TT: Can you pull it up just a smidgeon.

290
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Laughter)

291
0:14:14.08,000 --> 0:14:16,000
TT: (Beatboxing)

292
0:14:16.56,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Maybe just a little more --

293
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Laughter)

294
0:14:20.2,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Alright, cool, I think we're good.

295
0:14:22.52,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Beatboxing) To all my peeps who came to get deep,

296
0:14:25.52,000 --> 0:14:26,000
deep as the abyss --

297
0:14:27.2,000 --> 0:14:28,000
check this.

298
0:14:28.44,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Beatboxing)

299
0:15:34.88,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Cheers)

300
0:15:37.8,000 --> 0:15:4,000
(Applause)

301
0:15:42.2,000 --> 0:15:44,000
(Beatboxing)

302
0:15:44.4,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We start from the basics and build from scratch.

303
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Record scratch)

304
0:15:48.52,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Yeah, like that.

305
0:15:49.96,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Beatboxing)

306
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:31,000
(Trumpet sound)

307
0:16:47.4,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Beatboxing)

308
0:16:50.68,000 --> 0:16:51,000
(Beatboxing) Back to basics.

309
0:16:53.04,000 --> 0:16:55,000
(Beatboxing)

310
0:17:00.28,000 --> 0:17:01,000
(Beatboxing) You know the sound.

311
0:17:05.2,000 --> 0:17:07,000
(Beatboxing) Make some noise.

312
0:17:07.48,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Applause and cheers)

313
0:17:09.92,000 --> 0:17:11,000
(Whistling)

314
0:17:12.28,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Applause and cheers)

315
0:17:16.2,000 --> 0:17:17,000
TT: Thank you so much.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to ask you all to consider for a second

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the very simple fact

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that, by far,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
most of what we know about the universe

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
comes to us from light.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and see stars with our bare eyes.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We see light reflected off the Moon.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
at the celestial bodies,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the known universe has come to us through light,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
across vast eras in cosmic history.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And with all of our modern telescopes,

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we've been able to collect

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
this stunning silent movie of the universe --

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
these series of snapshots

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that go all the way back to the Big Bang.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because the universe isn't silent.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I'd like to convince you

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that the universe has a soundtrack

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and that soundtrack is played on space itself,

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because space can wobble like a drum.

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It can ring out a kind of recording

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
throughout the universe

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now we'd like to be able to add

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to a kind of glorious visual composition

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that we have of the universe --

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a sonic composition.

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And while we've never heard the sounds from space,

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we really should, in the next few years,

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So in this ambition

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to capture songs from the universe,

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we turn our focus

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to black holes and the promise they have,

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because black holes can bang on space-time

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
like mallets on a drum

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and have a very characteristic song,

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions

43
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for what that song will be like.

44
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky.

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We can't see them directly.

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We can see them indirectly,

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
because black holes wreak havoc on their environment.

49
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
They destroy stars around them.

50
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They churn up debris in their surroundings.

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But they won't come to us directly through light.

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We might one day see a shadow

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
a black hole can cast on a very bright background,

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but we haven't yet.

55
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And yet black holes may be heard

56
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
even if they're not seen,

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Einstein realized that if space were empty,

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
if the universe were empty,

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it would be like this picture,

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.

64
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But if we were freely falling through the space,

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
even without this helpful grid,

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we might be able to paint it ourselves,

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines,

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
undeflected straight paths

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
through the universe.

70
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Einstein also realized --

71
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and this is the real meat of the matter --

72
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that if you put energy or mass in the universe,

73
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it would curve space,

74
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and a freely falling object

75
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
would pass by, let's say, the Sun

76
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and it would be deflected

77
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
along the natural curves in the space.

78
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now even light will be bent by those paths.

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And you can be bent so much

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that you're caught in orbit around the Sun,

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
These are the natural curves in space.

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
What Einstein did not realize

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
was that, if you took our Sun

86
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and you crushed it down to six kilometers --

87
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
so you took a million times the mass of the Earth

88
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and you crushed it to six kilometers across,

89
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
you would make a black hole,

90
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
an object so dense

91
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that if light veered too close, it would never escape --

92
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
a dark shadow against the universe.

93
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It wasn't Einstein who realized this,

94
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
it was Karl Schwarzschild

95
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
who was a German Jew in World War I --

96
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
joined the German army already an accomplished scientist,

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
working on the Russian front.

98
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches

99
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire,

100
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and then, in between,

101
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
calculating Einstein's equations --

102
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as you do in the trenches.

103
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And he was reading Einstein's recently published

104
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
general theory of relativity,

105
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and he was thrilled by this theory.

106
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And he quickly surmised

107
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
an exact mathematical solution

108
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that described something very extraordinary:

109
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
curves so strong

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that space would rain down into them,

111
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
space itself would curve like a waterfall

112
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
flowing down the throat of a hole.

113
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And even light could not escape this current.

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Light would be dragged down the hole

115
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
as everything else would be,

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and all that would be left would be a shadow.

117
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now he wrote to Einstein,

118
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and he said, "As you will see,

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the war has been kind to me enough.

120
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Despite the heavy gunfire,

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I've been able to get away from it all

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and walk through the land of your ideas."

123
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution,

124
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.

125
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.

126
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And he took Schwarzschild's idea

127
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
He did not believe they existed in nature.

130
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.

131
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It was decades

132
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
before the term "black hole" was coined

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and people realized

134
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that black holes are real astrophysical objects --

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in fact they're the death state

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of very massive stars

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that collapse catastrophically

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
at the end of their lifetime.

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's actually not massive enough.

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But if we did a little thought experiment --

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as Einstein was very fond of doing --

143
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we could imagine

144
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers,

145
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit,

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
maybe 30 kilometers

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
outside of the black-hole sun.

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And it would be self-illuminated,

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light --

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.

151
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
even 30 km

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
outside of this crushed black hole.

154
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This crushed black hole

155
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.

156
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
before it destroyed the Earth.

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But basically that's what we're talking about.

159
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We're talking about an object that you could crush down

160
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to half the square area of Manhattan.

161
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So we move this Earth very close --

162
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
30 kilometers outside --

163
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
There's a sort of myth

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that black holes devour everything in the universe,

166
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but you actually have to get very close to fall in.

167
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point,

168
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we can always see the Earth.

169
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It cannot hide behind the black hole.

170
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in,

171
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.

172
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.

173
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
If this were Battlestar Galactica

174
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and you're fighting the Cylons,

175
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
don't hide behind the black hole.

176
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
They can see you.

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole --

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it's not massive enough --

179
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.

180
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way,

181
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
this is what it would look like.

182
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We would see a shadow of that black hole

183
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
against the hundred billion stars

184
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.

185
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And if we were to fall towards this black hole,

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we would see all of that light lensed around it,

187
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and we could even start to cross into that shadow

188
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.

189
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because we couldn't,

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
anymore than light can escape.

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside,

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it's not dark on the inside,

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.

195
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation,

196
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
our clocks would seem to slow down

197
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
relative to galactic time,

198
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy

199
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
had been sped up and shot at us,

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.

201
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It would be like a near-death experience

202
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where you see the light at the end of the tunnel,

203
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but it's a total death experience.

204
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And there's no way of telling anybody

206
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
about the light at the end of the tunnel.

207
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole,

208
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but black holes can be heard,

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
even if they're not seen.

210
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation --

211
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.

212
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Maybe they started as stars

213
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and collapsed to two black holes --

214
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.

215
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.

216
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They can be spinning

217
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
hundreds of times a second.

218
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
At the end of their lives,

219
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they're going around each other very near the speed of light.

220
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers

221
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in a fraction of a second,

222
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and as they do so, they not only curve space,

223
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but they leave behind in their wake

224
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
a ringing of space,

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
an actual wave on space-time.

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Space squeezes and stretches

227
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
as it emanates out from these black holes

228
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
banging on the universe.

229
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And they travel out into the cosmos

230
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
at the speed of light.

231
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This computer simulation

232
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.

233
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.

234
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This was one of the groups.

235
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other,

236
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
again, with these helpfully painted curves.

237
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint --

238
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but if you can see the red waves emanating out,

239
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
those are the gravitational waves.

240
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They're literally the sounds of space ringing,

241
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light

242
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
as they ring down and coalesce

243
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to one spinning, quiet black hole

244
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
at the end of the day.

245
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
If you were standing near enough,

246
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
your ear would resonate

247
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
with the squeezing and stretching of space.

248
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You would literally hear the sound.

249
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully,

250
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.

251
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But I'd like to play for you

252
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the sound that we predict.

253
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This is from my group --

254
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.

255
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Imagine a lighter black hole

256
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
falling into a very heavy black hole.

257
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The sound you're hearing

258
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is the light black hole banging on space

259
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
each time it gets close.

260
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.

261
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But it comes in like a mallet,

262
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and it literally cracks space,

263
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
wobbling it like a drum.

264
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And we can predict what the sound will be.

265
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
We know that, as it falls in,

266
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
it gets faster and it gets louder.

267
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And eventually,

268
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.

269
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Thumping)

270
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Then it's gone.

271
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.

272
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.

273
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.

274
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is another sound from my group.

275
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
No, I'm not showing you any images,

276
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
because black holes don't leave behind

277
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
helpful trails of ink,

278
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and space is not painted,

279
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
showing you the curves.

280
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday

281
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and you heard this,

282
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
you want to get moving.

283
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Laughter)

284
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Want to get away from the sound.

285
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Both black holes are moving.

286
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Both black holes are getting closer together.

287
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.

288
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And then they're going to merge.

289
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Thumping)

290
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Now it's gone.

291
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging --

292
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that it chirps up at the end.

293
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Now that's our prediction

294
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
for what we'll see.

295
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.

296
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And surely, somewhere in the universe

297
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
two black holes have merged.

298
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And surely, the space around us

299
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is ringing

300
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years,

301
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
at the speed of light to get to us.

302
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.

303
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth --

304
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
one called LIGO --

305
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
which will detect deviations

306
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
in the squeezing and stretching of space

307
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom

308
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
over four kilometers.

309
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment,

310
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity

311
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
within the next few years -- to pick this up.

312
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
There's also a mission proposed for space,

313
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
which hopefully will launch in the next ten years,

314
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
called LISA.

315
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes --

316
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
black holes millions or billions of times

317
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the mass of the Sun.

318
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.

319
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.

320
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And each one probably harbors

321
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
a super-massive black hole at its core.

322
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But they're not frozen;

323
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
they're actually merging.

324
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
These two black holes are colliding,

325
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.

326
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It's beyond our human perception

327
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to pick up a song of that duration.

328
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But LISA could see the final stages

329
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of two super-massive black holes

330
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
earlier in the universe's history,

331
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the last 15 minutes before they fall together.

332
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And it's not just black holes,

333
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
but it's also any big disturbance in the universe --

334
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.

335
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
When that expression was coined, it was derisive --

336
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"

337
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But now it actually might be more technically accurate

338
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
because it might bang.

339
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
It might make a sound.

340
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios

341
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.

342
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe

343
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.

344
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.

345
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It's everywhere, it's all around you,

346
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and the space is wobbling chaotically.

347
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Fourteen billion years pass

348
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and this song is still ringing all around us.

349
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Galaxies form,

350
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and generations of stars form in those galaxies,

351
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and around one star,

352
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
at least one star,

353
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
is a habitable planet.

354
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And here we are frantically building these experiments,

355
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.

356
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Imagine a billion years ago,

357
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
two black holes collided.

358
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
That song has been ringing through space

359
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
for all that time.

360
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We weren't even here.

361
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
It gets closer and closer --

362
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.

363
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
It's like hurry, build your instruments.

364
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...

365
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
whatever year it will be

366
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity --

367
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines

368
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space.

369
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up,

370
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
it would sound like this.

371
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Static) It's a terrible sound.

372
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It's literally the definition of noise.

373
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.

374
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
But it's around us everywhere, presumably,

375
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
if it hasn't been wiped out

376
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
by some other process in the universe.

377
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears

378
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
because it will be the quiet echo

379
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
of that moment of our creation,

380
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
of our observable universe.

381
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So within the next few years,

382
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit,

383
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
render the universe in audio.

384
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
But if we detect those earliest moments,

385
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
it'll bring us that much closer

386
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to an understanding of the Big Bang,

387
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
which brings us that much closer

388
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.

389
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
If we run the movie of our universe backwards,

390
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
we know that there was a Big Bang in our past,

391
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it,

392
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?

393
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?

394
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Will it happen again?

395
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge

396
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
to reignite wonder,

397
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
we can ask questions, at least for this last minute,

398
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that honestly might evade us forever.

399
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
But we have to ask:

400
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Is it possible that our universe

401
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
is just a plume off of some greater history?

402
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse --

403
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
each branch with its own Big Bang in its past --

404
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
maybe some of them with black holes playing drums,

405
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
maybe some without --

406
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without --

407
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
not in our past, not in our future,

408
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
but somehow fundamentally connected to us?

409
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse,

410
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
in some other patch of that multiverse,

411
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
are there creatures?

412
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Here's my multiverse creatures.

413
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Are there other creatures in the multiverse,

414
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
wondering about us

415
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and wondering about their own origins?

416
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And if they are,

417
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
I can imagine them as we are,

418
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
calculating, writing computer code,

419
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
building instruments,

420
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
trying to detect that faintest sound

421
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
of their origins

422
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and wondering who else is out there.

423
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Thank you. Thank you.

424
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.148,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
has evaporated over the course of the last two years.

3
0:00:21.813,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We've questioned the future of capitalism.

4
0:00:24.134,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We've questioned the financial industry.

5
0:00:26.51,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We've looked at our government oversight.

6
0:00:28.51,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We've questioned where we're going.

7
0:00:30.228,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And yet, at the same time,

8
0:00:31.561,000 --> 0:00:33,000
this very well may be a seminal moment in American history,

9
0:00:34.461,000 --> 0:00:38,000
an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us

10
0:00:38.81,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to a new trajectory in America.

11
0:00:41.01,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm calling this The Great Unwind.

12
0:00:42.759,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:43.785,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And the idea is a simple, simple idea,

14
0:00:46.41,000 --> 0:00:5,000
which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety

15
0:00:50.514,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to action.

16
0:00:51.696,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Consumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America

17
0:00:55.959,000 --> 0:00:58,000
have actually started, just like banks and just like businesses,

18
0:00:59.427,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage in daily life,

19
0:01:03.535,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to remove themselves from the liability and risk

20
0:01:06.51,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that presents itself as they move forward.

21
0:01:09.41,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So, to understand this -- and I'm going to stress this --

22
0:01:12.167,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it's not about the consumer being in retreat.

23
0:01:14.354,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The consumer is empowered.

24
0:01:15.738,000 --> 0:01:18,000
To understand this, we'll step back and look at what's happened

25
0:01:19.019,000 --> 0:01:2,000
over the last year and a half.

26
0:01:20.938,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So if you've been gone, this is the CliffsNotes

27
0:01:23.181,000 --> 0:01:24,000
on what's happened in the economy.

28
0:01:24.829,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:25.857,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down.

30
0:01:28.951,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Commodity prices are like this.

31
0:01:30.581,000 --> 0:01:32,000
If you're a mom trying to manage a budget,

32
0:01:32.853,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer,

33
0:01:35.542,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and it's somewhere between 50 and 70,

34
0:01:37.339,000 --> 0:01:38,000
do you plan vacations?

35
0:01:38.526,000 --> 0:01:39,000
How do you buy?

36
0:01:39.708,000 --> 0:01:41,000
What's your strategy in your household? Will the bailout work?

37
0:01:42.652,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, health care --

38
0:01:45.851,000 --> 0:01:46,000
all these issues facing us.

39
0:01:47.172,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You put them all together, mix them up in a bouillabaisse,

40
0:01:49.922,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb.

41
0:01:53.277,000 --> 0:01:55,000
In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis,

42
0:01:56.278,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives,

43
0:01:58.78,000 --> 0:02:,000
actually contributed a large part to the problem.

44
0:02:01.28,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is something I call the 50-20 paradox.

45
0:02:04.084,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It took us 50 years

46
0:02:06.86,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent.

47
0:02:10.64,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Fifty years.

48
0:02:11.86,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Do you know what this was right here? This was World War II.

49
0:02:14.762,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Do you know why savings was so high?

50
0:02:16.6,000 --> 0:02:19,000
There was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets.

51
0:02:19.934,000 --> 0:02:21,000
What happened, though, over the course of the last 20 years,

52
0:02:22.888,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate.

53
0:02:27.072,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Because we binged.

54
0:02:28.749,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We bought extra-large cars, supersized everything,

55
0:02:32.566,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome.

56
0:02:35.298,000 --> 0:02:38,000
All these things together basically created a factor

57
0:02:39.228,000 --> 0:02:41,000
where the consumer drove us headlong into the crisis

58
0:02:41.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that we face today.

59
0:02:43.137,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 to 135 percent

60
0:02:49.438,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in the span of about 15 years.

61
0:02:51.97,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So consumers got over-leveraged.

62
0:02:54.081,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.

63
0:02:57.286,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This is an absolutely staggering chart.

64
0:02:59.376,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009.

65
0:03:04.007,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon

66
0:03:06.683,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging

67
0:03:10.563,000 --> 0:03:13,000
future education, future children in our households.

68
0:03:13.766,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout,

69
0:03:16.89,000 --> 0:03:18,000
what you can see is, if you stack up dollar bills,

70
0:03:19.41,000 --> 0:03:21,000
first of all, 360,000 dollars

71
0:03:21.676,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.

72
0:03:24.219,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But if you stack it up, you see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars

73
0:03:28.52,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out.

74
0:03:31.41,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So this is the first 315 billion.

75
0:03:33.599,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But I read this fact the other day,

76
0:03:35.396,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that one trillion seconds equals 32,000 years.

77
0:03:38.73,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So if you think about that,

78
0:03:40.071,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the context, the casualness with which we talk about

79
0:03:42.591,000 --> 0:03:44,000
trillion-dollar bailout here and trillion there,

80
0:03:44.868,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.

81
0:03:48.277,000 --> 0:03:5,000
However, consumers have moved.

82
0:03:50.953,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They are taking responsibility.

83
0:03:53.016,000 --> 0:03:55,000
What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate.

84
0:03:55.569,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened

85
0:03:58.308,000 --> 0:03:59,000
since the beginning of the crisis.

86
0:03:59.979,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We're working our way back up to that 10 percent.

87
0:04:02.367,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,

88
0:04:04.321,000 --> 0:04:07,000
spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years --

89
0:04:07.726,000 --> 0:04:09,000
almost a 3.7 percent decline.

90
0:04:10.41,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than credit cards.

91
0:04:14.314,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have.

92
0:04:17.731,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest.

93
0:04:21.41,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But that's not really the whole story,

94
0:04:23.41,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation.

95
0:04:26.351,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And you've got to admit, over the last year and a half,

96
0:04:29.001,000 --> 0:04:31,000
consumers have been doing some weird things.

97
0:04:31.093,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's pretty staggering, what we've lived through.

98
0:04:33.408,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If you take into account that 80 percent of all Americans

99
0:04:36.128,000 --> 0:04:37,000
were born after World War II,

100
0:04:37.548,000 --> 0:04:38,000
this was essentially our Depression.

101
0:04:39.305,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And so, as a result, some crazy things have happened.

102
0:04:42.134,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I'll give you some examples.

103
0:04:43.508,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks.

104
0:04:48.197,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:50.009,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Dentists report molars -- people grinding their teeth,

106
0:04:53.916,000 --> 0:04:55,000
coming in and reporting that they've had stress.

107
0:04:56.303,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So there's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.

108
0:04:59.749,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks,

109
0:05:03.067,000 --> 0:05:06,000
are up almost 25 percent since January.

110
0:05:06.185,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Vasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell Institute.

111
0:05:10.862,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And lastly, but a very good point,

112
0:05:13.29,000 --> 0:05:15,000
hopefully not related to the former point I just made,

113
0:05:15.89,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003.

114
0:05:19.377,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Does anybody know why?

115
0:05:21.271,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:22.477,000 --> 0:05:23,000
No one's at the beach.

117
0:05:23.669,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So there's a bright side to everything.

118
0:05:25.589,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But seriously, what we see happening,

119
0:05:27.799,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat,

120
0:05:31.084,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is that this is a tremendous opportunity

121
0:05:33.123,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for the consumer who drove us into this recession

122
0:05:35.741,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to lead us right back out.

123
0:05:37.29,000 --> 0:05:4,000
What I mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption

124
0:05:40.656,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to mindful consumption.

125
0:05:42.708,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Right?

126
0:05:43.892,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Applause)

127
0:05:44.991,000 --> 0:05:46,000
If you think about the last three decades,

128
0:05:47.047,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s,

129
0:05:50.353,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade.

130
0:05:54.354,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate.

131
0:05:57.707,000 --> 0:05:58,000
By restricting their demand,

132
0:05:59.068,000 --> 0:06:02,000
consumers can actually align their values with their spending,

133
0:06:02.41,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more,

134
0:06:06.014,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but to be about better.

135
0:06:07.204,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We're going to explain that right now.

136
0:06:09.205,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Based on Y&R's BrandAsset Valuator,

137
0:06:12.01,000 --> 0:06:14,000
proprietary tool of VML and Young & Rubicam,

138
0:06:14.735,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis

139
0:06:17.643,000 --> 0:06:18,000
with the consumer marketplace.

140
0:06:19.208,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We found a couple of really interesting things.

141
0:06:21.449,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We're going to go through four value shifts

142
0:06:23.9,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that we see driving new consumer behaviors,

143
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that offer new management principles.

144
0:06:28.341,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The first cultural value shift we see

145
0:06:30.175,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is this tendency toward something we call "liquid life."

146
0:06:32.825,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This is the movement

147
0:06:33.999,000 --> 0:06:36,000
from Americans defining their success on having things

148
0:06:37.104,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to having liquidity,

149
0:06:38.41,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because the less excess that you have around you,

150
0:06:41.126,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.

151
0:06:43.302,000 --> 0:06:45,000
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.

152
0:06:45.796,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously

153
0:06:49.755,000 --> 0:06:51,000
makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.

154
0:06:52.517,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The management principle is dollars and cents.

155
0:06:55.03,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So let's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption

156
0:06:57.898,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that falls out of this value.

157
0:06:59.35,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The first thing is, something must be happening

158
0:07:01.671,000 --> 0:07:03,000
when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.

159
0:07:03.771,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:04.809,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But seriously, we also have this phenomenon

161
0:07:07.175,000 --> 0:07:08,000
on Madison Avenue and in other places,

162
0:07:09.124,000 --> 0:07:11,000
where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques

163
0:07:12.071,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with ordinary, generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases.

164
0:07:15.908,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We see high-end haggling in fashion today,

165
0:07:18.909,000 --> 0:07:2,000
high-end haggling for luxury and real estate.

166
0:07:21.41,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We also see just a relaxing of ego,

167
0:07:23.806,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and sort of a dismantling of artifice.

168
0:07:26.082,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar.

169
0:07:29.953,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Blue-collar yacht club -- where you can join,

170
0:07:32.151,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but you've got to work in the boatyard as condition of membership.

171
0:07:35.41,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low-key:

172
0:07:40.095,000 --> 0:07:43,000
agritourism -- going to vineyards and going to farms.

173
0:07:43.246,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents.

174
0:07:46.895,000 --> 0:07:48,000
What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets

175
0:07:49.634,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is really interesting.

176
0:07:50.825,000 --> 0:07:51,000
A couple things that are kind of cool.

177
0:07:52.694,000 --> 0:07:55,000
One is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer.

178
0:07:56.411,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month,

179
0:07:59.838,000 --> 0:08:,000
less at the end of the month.

180
0:08:01.271,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So they started to change their packaging:

181
0:08:03.308,000 --> 0:08:05,000
larger packs at the beginning of the month,

182
0:08:05.354,000 --> 0:08:07,000
smaller packaging at the end of the month.

183
0:08:07.398,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Really interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants.

184
0:08:10.141,000 --> 0:08:12,000
They've just instituted dynamic pricing.

185
0:08:12.41,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups,

186
0:08:15.653,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to the weather, to the team records,

187
0:08:17.52,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in setting prices for the consumer.

188
0:08:19.948,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga.

189
0:08:25.003,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire

190
0:08:27.307,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to not want to be locked in to fixed cost.

191
0:08:29.343,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Again, this theme is about variable cost, variable living.

192
0:08:32.127,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So micro-payments have become huge.

193
0:08:34.023,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And lastly, some people are using Hulu

194
0:08:36.626,000 --> 0:08:38,000
as a device to get rid of their cable bill.

195
0:08:38.722,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So, really clever ideas there that are being taken ahold of

196
0:08:42.336,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and that marketers are starting to understand.

197
0:08:44.531,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The second of the four values is this movement toward

198
0:08:47.185,000 --> 0:08:48,000
ethics and fair play.

199
0:08:48.514,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We see that play itself out with empathy and respect.

200
0:08:51.675,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The consumer is demanding it.

201
0:08:53.32,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And, as a result, businesses must provide not only value,

202
0:08:56.51,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but values.

203
0:08:57.686,000 --> 0:09:,000
Increasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company,

204
0:09:00.883,000 --> 0:09:01,000
at their conduct in the marketplace.

205
0:09:02.652,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So we see with empathy and respect

206
0:09:04.344,000 --> 0:09:06,000
lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession.

207
0:09:07.164,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I'll give you a few examples.

208
0:09:08.579,000 --> 0:09:1,000
One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods,

209
0:09:11.128,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system.

210
0:09:14.866,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Also, a wonderful by-product of a really lousy thing,

211
0:09:18.937,000 --> 0:09:19,000
which has been unemployment,

212
0:09:20.329,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country.

213
0:09:23.154,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We also see the phenomenon -- some of you may have "boomerang kids" --

214
0:09:26.848,000 --> 0:09:27,000
these are "boomerang alumni,"

215
0:09:28.509,000 --> 0:09:3,000
where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni

216
0:09:31.266,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining.

217
0:09:34.071,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We also talked about character and professionalism.

218
0:09:36.643,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City in January,

219
0:09:40.41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and suddenly Sully has become a key name on BabyCenter.

220
0:09:44.41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

221
0:09:45.504,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So, from a value and values standpoint,

222
0:09:47.924,000 --> 0:09:49,000
what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.

223
0:09:50.901,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Microsoft is doing something wonderful.

224
0:09:52.817,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with IT training,

225
0:09:56.679,000 --> 0:09:59,000
using their existing infrastructure to do something good.

226
0:09:59.805,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Also, a really interesting company is GORE-TEX.

227
0:10:02.29,000 --> 0:10:04,000
GORE-TEX is all about personal accountability

228
0:10:05.024,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of their management and their employees,

229
0:10:06.997,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses.

230
0:10:10.579,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But they also talk about the fact that their executives --

231
0:10:13.368,000 --> 0:10:16,000
all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet

232
0:10:16.464,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for everyone to see.

233
0:10:17.667,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Complete transparency.

234
0:10:19.41,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Think twice before you have that bottle of wine.

235
0:10:21.71,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

236
0:10:22.791,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism

237
0:10:25.588,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is about durable living.

238
0:10:27.097,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing

239
0:10:29.658,000 --> 0:10:3,000
this is a marathon, not a sprint.

240
0:10:31.41,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They're digging in and looking for ways to extract value

241
0:10:34.293,000 --> 0:10:36,000
out of every purchase they make.

242
0:10:36.41,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars

243
0:10:39.349,000 --> 0:10:42,000
longer than ever before: 9.4 years on average, in March.

244
0:10:43.235,000 --> 0:10:44,000
A record.

245
0:10:44.41,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America.

246
0:10:48.41,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Did you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card?

247
0:10:52.276,000 --> 0:10:54,000
The highest percentage ever in our nation's history.

248
0:10:54.765,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge.

249
0:10:58.41,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Continuing education is up.

250
0:11:00.153,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Everything is focused on betterment, training,

251
0:11:02.815,000 --> 0:11:03,000
development and moving forward.

252
0:11:04.624,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We also see a big DIY movement.

253
0:11:07.684,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America

254
0:11:11.872,000 --> 0:11:12,000
are actually built by owners.

255
0:11:13.41,000 --> 0:11:14,000
That includes cottages and the like,

256
0:11:15.292,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but 30 percent.

257
0:11:16.484,000 --> 0:11:19,000
People are getting their hands dirty, rolling up their sleeves.

258
0:11:19.52,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They want these skills.

259
0:11:20.711,000 --> 0:11:23,000
We see it with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens, chickens and ducks.

260
0:11:24.299,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And when you work out the math, they say it doesn't work,

261
0:11:27.011,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but the principle is there;

262
0:11:28.335,000 --> 0:11:3,000
it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself.

263
0:11:31.074,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Then we look at the High Line in New York City,

264
0:11:33.709,000 --> 0:11:35,000
an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure

265
0:11:36.501,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for something good,

266
0:11:37.684,000 --> 0:11:39,000
which is a brand-new park in New York City.

267
0:11:39.743,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers,

268
0:11:43.858,000 --> 0:11:44,000
be a brand that lasts,

269
0:11:45.41,000 --> 0:11:46,000
offer transparency,

270
0:11:46.823,000 --> 0:11:48,000
promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale.

271
0:11:49.341,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Perfect example of that is Patagonia.

272
0:11:51.41,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Patagonia's "Footprint Chronicles"

273
0:11:53.148,000 --> 0:11:56,000
basically goes through and tracks every product they make,

274
0:11:56.97,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and gives you social responsibility,

275
0:11:58.784,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and helps you understand the ethics behind the product they make.

276
0:12:02.347,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Another great example is Fidelity.

277
0:12:04.153,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases,

278
0:12:07.863,000 --> 0:12:11,000
this is about 529 rewards for your student education.

279
0:12:12.783,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Or the interesting company Sunrun.

280
0:12:14.894,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I love this company.

281
0:12:16.073,000 --> 0:12:18,000
They've created a consumer collective

282
0:12:18.164,000 --> 0:12:2,000
where they put solar panels on households

283
0:12:20.534,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and create a consumer-based utility,

284
0:12:22.653,000 --> 0:12:23,000
where the electricity they generate

285
0:12:24.375,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is basically pumped back out into the marketplace.

286
0:12:27.023,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So it's a consumer-driven co-op.

287
0:12:28.783,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The fourth post-crisis consumerism that we see

288
0:12:32.481,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is this movement about "return to the fold."

289
0:12:34.822,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It's incredibly important right now.

290
0:12:36.645,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.

291
0:12:39.253,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It's now about connecting to your communities,

292
0:12:41.469,000 --> 0:12:42,000
connecting to your social networks.

293
0:12:43.255,000 --> 0:12:44,000
In my book, I talked about the fact

294
0:12:44.993,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that 72 percent of people trust what other people say

295
0:12:47.692,000 --> 0:12:48,000
about a brand or a company,

296
0:12:49.167,000 --> 0:12:51,000
versus 15 percent on advertising.

297
0:12:51.233,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So in that respect, cooperative consumerism has really taken off.

298
0:12:54.977,000 --> 0:12:56,000
This is about consumers working together to get what they want

299
0:12:57.984,000 --> 0:12:58,000
out of the marketplace.

300
0:12:59.184,000 --> 0:13:,000
Let's look at a couple of quick examples.

301
0:13:01.185,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The artisanal movement is huge:

302
0:13:02.782,000 --> 0:13:05,000
everything about locally derived products and services,

303
0:13:05.863,000 --> 0:13:06,000
supporting your local neighborhoods,

304
0:13:07.671,000 --> 0:13:09,000
whether it's cheeses, wines and other products.

305
0:13:10.671,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Also this rise of local currencies.

306
0:13:13.353,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment,

307
0:13:16.352,000 --> 0:13:18,000
you're doing business with people you trust

308
0:13:18.435,000 --> 0:13:19,000
in your local markets.

309
0:13:19.638,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So this rise of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon.

310
0:13:23.53,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating.

311
0:13:27.176,000 --> 0:13:3,000
They actually started, in certain communities in the United States,

312
0:13:30.373,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to publish people's electricity usage.

313
0:13:32.424,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And what they found out is when that was available for public record,

314
0:13:35.759,000 --> 0:13:38,000
the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.

315
0:13:39.771,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling,

316
0:13:42.41,000 --> 0:13:46,000
which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together

317
0:13:46.629,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to buy meat from organic farms, that they know is safe and controlled

318
0:13:50.546,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in the way that they want it to be controlled.

319
0:13:52.756,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And then there's this other really interesting movement in California,

320
0:13:56.347,000 --> 0:13:57,000
which is about carrot mobs.

321
0:13:57.854,000 --> 0:14:,000
The traditional thing would be to boycott, right? Have a stick.

322
0:14:00.924,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Well, why not have a carrot?

323
0:14:02.294,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources

324
0:14:05.622,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to incentify companies to do good.

325
0:14:08.41,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And then we look at what companies can do.

326
0:14:11.231,000 --> 0:14:14,000
This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer.

327
0:14:14.708,000 --> 0:14:16,000
You have to realize that you can't fight and control this.

328
0:14:17.699,000 --> 0:14:18,000
You actually need to organize it.

329
0:14:19.333,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning.

330
0:14:21.882,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And there's lots of really interesting examples here.

331
0:14:25.118,000 --> 0:14:29,000
First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of

332
0:14:29.935,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and diversified from rating restaurants,

333
0:14:32.187,000 --> 0:14:34,000
into actually rating health care.

334
0:14:34.41,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So what credentials does Zagat's have?

335
0:14:36.563,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Well, they have a lot,

336
0:14:37.757,000 --> 0:14:38,000
because it's their network of people.

337
0:14:39.625,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So that becomes a very powerful force for them

338
0:14:42.192,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to make their brand more elastic.

339
0:14:44.41,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.

340
0:14:47.196,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck.

341
0:14:50.197,000 --> 0:14:51,000
It's a moving truck through L.A.,

342
0:14:51.82,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and the only way you can find it is through Twitter.

343
0:14:54.34,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

344
0:14:55.421,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Or you look at

345
0:14:56.598,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Johnson & Johnson's "Momversations," a phenomenal blog that's been built up,

346
0:15:01.684,000 --> 0:15:05,000
where J&J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers,

347
0:15:05.838,000 --> 0:15:09,000
allowing them to create a forum where they can communicate and connect.

348
0:15:10.31,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And it's also become a very valuable advertising revenue for J&J as well.

349
0:15:15.173,000 --> 0:15:19,000
This, plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs,

350
0:15:19.411,000 --> 0:15:21,000
from Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter,

351
0:15:21.975,000 --> 0:15:22,000
creating an open environment,

352
0:15:23.41,000 --> 0:15:26,000
allowing their employees to be part of the process,

353
0:15:26.472,000 --> 0:15:27,000
rather than hidden behind walls.

354
0:15:28.204,000 --> 0:15:32,000
You see this rising force in total transparency and openness

355
0:15:32.433,000 --> 0:15:33,000
that companies are starting to adopt,

356
0:15:34.245,000 --> 0:15:36,000
all because the consumer is demanding it.

357
0:15:36.576,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So when we look at this and step back,

358
0:15:38.546,000 --> 0:15:42,000
what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real.

359
0:15:42.762,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It's been tremendously powerful for consumers.

360
0:15:45.41,000 --> 0:15:48,000
But at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity.

361
0:15:48.997,000 --> 0:15:51,000
The Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side

362
0:15:52.488,000 --> 0:15:53,000
of the same coin.

363
0:15:53.679,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Crisis equals opportunity.

364
0:15:55.41,000 --> 0:15:58,000
What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them

365
0:15:58.928,000 --> 0:16:,000
to actually lead us forward out of this recession.

366
0:16:01.588,000 --> 0:16:05,000
So we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better:

367
0:16:06.41,000 --> 0:16:07,000
it will drive innovation;

368
0:16:08.314,000 --> 0:16:1,000
it will make longer-lasting products;

369
0:16:10.439,000 --> 0:16:12,000
it will create better, more intuitive customer service;

370
0:16:13.059,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies

371
0:16:15.96,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that share the values that we share.

372
0:16:18.055,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So when we look back and step out at this

373
0:16:20.098,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data,

374
0:16:23.41,000 --> 0:16:25,000
we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.

375
0:16:26.283,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Thank you very much.

376
0:16:27.475,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Applause)

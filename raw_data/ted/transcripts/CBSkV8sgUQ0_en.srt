thank you i realize you are working 24 7

12
0:00:32.079,000 --> 0:00:35,000
at the moment

13
0:00:33.12,000 --> 0:00:37,000
um first of all how are you how is

14
0:00:35.68,000 --> 0:00:38,000
estonia doing how are you doing what's

15
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the status of the country

16
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:42,000
right now i think we're i think we're

17
0:00:40.96,000 --> 0:00:43,000
actually pretty okay

18
0:00:42.399,000 --> 0:00:46,000
um there's not much panic around what's

19
0:00:44.8,000 --> 0:00:48,000
happening and and people are pretty much

20
0:00:47.12,000 --> 0:00:5,000
understanding uh the concept of social

21
0:00:49.6,000 --> 0:00:53,000
distancing

22
0:00:50.879,000 --> 0:00:54,000
though um i think you know

23
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
obviously it's not a place for anyone

24
0:00:55.44,000 --> 0:01:,000
likes to be right now

25
0:00:57.12,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but uh it's not the worst so you guys

26
0:01:00.719,000 --> 0:01:03,000
are socially distancing you're staying

27
0:01:02.96,000 --> 0:01:06,000
at home

28
0:01:03.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
there's kind of outside work

29
0:01:07.04,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or i i think we're actually like more

30
0:01:09.76,000 --> 0:01:12,000
like physically distancing because i

31
0:01:11.52,000 --> 0:01:13,000
don't think i've been ever talking to so

32
0:01:13.119,000 --> 0:01:16,000
many people

33
0:01:14.32,000 --> 0:01:17,000
as i've been in the last three weeks

34
0:01:16.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
like so

35
0:01:17.68,000 --> 0:01:2,000
uh yeah what we're doing we're staying

36
0:01:20.4,000 --> 0:01:22,000
home

37
0:01:21.2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
uh it's not like fully mandatory we can

38
0:01:23.36,000 --> 0:01:26,000
go out but

39
0:01:24.32,000 --> 0:01:28,000
uh but it's it's a common understanding

40
0:01:26.72,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that rather stay home

41
0:01:28.56,000 --> 0:01:33,000
great great so talk to us about

42
0:01:31.759,000 --> 0:01:35,000
pack the crisis in estonia tell us what

43
0:01:34.079,000 --> 0:01:37,000
happened tell us some of the

44
0:01:36.079,000 --> 0:01:39,000
extraordinary outcomes that we've seen

45
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:41,000
already from it

46
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:42,000
i think one of the one of the most

47
0:01:41.2,000 --> 0:01:45,000
extraordinary things uh

48
0:01:43.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is uh yeah of course what what came out

49
0:01:45.52,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of it but but uh

50
0:01:47.439,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but what i love about it is how it's a

51
0:01:49.52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
combination of of government and ngo

52
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and and then a startup working together

53
0:01:54.64,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so uh i think like three

54
0:01:56.399,000 --> 0:01:59,000
three weeks ago or so i'm lost track of

55
0:01:58.399,000 --> 0:02:02,000
time to be honest

56
0:01:59.68,000 --> 0:02:04,000
um uh we i had a phone call from

57
0:02:02.799,000 --> 0:02:05,000
uh celebrate the stoners uh mick weinig

58
0:02:05.28,000 --> 0:02:08,000
who's uh

59
0:02:06.32,000 --> 0:02:09,000
escalated is like a really bleeding as

60
0:02:08.319,000 --> 0:02:12,000
innovation agency in a stone

61
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
uh for the government uh so he called me

62
0:02:12.959,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and said hey you wanna you wanna

63
0:02:14.319,000 --> 0:02:17,000
champion would you to kick off

64
0:02:15.84,000 --> 0:02:19,000
a virtual hackathon and i was like what

65
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:23,000
are you talking about but yes

66
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so uh and then also garage 48 got on

67
0:02:23.28,000 --> 0:02:26,000
board with

68
0:02:23.92,000 --> 0:02:26,000
with kaizen who's a fantastic person and

69
0:02:26.64,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and

70
0:02:27.12,000 --> 0:02:33,000
um so we ended up also training it

71
0:02:30.48,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and and a carriage 48 is a hackathon

72
0:02:33.12,000 --> 0:02:35,000
company they've been doing it for 10

73
0:02:34.239,000 --> 0:02:36,000
years but they haven't done it virtually

74
0:02:35.68,000 --> 0:02:38,000
so their knowledge

75
0:02:36.72,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of how these things um should be done

76
0:02:39.599,000 --> 0:02:43,000
has been super

77
0:02:40.72,000 --> 0:02:43,000
invaluable for us uh well everyone after

78
0:02:43.68,000 --> 0:02:46,000
what

79
0:02:44.239,000 --> 0:02:5,000
after all of this came out so

80
0:02:47.519,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we had six hours and we kicked it off uh

81
0:02:50.64,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in six hours we had

82
0:02:51.92,000 --> 0:02:56,000
uh the yeah we had the icity minister

83
0:02:55.44,000 --> 0:02:58,000
kai margaret was an ex-skyper

84
0:02:57.04,000 --> 0:03:,000
actually one of the original estonian

85
0:02:58.879,000 --> 0:03:01,000
mafia you know

86
0:03:00.159,000 --> 0:03:04,000
gangs we call the startup founders dad

87
0:03:02.72,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in estonia um

88
0:03:04.959,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and he was opening the panel we had over

89
0:03:08.08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the next 48 hours we had 1

90
0:03:09.68,000 --> 0:03:13,000
300 people jumping in building amazing

91
0:03:12.319,000 --> 0:03:15,000
infrastructural

92
0:03:13.68,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and so forth solutions that for crisis

93
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that we're facing now and

94
0:03:18.159,000 --> 0:03:21,000
uh example of like what were some of

95
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:22,000
those applications or things that got

96
0:03:22.08,000 --> 0:03:25,000
built

97
0:03:23.2,000 --> 0:03:26,000
yeah absolutely uh one of my absolute

98
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:28,000
favorite ones is

99
0:03:26.319,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is a very simple thing it's it's a super

100
0:03:28.56,000 --> 0:03:31,000
simple thing

101
0:03:29.519,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it's a chatbot but uh when you when you

102
0:03:31.92,000 --> 0:03:33,000
understand

103
0:03:32.56,000 --> 0:03:35,000
uh the implications of how much it

104
0:03:34.4,000 --> 0:03:38,000
actually helps people

105
0:03:35.599,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it's kind of crazy uh so it's a chatbot

106
0:03:38.64,000 --> 0:03:4,000
about the information about the virus

107
0:03:40.239,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but

108
0:03:40.799,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it will be how to utilize for

109
0:03:42.72,000 --> 0:03:45,000
governmental communication afterwards

110
0:03:44.239,000 --> 0:03:47,000
too so there's in like in about three

111
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
weeks there's been

112
0:03:47.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
14 000 queries and talks with it uh

113
0:03:50.799,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and that's for estonia is a lot for a

114
0:03:52.4,000 --> 0:03:57,000
small place all right

115
0:03:54.239,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so um also um

116
0:03:57.519,000 --> 0:04:,000
what's really cool about this is that it

117
0:03:59.12,000 --> 0:04:02,000
understands slang

118
0:04:00.64,000 --> 0:04:03,000
like when when the kids talk to it you

119
0:04:02.48,000 --> 0:04:06,000
know it understands what

120
0:04:04.319,000 --> 0:04:08,000
uh what the kid is asking and also it

121
0:04:07.36,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and the main thing that i really really

122
0:04:08.879,000 --> 0:04:12,000
adore is that it actually leaves the

123
0:04:10.72,000 --> 0:04:14,000
hotlines open for the elderly who can't

124
0:04:13.84,000 --> 0:04:16,000
use the chatbot so it's kind of

125
0:04:15.2,000 --> 0:04:18,000
funneling the conversation so everyone's

126
0:04:16.959,000 --> 0:04:19,000
informed there's no panic

127
0:04:18.479,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you know it's it's it's used in every

128
0:04:20.32,000 --> 0:04:24,000
governmental uh website right now

129
0:04:22.56,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it's a media site so it's really easy to

130
0:04:24.479,000 --> 0:04:28,000
access for people

131
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
um so another another thing i really

132
0:04:28.96,000 --> 0:04:32,000
want to mention sorry

133
0:04:30.6,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is uh is a

134
0:04:33.759,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is a company now i think um called share

135
0:04:37.04,000 --> 0:04:4,000
force one

136
0:04:38.08,000 --> 0:04:41,000
uh we all know that employment is a big

137
0:04:40.479,000 --> 0:04:43,000
issue around the world right now because

138
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:46,000
it's all getting locked down it's all

139
0:04:43.759,000 --> 0:04:46,000
changing a lot so what they did they

140
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
built a platform where

141
0:04:47.44,000 --> 0:04:5,000
companies can share uh workforce with

142
0:04:49.84,000 --> 0:04:53,000
each other

143
0:04:50.96,000 --> 0:04:53,000
with so they don't have to let people go

144
0:04:53.919,000 --> 0:04:55,000
so

145
0:04:54.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this is i think this is ingenious and

146
0:04:56.639,000 --> 0:04:59,000
these things came out

147
0:04:57.84,000 --> 0:05:,000
uh well there's over 30 different

148
0:04:59.759,000 --> 0:05:02,000
solutions five of them one

149
0:05:01.36,000 --> 0:05:04,000
funny thing though uh so uh but it's

150
0:05:03.6,000 --> 0:05:05,000
what it's called

151
0:05:04.479,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it's called the chatbot is called surah

152
0:05:06.479,000 --> 0:05:09,000
it didn't win the government liked it

153
0:05:08.56,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the government reached out to it later

154
0:05:10.08,000 --> 0:05:15,000
on and said we need this

155
0:05:12.56,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so yeah yeah so with share force one so

156
0:05:15.44,000 --> 0:05:18,000
just so i'm understanding so the idea

157
0:05:17.28,000 --> 0:05:21,000
would be that someone

158
0:05:18.479,000 --> 0:05:21,000
an employer who suddenly has a ton of

159
0:05:21.52,000 --> 0:05:24,000
employees

160
0:05:22.4,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with kind of nothing to do because of

161
0:05:24.56,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the shutdowns

162
0:05:25.68,000 --> 0:05:29,000
can kind of advertise them and then like

163
0:05:28.479,000 --> 0:05:31,000
how does that actually work

164
0:05:29.919,000 --> 0:05:33,000
who's going to make use of it it builds

165
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
uh as much as i understand it's been

166
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
really flying fast right now right so as

167
0:05:36.479,000 --> 0:05:38,000
much as it's partnering up companies

168
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
between themselves

169
0:05:39.36,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so uh for example if you have a hotel uh

170
0:05:42.08,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that doesn't really

171
0:05:43.52,000 --> 0:05:47,000
uh have much people to do right now and

172
0:05:46.24,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they can partner up with a delivery

173
0:05:47.68,000 --> 0:05:51,000
company for example

174
0:05:49.36,000 --> 0:05:52,000
i see yeah i see so the people because

175
0:05:51.68,000 --> 0:05:53,000
people aren't staying at hotels or

176
0:05:53.199,000 --> 0:05:54,000
traveling to them there's a whole bunch

177
0:05:54.56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of work

178
0:05:55.12,000 --> 0:05:59,000
there that can be kind of reapplied

179
0:06:00.319,000 --> 0:06:03,000
people they don't lose their jobs right

180
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and and they went they went as far as

181
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
actually like building out the

182
0:06:05.36,000 --> 0:06:09,000
legislative part of it it's you know

183
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it's there use it

184
0:06:09.44,000 --> 0:06:12,000
so that's what's so interesting to me

185
0:06:11.12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
about especially about the global hack

186
0:06:12.96,000 --> 0:06:15,000
too is the fact that this is really it's

187
0:06:14.639,000 --> 0:06:16,000
not about just estonia you're really

188
0:06:16.4,000 --> 0:06:19,000
thinking kind of

189
0:06:17.52,000 --> 0:06:2,000
globally about this one of the things

190
0:06:19.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that has been heartening about this

191
0:06:21.28,000 --> 0:06:24,000
crisis has been the scientific

192
0:06:22.8,000 --> 0:06:25,000
collaboration and has been

193
0:06:24.479,000 --> 0:06:27,000
scientists really sharing information

194
0:06:26.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and just doing a really

195
0:06:27.52,000 --> 0:06:31,000
bang-up job of kind of breaking down

196
0:06:29.759,000 --> 0:06:31,000
barriers that's so much harder when

197
0:06:31.52,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you're talking about

198
0:06:32.479,000 --> 0:06:35,000
policy or you're talking about

199
0:06:33.84,000 --> 0:06:36,000
international affairs but what are you

200
0:06:35.919,000 --> 0:06:37,000
seeing that actually means that some of

201
0:06:37.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
this

202
0:06:38.319,000 --> 0:06:41,000
some of these ideas can be shared

203
0:06:40.72,000 --> 0:06:44,000
globally

204
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
oh well that's the thing uh after we did

205
0:06:44.72,000 --> 0:06:47,000
our hackathon in estonia we wrote down a

206
0:06:46.72,000 --> 0:06:48,000
playbook actually carrots 48 people

207
0:06:48.479,000 --> 0:06:5,000
wrote it down

208
0:06:49.44,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and we kind of helped along with what we

209
0:06:51.039,000 --> 0:06:56,000
knew um

210
0:06:52.639,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and uh so after that

211
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it's been three and a half weeks i think

212
0:06:57.84,000 --> 0:07:02,000
or something there's been

213
0:06:59.919,000 --> 0:07:03,000
40 something countries holding over 52

214
0:07:03.36,000 --> 0:07:04,000
hackathons

215
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
meaning that it's getting really

216
0:07:05.28,000 --> 0:07:08,000
international but all of these things

217
0:07:06.72,000 --> 0:07:1,000
are regional as they should be you know

218
0:07:08.639,000 --> 0:07:12,000
europe communities need solutions so we

219
0:07:11.28,000 --> 0:07:15,000
figured we need to escalate this to do

220
0:07:13.28,000 --> 0:07:17,000
a next level where we get all these

221
0:07:15.44,000 --> 0:07:18,000
people to work together and we also need

222
0:07:17.28,000 --> 0:07:2,000
all the governments to get work together

223
0:07:18.8,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to work together with the teams

224
0:07:20.88,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because what some of the best hackathons

225
0:07:22.56,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we've seen are the ones where the

226
0:07:23.759,000 --> 0:07:25,000
government is involved just like ours

227
0:07:25.599,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was

228
0:07:26.479,000 --> 0:07:29,000
um so what we've been doing for the for

229
0:07:29.28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the global hack

230
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is uh is we've been building a separate

231
0:07:32.24,000 --> 0:07:35,000
slack

232
0:07:33.36,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where we're onboarding government

233
0:07:35.36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
officials from all over the world

234
0:07:36.88,000 --> 0:07:39,000
our our government is doing it our civil

235
0:07:38.8,000 --> 0:07:39,000
servants who know other civil servants

236
0:07:40.319,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and so

237
0:07:40.72,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it's very informal and they have been uh

238
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
describing the challenges that they have

239
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
locally that should be solved

240
0:07:48.4,000 --> 0:07:51,000
uh during uh the global hack that's

241
0:07:51.44,000 --> 0:07:54,000
starting

242
0:07:52.08,000 --> 0:07:56,000
tomorrow that's so interesting so the

243
0:07:54.96,000 --> 0:07:57,000
problems that people are solving are not

244
0:07:56.96,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the ones that they kind of invent for

245
0:07:58.56,000 --> 0:08:,000
themselves but this is really coming

246
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
from

247
0:08:00.879,000 --> 0:08:03,000
need it's both it's both interesting

248
0:08:03.84,000 --> 0:08:05,000
yeah yeah

249
0:08:04.479,000 --> 0:08:07,000
yeah yeah it's absolutely what's cool is

250
0:08:06.639,000 --> 0:08:08,000
like you're not showing up to solve

251
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
government problems but you're so you're

252
0:08:09.599,000 --> 0:08:12,000
showing up

253
0:08:10.879,000 --> 0:08:13,000
getting a full understanding what is a

254
0:08:12.639,000 --> 0:08:16,000
problem and then

255
0:08:13.919,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you start building solutions for how for

256
0:08:16.72,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it however you want it it can be

257
0:08:18.36,000 --> 0:08:22,000
non-technological it can be a movement

258
0:08:20.72,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it can be a social thing it can be a

259
0:08:22.72,000 --> 0:08:24,000
hotline for

260
0:08:23.599,000 --> 0:08:27,000
like example i'll give you an example in

261
0:08:25.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
italy hack uh there was a red cross

262
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:34,000
uh uh employee a volunteer i think sorry

263
0:08:31.199,000 --> 0:08:35,000
uh who set up a hotline for elderly

264
0:08:34.56,000 --> 0:08:37,000
people so they could just you know

265
0:08:36.08,000 --> 0:08:39,000
talk with each other things like that

266
0:08:37.839,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it's not high tech at all it's it's

267
0:08:39.68,000 --> 0:08:43,000
human we're

268
0:08:40.56,000 --> 0:08:43,000
solving this for humans right i love

269
0:08:43.68,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that

270
0:08:44.48,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and so i think speaking to that that

271
0:08:47.6,000 --> 0:08:49,000
means that

272
0:08:48.48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
you are looking for everyone to get

273
0:08:50.08,000 --> 0:08:53,000
involved this isn't just about

274
0:08:51.68,000 --> 0:08:55,000
coders or technologists this is really

275
0:08:53.519,000 --> 0:08:57,000
about every everybody can show up and

276
0:08:55.839,000 --> 0:08:59,000
everybody can play a part is that right

277
0:08:58.32,000 --> 0:09:01,000
absolutely it's i think there's a lot of

278
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:04,000
people out there right now who are

279
0:09:01.68,000 --> 0:09:05,000
trying to find a way how to contribute

280
0:09:04.08,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in you know time of crisis how to put

281
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
their expertise in play

282
0:09:08.08,000 --> 0:09:12,000
there can be a lot for example

283
0:09:10.08,000 --> 0:09:13,000
researchers scientists marketers there

284
0:09:12.24,000 --> 0:09:15,000
can be

285
0:09:13.68,000 --> 0:09:17,000
people with with some knowledge about

286
0:09:15.92,000 --> 0:09:19,000
managing teams for example

287
0:09:18.32,000 --> 0:09:22,000
they're all welcome all of these skill

288
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
sets are very much welcome

289
0:09:23.279,000 --> 0:09:27,000
so i know it doesn't go live until when

290
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
does it go live

291
0:09:27.76,000 --> 0:09:3,000
tomorrow tomorrow i honestly don't

292
0:09:30.959,000 --> 0:09:32,000
remember

293
0:09:31.36,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it's on thursday yeah i don't remember

294
0:09:33.12,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the exact time like it's been crazy

295
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is there a challenge that you are like

296
0:09:41.6,000 --> 0:09:45,000
you saw come in and you were like oh my

297
0:09:43.6,000 --> 0:09:46,000
god that could make such a difference

298
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
yeah um we have

299
0:09:47.36,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we have some uh missions of united

300
0:09:49.279,000 --> 0:09:51,000
nations involved they have set up their

301
0:09:51.2,000 --> 0:09:54,000
missions

302
0:09:52.24,000 --> 0:09:55,000
regarding solidarity uh they really

303
0:09:54.48,000 --> 0:09:59,000
enjoyed the european commission

304
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is is really looking heavily into um

305
0:09:59.76,000 --> 0:10:02,000
how to what is what's the new education

306
0:10:02.24,000 --> 0:10:05,000
going to be

307
0:10:03.279,000 --> 0:10:07,000
like this is this is interesting right

308
0:10:05.44,000 --> 0:10:1,000
uh estonian government uh is trying to

309
0:10:08.079,000 --> 0:10:12,000
prevent the the uh drop of an employment

310
0:10:11.12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
rate in youth

311
0:10:12.079,000 --> 0:10:15,000
so there's there's a lot of like pretty

312
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
broad

313
0:10:15.12,000 --> 0:10:19,000
uh challenges but uh what's gonna happen

314
0:10:17.839,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is that when we see

315
0:10:19.2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
different ideas popping up solving these

316
0:10:21.6,000 --> 0:10:24,000
things from different

317
0:10:22.64,000 --> 0:10:25,000
angles then there will be people coming

318
0:10:24.959,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to them and trying to help them with

319
0:10:26.399,000 --> 0:10:3,000
data and access and so forth

320
0:10:28.88,000 --> 0:10:31,000
i love that and i saw that there's prize

321
0:10:30.64,000 --> 0:10:36,000
money for this i think it's

322
0:10:32.12,000 --> 0:10:37,000
120 120 000 euros

323
0:10:37.6,000 --> 0:10:41,000
oh yeah you're missing yeah it's 140 now

324
0:10:41.2,000 --> 0:10:45,000
so what i'm saying is that it's

325
0:10:42.56,000 --> 0:10:46,000
constantly growing and actually

326
0:10:45.2,000 --> 0:10:48,000
i found out something just before this

327
0:10:47.519,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that i really want to say

328
0:10:49.12,000 --> 0:10:53,000
um one thing i had not figured out since

329
0:10:52.64,000 --> 0:10:56,000
since now

330
0:10:53.519,000 --> 0:10:59,000
uh is like who really started it and

347
0:11:30.24,000 --> 0:11:34,000
bunch of kind of big-time investors

348
0:11:32.32,000 --> 0:11:36,000
involved in this is this is maybe one of

349
0:11:35.04,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the side effects of this actually like

350
0:11:36.88,000 --> 0:11:4,000
employment do you see businesses being

351
0:11:38.8,000 --> 0:11:44,000
launched as a result of this

352
0:11:41.04,000 --> 0:11:48,000
absolutely uh it's that's how it's been

353

crazy awesome companies coming out of it

357
0:11:53.44,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in this region and it's not a one-off

358
0:11:55.76,000 --> 0:11:59,000
thing like you kick it off for 48 hours

359

you let it fly you you really work

360

361

380
0:12:38.959,000 --> 0:12:4,000
into connecting people to the right

381
0:12:40.399,000 --> 0:12:42,000
people they've been doing this for us

382
0:12:41.839,000 --> 0:12:43,000
since day one when we kicked these

383
0:12:43.36,000 --> 0:12:46,000
things out

384
0:12:44.32,000 --> 0:12:48,000

385
0:12:47.279,000 --> 0:12:53,000
silicon valley a lot of

386
0:12:48.8,000 --> 0:12:54,000
european uh vc and angel eyes on it

387
0:12:53.36,000 --> 0:12:56,000

388
0:12:55.12,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and amazons are going to be built

389
0:12:56.959,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and the key reason is is all eyes on

390
0:12:59.12,000 --> 0:13:02,000
them and secondly

391
0:13:00.32,000 --> 0:13:05,000
access they will have all the access

392
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
they need to build their solutions right

393
0:13:05.44,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and i think yeah that's amazing how

394
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000

1
0:00:00.163,000 --> 0:00:01,000
HR jargon makes me crazy.

2
0:00:01.63,000 --> 0:00:03,000
We have to have all these stupid acronyms

3
0:00:03.659,000 --> 0:00:06,000
that describe things that nobody understands: OKRs and PIPs.

4
0:00:07.648,000 --> 0:00:08,000
I think we can run our businesses

5
0:00:09.307,000 --> 0:00:11,000
by just talking to each other like regular human beings.

6
0:00:12.021,000 --> 0:00:13,000
We might actually get more done.

7
0:00:13.489,000 --> 0:00:15,000
[The Way We Work]

8
0:00:17.739,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I really always wanted to be an HR professional,

9
0:00:20.399,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I wanted to be able to speak the language of management.

10
0:00:23.166,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And you know what I've learned after all this time?

11
0:00:25.603,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I don't think any of it matters.

12
0:00:27.158,000 --> 0:00:29,000
There's all kinds of things that we call "best practices"

13
0:00:30.156,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that aren't best practices at all.

14
0:00:32.078,000 --> 0:00:34,000
How do we know it's best? We don't measure this stuff.

15
0:00:34.854,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In fact, I've learned that "best practices" usually means

16
0:00:38.261,000 --> 0:00:39,000
copying what everybody else does.

17
0:00:39.879,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Our world is changing and evolving all the time.

18
0:00:42.775,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Here are some lessons to help you adapt.

19
0:00:44.942,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Lesson one: Your employees are adults.

20
0:00:47.513,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You know, we've created so many layers

21
0:00:49.648,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and so many processes and so many guidelines

22
0:00:52.466,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to keep those employees in place

23
0:00:54.369,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that we've ended up with systems that treat people like they're children.

24
0:00:58.073,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And they're not.

25
0:00:59.299,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Fully formed adults walk in the door every single day.

26
0:01:01.87,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They have rent payments, they have obligations,

27
0:01:04.45,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they're members of society,

28
0:01:05.823,000 --> 0:01:07,000
they want to create a difference in the world.

29
0:01:08.013,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So if we start with the assumption

30
0:01:09.72,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that everybody comes to work to do an amazing job,

31
0:01:12.092,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you'd be surprised what you get.

32
0:01:13.703,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Lesson two: The job of management isn't to control people,

33
0:01:17.175,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it's to build great teams.

34
0:01:18.556,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When managers build great teams, here's how you know it.

35
0:01:22.151,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They've done amazing stuff.

36
0:01:23.492,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Customers are really happy.

37
0:01:24.989,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Those are the metrics that really matter.

38
0:01:27.299,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Not the metrics of: "Do you come to work on time?"

39
0:01:29.91,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"Did you take your vacation?" "Did you follow the rules?"

40
0:01:32.632,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"Did you ask for permission?"

41
0:01:34.068,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Lesson three: People want to do work that means something.

42
0:01:37.298,000 --> 0:01:39,000
After they do it, they should be free to move on.

43
0:01:39.78,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Careers are journeys.

44
0:01:41.079,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Nobody's going to want to do the same thing for 60 years.

45
0:01:43.844,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So the idea of keeping people for the sake of keeping them

46
0:01:47.121,000 --> 0:01:48,000
really hurts both of us.

47
0:01:48.654,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Instead, what if we created companies that were great places to be from?

48
0:01:53.578,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And everyone who leaves you

49
0:01:55.212,000 --> 0:01:58,000
becomes an ambassador for not only your product,

50
0:01:58.49,000 --> 0:02:,000
but who you are and how you operate.

51
0:02:00.545,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And when you spread that kind of excitement throughout the world,

52
0:02:04.378,000 --> 0:02:06,000
then we make all of our companies better.

53
0:02:06.64,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Lesson four: Everyone in your company should understand the business.

54
0:02:10.751,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, based on the assumption that we've got smart adults here,

55
0:02:13.791,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the most important thing we can teach them is how our business works.

56
0:02:17.069,000 --> 0:02:19,000
When I look at companies that are moving fast,

57
0:02:19.472,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that are really innovative

58
0:02:20.874,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that are doing amazing things with agility and speed,

59
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
it's because they're collaborative.

60
0:02:27.045,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The best thing that we can do is constantly teach each other what we do,

61
0:02:31.782,000 --> 0:02:34,000
what matters to us, what we measure, what goodness looks like,

62
0:02:35.616,000 --> 0:02:37,000
so that we can all drive towards achieving the same thing.

63
0:02:38.894,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Lesson five: Everyone in your company should be able to handle the truth.

64
0:02:43.115,000 --> 0:02:45,000
You know why people say giving feedback is so hard?

65
0:02:46.412,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They don't practice.

66
0:02:47.735,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Let's take the annual performance review.

67
0:02:49.886,000 --> 0:02:52,000
What else do you do in your whole life that you're really good at

68
0:02:53.022,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that you only do once a year?

69
0:02:54.743,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Here's what I found:

70
0:02:56.267,000 --> 0:02:59,000
humans can hear anything if it's true.

71
0:02:59.521,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So let's rethink the word "feedback,"

72
0:03:03.211,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and think about it as telling people the truth, the honest truth,

73
0:03:07.892,000 --> 0:03:09,000
about what they're doing right and what they're doing wrong,

74
0:03:10.751,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in the moment when they're doing it.

75
0:03:12.506,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That good thing you just did, whoo!

76
0:03:14.307,000 --> 0:03:15,000
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

77
0:03:16.164,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Go do that again.

78
0:03:17.346,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And people will do that again, today, three more times.

79
0:03:20.751,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Lesson six: Your company needs to live out its values.

80
0:03:24.608,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I was talking to a company not long ago, to the CEO.

81
0:03:27.918,000 --> 0:03:3,000
He was having trouble because the company was rocky

82
0:03:31.465,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and things weren't getting done on time,

83
0:03:33.484,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and he felt like things were sloppy.

84
0:03:35.862,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This also was a man who, I observed,

85
0:03:38.203,000 --> 0:03:4,000
never showed up to any meeting on time.

86
0:03:41.013,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Ever.

87
0:03:42.196,000 --> 0:03:43,000
If you're part of a leadership team,

88
0:03:43.95,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the most important thing that you can do to "uphold your values" is to live them.

89
0:03:48.942,000 --> 0:03:5,000
People can't be what they can't see.

90
0:03:51.337,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We say, "Yes, we're here for equality,"

91
0:03:53.901,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and then we proudly pound our chest

92
0:03:56.451,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because we'd achieved 30 percent representation of women

93
0:03:59.611,000 --> 0:04:,000
on an executive team.

94
0:04:00.998,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well that's not equal, that's 30 percent.

95
0:04:03.854,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Lesson seven: All start-up ideas are stupid.

96
0:04:07.171,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I spend a lot of time with start-ups,

97
0:04:09.59,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I have a lot of friends that work in larger, more established companies.

98
0:04:13.195,000 --> 0:04:15,000
They are always pooh-poohing the companies that I work with.

99
0:04:16.048,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"That is such a stupid idea."

100
0:04:17.477,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Well, guess what: all start-up ideas are stupid.

101
0:04:19.799,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If they were reasonable, somebody else would have already been doing them.

102
0:04:23.386,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Lesson eight: Every company needs to be excited for change.

103
0:04:26.543,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Beware of the smoke of nostalgia.

104
0:04:29.156,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If you find yourself saying, "Remember the way it used to be?"

105
0:04:32.973,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I want you to shift your thinking to say,

106
0:04:35.369,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"Think about the way it's going to be."

107
0:04:37.291,000 --> 0:04:39,000
If I had a dream company,

108
0:04:39.95,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I would walk in the door and I would say,

109
0:04:42.006,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"Everything's changed, all bets are off.

110
0:04:43.95,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We were running as fast as we can to the right,

111
0:04:46.232,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and now we'll take a hard left."

112
0:04:47.82,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And everybody would go "Yes!"

113
0:04:49.321,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It's a pretty exciting world out there, and it's changing all the time.

114
0:04:52.68,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The more we embrace it and get excited about it,

115
0:04:55.013,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the more fun we're going to have.

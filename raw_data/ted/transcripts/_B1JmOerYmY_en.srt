1
0:00:12.605,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I have a confession.

2
0:00:16.858,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I have been in an affair

3
0:00:19.329,000 --> 0:00:21,000
since I was 17 years old.

4
0:00:22.704,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I wish I could talk about butterflies in my stomach

5
0:00:26.575,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or maps I drew on the ground

6
0:00:29.438,000 --> 0:00:31,000
when I think about this affair,

7
0:00:31.747,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I cannot.

8
0:00:33.896,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I wish I could talk about sweet words spoken

9
0:00:37.18,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or gifts that I received

10
0:00:39.277,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from this affair,

11
0:00:41.021,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but I cannot.

12
0:00:43.738,000 --> 0:00:46,000
All I can tell you about is the aftermath,

13
0:00:47.742,000 --> 0:00:5,000
about days I spent constantly asking:

14
0:00:51.518,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Why, why, why me?

15
0:00:57.24,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I remember how it all began.

16
0:01:00.088,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I was in my final year of high school,

17
0:01:02.899,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and my class had just won in sports,

18
0:01:06.046,000 --> 0:01:1,000
so we were singing and dancing and hugging each other.

19
0:01:10.789,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I went and took a shower.

20
0:01:12.597,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Then I went for dinner.

21
0:01:15.061,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And when I sat down to eat,

22
0:01:17.335,000 --> 0:01:19,000
my teeth started chattering,

23
0:01:19.909,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and so I couldn't put the spoon in my mouth.

24
0:01:22.468,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I rushed to the nurse's office,

25
0:01:25.046,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and because I couldn't talk, I just pointed at my mouth.

26
0:01:28.984,000 --> 0:01:29,000
She didn't know what was happening,

27
0:01:30.794,000 --> 0:01:32,000
so she told me to lie down,

28
0:01:32.902,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and it worked --

29
0:01:34.198,000 --> 0:01:36,000
after a few minutes, the chattering stopped.

30
0:01:36.685,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I was about to dash out, and she told me --

31
0:01:41.137,000 --> 0:01:45,000
no, she insisted -- that I go up to the dormitories to sleep.

32
0:01:46.085,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Here I was in my final year of high school,

33
0:01:49.226,000 --> 0:01:53,000
just a few months from doing my end of high school exams

34
0:01:53.805,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and a few days from doing a set of exams we call here in Kenya "mocks,"

35
0:01:58.718,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which are somehow meant to gauge how prepared one is for the final exams.

36
0:02:04.423,000 --> 0:02:06,000
There is no way I was going to sleep

37
0:02:06.739,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and let a set of exams mock me.

38
0:02:09.207,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I went to class, sat down,

39
0:02:12.234,000 --> 0:02:14,000
took my Kenyan history notes,

40
0:02:14.613,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and there I was, down Kenyan coastal town,

41
0:02:18.402,000 --> 0:02:2,000
with the great Mekatilili wa Menza,

42
0:02:20.909,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the Giriama woman who led her people against British colonial rule.

43
0:02:27.319,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Then, without any notice,

44
0:02:30.259,000 --> 0:02:32,000
my left hand started jerking,

45
0:02:34.375,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and it was as if I was marking imaginary papers.

46
0:02:37.893,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In and out it went,

47
0:02:40.953,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and with every stroke, one by one,

48
0:02:44.172,000 --> 0:02:47,000
my classmates stopped concentrating on their reading

49
0:02:47.679,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and started looking at me.

50
0:02:50.376,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And I tried really hard to stop it,

51
0:02:53.071,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but I couldn't,

52
0:02:54.751,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because it had a life of its own.

53
0:02:58.107,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And then, when it was sure everybody was looking at us,

54
0:03:02.753,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in its final show and official introduction,

55
0:03:06.967,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I had my first full-blown seizure,

56
0:03:09.8,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which was the beginning of what has been a 15-year-long affair.

57
0:03:17.361,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Seizures are the trademark characteristic for most types of epilepsy,

58
0:03:23.94,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and every first-ever seizure needs to be assessed by a doctor

59
0:03:28.442,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to determine if one has epilepsy

60
0:03:30.969,000 --> 0:03:32,000
or if it's a symptom of something else.

61
0:03:33.679,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In my case, it was confirmed that I had epilepsy.

62
0:03:38.091,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I spent a large chunk of my time in hospital and at home,

63
0:03:43.01,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and only went back to do my final exams.

64
0:03:47.255,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I had seizures in between papers,

65
0:03:51.128,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but managed to get good enough grades

66
0:03:53.288,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to be admitted for an actuarial science degree

67
0:03:56.572,000 --> 0:03:57,000
at the University of Nairobi.

68
0:03:58.187,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Applause)

69
0:04:04.53,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Unfortunately, I had to drop out in my second year.

70
0:04:09.117,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I didn't have good enough coping skills

71
0:04:11.584,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and a support community around me.

72
0:04:14.315,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I was lucky enough to get a job,

73
0:04:17.05,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but I was fired from that job when I had a seizure in the workplace.

74
0:04:22.521,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So I found myself in a space

75
0:04:26.669,000 --> 0:04:29,000
where I was constantly asking myself

76
0:04:30.125,000 --> 0:04:32,000
why this had to happen to me.

77
0:04:33.548,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I lived in denial for a long time,

78
0:04:37.264,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and the denial was maybe because of the things that had happened,

79
0:04:44.149,000 --> 0:04:46,000
dropping out of school and being fired from my job.

80
0:04:47.523,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Or maybe it was because of the things I had heard about epilepsy

81
0:04:51.562,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and about people living with epilepsy:

82
0:04:54.171,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that they would never live on their own;

83
0:04:56.427,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that they would never travel on their own

84
0:04:58.692,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or even get work;

85
0:05:01.191,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that they were outcasts,

86
0:05:03.064,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with a spirit in them that they needed to be delivered from.

87
0:05:08.482,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And so the more I thought about these things,

88
0:05:12.133,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the more my seizures became,

89
0:05:15.834,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I spent days with my legs locked,

90
0:05:18.963,000 --> 0:05:21,000
my speech became blurred

91
0:05:22.408,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and on days on end, this is how I'd be.

92
0:05:26.867,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Two or three days after a seizure,

93
0:05:28.924,000 --> 0:05:31,000
my head and my hand would still be twitching.

94
0:05:34.079,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I felt lost,

95
0:05:36.5,000 --> 0:05:37,000
like I'd lost everything,

96
0:05:39.353,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and sometimes,

97
0:05:42.596,000 --> 0:05:43,000
even the will to live.

98
0:05:53.544,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Sigh)

99
0:06:00.377,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I had so much frustration in me.

100
0:06:03.821,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And so I started writing,

101
0:06:05.392,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because the people around me didn't have answers

102
0:06:08.255,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to the questions that I had.

103
0:06:10.929,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And so I wrote my fears

104
0:06:13.655,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and my doubts.

105
0:06:15.749,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I wrote about my good days and my bad days and my really ugly days,

106
0:06:20.04,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and I shared them on a blog.

107
0:06:22.898,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And before long,

108
0:06:25.308,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I began to be seen and heard by people who had epilepsy

109
0:06:28.963,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and their families,

110
0:06:30.421,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and even those who did not have the diagnosis.

111
0:06:33.773,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And I moved from that girl who constantly asked why me

112
0:06:37.887,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to one who not only self-advocates,

113
0:06:40.698,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but does it for those who are yet to find their voices.

114
0:06:47.197,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Applause)

115
0:06:54.901,000 --> 0:06:57,000
My seizures are greatly reduced, from two to three times a day,

116
0:06:58.869,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to sometimes two to three times in one year.

117
0:07:02.3,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I went on --

118
0:07:03.534,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Applause)

119
0:07:09.299,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I went on to employ five people,

120
0:07:11.927,000 --> 0:07:13,000
when I began what was Kenya's first

121
0:07:14.212,000 --> 0:07:17,000
free mental health and epilepsy support line.

122
0:07:17.682,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And I travel --

123
0:07:19.028,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Applause)

124
0:07:21.349,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And I travel to speak about my affair,

125
0:07:25.871,000 --> 0:07:27,000
all these things that I had been told

126
0:07:28.252,000 --> 0:07:32,000
people like me living with epilepsy could never be able to do.

127
0:07:33.11,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Every year, a population as big as 80 percent of Nairobi

128
0:07:38.35,000 --> 0:07:4,000
gets diagnosed with epilepsy

129
0:07:41.139,000 --> 0:07:42,000
across the globe.

130
0:07:43.166,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And they, like me,

131
0:07:44.349,000 --> 0:07:48,000
go through the emotions of stigma and exclusion.

132
0:07:50.422,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And so I have made it my life journey

133
0:07:53.922,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to keep these conversations going,

134
0:07:56.53,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and I keep confessing about my affair

135
0:07:59.729,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so that those people who do not have the diagnosis

136
0:08:03.107,000 --> 0:08:06,000
might know and might have a constant reminder

137
0:08:07.068,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that it is alright to engage with people like us,

138
0:08:10.272,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that as long as they pull down the walls of stigma and exclusion,

139
0:08:15.856,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that we, just like them,

140
0:08:18.097,000 --> 0:08:21,000
can be able to take anything life throws at us.

141
0:08:21.801,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Thank you.

142
0:08:23.008,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I am the daughter of a forger,

3
0:00:19.176,000 --> 0:00:2,000
not just any forger ...

4
0:00:21.121,000 --> 0:00:23,000
When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."

5
0:00:24.038,000 --> 0:00:27,000
You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."

6
0:00:27.56,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My father is no such man.

7
0:00:29.872,000 --> 0:00:3,000
For 30 years of his life,

8
0:00:31.06,000 --> 0:00:33,000
he made false papers --

9
0:00:33.762,000 --> 0:00:34,000
never for himself, always for other people,

10
0:00:35.707,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.

11
0:00:39.596,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Let me introduce him.

12
0:00:41.76,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Here is my father at age 19.

13
0:00:44.76,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It all began for him during World War II,

14
0:00:48.76,000 --> 0:00:5,000
when at age 17 he found himself thrust

15
0:00:50.76,000 --> 0:00:51,000
into a forged documents workshop.

16
0:00:52.46,000 --> 0:00:56,000
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.

17
0:00:56.96,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And it's not a banal story --

18
0:00:58.76,000 --> 0:01:01,000
after the liberation he continued

19
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to make false papers until the '70s.

20
0:01:04.86,000 --> 0:01:05,000
When I was a child

21
0:01:06.51,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I knew nothing about this, of course.

22
0:01:08.658,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is me in the middle making faces.

23
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I grew up in the Paris suburbs

24
0:01:13.492,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and I was the youngest of three children.

25
0:01:17.381,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I had a "normal" dad like everybody else,

26
0:01:20.271,000 --> 0:01:21,000
apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...

27
0:01:22.216,000 --> 0:01:25,000
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.

28
0:01:26.105,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,

29
0:01:29.06,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.

30
0:01:32.66,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And, of course, he never talked about his past life

31
0:01:34.96,000 --> 0:01:36,000
when he was a forger.

32
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about,

33
0:01:39.719,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that perhaps could have led me suspect something.

34
0:01:42.636,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was in high school and got a bad grade,

35
0:01:45.553,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a rare event for me,

36
0:01:47.498,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so I decided to hide it from my parents.

37
0:01:50.443,000 --> 0:01:53,000
In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.

38
0:01:54.332,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I started working on my mother's signature,

39
0:01:57.46,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.

40
0:02:00.167,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So, I got working. I took some sheets of paper

41
0:02:03.084,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and started practicing, practicing, practicing,

42
0:02:06.002,000 --> 0:02:07,000
until I reached what I thought was a steady hand,

43
0:02:07.946,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and went into action.

44
0:02:09.891,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Later, while checking my school bag,

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.

46
0:02:15.752,000 --> 0:02:16,000
She yelled at me like she never had before.

47
0:02:17.697,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,

48
0:02:20.614,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and then I waited for my father to come back from work

49
0:02:23.559,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with, one could say, much apprehension.

50
0:02:25.449,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I heard him come in.

51
0:02:27.421,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room,

52
0:02:31.338,000 --> 0:02:32,000
sat on the corner of the bed,

53
0:02:33.283,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,

54
0:02:36.173,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and when he saw me he started laughing.

55
0:02:39.09,000 --> 0:02:41,000
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.

56
0:02:42.007,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"

57
0:02:46.36,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Indeed, it's rather small.

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I was born in Algeria.

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid"

60
0:02:57.565,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and that means "fighter."

61
0:02:58.76,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,

62
0:03:03.344,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,

63
0:03:06.261,000 --> 0:03:08,000
especially that he had "done" World War II,

64
0:03:09.179,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that he had "done" the Algerian war.

65
0:03:11.123,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.

66
0:03:14.041,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,

67
0:03:17.958,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.

68
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And indeed, I was very far from the mark.

69
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
One day, while my father was working on a file

70
0:03:26.46,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for us to obtain French nationality,

71
0:03:29.626,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I happened to see some documents

72
0:03:31.571,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that caught my attention.

73
0:03:33.988,000 --> 0:03:34,000
These are real!

74
0:03:35.66,000 --> 0:03:37,000
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.

75
0:03:38.378,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But the document I happened to see

76
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that would help us build a case for the authorities

77
0:03:42.267,000 --> 0:03:44,000
was a document from the army

78
0:03:44.96,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that thanked my father for his work

79
0:03:48.129,000 --> 0:03:49,000
on behalf of the secret services.

80
0:03:50.048,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!"

81
0:03:52.965,000 --> 0:03:53,000
My father, a secret agent?

82
0:03:54.66,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It was very James Bond.

83
0:03:56.826,000 --> 0:04:,000
I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.

84
0:04:01.715,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And later, I told myself that

85
0:04:04.66,000 --> 0:04:06,000
one day I would have to question him.

86
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And then I became a mother and had a son,

87
0:04:09.411,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us.

88
0:04:12.56,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I had become a mother

89
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and he was celebrating his 77th birthday,

90
0:04:16.56,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and suddenly I was very, very afraid.

91
0:04:18.86,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I feared he'd go

92
0:04:21.108,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and take his silences with him,

93
0:04:23.053,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and take his secrets with him.

94
0:04:24.997,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I managed to convince him that it was important for us,

95
0:04:27.36,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but possibly also for other people

96
0:04:28.887,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that he shared his story.

97
0:04:30.832,000 --> 0:04:31,000
He decided to tell it to me

98
0:04:32.776,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I made a book,

99
0:04:34.06,000 --> 0:04:36,000
from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.

100
0:04:36.666,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.

101
0:04:39.583,000 --> 0:04:4,000
His parents were of Russian descent.

102
0:04:41.528,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.

103
0:04:45.446,000 --> 0:04:49,000
His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.

104
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So at the age of 14 my father had to work.

105
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And with his only diploma,

106
0:04:54.46,000 --> 0:04:55,000
his primary education certificate,

107
0:04:55.76,000 --> 0:04:57,000
he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.

108
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That's where he discovered something totally magical,

109
0:05:01.46,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and when he talks about it, it's fascinating --

110
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.

111
0:05:06.06,000 --> 0:05:07,000
During that time the war was happening

112
0:05:07.86,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and his mother was killed when he was 15.

113
0:05:10.728,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This coincided with the time when

114
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
he threw himself body and soul into chemistry

115
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because it was the only consolation for his sadness.

116
0:05:17.96,000 --> 0:05:2,000
All day he would ask many questions to his boss

117
0:05:21.424,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,

118
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and at night, when no one was looking,

119
0:05:25.76,000 --> 0:05:27,000
he'd put his experience to practice.

120
0:05:27.96,000 --> 0:05:32,000
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.

121
0:05:33.06,000 --> 0:05:35,000
All this to tell you

122
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that if my father became a forger, actually,

123
0:05:37.76,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it was almost by accident.

124
0:05:39.76,000 --> 0:05:41,000
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.

125
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp

126
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.

127
0:05:48.46,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Well, they were out,

128
0:05:49.596,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.

129
0:05:52.513,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.

130
0:05:55.76,000 --> 0:05:58,000
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law

131
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that although he was being persecuted,

132
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
he'd never thought of false papers.

133
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.

134
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
In those times documents had hard covers,

135
0:06:08.76,000 --> 0:06:09,000
they were filled in by hand,

136
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they stated your job.

137
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In order to survive, he needed

138
0:06:15.46,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to be working. He asked the man

139
0:06:17.46,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to write "dyer."

140
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.

141
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?

142
0:06:25.46,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Of course he knew.

143
0:06:27.76,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And suddenly the man started explaining that

144
0:06:29.56,000 --> 0:06:31,000
actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:

145
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
even the top experts

146
0:06:34.86,000 --> 0:06:37,000
could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,"

147
0:06:38.46,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the "Waterman" blue ink.

148
0:06:40.66,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly

149
0:06:44.56,000 --> 0:06:45,000
how to bleach it.

150
0:06:45.76,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17

151
0:06:48.96,000 --> 0:06:51,000
who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.

152
0:06:52.76,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something

153
0:06:55.76,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:

154
0:06:58.41,000 --> 0:07:,000
the so-called "correction pen."

155
0:07:01.76,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Applause)

156
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But it was only the beginning.

157
0:07:08.66,000 --> 0:07:09,000
That's my father.

158
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
As soon as he got to the lab,

159
0:07:11.76,000 --> 0:07:12,000
even though he was the youngest,

160
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.

161
0:07:16.06,000 --> 0:07:18,000
All the movements stopped at falsifying.

162
0:07:18.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But demand was ever-growing

163
0:07:21.56,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.

164
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.

165
0:07:25.66,000 --> 0:07:27,000
He started a press. He started photoengraving.

166
0:07:28.46,000 --> 0:07:29,000
He started making rubber stamps.

167
0:07:30.06,000 --> 0:07:31,000
He started inventing all kind of things --

168
0:07:31.86,000 --> 0:07:34,000
with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.

169
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Anyway, he had to do all this

170
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because he was completely obsessed with output.

171
0:07:40.06,000 --> 0:07:42,000
He had made a simple calculation:

172
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.

173
0:07:45.36,000 --> 0:07:49,000
If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.

174
0:07:49.76,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This sense of

175
0:07:52.76,000 --> 0:07:55,000
responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 --

176
0:07:55.96,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and also his guilt for being a survivor,

177
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:01,000
since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not --

178
0:08:02.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
stayed with him all his life.

179
0:08:04.813,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,

180
0:08:07.731,000 --> 0:08:09,000
he continued to make false papers

181
0:08:10.36,000 --> 0:08:12,000
at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.

182
0:08:12.66,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I'd like to talk about those sacrifices,

183
0:08:13.56,000 --> 0:08:14,000
because there were many.

184
0:08:15.46,000 --> 0:08:17,000
There were obviously financial sacrifices

185
0:08:17.96,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because he always refused to be paid.

186
0:08:19.76,000 --> 0:08:21,000
To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.

187
0:08:22.46,000 --> 0:08:23,000
If he had accepted payment,

188
0:08:24.06,000 --> 0:08:25,000
he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no"

189
0:08:25.86,000 --> 0:08:27,000
depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.

190
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So he was a photographer by day,

191
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and a forger by night for 30 years.

192
0:08:31.76,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He was broke all of the time.

193
0:08:33.76,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Then there were the emotional sacrifices:

194
0:08:36.76,000 --> 0:08:39,000
How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?

195
0:08:39.76,000 --> 0:08:43,000
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?

196
0:08:43.96,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice

197
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
involving his family that I understood much later.

198
0:08:50.66,000 --> 0:08:53,000
One day my father introduced me to my sister.

199
0:08:53.76,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He also explained to me that I had a brother, too,

200
0:08:57.76,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,

201
0:09:03.76,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and they were 30 years older than me.

202
0:09:05.56,000 --> 0:09:1,000
They are both in their sixties now.

203
0:09:11.06,000 --> 0:09:13,000
In order to write the book,

204
0:09:13.76,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,

205
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
who was the father she had known.

206
0:09:18.76,000 --> 0:09:22,000
She explained that the father that she'd had

207
0:09:22.86,000 --> 0:09:26,000
would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.

208
0:09:27.06,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They would get all dressed up and wait for him,

209
0:09:29.66,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but he would almost never come.

210
0:09:31.46,000 --> 0:09:34,000
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.

211
0:09:34.76,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And then he would not come.

212
0:09:36.76,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Then one day he totally disappeared.

213
0:09:40.06,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Time passed,

214
0:09:41.46,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and they thought he had surely forgotten them,

215
0:09:44.66,000 --> 0:09:45,000
at first.

216
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Then as time passed,

217
0:09:47.76,000 --> 0:09:49,000
at the end of almost two years, they thought,

218
0:09:49.76,000 --> 0:09:52,000
"Well, perhaps our father has died."

219
0:09:52.96,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And then I understood

220
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that asking my father so many questions

221
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about

222
0:10:00.96,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because it was painful.

223
0:10:02.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,

224
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
orphaned,

225
0:10:08.96,000 --> 0:10:1,000
my father was making false papers.

226
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.

227
0:10:14.76,000 --> 0:10:15,000
After the liberation he made false papers

228
0:10:16.56,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine

229
0:10:19.46,000 --> 0:10:2,000
before the creation of Israel.

230
0:10:21.36,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,

231
0:10:23.76,000 --> 0:10:26,000
he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.

232
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
After the Algerian war,

233
0:10:29.86,000 --> 0:10:31,000
at the heart of the international resistance movements,

234
0:10:32.46,000 --> 0:10:33,000
his name circulated

235
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and the whole world came knocking at his door.

236
0:10:36.46,000 --> 0:10:39,000
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:

237
0:10:39.96,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.

238
0:10:42.96,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.

239
0:10:47.46,000 --> 0:10:5,000
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.

240
0:10:50.96,000 --> 0:10:51,000
There was also Latin America.

241
0:10:52.76,000 --> 0:10:54,000
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships

242
0:10:55.46,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in the Dominican Republic, Haiti,

243
0:10:57.36,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,

244
0:11:03.46,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.

245
0:11:09.06,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Then there was the Vietnam War.

246
0:11:10.76,000 --> 0:11:12,000
My father made false papers for the American deserters

247
0:11:13.06,000 --> 0:11:16,000
who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.

248
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Europe was not spared either.

249
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
My father made false papers for the dissidents

250
0:11:20.402,000 --> 0:11:23,000
against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,

251
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,

252
0:11:29.153,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and even in France.

253
0:11:30.86,000 --> 0:11:33,000
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.

254
0:11:34.015,000 --> 0:11:36,000
My father watched, benevolently, of course,

255
0:11:36.66,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the demonstrations of the month of May,

256
0:11:39.46,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time

257
0:11:41.76,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because he had over 15 countries to serve.

258
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Once, though, he agreed to make false papers

259
0:11:47.629,000 --> 0:11:48,000
for someone you might recognize.

260
0:11:49.573,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

261
0:11:52.49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
He was much younger in those days,

262
0:11:54.11,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and my father agreed to make false papers

263
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.

264
0:11:59.297,000 --> 0:12:03,000
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant

265
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.

266
0:12:07.76,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But, he agreed to do it,

267
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,

268
0:12:12.66,000 --> 0:12:14,000
just because

269
0:12:14.855,000 --> 0:12:15,000
it was a good opportunity

270
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to mock the authorities,

271
0:12:18.745,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders --

272
0:12:21.76,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and that ideas have no borders.

273
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
All my childhood,

274
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,

275
0:12:32.358,000 --> 0:12:35,000
my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes

276
0:12:36.248,000 --> 0:12:38,000
with unshakeable utopias

277
0:12:39.165,000 --> 0:12:41,000
who managed to make miracles.

278
0:12:42.082,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And those heroes did not need an army behind them.

279
0:12:46.06,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them,

280
0:12:48.56,000 --> 0:12:51,000
except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.

281
0:12:51.806,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I understood much later

282
0:12:53.06,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.

283
0:12:56.668,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,

284
0:12:59.585,000 --> 0:13:,000
he ever had any regrets.

285
0:13:01.53,000 --> 0:13:02,000
He said no.

286
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
He told me that he would have been unable

287
0:13:05.42,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.

288
0:13:08.337,000 --> 0:13:11,000
He was persuaded, and he's still convinced

289
0:13:11.36,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that another world is possible --

290
0:13:13.56,000 --> 0:13:16,000
a world where no one would ever need a forger.

291
0:13:16.56,000 --> 0:13:18,000
He's still dreaming about it.

292
0:13:18.56,000 --> 0:13:19,000
My father

293
0:13:20.005,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is here in the room today.

294
0:13:21.76,000 --> 0:13:25,000
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.

295
0:13:25.84,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Applause)

296
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Thank you.

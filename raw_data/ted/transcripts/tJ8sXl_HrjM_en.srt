1
0:00:12.648,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As an Arab female photographer,

2
0:00:14.785,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences.

3
0:00:19.917,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The passion I developed for knowledge,

4
0:00:21.849,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which allowed me to break barriers towards a better life

5
0:00:25.25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
was the motivation for my project I Read I Write.

6
0:00:29.599,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Pushed by my own experience,

7
0:00:31.331,000 --> 0:00:34,000
as I was not allowed initially to pursue my higher education,

8
0:00:35.306,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I decided to explore and document stories of other women

9
0:00:39.483,000 --> 0:00:41,000
who changed their lives through education,

10
0:00:42.316,000 --> 0:00:45,000
while exposing and questioning the barriers they face.

11
0:00:46.147,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I covered a range of topics that concern women's education,

12
0:00:49.833,000 --> 0:00:51,000
keeping in mind the differences among Arab countries

13
0:00:52.451,000 --> 0:00:55,000
due to economic and social factors.

14
0:00:55.569,000 --> 0:00:59,000
These issues include female illiteracy, which is quite high in the region;

15
0:00:59.734,000 --> 0:01:03,000
educational reforms; programs for dropout students;

16
0:01:04.141,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and political activism among university students.

17
0:01:08.11,000 --> 0:01:09,000
As I started this work,

18
0:01:09.512,000 --> 0:01:12,000
it was not always easy to convince the women to participate.

19
0:01:13.072,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Only after explaining to them

20
0:01:14.987,000 --> 0:01:16,000
how their stories might influence other women's lives,

21
0:01:17.841,000 --> 0:01:21,000
how they would become role models for their own community, did some agree.

22
0:01:22.647,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Seeking a collaborative and reflexive approach,

23
0:01:25.828,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I asked them to write their own words and ideas

24
0:01:29.032,000 --> 0:01:31,000
on prints of their own images.

25
0:01:31.261,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Those images were then shared in some of the classrooms,

26
0:01:34.071,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and worked to inspire and motivate other women

27
0:01:37.321,000 --> 0:01:41,000
going through similar educations and situations.

28
0:01:42.273,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Aisha, a teacher from Yemen, wrote,

29
0:01:45.1,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"I sought education in order to be independent

30
0:01:48.234,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and to not count on men with everything."

31
0:01:51.663,000 --> 0:01:54,000
One of my first subjects was Umm El-Saad from Egypt.

32
0:01:55.358,000 --> 0:01:58,000
When we first met, she was barely able to write her name.

33
0:01:58.799,000 --> 0:02:,000
She was attending a nine-month literacy program

34
0:02:01.051,000 --> 0:02:03,000
run by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs.

35
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Months later, she was joking that her husband

36
0:02:06.229,000 --> 0:02:08,000
had threatened to pull her out of the classes,

37
0:02:08.76,000 --> 0:02:1,000
as he found out that his now literate wife

38
0:02:10.989,000 --> 0:02:12,000
was going through his phone text messages.

39
0:02:13.777,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:15.237,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Naughty Umm El-Saad.

41
0:02:16.985,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Of course, that's not why Umm El-Saad joined the program.

42
0:02:21.139,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I saw how she was longing to gain control over her simple daily routines,

43
0:02:25.855,000 --> 0:02:26,000
small details that we take for granted,

44
0:02:27.764,000 --> 0:02:31,000
from counting money at the market to helping her kids in homework.

45
0:02:31.962,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Despite her poverty and her community's mindset,

46
0:02:34.957,000 --> 0:02:36,000
which belittles women's education,

47
0:02:37.042,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Umm El-Saad, along with her Egyptian classmates,

48
0:02:39.768,000 --> 0:02:42,000
was eager to learn how to read and write.

49
0:02:44.175,000 --> 0:02:46,000
In Tunisia, I met Asma,

50
0:02:46.729,000 --> 0:02:49,000
one of the four activist women I interviewed.

51
0:02:49.771,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The secular bioengineering student is quite active on social media.

52
0:02:54.235,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Regarding her country, which treasured what has been called the Arab Spring,

53
0:02:59.917,000 --> 0:03:01,000
she said, "I've always dreamt of discovering a new bacteria.

54
0:03:02.843,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now, after the revolution, we have a new one every single day."

55
0:03:06.603,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Asma was referring to the rise of religious fundamentalism in the region,

56
0:03:11.179,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which is another obstacle to women in particular.

57
0:03:15.363,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Out of all the women I met, Fayza from Yemen affected me the most.

58
0:03:20.229,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Fayza was forced to drop out of school at the age of eight when she was married.

59
0:03:25.114,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That marriage lasted for a year.

60
0:03:28.361,000 --> 0:03:31,000
At 14, she became the third wife of a 60-year-old man,

61
0:03:32.229,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and by the time she was 18, she was a divorced mother of three.

62
0:03:36.919,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Despite her poverty,

63
0:03:39.39,000 --> 0:03:44,000
despite her social status as a divorcée in an ultra-conservative society,

64
0:03:44.66,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and despite the opposition of her parents to her going back to school,

65
0:03:48.538,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Fayza knew that her only way to control her life was through education.

66
0:03:53.71,000 --> 0:03:54,000
She is now 26.

67
0:03:55.48,000 --> 0:03:57,000
She received a grant from a local NGO

68
0:03:57.64,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to fund her business studies at the university.

69
0:04:00.519,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Her goal is to find a job, rent a place to live in,

70
0:04:03.979,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and bring her kids back with her.

71
0:04:07.158,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The Arab states are going through tremendous change,

72
0:04:11.455,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and the struggles women face are overwhelming.

73
0:04:14.216,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Just like the women I photographed,

74
0:04:16.458,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I had to overcome many barriers to becoming the photographer I am today,

75
0:04:20.89,000 --> 0:04:23,000
many people along the way telling me what I can and cannot do.

76
0:04:25.387,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Umm El-Saad, Asma and Fayza, and many women across the Arab world,

77
0:04:30.693,000 --> 0:04:33,000
show that it is possible to overcome barriers to education,

78
0:04:34.651,000 --> 0:04:37,000
which they know is the best means to a better future.

79
0:04:38.83,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And here I would like to end with a quote by Yasmine,

80
0:04:42.197,000 --> 0:04:45,000
one of the four activist women I interviewed in Tunisia.

81
0:04:45.463,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Yasmine wrote,

82
0:04:47.034,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"Question your convictions.

83
0:04:49.414,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Be who you to want to be, not who they want you to be.

84
0:04:53.156,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Don't accept their enslavement, for your mother birthed you free."

85
0:04:56.732,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Thank you.

86
0:04:58.961,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Applause)

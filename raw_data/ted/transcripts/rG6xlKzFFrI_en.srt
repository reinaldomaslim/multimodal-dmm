1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I thought, "I will talk about death."

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Seemed to be the passion today.

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Actually, it's not about death.

4
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is,

5
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's what I want to talk about.

7
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that appeared soon after he died, saying,

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED,

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling

12
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
his journey through cancer.

13
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting

14
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
through letters and a notebook.

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick,

16
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.

17
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses,

18
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and gentle suggestions for improvement,

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.

20
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Handwriting is a disappearing art.

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'm all for email and thinking while typing,

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but why give up old habits for new?

24
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
There are times when I want to trade all those years

26
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him,

27
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and trade all those years for one hug.

28
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But too late.

29
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them,

30
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
and the paper that touched his hand is in mine,

31
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and I feel connected to him.

32
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So maybe we all need to leave our children

33
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with a value legacy, and not a financial one.

34
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
A value for things with a personal touch --

35
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
an autographed book, a soul-searching letter.

36
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience

37
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper --

38
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter

39
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution

40
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
where our children may go to penmanship classes.

41
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So what do I plan to leave for my son?

42
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I collect autographed books, and those of you authors

43
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in the audience know I hound you for them --

44
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and CDs too, Tracy.

45
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I plan to publish my own notebook.

46
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire,

47
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.

48
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I have no idea how I'm going to do it,

49
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine

50
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
into a book, and leave that published book for my son.

51
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote

52
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
at my father's cremation.

53
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar,

54
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.

55
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I took it out for the first time to come here.

56
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle,

57
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
boundless energy confined in the bottle,

58
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
forcing me to deal with reality,

59
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
forcing me to deal with being grown up.

60
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong,

61
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded

62
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and suffocated by these raging emotional waters,

63
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge

64
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing

65
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
just as you taught me.

66
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair,

67
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity,

68
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to live again and to love again."

69
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Thank you.

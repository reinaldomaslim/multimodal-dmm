Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.754,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Growing up in Taiwan

3
0:00:14.81,000 --> 0:00:15,000
as the daughter of a calligrapher,

4
0:00:16.422,000 --> 0:00:18,000
one of my most treasured memories

5
0:00:18.79,000 --> 0:00:21,000
was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape

6
0:00:21.883,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and the form of Chinese characters.

7
0:00:24.516,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Ever since then, I was fascinated

8
0:00:27.023,000 --> 0:00:29,000
by this incredible language.

9
0:00:29.685,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But to an outsider, it seems to be

10
0:00:32.42,000 --> 0:00:35,000
as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.

11
0:00:35.929,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Over the past few years, I've been wondering

12
0:00:38.304,000 --> 0:00:4,000
if I can break down this wall,

13
0:00:40.356,000 --> 0:00:42,000
so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate

14
0:00:42.95,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.

15
0:00:46.858,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I started thinking about how a new, fast method

16
0:00:51.17,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of learning Chinese might be useful.

17
0:00:54.018,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw

18
0:00:58.004,000 --> 0:01:01,000
every single stroke for each character

19
0:01:01.009,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in the correct sequence.

20
0:01:03.553,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I learned new characters every day

21
0:01:05.61,000 --> 0:01:07,000
during the course of the next 15 years.

22
0:01:08.337,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Since we only have five minutes,

23
0:01:10.457,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.

24
0:01:14.092,000 --> 0:01:17,000
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.

25
0:01:17.617,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.

26
0:01:22.729,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend

27
0:01:26.745,000 --> 0:01:28,000
40 percent of basic literature --

28
0:01:29.641,000 --> 0:01:31,000
enough to read road signs, restaurant menus,

29
0:01:32.517,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to understand the basic idea of the web pages

30
0:01:35.521,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or the newspapers.

31
0:01:37.46,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Today I'm going to start with eight

32
0:01:39.659,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to show you how the method works.

33
0:01:41.551,000 --> 0:01:42,000
You are ready?

34
0:01:43.472,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Open your mouth as wide as possible

35
0:01:46.155,000 --> 0:01:48,000
until it's square.

36
0:01:48.201,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You get a mouth.

37
0:01:50.883,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is a person going for a walk.

38
0:01:53.971,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Person.

39
0:01:57.102,000 --> 0:01:59,000
If the shape of the fire is a person

40
0:01:59.811,000 --> 0:02:01,000
with two arms on both sides,

41
0:02:02.081,000 --> 0:02:04,000
as if she was yelling frantically,

42
0:02:04.251,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"Help! I'm on fire!" --

43
0:02:07.804,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,

44
0:02:11.971,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.

45
0:02:15.784,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This is a tree.

46
0:02:18.043,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Tree.

47
0:02:20.141,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is a mountain.

48
0:02:24.566,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The sun.

49
0:02:29.458,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The moon.

50
0:02:34.112,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The symbol of the door

51
0:02:36.087,000 --> 0:02:41,000
looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.

52
0:02:41.793,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I call these eight characters radicals.

53
0:02:45.531,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They are the building blocks

54
0:02:47.297,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for you to create lots more characters.

55
0:02:51.427,000 --> 0:02:52,000
A person.

56
0:02:53.165,000 --> 0:02:57,000
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow."

57
0:02:57.433,000 --> 0:02:59,000
As the old saying goes,

58
0:02:59.561,000 --> 0:03:02,000
two is company, three is a crowd.

59
0:03:03.287,000 --> 0:03:05,000
If a person stretched their arms wide,

60
0:03:06.202,000 --> 0:03:1,000
this person is saying, "It was this big."

61
0:03:10.849,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.

62
0:03:14.697,000 --> 0:03:19,000
He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.

63
0:03:20.543,000 --> 0:03:23,000
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.

64
0:03:24.037,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Three trees together, we create the forest.

65
0:03:27.593,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.

66
0:03:31.665,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter)

67
0:03:35.8,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Easy to remember,

68
0:03:37.881,000 --> 0:03:41,000
since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.

69
0:03:42.823,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Remember fire?

70
0:03:44.865,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Two fires together, I get really hot.

71
0:03:47.526,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.

72
0:03:50.385,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.

73
0:03:54.986,000 --> 0:03:57,000
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.

74
0:03:58.078,000 --> 0:04:,000
Two suns together, prosperous.

75
0:04:00.257,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Three together, that's sparkles.

76
0:04:02.615,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Put the sun and the moon shining together,

77
0:04:04.636,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it's brightness.

78
0:04:05.944,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.

79
0:04:10.169,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.

80
0:04:14.652,000 --> 0:04:17,000
A door. Put a plank inside the door,

81
0:04:17.755,000 --> 0:04:19,000
it's a door bolt.

82
0:04:19.812,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.

83
0:04:22.776,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Knock knock. Is anyone home?

84
0:04:26.107,000 --> 0:04:28,000
This person is sneaking out of a door,

85
0:04:28.995,000 --> 0:04:3,000
escaping, evading.

86
0:04:31.827,000 --> 0:04:33,000
On the left, we have a woman.

87
0:04:33.98,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Two women together, they have an argument.

88
0:04:36.142,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:38.275,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.

90
0:04:44.793,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So we have gone through almost 30 characters.

91
0:04:48.302,000 --> 0:04:51,000
By using this method, the first eight radicals

92
0:04:51.639,000 --> 0:04:53,000
will allow you to build 32.

93
0:04:53.64,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The next group of eight characters

94
0:04:55.403,000 --> 0:04:57,000
will build an extra 32.

95
0:04:57.595,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So with very little effort,

96
0:04:59.897,000 --> 0:05:01,000
you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,

97
0:05:02.163,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.

98
0:05:04.715,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.

99
0:05:08.262,000 --> 0:05:1,000
For example, the mountain and the fire together,

100
0:05:10.959,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.

101
0:05:13.887,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.

102
0:05:17.207,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This is a sun placed with the origin,

103
0:05:20.625,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because Japan lies to the east of China.

104
0:05:23.752,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.

105
0:05:27.642,000 --> 0:05:29,000
A person behind Japan, what do we get?

106
0:05:30.6,000 --> 0:05:33,000
A Japanese person.

107
0:05:33.702,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The character on the left is two mountains

108
0:05:36.503,000 --> 0:05:38,000
stacked on top of each other.

109
0:05:38.61,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In ancient China, that means in exile,

110
0:05:41.827,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies

111
0:05:44.265,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in exile beyond mountains.

112
0:05:46.636,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.

113
0:05:51.647,000 --> 0:05:53,000
A mouth which tells you where to get out

114
0:05:54.218,000 --> 0:05:55,000
is an exit.

115
0:05:56.146,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking

116
0:05:59.787,000 --> 0:06:,000
and get off of the stage. Thank you.

117
0:06:01.67,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

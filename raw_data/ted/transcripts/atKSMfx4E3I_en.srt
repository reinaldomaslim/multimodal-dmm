1
0:00:12.878,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Like many of you, I'm often frustrated by the democratic process.

2
0:00:17.005,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's messy, it's complicated,

3
0:00:19.341,000 --> 0:00:2,000
it's often inefficient.

4
0:00:21.654,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Our political leaders feel disconnected

5
0:00:24.265,000 --> 0:00:25,000
from the concerns of ordinary people.

6
0:00:27.179,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Many feel that voting every few years

7
0:00:29.623,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for leaders disconnected from their daily challenges

8
0:00:32.147,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is pointless.

9
0:00:35.427,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But before we reject democracy,

10
0:00:38.626,000 --> 0:00:39,000
let's imagine what it could be.

11
0:00:41.221,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I believe that African activists are redefining democracy

12
0:00:45.059,000 --> 0:00:47,000
by putting protest at its center,

13
0:00:47.769,000 --> 0:00:49,000
what I refer to as "protest democracy."

14
0:00:53.219,000 --> 0:00:56,000
International organizations and academic experts

15
0:00:56.656,000 --> 0:01:,000
define democracy as regular, multiparty electoral competition.

16
0:01:03.049,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But democracy should not only be about elites competing at the ballot box.

17
0:01:07.739,000 --> 0:01:08,000
For it to have meaning,

18
0:01:09.833,000 --> 0:01:11,000
it's something we must engage in every day.

19
0:01:13.906,000 --> 0:01:14,000
When I say "protest democracy,"

20
0:01:16.579,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'm challenging how we think about democratic action.

21
0:01:21.647,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Viewing democracy as only elections is no longer adequate

22
0:01:25.826,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and threatens democracy itself.

23
0:01:29.912,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So we must protest democracy to give it a renewed meaning.

24
0:01:36.425,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What would this look like?

25
0:01:39.499,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We need to turn to African societies,

26
0:01:41.976,000 --> 0:01:44,000
where ordinary people are increasingly taking to the streets

27
0:01:45.407,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to transform their lives.

28
0:01:47.102,000 --> 0:01:5,000
African social movements have often been at the forefront

29
0:01:50.674,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of conceptualizing democracy in this way.

30
0:01:53.268,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This may come as a surprise to those of who think

31
0:01:55.717,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that the only way Africans engage in politics

32
0:01:58.267,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is through the barrel of the gun.

33
0:02:01.984,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But increasingly, young people are taking to the streets

34
0:02:04.641,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and abandoning organized violence

35
0:02:07.139,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in favor of more effective nonviolent action.

36
0:02:12.575,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I've spent much of the past two decades talking to African activists,

37
0:02:15.912,000 --> 0:02:16,000
both violent and nonviolent.

38
0:02:19.372,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Across Africa, young people are rising up

39
0:02:21.915,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to challenge almost every type of regime known to humanity.

40
0:02:25.444,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This is my friend Thiat.

41
0:02:27.787,000 --> 0:02:28,000
He's a rapper from Senegal.

42
0:02:29.56,000 --> 0:02:3,000
He led a large movement in Senegal

43
0:02:31.248,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that was successful in preventing the president from stealing a third term.

44
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
From Morocco to Lesotho,

45
0:02:37.38,000 --> 0:02:39,000
young people are rising up against entrenched monarchies:

46
0:02:41.177,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in Egypt and Sudan,

47
0:02:43.577,000 --> 0:02:44,000
against brutal dictatorships;

48
0:02:46.303,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in Uganda and Ethiopia,

49
0:02:48.909,000 --> 0:02:5,000
against powerful militarized states

50
0:02:51.687,000 --> 0:02:52,000
with quasi-democratic veneers;

51
0:02:56.053,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in South Africa, where this image was taken,

52
0:02:58.692,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and Burundi,

53
0:03:00.172,000 --> 0:03:02,000
against democratically elected leaders

54
0:03:02.278,000 --> 0:03:05,000
who have done little to improve the conditions for ordinary people.

55
0:03:06.548,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Across the continent, protest is not exceptional,

56
0:03:09.449,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but a normal part of life.

57
0:03:12.293,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Africans use protests to challenge both dictators

58
0:03:15.964,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as well as power cuts.

59
0:03:19.257,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In a way, Africans are protesting democracy itself,

60
0:03:23.048,000 --> 0:03:25,000
enriching its possibilities for us all.

61
0:03:26.306,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There have been two major waves of African protest,

62
0:03:28.876,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and we are currently living through the third,

63
0:03:31.088,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which began around 2005.

64
0:03:32.743,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It includes the so-called Arab Spring,

65
0:03:35.759,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which took place mostly on the continent.

66
0:03:39.032,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The first wave took place in the 1940s and 1950s

67
0:03:42.21,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and led to Africa's decolonization.

68
0:03:45.023,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Kwame Nkrumah led a broad coalition in Ghana

69
0:03:49.258,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that overthrew British rule,

70
0:03:51.147,000 --> 0:03:53,000
providing a template for nonviolent movements globally.

71
0:03:55.769,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The second wave took place in the 1980s and 1990s

72
0:03:59.016,000 --> 0:04:01,000
against austerity measures that imposed harsh conditions

73
0:04:01.719,000 --> 0:04:02,000
on African economies.

74
0:04:04.129,000 --> 0:04:07,000
These protests led to the overthrow of autocratic regimes

75
0:04:07.491,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and led to the introduction

76
0:04:08.976,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of multiparty elections across the continent.

77
0:04:13.674,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The ongoing third wave is correcting the shortcomings of the earlier two.

78
0:04:19.75,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If the first wave brought liberation but not democracy,

79
0:04:24.198,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and the second, elections but only for the elites,

80
0:04:28.398,000 --> 0:04:29,000
then it is the third wave

81
0:04:29.849,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that is most concerned with transforming democracy

82
0:04:32.539,000 --> 0:04:33,000
into the rule of the people.

83
0:04:35.678,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It includes movements like Y'en a Marre in Senegal,

84
0:04:39.07,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Le Balai Citoyen in Burkina Faso,

85
0:04:41.606,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Tajamuka in Zimbabwe,

86
0:04:43.937,000 --> 0:04:46,000
LUCHA and Filimbi in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

87
0:04:47.725,000 --> 0:04:51,000
movements that work outside of more conventional nongovernmental organizations

88
0:04:52.644,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and political parties

89
0:04:53.993,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to challenge the economic and political system itself,

90
0:04:57.323,000 --> 0:04:58,000
often at great risk.

91
0:04:59.402,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Brilliant young activists like LUCHA's Fred Bauma

92
0:05:02.786,000 --> 0:05:04,000
have been detained and tortured,

93
0:05:05.341,000 --> 0:05:08,000
often with little to no outcry from the international community.

94
0:05:09.018,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The list goes on, as you can see from some of the data we collected.

95
0:05:12.395,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There have been large popular protests

96
0:05:14.761,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in over 40 African countries since 2005,

97
0:05:18.5,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and if you look, you'll recognize that in 2011,

98
0:05:21.379,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the year of the so-called Arab Spring,

99
0:05:23.311,000 --> 0:05:25,000
was actually the spike of this broader wave.

100
0:05:26.237,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Contrary to popular belief,

101
0:05:27.904,000 --> 0:05:29,000
many of these protests have been successful.

102
0:05:30.874,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We know of the dictators falling in Tunisia and in Egypt,

103
0:05:34.702,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but popular movements have prevented presidents from stealing third terms

104
0:05:38.367,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in Senegal, in Malawi and Burkina Faso as well.

105
0:05:43.782,000 --> 0:05:45,000
What's driving this upsurge of protest?

106
0:05:46.865,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Demographically, Africa is both the youngest

107
0:05:49.34,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the fastest-growing continent,

108
0:05:51.236,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with the largest age gap between the people and their rulers.

109
0:05:55.334,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It is urbanizing at a tremendous pace.

110
0:05:58.578,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Economically, African countries have been growing for over a decade now,

111
0:06:02.585,000 --> 0:06:04,000
largely driven by investments from Asia.

112
0:06:05.864,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But little of this wealth is trickling down.

113
0:06:09.305,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Formal jobs in the industrial sector are actually decreasing,

114
0:06:13.439,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with informal labor the only option left for people to eke out a living.

115
0:06:18.942,000 --> 0:06:2,000
As a result, inequality is skyrocketing,

116
0:06:21.717,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and political leaders are increasingly disconnected

117
0:06:24.178,000 --> 0:06:26,000
from their much younger populations.

118
0:06:26.329,000 --> 0:06:28,000
For those of us from outside of Africa,

119
0:06:28.449,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we're familiar with parts of this story:

120
0:06:30.888,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a massive spike in inequality,

121
0:06:33.551,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the product of a decline in good jobs for good wages

122
0:06:36.005,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that were once considered the hallmark of an advanced society;

123
0:06:39.586,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the capture of our political parties by elites

124
0:06:42.027,000 --> 0:06:45,000
accompanied by the hollowing out of civil society

125
0:06:45.077,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that once provided a voice to ordinary people;

126
0:06:48.321,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that sinking feeling that no matter what you do,

127
0:06:51.829,000 --> 0:06:53,000
external factors related to the global economy

128
0:06:54.36,000 --> 0:06:56,000
can disrupt our lives for the worse.

129
0:06:58.706,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Our political leaders seem helpless,

130
0:07:00.679,000 --> 0:07:01,000
insisting on austerity,

131
0:07:03.02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
even as public goods diminish to levels unseen in decades.

132
0:07:06.398,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And this is when they're not succumbing to exclusionary nationalism,

133
0:07:10.748,000 --> 0:07:12,000
blaming our woes on the weak rather than the powerful.

134
0:07:15.319,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What those of us from North America and Western Europe consider to be new

135
0:07:18.842,000 --> 0:07:2,000
has been the normal condition of African life since the 1970s.

136
0:07:22.202,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So who better to learn from

137
0:07:23.85,000 --> 0:07:26,000
than those who have been engaged in resistance to these conditions

138
0:07:27.048,000 --> 0:07:28,000
for the longest period of time?

139
0:07:29.415,000 --> 0:07:31,000
What can we learn from African protest democracy?

140
0:07:32.795,000 --> 0:07:34,000
First, democracy must begin with ordinary people.

141
0:07:36.619,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Viewing democracy as only elections has led to widespread disillusionment.

142
0:07:41.724,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We must instead work to center ordinary people in democratic life.

143
0:07:45.681,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Protest provides us one way to do that.

144
0:07:48.445,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Regardless of your age, sexuality, your gender,

145
0:07:52.177,000 --> 0:07:55,000
whether you're a citizen or a non-citizen, able-bodied or disabled,

146
0:07:55.76,000 --> 0:07:56,000
anyone can participate.

147
0:07:58.524,000 --> 0:07:59,000
In contrast to elections,

148
0:07:59.912,000 --> 0:08:01,000
protests are not confined by rigid electoral cycles.

149
0:08:03.129,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They offer a much more immediate form of action

150
0:08:05.405,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in our era of instant feedback.

151
0:08:08.261,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Second, while protests may be messy,

152
0:08:11.83,000 --> 0:08:12,000
this is what makes them powerful.

153
0:08:14.532,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Protests are contentious and contested processes,

154
0:08:18.528,000 --> 0:08:2,000
defined by contingent actions,

155
0:08:21.69,000 --> 0:08:22,000
often devoid of clear messaging,

156
0:08:24.073,000 --> 0:08:26,000
characterized by incomplete organization.

157
0:08:27.756,000 --> 0:08:3,000
These dynamics are what makes it easy to dismiss protests as riots

158
0:08:31.668,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or to assume they are of limited political utility.

159
0:08:35.871,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But it also makes them easier to suppress.

160
0:08:38.612,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Too often, governments do not view protests as elementary to democracy.

161
0:08:44.229,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Instead, they violently crush social movements

162
0:08:48.371,000 --> 0:08:5,000
or work to discredit their message.

163
0:08:53.642,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Third, as I already hinted,

164
0:08:56.147,000 --> 0:08:59,000
protest is the space from which new political imaginations may emerge.

165
0:09:01.957,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Protests are about coloring outside the lines,

166
0:09:04.797,000 --> 0:09:07,000
a way for ordinary people to rewrite the rules of the game

167
0:09:08.001,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that too many feel are stacked against them.

168
0:09:11.759,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Many young people in Africa have grown up in societies

169
0:09:14.416,000 --> 0:09:16,000
where a single ruler has ruled their entire lives.

170
0:09:17.787,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Protest is the space for new possibilities to emerge,

171
0:09:20.549,000 --> 0:09:22,000
as young people begin to discover their own power.

172
0:09:24.954,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Consider the situation of my friend Linda Masarira,

173
0:09:28.206,000 --> 0:09:29,000
a single mother of five,

174
0:09:29.968,000 --> 0:09:32,000
who is leading protests against the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe.

175
0:09:34.103,000 --> 0:09:36,000
She has been beaten, arrested, harassed.

176
0:09:37.709,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But Linda perseveres, because as she told me a few months ago,

177
0:09:40.764,000 --> 0:09:42,000
protest has given her a sense of meaning and direction.

178
0:09:43.495,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And though she knows the odds against her,

179
0:09:45.863,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Linda perseveres.

180
0:09:47.789,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Like Linda and other young African activists,

181
0:09:51.392,000 --> 0:09:53,000
we all must work to redefine democracy

182
0:09:53.909,000 --> 0:09:56,000
as something more than just elections and political parties.

183
0:09:58.522,000 --> 0:10:,000
Democracy is a creative process,

184
0:10:01.363,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and protest has always been the vehicle

185
0:10:03.95,000 --> 0:10:07,000
for expanding our political imaginations beyond what we are told is possible.

186
0:10:08.124,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(In Swahili) Thank you very much.

187
0:10:09.866,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Applause)

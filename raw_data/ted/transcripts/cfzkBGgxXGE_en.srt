1
0:00:12.81,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I remember the first time that I saw people injecting drugs.

2
0:00:18.09,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I had just arrived in Vancouver to lead a research project

3
0:00:21.64,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in HIV prevention in the infamous Downtown East Side.

4
0:00:27.1,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It was in the lobby of the Portland Hotel,

5
0:00:29.65,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a supportive housing project that gave rooms

6
0:00:32.56,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to the most marginalized people in the city,

7
0:00:34.96,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the so-called "difficult to house."

8
0:00:38.8,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'll never forget the young woman standing on the stairs

9
0:00:42.214,000 --> 0:00:46,000
repeatedly jabbing herself with a needle, and screaming,

10
0:00:46.293,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"I can't find a vein,"

11
0:00:47.77,000 --> 0:00:49,000
as blood splattered on the wall.

12
0:00:52.14,000 --> 0:00:55,000
In response to the desperate state of affairs, the drug use,

13
0:00:56.1,000 --> 0:01:,000
the poverty, the violence, the soaring rates of HIV,

14
0:01:00.78,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Vancouver declared a public health emergency in 1997.

15
0:01:05.43,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This opened the door to expanding harm reduction services,

16
0:01:08.85,000 --> 0:01:09,000
distributing more needles,

17
0:01:10.53,000 --> 0:01:11,000
increasing access to methadone,

18
0:01:12.324,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and, finally, opening a supervised injection site.

19
0:01:16.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Things that make injecting drugs less hazardous.

20
0:01:20.91,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But today, 20 years later,

21
0:01:23.473,000 --> 0:01:27,000
harm reduction is still viewed as some sort of radical concept.

22
0:01:27.81,000 --> 0:01:3,000
In some places, it's still illegal to carry a clean needle.

23
0:01:31.74,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Drug users are far more likely to be arrested

24
0:01:34.501,000 --> 0:01:36,000
than to be offered methadone therapy.

25
0:01:37.44,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Recent proposals for supervised injection sites

26
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in cities like Seattle, Baltimore and New York

27
0:01:43.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
have been met with stiff opposition:

28
0:01:46.8,000 --> 0:01:5,000
opposition that goes against everything we know about addiction.

29
0:01:52.149,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Why is that?

30
0:01:53.633,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Why are we still stuck on the idea

31
0:01:56.252,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that the only option is to stop using -- that any drug use will not be tolerated?

32
0:02:03.06,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Why do we ignore countless personal stories

33
0:02:06.78,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and overwhelming scientific evidence

34
0:02:09.3,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that harm reduction works?

35
0:02:12.98,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Critics say that harm reduction doesn't stop people

36
0:02:16.79,000 --> 0:02:17,000
from using illegal drugs.

37
0:02:19.034,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Well, actually, that is the whole point.

38
0:02:21.77,000 --> 0:02:23,000
After every criminal and societal sanction

39
0:02:24.65,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that we can come up with,

40
0:02:26.396,000 --> 0:02:29,000
people still use drugs, and far too many die.

41
0:02:31.1,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Critics also say that we are giving up on people

42
0:02:33.92,000 --> 0:02:37,000
by not focusing our attention on treatment and recovery.

43
0:02:38.951,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In fact, it is just the opposite.

44
0:02:40.74,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We are not giving up on people.

45
0:02:42.241,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We know that if recovery is ever going to happen

46
0:02:44.54,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we must keep people alive.

47
0:02:46.73,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Offering someone a clean needle or a safe place to inject

48
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is the first step to treatment and recovery.

49
0:02:54.95,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Critics also claim that harm reduction

50
0:02:57.41,000 --> 0:03:,000
gives the wrong message to our children about drug users.

51
0:03:01.864,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The last time I looked, these drug users are our children.

52
0:03:06.268,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The message of harm reduction is that while drugs can hurt you,

53
0:03:10.34,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we still must reach out to people who are addicted.

54
0:03:13.25,000 --> 0:03:17,000
A needle exchange is not an advertisement for drug use.

55
0:03:17.75,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Neither is a methadone clinic or a supervised injection site.

56
0:03:21.77,000 --> 0:03:23,000
What you see there are people sick and hurting,

57
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
hardly an endorsement for drug use.

58
0:03:28.876,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Let's take supervised injection sites, for example.

59
0:03:31.92,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Probably the most misunderstood health intervention ever.

60
0:03:35.57,000 --> 0:03:37,000
All we are saying is that allowing people

61
0:03:38.27,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to inject in a clean, dry space with fresh needles,

62
0:03:42.131,000 --> 0:03:44,000
surrounded by people who care

63
0:03:44.726,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is a lot better than injecting in a dingy alley,

64
0:03:47.892,000 --> 0:03:5,000
sharing contaminated needles and hiding out from police.

65
0:03:51.47,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's better for everybody.

66
0:03:54.81,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The first supervised injection site in Vancouver was at 327 Carol Street,

67
0:04:00.794,000 --> 0:04:05,000
a narrow room with a concrete floor, a few chairs and a box of clean needles.

68
0:04:06.15,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The police would often lock it down,

69
0:04:08.46,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but somehow it always mysteriously reopened,

70
0:04:12.493,000 --> 0:04:14,000
often with the aid of a crowbar.

71
0:04:15.72,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I would go down there some evenings

72
0:04:17.49,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to provide medical care for people who were injecting drugs.

73
0:04:20.749,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I was always struck with the commitment and compassion

74
0:04:23.94,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of the people who operated and used the site.

75
0:04:27.24,000 --> 0:04:3,000
No judgment, no hassles, no fear,

76
0:04:30.45,000 --> 0:04:31,000
lots of profound conversation.

77
0:04:32.455,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I learned that despite unimaginable trauma,

78
0:04:35.82,000 --> 0:04:38,000
physical pain and mental illness,

79
0:04:38.923,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that everyone there thought that things would get better.

80
0:04:42.63,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Most were convinced that, someday, they'd stop using drugs altogether.

81
0:04:50.58,000 --> 0:04:53,000
That room was the forerunner to North America's

82
0:04:53.97,000 --> 0:04:57,000
first government-sanctioned supervised injection site, called INSITE.

83
0:04:58.53,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It opened in September of 2003 as a three-year research project.

84
0:05:03.48,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The conservative government was intent on closing it down at the end of the study.

85
0:05:08.58,000 --> 0:05:11,000
After eight years, the battle to close INSITE

86
0:05:12.45,000 --> 0:05:14,000
went all the way up to Canada's Supreme Court.

87
0:05:14.97,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It pitted the government of Canada

88
0:05:16.77,000 --> 0:05:19,000
against two people with a long history of drug use

89
0:05:20.13,000 --> 0:05:22,000
who knew the benefits of INSITE firsthand:

90
0:05:22.982,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Dean Wilson and Shelley Tomic.

91
0:05:26.37,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The court ruled in favor of keeping INSITE open by nine to zero.

92
0:05:31.53,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The justices were scathing in their response to the government's case.

93
0:05:36.72,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I quote:

94
0:05:38.029,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"The effect of denying the services of INSITE to the population that it serves

95
0:05:42.689,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and the correlative increase in the risk of death and disease

96
0:05:45.92,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to injection drug users is grossly disproportionate to any benefit

97
0:05:50.902,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that Canada might derive

98
0:05:53.028,000 --> 0:05:57,000
from presenting a uniform stance on the possession of narcotics."

99
0:05:59.54,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This was a hopeful moment for harm reduction.

100
0:06:02.39,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Yet, despite this strong message from the Supreme Court,

101
0:06:06.29,000 --> 0:06:08,000
it was, until very recently,

102
0:06:09.029,000 --> 0:06:12,000
impossible to open up any new sites in Canada.

103
0:06:12.8,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There was one interesting thing that happened in December of 2016,

104
0:06:17.879,000 --> 0:06:2,000
when due to the overdose crisis,

105
0:06:20.96,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the government of British Columbia allowed the opening of overdose prevention sites.

106
0:06:27.117,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Essentially ignoring the federal approval process,

107
0:06:30.53,000 --> 0:06:34,000
community groups opened up about 22 of these de facto illegal

108
0:06:34.925,000 --> 0:06:36,000
supervised injection sites across the province.

109
0:06:38.6,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Virtually overnight,

110
0:06:40.013,000 --> 0:06:43,000
thousands of people could use drugs under supervision.

111
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Hundreds of overdoses were reversed by Naloxone, and nobody died.

112
0:06:48.53,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In fact, this is what's happened at INSITE over the last 14 years:

113
0:06:53.363,000 --> 0:06:57,000
75,000 different individuals have injected illegal drugs

114
0:06:58.34,000 --> 0:07:01,000
more than three and a half million times,

115
0:07:01.58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and not one person has died.

116
0:07:04.157,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Nobody has ever died at INSITE.

117
0:07:10.95,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So there you have it.

118
0:07:12.15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We have scientific evidence and successes from needle exchanges

119
0:07:17.792,000 --> 0:07:2,000
methadone and supervised injection sites.

120
0:07:20.85,000 --> 0:07:24,000
These are common-sense, compassionate approaches to drug use

121
0:07:25.167,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that improve health, bring connection

122
0:07:27.803,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and greatly reduce suffering and death.

123
0:07:32.54,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So why haven't harm reduction programs taken off?

124
0:07:35.63,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Why do we still think that drug use is law enforcement issue?

125
0:07:42.72,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Our disdain for drugs and drug users goes very deep.

126
0:07:46.386,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We are bombarded with images and media stories

127
0:07:49.81,000 --> 0:07:51,000
about the horrible impacts of drugs.

128
0:07:52.6,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We have stigmatized entire communities.

129
0:07:55.96,000 --> 0:08:,000
We applaud military-inspired operations that bring down drug dealers.

130
0:08:01.809,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And we appear unfazed by building more jails

131
0:08:05.17,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to incarcerate people whose only crime is using drugs.

132
0:08:10.96,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Virtually millions of people are caught up

133
0:08:13.905,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in a hopeless cycle of incarceration, violence and poverty

134
0:08:18.063,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that has been created by our drug laws and not the drugs themselves.

135
0:08:24.9,000 --> 0:08:28,000
How do I explain to people that drug users deserve care and support

136
0:08:29.051,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the freedom to live their lives

137
0:08:30.75,000 --> 0:08:35,000
when all we see are images of guns and handcuffs and jail cells?

138
0:08:37.71,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Let's be clear:

139
0:08:39.736,000 --> 0:08:43,000
criminalization is just a way to institutionalize stigma.

140
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Making drugs illegal does nothing to stop people from using them.

141
0:08:53.888,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Our paralysis to see things differently

142
0:08:57.28,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is also based on an entirely false narrative about drug use.

143
0:09:01.84,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We have been led to believe that drug users

144
0:09:04.111,000 --> 0:09:07,000
are irresponsible people who just want to get high,

145
0:09:07.913,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and then through their own personal failings

146
0:09:10.452,000 --> 0:09:13,000
spiral down into a life of crime and poverty,

147
0:09:14.14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
losing their jobs, their families and, ultimately, their lives.

148
0:09:19.19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
In reality, most drug users have a story,

149
0:09:22.745,000 --> 0:09:26,000
whether it's childhood trauma, sexual abuse, mental illness

150
0:09:27.17,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or a personal tragedy.

151
0:09:28.64,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The drugs are used to numb the pain.

152
0:09:34.13,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We must understand that as we approach people with so much trauma.

153
0:09:41.167,000 --> 0:09:46,000
At its core, our drug policies are really a social justice issue.

154
0:09:46.21,000 --> 0:09:51,000
While the media may focus on overdose deaths like Prince and Michael Jackson,

155
0:09:51.9,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the majority of the suffering

156
0:09:53.423,000 --> 0:09:56,000
happens to people who are living on the margins,

157
0:09:56.995,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the poor and the dispossessed.

158
0:09:59.57,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They don't vote; they are often alone.

159
0:10:02.92,000 --> 0:10:04,000
They are society's disposable people.

160
0:10:07.04,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Even within health care, drug use is highly stigmatized.

161
0:10:11.97,000 --> 0:10:14,000
People using drugs avoid the health care system.

162
0:10:15.08,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They know that once engaged in clinical care

163
0:10:17.67,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or admitted to hospital, they will be treated poorly.

164
0:10:20.804,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And their supply line, be it heroin, cocaine or crystal meth

165
0:10:24.351,000 --> 0:10:25,000
will be interrupted.

166
0:10:26.7,000 --> 0:10:29,000
On top of that, they will be asked a barrage of questions

167
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that only serve to expose their losses and shame.

168
0:10:34.35,000 --> 0:10:35,000
"What drugs do you use?"

169
0:10:35.757,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"How long have you been living on the street?"

170
0:10:37.948,000 --> 0:10:38,000
"Where are your children?"

171
0:10:40.32,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"When were you last in jail?"

172
0:10:42.58,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Essentially: "Why the hell don't you stop using drugs?"

173
0:10:47.826,000 --> 0:10:52,000
In fact, our entire medical approach to drug use is upside down.

174
0:10:52.89,000 --> 0:10:53,000
For some reason,

175
0:10:54.065,000 --> 0:10:59,000
we have decided that abstinence is the best way to treat this.

176
0:10:59.97,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If you're lucky enough, you may get into a detox program.

177
0:11:03.42,000 --> 0:11:06,000
If you live in a community with Suboxone or methadone,

178
0:11:06.51,000 --> 0:11:08,000
you may get on a substitution program.

179
0:11:09.48,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Hardly ever would we offer people what they desperately need to survive:

180
0:11:13.472,000 --> 0:11:16,000
a safe prescription for opioids.

181
0:11:18.04,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Starting with abstinence is like asking a new diabetic to quit sugar

182
0:11:22.897,000 --> 0:11:25,000
or a severe asthmatic to start running marathons

183
0:11:26.152,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or a depressed person to just be happy.

184
0:11:28.48,000 --> 0:11:29,000
For any other medical condition,

185
0:11:30.067,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we would never start with the most extreme option.

186
0:11:33.4,000 --> 0:11:35,000
What makes us think that strategy

187
0:11:35.71,000 --> 0:11:38,000
would work for something as complex as addiction?

188
0:11:40.57,000 --> 0:11:42,000
While unintentional overdoses are not new,

189
0:11:43.03,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the scale of the current crisis is unprecedented.

190
0:11:46.15,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The Center for Disease Control estimated

191
0:11:48.968,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that 64,000 Americans died of a drug overdose in 2016,

192
0:11:54.135,000 --> 0:11:56,000
far exceeding car crashes or homicides.

193
0:11:57.7,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Drug-related mortality is now the leading cause of death

194
0:12:01.795,000 --> 0:12:05,000
among men and women between 20 and 50 years old in North America

195
0:12:07.199,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Think about that.

196
0:12:09.133,000 --> 0:12:13,000
How did we get to this point, and why now?

197
0:12:14.29,000 --> 0:12:16,000
There is a kind of perfect storm around opioids.

198
0:12:16.96,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Drugs like Oxycontin, Percocet and Dilaudid

199
0:12:20.74,000 --> 0:12:25,000
have been liberally distributed for decades for all kinds of pain.

200
0:12:26.89,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It is estimated that two million Americans are daily opioid users,

201
0:12:31.159,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and over 60 million people

202
0:12:33.7,000 --> 0:12:36,000
received at least one prescription for opioids last year.

203
0:12:38.14,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This massive dump of prescription drugs into communities

204
0:12:41.751,000 --> 0:12:45,000
has provided a steady source for people wanting to self-medicate.

205
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
In response to this prescription epidemic,

206
0:12:50.49,000 --> 0:12:54,000
people have been cut off, and this has greatly reduced the street supply

207
0:12:55.86,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The unintended but predictable consequence

208
0:12:58.526,000 --> 0:12:59,000
is an overdose epidemic.

209
0:13:00.36,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Many people who were reliant on a steady supply of prescription drugs

210
0:13:05.01,000 --> 0:13:06,000
turned to heroin.

211
0:13:06.185,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And now the illegal drug market has tragically switched

212
0:13:09.741,000 --> 0:13:11,000
to synthetic drugs, mainly fentanyl.

213
0:13:13.14,000 --> 0:13:17,000
These new drugs are cheap, potent and extremely hard to dose.

214
0:13:18.45,000 --> 0:13:2,000
People are literally being poisoned.

215
0:13:23.47,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Can you imagine if this was any other kind of poisoning epidemic?

216
0:13:27.7,000 --> 0:13:29,000
What if thousands of people started dying

217
0:13:30.057,000 --> 0:13:33,000
from poisoned meat or baby formula or coffee?

218
0:13:34.041,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We would be treating this as a true emergency.

219
0:13:36.34,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We would immediately be supplying safer alternatives.

220
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:41,000
There would be changes in legislation,

221
0:13:42.02,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and we would be supporting the victims and their families.

222
0:13:46.356,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But for the drug overdose epidemic,

223
0:13:48.39,000 --> 0:13:49,000
we have done none of that.

224
0:13:50.43,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We continue to demonize the drugs and the people who use them

225
0:13:54.683,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and blindly pour even more resources into law enforcement.

226
0:14:02.89,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So where should we go from here?

227
0:14:05.763,000 --> 0:14:09,000
First, we should fully embrace, fund and scale up

228
0:14:09.921,000 --> 0:14:11,000
harm reduction programs across North America.

229
0:14:12.49,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I know that in places like Vancouver,

230
0:14:15.41,000 --> 0:14:18,000
harm reduction has been a lifeline to care and treatment.

231
0:14:19.426,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I know that the number of overdose deaths

232
0:14:21.82,000 --> 0:14:23,000
would be far higher without harm reduction.

233
0:14:25.18,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And I personally know hundreds of people who are alive today

234
0:14:30.81,000 --> 0:14:31,000
because of harm reduction.

235
0:14:33.81,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But harm reduction is just the start.

236
0:14:35.75,000 --> 0:14:39,000
If we truly want to make an impact on this drug crisis,

237
0:14:40.07,000 --> 0:14:43,000
we need to have a serious conversation about prohibition

238
0:14:43.94,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and criminal punishment.

239
0:14:46.454,000 --> 0:14:51,000
We need to recognize that drug use is first and foremost a public health issue

240
0:14:53.358,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and turn to comprehensive social and health solutions.

241
0:15:00.9,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We already have a model for how this can work.

242
0:15:03.075,000 --> 0:15:06,000
In 2001, Portugal was having its own drug crisis.

243
0:15:06.39,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Lots of people using drugs, high crime rates

244
0:15:09.6,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and an overdose epidemic.

245
0:15:11.49,000 --> 0:15:15,000
They defied global conventions and decriminalized all drug possession.

246
0:15:16.83,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Money that was spent on drug enforcement

247
0:15:19.29,000 --> 0:15:22,000
was redirected to health and rehabilitation programs.

248
0:15:23.06,000 --> 0:15:24,000
The results are in.

249
0:15:25.05,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Overall drug use is down dramatically.

250
0:15:29.24,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Overdoses are uncommon.

251
0:15:31.836,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Many more people are in treatment.

252
0:15:36.115,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And people have been given their lives back.

253
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We have come so far down the road of prohibition, punishment and prejudice

254
0:15:47.155,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that we have become indifferent to the suffering

255
0:15:49.768,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that we have inflicted on the most vulnerable people in our society.

256
0:15:54.32,000 --> 0:15:57,000
This year even more people will get caught up

257
0:15:57.92,000 --> 0:15:58,000
in the illegal drug trade.

258
0:16:00.62,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Thousands of children will learn that their mother or father

259
0:16:04.94,000 --> 0:16:07,000
has been sent to jail for using drugs.

260
0:16:09.84,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And far too many parents will be notified

261
0:16:12.9,000 --> 0:16:16,000
that their son or daughter has died of a drug overdose.

262
0:16:18.454,000 --> 0:16:2,000
It doesn't have to be this way.

263
0:16:22.444,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Thank you.

264
0:16:23.618,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.149,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I was pregnant, I just got very frustrated.

3
0:00:14.94,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Don't eat deli meats, do this particular prenatal test.

4
0:00:17.649,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Why did you make that choice? Why didn't you make a different choice?

5
0:00:20.94,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I felt like I was being told to do things, and I never got the answer to why.

0:00:29.815,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Sometimes in the world of modern parenting you just can't seem to win.

8
0:00:33.149,000 --> 0:00:35,000
If I go back to work, I spend less time with my kid.

9
0:00:35.649,000 --> 0:00:38,000
What if they don't get the attention they need to adequately develop?

10
0:00:38.94,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If I stay home and give up my income stream,

11
0:00:41.149,000 --> 0:00:43,000
will I look back and regret my decision?

12
0:00:43.44,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There's a lot of conflicting advice out there

13
0:00:45.649,000 --> 0:00:47,000
about whether to stay home or go back to work,

14
0:00:47.857,000 --> 0:00:5,000
so trying to make a choice between the two can be confusing and emotional.

15
0:00:51.524,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You love your kids and want what's best for them,

16
0:00:53.857,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but how do you determine what best means when everyone has a different opinion?

17
0:00:57.607,000 --> 0:01:,000
There are many variations of parents that a household can have,

18
0:01:00.649,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and I think more families should be asking the question

19
0:01:03.274,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of whether it makes sense for the male partner to stay home.

20
0:01:06.149,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But the truth is that in the current time,

21
0:01:08.232,000 --> 0:01:1,000
most of the discussions about stay-at-home parents

22
0:01:10.607,000 --> 0:01:11,000
focus on women in particular.

23
0:01:12.065,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And it's usually the women who say they feel

24
0:01:14.315,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that what they do during the day is going to determine at a deep level

25
0:01:18.399,000 --> 0:01:2,000
what kind of mom and person they are.

26
0:01:20.649,000 --> 0:01:22,000
That is a huge weight to put on yourself as a parent.

27
0:01:23.19,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And when you're met with the side-eye

28
0:01:25.065,000 --> 0:01:27,000
after telling someone you're going back to work or not,

29
0:01:27.69,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it can poke holes in your confidence.

30
0:01:29.565,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I decided to dig in and find out.

31
0:01:31.232,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Is it better to stay at home or go back to work?

32
0:01:33.524,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's an emotional decision, yes,

33
0:01:35.107,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but as an economist I've learned that we can use data

34
0:01:37.69,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to help navigate through those emotional decisions

35
0:01:40.065,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and feel confident we're making the best decision for our family.

36
0:01:43.149,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Specifically there are three main factors you should consider before you decide.

37
0:01:46.94,000 --> 0:01:47,000
First, you need to think about

38
0:01:48.44,000 --> 0:01:5,000
how this decision will affect your family budget.

39
0:01:50.815,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Let's do some numbers.

40
0:01:52.107,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Say your total household income is 100,000 dollars,

41
0:01:54.899,000 --> 0:01:56,000
with you and your partner making 50,000 each.

42
0:01:57.44,000 --> 0:02:,000
That means you bring home about 85,000 dollars after taxes.

43
0:02:01.44,000 --> 0:02:02,000
If both of you work

44
0:02:02.94,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and the family pays 1,500 dollars a month for childcare,

45
0:02:06.149,000 --> 0:02:09,000
your total disposable income would be 67,000 dollars a year.

46
0:02:09.649,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Are you with me so far?

47
0:02:10.94,000 --> 0:02:11,000
If you decide to stay home,

48
0:02:12.315,000 --> 0:02:14,000
your family makes less but you don't pay for childcare.

49
0:02:15.024,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Your disposable income goes down in this scenario,

50
0:02:17.399,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but not by as much as it would if you didn't factor in the childcare.

51
0:02:20.69,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It becomes more complicated if childcare is more expensive in your area.

52
0:02:24.107,000 --> 0:02:26,000
A full-time nanny can run 40, 50,000 dollars a year

53
0:02:26.857,000 --> 0:02:27,000
depending on where you live.

54
0:02:28.274,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If that's the case in your neighborhood, in the scenario I outlined,

55
0:02:31.607,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it would completely wipe out one parent's income,

56
0:02:34.524,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and you'd be better off financially with one parent staying home.

57
0:02:37.596,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Of course, this is only a short-term analysis.

58
0:02:39.94,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Childcare is less expensive sometimes when kids are in school,

59
0:02:43.899,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and you may make a higher income later, so you want to factor that in if you can.

60
0:02:48.107,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Once you've done the math, you'll know what's possible

61
0:02:50.732,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and you'll be able to make a more informed choice,

62
0:02:53.149,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which should feel empowering.

63
0:02:54.607,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Second, it's time to talk about what's best for your child.

64
0:02:57.482,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You may think this should be the core of your decision,

65
0:03:00.149,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but there's actually no right answer.

66
0:03:02.774,000 --> 0:03:05,000
According to studies from Europe and the US,

67
0:03:05.899,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the decision to go back to work or stay at home

68
0:03:08.274,000 --> 0:03:1,000
won't actually make or break your child's future success.

69
0:03:11.149,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Research shows that two parents working full-time

70
0:03:13.982,000 --> 0:03:16,000
has a similar effect on your child's future test scores and income

71
0:03:17.607,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to one parent working and one not.

72
0:03:19.815,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What seems to be most important is the environment

73
0:03:22.232,000 --> 0:03:24,000
your child is in during their spare time.

74
0:03:24.607,000 --> 0:03:26,000
As long as they're engaging in enriching activities;

75
0:03:27.107,000 --> 0:03:3,000
reading, practicing their motor skills, interacting with other kids,

76
0:03:30.357,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they're going to thrive whether or not you're at home.

77
0:03:33.274,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There is a bit of nuance in the data.

78
0:03:35.149,000 --> 0:03:37,000
For example, studies have found,

79
0:03:37.399,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that if both parents work,

80
0:03:39.274,000 --> 0:03:42,000
kids from poorer families are impacted positively,

81
0:03:43.024,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and kids from richer families are impacted less positively.

82
0:03:46.315,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So depending on your household configuration,

83
0:03:48.565,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the effects on your child could be a little positive,

84
0:03:51.357,000 --> 0:03:52,000
or a little negative,

85
0:03:52.649,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but the overall impact is negligible.

86
0:03:54.482,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now I want to call out an exception: maternity leave.

87
0:03:57.482,000 --> 0:04:,000
There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that babies do better

88
0:04:01.024,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when their mothers take some maternity leave.

89
0:04:03.19,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The early days with your child can impact their development,

90
0:04:06.232,000 --> 0:04:08,000
so if you have paid leave, you should take it,

91
0:04:08.774,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and if you don't, maybe consider

92
0:04:10.482,000 --> 0:04:12,000
taking some unpaid leave for those first few months,

93
0:04:12.982,000 --> 0:04:13,000
if your budget allows.

94
0:04:14.399,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And finally, ask yourself, what do I want?

95
0:04:17.065,000 --> 0:04:18,000
While this may seem simple,

96
0:04:18.649,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it's the factor that feels most taboo to explore.

97
0:04:21.357,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In talking to parents I find that when a woman chooses to stay home,

98
0:04:24.774,000 --> 0:04:26,000
she often feels obligated to say

99
0:04:26.815,000 --> 0:04:29,000
she made this choice for her children's optimal development.

100
0:04:30.149,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Which, sure, can be part of the reason,

101
0:04:32.94,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but a perfectly acceptable answer is, "this is the lifestyle I prefer,"

102
0:04:37.107,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or "this is what works for my family."

103
0:04:39.024,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The same goes for the working mother.

104
0:04:40.857,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Saying, "I like my job, and that's why I went back to work," is enough.

105
0:04:44.232,000 --> 0:04:46,000
If you want to go back to work, that's great.

106
0:04:46.482,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You're lucky to have a job that you love

107
0:04:48.44,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and you have every right to keep it once you become a parent.

108
0:04:51.357,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Be honest with yourself about what you'd like to do.

109
0:04:53.899,000 --> 0:04:56,000
If you're upfront about that, you're guaranteed to feel happier,

110
0:04:56.982,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which will allow you to be the best version of a parent you can be,

111
0:05:00.19,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and isn't that the whole point?

112
0:05:01.732,000 --> 0:05:03,000
There is no right and wrong when it comes to parenting.

113
0:05:04.357,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The best decision is the one

114
0:05:05.774,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that will make you -- and your family -- the happiest.

115
0:05:08.399,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Up to you to decide what's next.

116
0:05:10.107,000 --> 0:05:12,000
By acknowledging that the choice to stay home or not

117
0:05:12.649,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is just that, a choice,

118
0:05:14.899,000 --> 0:05:16,000
with factors pushing you in various directions,

119
0:05:17.524,000 --> 0:05:21,000
we can ditch the guilt and enjoy doing what feels best for our families.

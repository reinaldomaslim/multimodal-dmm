1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Brain magic. What's brain magic all about?

2
0:00:14.184,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic

3
0:00:16.375,000 --> 0:00:18,000
dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects.

4
0:00:19.667,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words,

5
0:00:22.547,000 --> 0:00:24,000
linguistic deception, non-verbal communication

6
0:00:25.167,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense.

7
0:00:30.136,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm going to show you all how easy it is

8
0:00:32.136,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to manipulate the human mind once you know how.

9
0:00:34.486,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody.

10
0:00:37.615,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me, first of all.

11
0:00:40.932,000 --> 0:00:41,000
OK, clap them together, once.

12
0:00:42.558,000 --> 0:00:43,000
OK, reverse your hands.

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Now, follow my actions exactly.

14
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that?

15
0:00:49.232,000 --> 0:00:51,000
OK, swap them around, put your right hand up.

16
0:00:51.883,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Cross your hands over, so your right hand goes over,

17
0:00:54.48,000 --> 0:00:55,000
interlace your fingers like this,

18
0:00:56.481,000 --> 0:00:58,000
then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb --

19
0:00:59.371,000 --> 0:01:,000
that's very important.

20
0:01:00.544,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Yours is the other way around, so swap it around.

21
0:01:02.854,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Excellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me.

22
0:01:05.891,000 --> 0:01:06,000
All right. Tap them together once.

23
0:01:08.384,000 --> 0:01:11,000
OK, now, if you did not allow me to deceive your minds,

24
0:01:11.926,000 --> 0:01:12,000
you would all be able to do this.

25
0:01:15.9,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:19.376,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter ends)

27
0:01:20.979,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now you can see how easy it is

28
0:01:22.51,000 --> 0:01:24,000
for me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how.

29
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:27.867,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, I remember when I was about 15,

31
0:01:30.129,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:31.723,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I read a copy of Life magazine,

33
0:01:33.666,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman

34
0:01:38.6,000 --> 0:01:39,000
who could sense printed letters --

35
0:01:40.276,000 --> 0:01:41,000
there's still people trying to do it --

36
0:01:42.172,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:43.323,000 --> 0:01:46,000
-- who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch.

38
0:01:46.728,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And she was completely blind.

39
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
She could also read the serial numbers on bills

40
0:01:50.423,000 --> 0:01:52,000
when they were placed, face down, on a hard surface.

41
0:01:52.924,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now, I was fascinated, but at the same time, skeptical.

42
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
How could somebody read using their fingertips?

43
0:01:59.302,000 --> 0:02:02,000
You know, if you actually think about it, if somebody is totally blind --

44
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms,

45
0:02:05.826,000 --> 0:02:08,000
where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things.

46
0:02:09.118,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out.

47
0:02:12.056,000 --> 0:02:14,000
How could somebody read using their fingertips?

48
0:02:14.329,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV,

49
0:02:18.068,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I attempted to give a similar demonstration

50
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of what is now known as second sight.

51
0:02:23.048,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So, let's take a look.

52
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000

I'm going to take you to a secret location, OK?

59
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Kathryn, there was no way you could see through that blindfold.

KB: Thank you.

109
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
By the way, two days ago, we were going to film this

110
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
down there, at the race course, and we got a guy into a car,

111
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and we got a camera man in the back,

112
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but halfway through the drive,

113
0:05:05.721,000 --> 0:05:07,000
he told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter,

114
0:05:08.191,000 --> 0:05:09,000
stuck to his leg.

115
0:05:09.384,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So, I stopped pretty quick, and that was it.

116
0:05:11.494,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes?

117
0:05:14.787,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That's the question.

118
0:05:15.89,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now, most people here would automatically say no.

119
0:05:18.419,000 --> 0:05:2,000
OK, but I want you to realize some facts.

120
0:05:20.587,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I couldn't see through the blindfold.

121
0:05:22.832,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way.

122
0:05:25.666,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The girl, I'd never met before, all right.

123
0:05:28.628,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So, I want you to just think about it for a moment.

124
0:05:31.132,000 --> 0:05:32,000
A lot of people try to come up

125
0:05:32.81,000 --> 0:05:34,000
with a logical solution to what just happened, all right.

126
0:05:35.501,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception,

127
0:05:38.903,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the solutions you come up with

128
0:05:40.368,000 --> 0:05:42,000
will, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark.

129
0:05:43.502,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is because magic is all about directing attention.

130
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
If, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand,

131
0:05:49.101,000 --> 0:05:5,000
then I don't look at it.

132
0:05:50.36,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But if I wanted you to look at my right hand,

133
0:05:53.155,000 --> 0:05:54,000
then I look at it, too.

134
0:05:54.401,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You see, it's very simple, once you know how,

135
0:05:56.544,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but very complicated in other ways.

136
0:05:58.271,000 --> 0:06:,000
I'm going to give you some demonstrations right now.

137
0:06:00.812,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up?

138
0:06:03.694,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And let's see, down at the end, here, can you also come up, real quick?

139
0:06:07.754,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Do you mind? Yes, at the end.

140
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
OK, give them a round of applause as they come up.

141

just take a deep breath in through your nose,

letting it out through your mouth, and relax.

Allow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one.

OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,

207
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity,

208
0:08:49.137,000 --> 0:08:5,000
so our minds are along the same lines.

209
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind,

210
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.

to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop

at the same rate and speed

215
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness,

216
0:09:09.379,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop.

Excellent.

OK, now, allow it to stay there.

222
0:09:24.765,000 --> 0:09:26,000
OK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK,

OK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again.

236
0:10:21.813,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Excellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting.

237
0:10:25.743,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.

238
0:10:28.767,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Can you stand up? Just stand, stage forward.

239
0:10:31.807,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I want you to point directly at his forehead.

240
0:10:34.29,000 --> 0:10:35,000
OK.

241
0:10:35.512,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Imagine a connection between you and him.

242
0:10:38.567,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Only when you want the pressure to be released,

243
0:10:40.808,000 --> 0:10:41,000
make an upward gesture, like this,

244
0:10:42.474,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but only when you want it to be released.

245
0:10:44.491,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You can wait as long as you want,

246
0:10:46.164,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but only when you want the pressure released.

247
0:10:55.317,000 --> 0:10:56,000
OK, let's try it again.

248
0:10:56.864,000 --> 0:10:58,000
OK, now, imagine the connection, OK.

249
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
Point directly at his forehead.

250
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Only when you want the pressure released, we'll try it again.

251
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
OK, it worked that time, excellent.

252
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And hold it there, both of you.

253
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Only when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture.

254
0:11:14.423,000 --> 0:11:15,000
You can wait as long as you want.

255
0:11:18.477,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You did it pretty quickly, but it went down, OK.

256
0:11:21.993,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Now, I want you to be aware that in a moment,

257
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
when I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again.

258
0:11:26.592,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened.

259
0:11:29.811,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Most people ask you, "What the hell just happened up here?"

260
0:11:32.605,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized,

261
0:11:35.012,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you will forget everything that happened.

262
0:11:37.268,000 --> 0:11:39,000
On five, four, three, two, one -- open your eyes, wide awake.

263
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Give them a round of applause, as they go back to their seats.

264
0:11:43.488,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Applause)

265
0:11:45.025,000 --> 0:11:46,000
OK, you can go back.

266
0:11:46.416,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

267
0:11:50.375,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I once saw a film called "The Gods Are Crazy."

268
0:11:52.684,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah.

269
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane,

270
0:11:57.792,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and it landed on the ground, and it didn't break?

271
0:12:00.144,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now, see, that's because Coke bottles are solid.

272
0:12:03.006,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle.

273
0:12:06.317,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Do you want to try it?

274
0:12:09.429,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Good job. She's not taking any chances.

275
0:12:11.859,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

276
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence

277
0:12:15.565,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of the mind on physical events and processes.

278
0:12:18.542,000 --> 0:12:19,000
For some magicians or mentalists,

279
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
sometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not.

280
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Sometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not.

281
0:12:27.668,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It depends on how much energy you have that day,

282
0:12:29.964,000 --> 0:12:3,000
so on and so forth.

283
0:12:31.052,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now.

284
0:12:33.934,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Come right over here, next to me. Excellent.

285
0:12:36.087,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.

286
0:12:37.896,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.

287
0:12:41.492,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful.

288
0:12:44.517,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Even though it's solid, I'm standing away.

289
0:12:46.541,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb.

290
0:12:49.915,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Excellent. Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.

291
0:12:52.493,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I want you to examine the shard of glass.

292
0:12:54.47,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Careful, it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment.

293
0:12:57.069,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Now, hold it out here.

294
0:12:58.261,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago.

295
0:13:02.707,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I want you to imagine all the negative energy

296
0:13:05.812,000 --> 0:13:07,000
from that broken relationship, from that guy,

297
0:13:07.988,000 --> 0:13:09,000
being imparted into the broken piece of glass,

298
0:13:10.516,000 --> 0:13:11,000
which will represent him, OK.

299
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But I want you to take this very seriously.

300
0:13:14.232,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Stare at the glass, ignore everybody right here.

301
0:13:16.542,000 --> 0:13:19,000
In a moment, you'll feel a certain sensation, OK,

302
0:13:19.689,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and when you feel that sensation,

303
0:13:21.529,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle.

304
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Think of that guy, that ba -- that guy.

305
0:13:29.081,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Laughter)

306
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I'm trying to be good here.

307
0:13:31.597,000 --> 0:13:32,000
OK, and when you feel the sensation --

308
0:13:33.431,000 --> 0:13:35,000
it might take a while -- drop it into the glass.

309
0:13:47.969,000 --> 0:13:48,000
OK, drop it in.

310
0:13:49.501,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Now, imagine all that negative energy in there.

311
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass.

312
0:13:54.817,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And I want you to release that negative energy

313
0:13:57.085,000 --> 0:13:58,000
by shaking it from side to side.

314

316
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000

I also want you to look at me and think of his name.

320
0:14:14.185,000 --> 0:14:17,000
OK, think of how many letters in the title of his name.

321
0:14:18.184,000 --> 0:14:19,000
There's five letters in the title.

322
0:14:19.89,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You didn't react to that, so it's four letters.

323
0:14:22.161,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Think of one of the letters in the title.

324
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
There's a K in his name, there is a K.

325
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I knew that because my name starts with a K also,

326
0:14:28.56,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M.

Tell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him.

Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this,

338

And it should be a male victim, that's the only thing.

Go ahead, I've no fancy assistants underneath there.

One, two, three and four.

But I don't want you to know either, so swivel around on your chair.

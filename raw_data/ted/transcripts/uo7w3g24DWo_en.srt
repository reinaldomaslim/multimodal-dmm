2
0:00:13.204,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Good afternoon, I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow.

3
0:00:16.329,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon

4
0:00:19.35,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which can, and actually is changing the world,

5
0:00:22.376,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and whose name is people power.

6
0:00:24.392,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'll start with an anecdote,

7
0:00:25.924,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers,

8
0:00:29.071,000 --> 0:00:3,000
a Monty Python type of sketch.

9
0:00:30.542,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Here it is.

10
0:00:31.597,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It is December 15, 2010.

11
0:00:34.756,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Somebody gives you a bet: you will look at a crystal ball,

12
0:00:38.262,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and you will see the future; the future will be accurate.

13
0:00:40.953,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But you need to share it with the world.

14
0:00:42.897,000 --> 0:00:45,000
OK, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet,

15
0:00:46.019,000 --> 0:00:47,000
you look at the crystal ball.

16
0:00:47.553,000 --> 0:00:5,000
One hour later, you're sitting in a building of the national TV,

17
0:00:51.116,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in a top show, and you tell the story.

18
0:00:53.672,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Before the end of 2011,

19
0:00:56.78,000 --> 0:01:,000
Ben Ali, and Mubarak, and Gaddafi would be down,

20
0:01:00.953,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and prosecuted.

21
0:01:02.705,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria

22
0:01:05.221,000 --> 0:01:08,000
would be either challenged, or already on their knees.

23
0:01:08.683,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Osama bin Laden would be dead,

24
0:01:10.701,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague.

25
0:01:13.421,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face.

26
0:01:16.991,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And then, on top of it you add:

27
0:01:18.833,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"And thousands of young people from Athens, Madrid and New York

28
0:01:22.722,000 --> 0:01:26,000
will demonstrate for social justice, claiming they are inspired by Arabs."

29
0:01:28.007,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Next thing you know, two guys in white appear,

30
0:01:30.587,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they give you the strange t-shirt,

31
0:01:32.825,000 --> 0:01:34,000
take you to the nearest mental institution.

32
0:01:34.904,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So I would like to speak a little bit

33
0:01:36.791,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be

34
0:01:40.664,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a very bad year for bad guys.

35
0:01:43.379,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And this phenomenon is called people power.

36
0:01:46.78,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Well, people power has been there for a while.

37
0:01:48.947,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India,

38
0:01:51.942,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle.

39
0:01:56.073,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It helped a local, Lech Walesa,

40
0:01:58.46,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland,

41
0:02:01.88,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.

42
0:02:05.102,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So what's new in it?

43
0:02:07.157,000 --> 0:02:08,000
What seems to be very new,

44
0:02:08.765,000 --> 0:02:1,000
which is the idea I would like to share with you today,

45
0:02:11.361,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is that there is a set of rules and skills

46
0:02:13.823,000 --> 0:02:15,000
which can be learned and taught

47
0:02:16.305,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle.

48
0:02:19.753,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If this is true, we can help these movements.

49
0:02:23.531,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Well, the first one - analytic skills.

50
0:02:26.374,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I'll try where it all started in the Middle East.

51
0:02:29.224,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And for so many years,

52
0:02:30.846,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we were living with a completely wrong perception of the Middle East.

53
0:02:35.274,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It was looking like the frozen region.

54
0:02:37.201,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Literally a refrigerator.

55
0:02:38.934,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And there were only two types of meal there.

56
0:02:41.401,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Steak, which stands for a Mubarak-Ben Ali type of military police dictatorship,

57
0:02:47.279,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or a potato, which stands for a Tehran type of theocracies.

58
0:02:50.957,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened,

59
0:02:54.291,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and millions of young, mainly secular people

60
0:02:57.246,000 --> 0:02:59,000
stepped out to do the change.

61
0:02:59.32,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Guess what - they didn't watch the demographics.

62
0:03:02.731,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What is the average age of an Egyptian? 24.

63
0:03:05.147,000 --> 0:03:07,000
How long was Mubarak in power? 31.

64
0:03:07.53,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So, this system was just obsolete, they expired.

65
0:03:11.437,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And young people of the Arab world have awakened one morning,

66
0:03:14.871,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and understood that power lies in their hands.

67
0:03:18.226,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The rest is the year in front of us.

68
0:03:20.273,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And guess what? The same Generation Y,

69
0:03:23.145,000 --> 0:03:25,000
with their rules, with their tools, with their games,

70
0:03:26.051,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and with their language, which sounds a little bit strange to me.

71
0:03:29.389,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I'm 38 now.

72
0:03:31.257,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe?

73
0:03:34.794,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It seems that Generation Y is coming.

74
0:03:39.025,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Now, let me set another example.

75
0:03:41.738,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I'm meeting different people throughout the world,

76
0:03:44.119,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and they are, you know, academics, and professors, and doctors,

77
0:03:47.27,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and they will always talk conditions.

78
0:03:49.168,000 --> 0:03:53,000
They will say: "People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive."

79
0:03:53.221,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They will say: "People power will work,

80
0:03:55.23,000 --> 0:03:58,000
if the annual income of the country is between X and Z."

81
0:03:59.07,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They will say: "People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure."

82
0:04:02.744,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They will say: "People power will work only if there is no oil."

83
0:04:05.85,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And, I mean, there is a set of conditions.

84
0:04:08.958,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Well, the news here is that your skills during the conflict

85
0:04:12.608,000 --> 0:04:14,000
seem to be more important than the conditions.

86
0:04:15.522,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Namely, the skills of unity, planning, and maintaining nonviolent discipline.

87
0:04:20.133,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Let me give you an example.

88
0:04:21.546,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I come from a country called Serbia.

89
0:04:23.631,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders,

90
0:04:28.209,000 --> 0:04:31,000
with their big egos, behind one single candidate

91
0:04:31.613,000 --> 0:04:33,000
against the Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic.

92
0:04:34.264,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Guess what? That was the day of his defeat.

93
0:04:37.034,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You look at the Egyptians, they fight on Tahrir Square,

94
0:04:39.923,000 --> 0:04:41,000
they get rid of their individual symbols,

95
0:04:42.007,000 --> 0:04:44,000
they appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt.

96
0:04:44.926,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I will give you a counter-example.

97
0:04:46.967,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko,

98
0:04:50.681,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you all know the outcome.

99
0:04:52.284,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So unity is a big thing.

100
0:04:54.398,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And this can be achieved.

101
0:04:55.724,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Same with planning.

102
0:04:56.93,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Somebody has lied to you

103
0:04:58.325,000 --> 0:05:01,000
about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution.

104
0:05:02.102,000 --> 0:05:04,000
That thing doesn't exist in the world.

105
0:05:04.133,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Whenever you see young people in front of the row

106
0:05:07.006,000 --> 0:05:09,000
trying to fraternize with the police or military,

107
0:05:09.506,000 --> 0:05:11,000
somebody was thinking about it before.

108
0:05:12.016,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, at the end, nonviolent discipline.

109
0:05:14.229,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And this is probably the game-changer.

110
0:05:16.722,000 --> 0:05:18,000
If you maintain nonviolent discipline,

111
0:05:19.116,000 --> 0:05:2,000
you'll exclusively win.

112
0:05:21.098,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march,

113
0:05:23.582,000 --> 0:05:25,000
one idiot or agent-provocateur throwing a stone.

114
0:05:26.36,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Guess what takes all the cameras.

115
0:05:28.094,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That one guy.

116
0:05:29.212,000 --> 0:05:33,000
One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement.

117
0:05:33.564,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, let me move to another place.

118
0:05:36.175,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's the selection of strategies and tactics.

119
0:05:38.295,000 --> 0:05:41,000
There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow.

120
0:05:42.113,000 --> 0:05:43,000
First, you start small.

121
0:05:43.765,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Second, you pick the battles you can win.

122
0:05:47.181,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's only 200 of us in this room.

123
0:05:49.212,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We won't call for the march of a million.

124
0:05:51.553,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night,

125
0:05:55.001,000 --> 0:05:56,000
all over Krakow.

126
0:05:56.432,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The city will know.

127
0:05:57.6,000 --> 0:06:,000
So, we pick tactics accommodated to the event,

128
0:06:00.925,000 --> 0:06:04,000
especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion.

129
0:06:04.996,000 --> 0:06:07,000
They're very useful in violent oppression.

130
0:06:08.933,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used.

131
0:06:13.153,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It was on Tahrir square,

132
0:06:15.248,000 --> 0:06:18,000
where the international community was constantly frightened

133
0:06:18.548,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that, you know, the Islamists will overtake the revolution.

134
0:06:21.735,000 --> 0:06:22,000
What they organized --

135
0:06:23.132,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Christians protecting Muslims where they are praying,

136
0:06:25.633,000 --> 0:06:27,000
a Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims,

137
0:06:28.245,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the world has just changed the picture,

138
0:06:30.289,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but somebody was thinking about this previously.

139
0:06:33.313,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So there are so many things you can do

140
0:06:35.267,000 --> 0:06:37,000
instead of getting into one place,

141
0:06:37.608,000 --> 0:06:41,000
shouting, and you know, showing off in front of the security forces.

142
0:06:43.013,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, there is also another very important dynamic.

143
0:06:45.983,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And this is a dynamic that analysts normally don't see.

144
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side,

145
0:06:52.981,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and enthusiasm and humor on another side.

146
0:06:55.917,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, it works like in a video game.

147
0:06:57.671,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You have the fear high, you have status quo.

148
0:07:00.079,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You have the enthusiasm higher,

149
0:07:02.167,000 --> 0:07:03,000
you see the fear is starting to melt.

150
0:07:04.001,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Day two, you see people running towards the police

151
0:07:06.747,000 --> 0:07:08,000
instead of from the police, in Egypt.

152
0:07:09.332,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You can tell that something is happening there.

153
0:07:11.936,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And then, it's about the humor.

154
0:07:13.945,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Humor is such a powerful game-changer,

155
0:07:16.452,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and of course, it was very big in Poland.

156
0:07:18.449,000 --> 0:07:21,000
You know, we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia

157
0:07:22.016,000 --> 0:07:24,000
when we made this big skit.

158
0:07:24.156,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We put the big petrol barrel

159
0:07:26.625,000 --> 0:07:3,000
with a portrait of Mr. President on it, in the middle of the Main Street.

160
0:07:31.312,000 --> 0:07:32,000
There was a hole in the top.

161
0:07:32.917,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So you could literally come, put a coin in,

162
0:07:35.702,000 --> 0:07:37,000
get a baseball bat, and hit his face.

163
0:07:39.18,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Sounds loud.

164
0:07:40.861,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And within minutes,

165
0:07:42.161,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we were sitting in a nearby café having coffee,

166
0:07:44.542,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing.

167
0:07:48.82,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Well, that's just the beginning of the show.

168
0:07:50.892,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The real show starts when the police appears.

169
0:07:53.049,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:54.294,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"What will they do?"

171
0:07:55.452,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Arrest us? We were nowhere to be seen.

172
0:07:57.368,000 --> 0:08:,000
We were like three blocks away, observing it from our espresso bar.

173
0:08:01.207,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Arrest the shoppers, with kids?

174
0:08:03.155,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Doesn't make sense.

175
0:08:04.385,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Of course, you could bet, they did the most stupid thing.

176
0:08:07.076,000 --> 0:08:08,000
They arrested the barrel.

177
0:08:08.648,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And now, the picture of the smashed face on the barrel,

178
0:08:11.59,000 --> 0:08:13,000
with the policemen dragging it to the police car,

179
0:08:13.924,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that was the best day for newspaper photographers

180
0:08:17.147,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that they will ever have.

181
0:08:18.851,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So, I mean, these are the things you can do.

182
0:08:21.092,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And you can always use humor.

183
0:08:22.515,000 --> 0:08:24,000
There is also one big thing about humor,

184
0:08:24.814,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it really hurts.

185
0:08:26.117,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously.

186
0:08:30.25,000 --> 0:08:31,000
When you start to mock them, it hurts.

187
0:08:33.393,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now, everybody is talking about His Majesty, the Internet,

188
0:08:37.043,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and it is also a very useful skill.

189
0:08:39.279,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But don't rush to label things like "a Facebook Revolution,"

190
0:08:43.438,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"Twitter Revolution."

191
0:08:44.616,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Don't mix the tools with the substance.

192
0:08:47.999,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful

193
0:08:51.477,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in making things faster and cheaper.

194
0:08:54.034,000 --> 0:08:56,000
They also make it a bit safer for the participants,

195
0:08:56.881,000 --> 0:08:57,000
because they give partial anonymity.

196
0:08:59.175,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We're watching the great example of something else the Internet can do.

197
0:09:02.825,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence

198
0:09:06.376,000 --> 0:09:07,000
over a nonviolent protester.

199
0:09:07.995,000 --> 0:09:09,000
This is the famous group "We are all Khaled Said,"

200
0:09:10.495,000 --> 0:09:12,000
made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt, and his friend.

201
0:09:12.836,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police.

202
0:09:16.723,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This is how he became known to the public,

203
0:09:18.747,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel's back.

204
0:09:22.882,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But here is also the bad news.

205
0:09:24.597,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world, in the streets.

206
0:09:28.301,000 --> 0:09:32,000
You will never change your society towards democracy,

207
0:09:32.492,000 --> 0:09:35,000
or, you know, the economy, if you sit down and click.

208
0:09:35.905,000 --> 0:09:36,000
There are risks to be taken,

209
0:09:37.346,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and there are living people who are winning the struggle.

210
0:09:41.071,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Well, the million-dollar question.

211
0:09:42.761,000 --> 0:09:43,000
What will happen in the Arab world?

212
0:09:44.692,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And though young people from the Arab world

213
0:09:46.716,000 --> 0:09:49,000
were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators,

214
0:09:49.988,000 --> 0:09:51,000
shaking the region,

215
0:09:52.408,000 --> 0:09:55,000
kind of persuading the clever kings from Jordan and Morocco

216
0:09:55.587,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to do substantial reforms,

217
0:09:57.406,000 --> 0:10:,000
it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome.

218
0:10:01.487,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition,

219
0:10:05.436,000 --> 0:10:08,000
or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts,

220
0:10:09.071,000 --> 0:10:14,000
whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline,

221
0:10:14.317,000 --> 0:10:17,000
faced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already,

222
0:10:18.141,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or they will slip into violent struggle

223
0:10:20.276,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and make ugly civil war.

224
0:10:24.689,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Will these revolutions be pushed through the transitions and democracy

225
0:10:28.691,000 --> 0:10:31,000
or be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds?

226
0:10:32.8,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We cannot tell.

227
0:10:34.894,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The same works for the Western sector,

228
0:10:36.919,000 --> 0:10:38,000
where you can see all these excited young people

229
0:10:39.209,000 --> 0:10:42,000
protesting around the world, occupying this, occupying that.

230
0:10:43.538,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Are they going to become the world wave?

231
0:10:46.309,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Are they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy

232
0:10:51.968,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to find what they really want and push for the reform,

233
0:10:55.262,000 --> 0:10:59,000
or will they just stay complaining about the endless list

234
0:10:59.515,000 --> 0:11:,000
of the things they hate?

235
0:11:01.982,000 --> 0:11:03,000
This is the difference between the two paths.

236
0:11:04.774,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now, what do the statistics have?

237
0:11:07.597,000 --> 0:11:09,000
My friend Maria Stephan's book

238
0:11:10.215,000 --> 0:11:12,000
talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle,

239
0:11:12.939,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and there are some shocking data.

240
0:11:15.59,000 --> 0:11:19,000
If you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions,

241
0:11:19.876,000 --> 0:11:2,000
from dictatorship to democracy,

242
0:11:21.742,000 --> 0:11:24,000
you will see that, out of 67 different cases,

243
0:11:25.095,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle

244
0:11:28.729,000 --> 0:11:3,000
which was the key power.

245
0:11:31.809,000 --> 0:11:33,000
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon,

246
0:11:34.452,000 --> 0:11:36,000
this is one more reason to look at Generation Y.

247
0:11:38.013,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Enough for me to give them credit,

248
0:11:40.089,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and hope that they will find their skills and their courage

249
0:11:44.981,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to use nonviolent struggle

250
0:11:46.668,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world.

251
0:11:51.765,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Thank you.

252
0:11:52.852,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Applause)

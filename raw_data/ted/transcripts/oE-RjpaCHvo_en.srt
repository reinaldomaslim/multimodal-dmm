0:00:04.44,000 --> 0:00:08,000
massara

3
0:00:05.13,000 --> 0:00:11,000
walked into a hotel in Manhattan and

4
0:00:08.57,000 --> 0:00:13,000
assassinated rabbi meir Kahana while

5
0:00:11.82,000 --> 0:00:15,000
serving time no Sara began planning

6
0:00:14.099,000 --> 0:00:18,000
attacks on a dozen New York City

7
0:00:16.289,000 --> 0:00:2,000
landmarks thankfully those plans were

8
0:00:18.66,000 --> 0:00:22,000
foiled by an FBI informant

0:00:37.94,000 --> 0:00:42,000
back against terrorism against the

14
0:00:40.64,000 --> 0:00:45,000
bigotry I stand here as proof that

15
0:00:43.54,000 --> 0:00:48,000
violence isn't inherent in one's

16
0:00:45.71,000 --> 0:00:51,000
religion or race and the son does not

17
0:00:49.46,000 --> 0:00:55,000
have to follow the ways of his father I

18
0:00:52.1,000 --> 0:00:55,000
am NOT my father

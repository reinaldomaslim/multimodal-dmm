1
0:00:12.742,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So we humans have an extraordinary potential for goodness,

2
0:00:19.963,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but also an immense power to do harm.

3
0:00:24.363,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Any tool can be used to build or to destroy.

4
0:00:30.036,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That all depends on our motivation.

5
0:00:33.217,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Therefore, it is all the more important

6
0:00:36.664,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one.

7
0:00:42.508,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So now we indeed are facing many challenges in our times.

8
0:00:49.008,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Those could be personal challenges.

9
0:00:52.325,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Our own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy.

10
0:00:58.341,000 --> 0:01:,000
There's also societal challenges:

11
0:01:01.225,000 --> 0:01:06,000
poverty in the midst of plenty, inequalities, conflict, injustice.

12
0:01:06.924,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And then there are the new challenges, which we don't expect.

13
0:01:11.12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Ten thousand years ago, there were about five million human beings on Earth.

14
0:01:15.763,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Whatever they could do,

15
0:01:17.373,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the Earth's resilience would soon heal human activities.

16
0:01:22.559,000 --> 0:01:25,000
After the Industrial and Technological Revolutions,

17
0:01:25.775,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that's not the same anymore.

18
0:01:28.008,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We are now the major agent of impact on our Earth.

19
0:01:32.073,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We enter the Anthropocene, the era of human beings.

20
0:01:36.977,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So in a way, if we were to say we need to continue this endless growth,

21
0:01:43.97,000 --> 0:01:46,000
endless use of material resources,

22
0:01:47.616,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it's like if this man was saying --

23
0:01:50.514,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I heard a former head of state, I won't mention who, saying --

24
0:01:55.386,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Five years ago, we were at the edge of the precipice.

25
0:01:59.395,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Today we made a big step forward."

26
0:02:02.587,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists

27
0:02:08.59,000 --> 0:02:1,000
as the planetary boundaries.

28
0:02:11.244,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And within those boundaries, they can carry a number of factors.

29
0:02:15.705,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We can still prosper, humanity can still prosper for 150,000 years

30
0:02:21.231,000 --> 0:02:24,000
if we keep the same stability of climate

31
0:02:24.563,000 --> 0:02:27,000
as in the Holocene for the last 10,000 years.

32
0:02:27.721,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity,

33
0:02:33.479,000 --> 0:02:35,000
growing qualitatively, not quantitatively.

34
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So in 1900, as you can see, we were well within the limits of safety.

35
0:02:42.394,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, in 1950 came the great acceleration.

36
0:02:47.793,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now hold your breath, not too long, to imagine what comes next.

37
0:02:52.762,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries.

38
0:02:58.907,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Just to take biodiversity, at the current rate,

39
0:03:02.866,000 --> 0:03:08,000
by 2050, 30 percent of all species on Earth will have disappeared.

40
0:03:09.288,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge, that's not going to be reversible.

41
0:03:15.085,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So here I am sitting

42
0:03:16.936,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in front of a 7,000-meter-high, 21,000-foot glacier in Bhutan.

43
0:03:22.836,000 --> 0:03:29,000
At the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciers are melting fast, faster than the Arctic.

44
0:03:29.987,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So what can we do in that situation?

45
0:03:34.144,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, however complex politically, economically, scientifically

46
0:03:41.453,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the question of the environment is,

47
0:03:43.851,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness.

48
0:03:50.678,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.

49
0:03:54.287,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

50
0:03:55.712,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Groucho Marx said, "Why should I care about future generations?

51
0:03:59.121,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What have they ever done for me?"

52
0:04:01.151,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

53
0:04:02.647,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Unfortunately, I heard the billionaire Steve Forbes,

54
0:04:07.43,000 --> 0:04:1,000
on Fox News, saying exactly the same thing, but seriously.

55
0:04:10.958,000 --> 0:04:12,000
He was told about the rise of the ocean,

56
0:04:13.293,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and he said, "I find it absurd to change my behavior today

57
0:04:16.64,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for something that will happen in a hundred years."

58
0:04:19.695,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So if you don't care for future generations,

59
0:04:22.593,000 --> 0:04:24,000
just go for it.

60
0:04:25.494,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So one of the main challenges of our times

61
0:04:28.42,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is to reconcile three time scales:

62
0:04:31.538,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the short term of the economy,

63
0:04:33.683,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the ups and downs of the stock market, the end-of-the-year accounts;

64
0:04:37.915,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the midterm of the quality of life --

65
0:04:40.621,000 --> 0:04:45,000
what is the quality every moment of our life, over 10 years and 20 years? --

66
0:04:45.945,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the long term of the environment.

67
0:04:49.554,000 --> 0:04:51,000
When the environmentalists speak with economists,

68
0:04:51.903,000 --> 0:04:54,000
it's like a schizophrenic dialogue, completely incoherent.

69
0:04:54.982,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They don't speak the same language.

70
0:04:57.814,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now, for the last 10 years, I went around the world

71
0:05:01.354,000 --> 0:05:05,000
meeting economists, scientists, neuroscientists, environmentalists,

72
0:05:05.452,000 --> 0:05:09,000
philosophers, thinkers in the Himalayas, all over the place.

73
0:05:09.912,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It seems to me, there's only one concept

74
0:05:13.834,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that can reconcile those three time scales.

75
0:05:16.794,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It is simply having more consideration for others.

76
0:05:21.198,000 --> 0:05:25,000
If you have more consideration for others, you will have a caring economics,

77
0:05:26.099,000 --> 0:05:28,000
where finance is at the service of society

78
0:05:29.051,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and not society at the service of finance.

79
0:05:32.319,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You will not play at the casino

80
0:05:34.187,000 --> 0:05:36,000
with the resources that people have entrusted you with.

81
0:05:37.073,000 --> 0:05:39,000
If you have more consideration for others,

82
0:05:39.919,000 --> 0:05:42,000
you will make sure that you remedy inequality,

83
0:05:43.396,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that you bring some kind of well-being within society,

84
0:05:47.136,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in education, at the workplace.

85
0:05:49.176,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Otherwise, a nation that is the most powerful and the richest

86
0:05:52.599,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but everyone is miserable, what's the point?

87
0:05:55.686,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And if you have more consideration for others,

88
0:05:57.973,000 --> 0:06:,000
you are not going to ransack that planet that we have

89
0:06:01.369,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and at the current rate, we don't have three planets to continue that way.

90
0:06:05.703,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So the question is,

91
0:06:08.056,000 --> 0:06:12,000
okay, altruism is the answer, it's not just a novel ideal,

92
0:06:12.387,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but can it be a real, pragmatic solution?

93
0:06:15.611,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And first of all, does it exist,

94
0:06:18.469,000 --> 0:06:21,000
true altruism, or are we so selfish?

95
0:06:22.213,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish.

96
0:06:27.553,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But are we really all just like rascals?

97
0:06:32.765,000 --> 0:06:34,000
That's good news, isn't it?

98
0:06:35.579,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Many philosophers, like Hobbes, have said so.

99
0:06:38.108,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But not everyone looks like a rascal.

100
0:06:41.429,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Or is man a wolf for man?

101
0:06:44.262,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But this guy doesn't seem too bad.

102
0:06:47.15,000 --> 0:06:49,000
He's one of my friends in Tibet.

103
0:06:50.073,000 --> 0:06:52,000
He's very kind.

104
0:06:52.312,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So now, we love cooperation.

105
0:06:55.937,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There's no better joy than working together, is there?

106
0:07:00.275,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And then not only humans.

107
0:07:04.35,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Then, of course, there's the struggle for life,

108
0:07:06.837,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the survival of the fittest, social Darwinism.

109
0:07:11.178,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But in evolution, cooperation -- though competition exists, of course --

110
0:07:17.015,000 --> 0:07:22,000
cooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity.

111
0:07:22.732,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We are super-cooperators and we should even go further.

112
0:07:27.414,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So now, on top of that, the quality of human relationships.

113
0:07:33.443,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The OECD did a survey among 10 factors, including income, everything.

114
0:07:37.925,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The first one that people said, that's the main thing for my happiness,

115
0:07:41.268,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is quality of social relationships.

116
0:07:44.621,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Not only in humans.

117
0:07:47.498,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And look at those great-grandmothers.

118
0:07:50.846,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So now, this idea that if we go deep within,

119
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
we are irredeemably selfish,

120
0:07:58.57,000 --> 0:08:,000
this is armchair science.

121
0:08:01.224,000 --> 0:08:03,000
There is not a single sociological study,

122
0:08:03.491,000 --> 0:08:06,000
psychological study, that's ever shown that.

123
0:08:06.737,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Rather, the opposite.

124
0:08:08.697,000 --> 0:08:11,000
My friend, Daniel Batson, spent a whole life

125
0:08:12.355,000 --> 0:08:14,000
putting people in the lab in very complex situations.

126
0:08:15.118,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And of course we are sometimes selfish, and some people more than others.

127
0:08:19.487,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But he found that systematically, no matter what,

128
0:08:22.149,000 --> 0:08:25,000
there's a significant number of people

129
0:08:25.149,000 --> 0:08:28,000
who do behave altruistically, no matter what.

130
0:08:28.504,000 --> 0:08:31,000
If you see someone deeply wounded, great suffering,

131
0:08:31.696,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you might just help out of empathic distress --

132
0:08:34.318,000 --> 0:08:38,000
you can't stand it, so it's better to help than to keep on looking at that person.

133
0:08:38.468,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So we tested all that, and in the end, he said, clearly people can be altruistic.

134
0:08:44.344,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So that's good news.

135
0:08:46.284,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And even further, we should look at the banality of goodness.

136
0:08:51.896,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now look at here.

137
0:08:53.6,000 --> 0:08:55,000
When we come out, we aren't going to say, "That's so nice.

138
0:08:56.37,000 --> 0:09:,000
There was no fistfight while this mob was thinking about altruism."

139
0:09:00.937,000 --> 0:09:02,000
No, that's expected, isn't it?

140
0:09:03.099,000 --> 0:09:06,000
If there was a fistfight, we would speak of that for months.

141
0:09:06.278,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So the banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention,

142
0:09:09.949,000 --> 0:09:1,000
but it exists.

143
0:09:11.437,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now, look at this.

144
0:09:21.253,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So some psychologists said,

145
0:09:24.054,000 --> 0:09:27,000
when I tell them I run 140 humanitarian projects in the Himalayas

146
0:09:27.291,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that give me so much joy,

147
0:09:29.545,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they said, "Oh, I see, you work for the warm glow.

148
0:09:32.799,000 --> 0:09:34,000
That is not altruistic. You just feel good."

149
0:09:35.703,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You think this guy, when he jumped in front of the train,

150
0:09:38.991,000 --> 0:09:4,000
he thought, "I'm going to feel so good when this is over?"

151
0:09:41.277,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

152
0:09:43.563,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But that's not the end of it.

153
0:09:45.849,000 --> 0:09:47,000
They say, well, but when you interviewed him, he said,

154
0:09:48.391,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"I had no choice. I had to jump, of course."

155
0:09:51.526,000 --> 0:09:54,000
He has no choice. Automatic behavior. It's neither selfish nor altruistic.

156
0:09:55.407,000 --> 0:09:56,000
No choice?

157
0:09:56.882,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Well of course, this guy's not going to think for half an hour,

158
0:09:59.844,000 --> 0:10:01,000
"Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?"

159
0:10:01.881,000 --> 0:10:04,000
He does it. There is a choice, but it's obvious, it's immediate.

160
0:10:05.676,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And then, also, there he had a choice.

161
0:10:08.037,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

162
0:10:10.738,000 --> 0:10:13,000
There are people who had choice, like Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,

163
0:10:14.5,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and the whole village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.

164
0:10:17.187,000 --> 0:10:2,000
For the whole Second World War, they saved 3,500 Jews,

165
0:10:21.135,000 --> 0:10:23,000
gave them shelter, brought them to Switzerland,

166
0:10:23.792,000 --> 0:10:26,000
against all odds, at the risk of their lives and those of their family.

167
0:10:27.237,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So altruism does exist.

168
0:10:29.394,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So what is altruism?

169
0:10:31.119,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It is the wish: May others be happy and find the cause of happiness.

170
0:10:35.021,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Now, empathy is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you,

171
0:10:40.266,000 --> 0:10:42,000
this person is joyful, this person suffers.

172
0:10:42.977,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But empathy alone is not sufficient.

173
0:10:46.463,000 --> 0:10:48,000
If you keep on being confronted with suffering,

174
0:10:48.686,000 --> 0:10:5,000
you might have empathic distress, burnout,

175
0:10:51.447,000 --> 0:10:55,000
so you need the greater sphere of loving-kindness.

176
0:10:55.507,000 --> 0:10:57,000
With Tania Singer at the Max Planck Institute of Leipzig,

177
0:10:58.234,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving-kindness are different.

178
0:11:04.335,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now, that's all well done,

179
0:11:06.416,000 --> 0:11:11,000
so we got that from evolution, from maternal care, parental love,

180
0:11:11.79,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but we need to extend that.

181
0:11:13.625,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It can be extended even to other species.

182
0:11:16.968,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Now, if we want a more altruistic society, we need two things:

183
0:11:21.375,000 --> 0:11:24,000
individual change and societal change.

184
0:11:24.592,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So is individual change possible?

185
0:11:27.15,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Two thousand years of contemplative study said yes, it is.

186
0:11:30.349,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Now, 15 years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics

187
0:11:33.951,000 --> 0:11:37,000
said yes, our brains change when you train in altruism.

188
0:11:38.435,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.

189
0:11:42.707,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This is the first time I went after two and a half hours.

190
0:11:45.493,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And then the result has been published in many scientific papers.

191
0:11:49.167,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It shows without ambiguity that there is structural change

192
0:11:52.749,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love.

193
0:11:56.502,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Just to give you an idea:

194
0:11:58.252,000 --> 0:12:,000
this is the meditator at rest on the left,

195
0:12:01.073,000 --> 0:12:04,000
meditator in compassion meditation, you see all the activity,

196
0:12:04.776,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and then the control group at rest, nothing happened,

197
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
in meditation, nothing happened.

198
0:12:09.272,000 --> 0:12:1,000
They have not been trained.

199
0:12:11.25,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So do you need 50,000 hours of meditation? No, you don't.

200
0:12:15.671,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Four weeks, 20 minutes a day, of caring, mindfulness meditation

201
0:12:19.838,000 --> 0:12:25,000
already brings a structural change in the brain compared to a control group.

202
0:12:26.141,000 --> 0:12:29,000
That's only 20 minutes a day for four weeks.

203
0:12:29.879,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Even with preschoolers -- Richard Davidson did that in Madison.

204
0:12:33.217,000 --> 0:12:39,000
An eight-week program: gratitude, loving- kindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.

205
0:12:39.627,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You would say, "Oh, they're just preschoolers."

206
0:12:41.882,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Look after eight weeks,

207
0:12:43.508,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the pro-social behavior, that's the blue line.

208
0:12:45.958,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And then comes the ultimate scientific test, the stickers test.

209
0:12:51.402,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Before, you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class,

210
0:12:55.35,000 --> 0:12:59,000
their least favorite child, an unknown child, and the sick child,

211
0:12:59.425,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and they have to give stickers away.

212
0:13:02.129,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So before the intervention, they give most of it to their best friend.

213
0:13:06.181,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Four, five years old, 20 minutes three times a week.

214
0:13:09.64,000 --> 0:13:12,000
After the intervention, no more discrimination:

215
0:13:13.123,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the same amount of stickers to their best friend and the least favorite child.

216
0:13:17.048,000 --> 0:13:2,000
That's something we should do in all the schools in the world.

217
0:13:20.436,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Now where do we go from there?

218
0:13:22.43,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

219
0:13:26.678,000 --> 0:13:28,000
When the Dalai Lama heard that, he told Richard Davidson,

220
0:13:29.359,000 --> 0:13:32,000
"You go to 10 schools, 100 schools, the U.N., the whole world."

221
0:13:32.815,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So now where do we go from there?

222
0:13:34.499,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Individual change is possible.

223
0:13:36.762,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now do we have to wait for an altruistic gene to be in the human race?

224
0:13:41.378,000 --> 0:13:44,000
That will take 50,000 years, too much for the environment.

225
0:13:45.132,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Fortunately, there is the evolution of culture.

226
0:13:49.567,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Cultures, as specialists have shown, change faster than genes.

227
0:13:55.301,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That's the good news.

228
0:13:56.829,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Look, attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years.

229
0:14:00.189,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So now individual change and cultural change mutually fashion each other,

230
0:14:05.37,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and yes, we can achieve a more altruistic society.

231
0:14:08.146,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So where do we go from there?

232
0:14:09.888,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Myself, I will go back to the East.

233
0:14:12.137,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Now we treat 100,000 patients a year in our projects.

234
0:14:15.597,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We have 25,000 kids in school, four percent overhead.

235
0:14:19.346,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Some people say, "Well, your stuff works in practice,

236
0:14:21.921,000 --> 0:14:23,000
but does it work in theory?"

237
0:14:23.945,000 --> 0:14:26,000
There's always positive deviance.

238
0:14:27.287,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So I will also go back to my hermitage

239
0:14:29.706,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to find the inner resources to better serve others.

240
0:14:32.995,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But on the more global level, what can we do?

241
0:14:36.182,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We need three things.

242
0:14:37.973,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Enhancing cooperation:

243
0:14:40.325,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Cooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning,

244
0:14:44.041,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Unconditional cooperation within corporations --

245
0:14:47.612,000 --> 0:14:51,000
there can be some competition between corporations, but not within.

246
0:14:52.019,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We need sustainable harmony. I love this term.

247
0:14:55.971,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Not sustainable growth anymore.

248
0:14:57.914,000 --> 0:15:,000
Sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality.

249
0:15:01.5,000 --> 0:15:05,000
In the future, we do more with less,

250
0:15:05.826,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and we continue to grow qualitatively, not quantitatively.

251
0:15:10.31,000 --> 0:15:12,000
We need caring economics.

252
0:15:12.615,000 --> 0:15:17,000
The Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty,

253
0:15:18.446,000 --> 0:15:2,000
cannot deal with the problem of the common goods

254
0:15:20.798,000 --> 0:15:22,000
of the atmosphere, of the oceans.

255
0:15:23.096,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We need a caring economics.

256
0:15:24.679,000 --> 0:15:26,000
If you say economics should be compassionate,

257
0:15:26.788,000 --> 0:15:27,000
they say, "That's not our job."

258
0:15:28.273,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But if you say they don't care, that looks bad.

259
0:15:31.588,000 --> 0:15:34,000
We need local commitment, global responsibility.

260
0:15:34.967,000 --> 0:15:39,000
We need to extend altruism to the other 1.6 million species.

261
0:15:40.307,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Sentient beings are co-citizens in this world.

262
0:15:43.732,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and we need to dare altruism.

263
0:15:46.724,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So, long live the altruistic revolution.

264
0:15:50.605,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Viva la revolución de altruismo.

265
0:15:55.155,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Applause)

266
0:16:00.515,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Thank you.

267
0:16:02.496,000 --> 0:16:03,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.687,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, raise your hand if you've seen somebody in your city

2
0:00:16.383,000 --> 0:00:19,000
standing on a corner, holding a sign like this.

3
0:00:22.229,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I think we all have.

4
0:00:23.502,000 --> 0:00:24,000
If you're being honest,

5
0:00:24.691,000 --> 0:00:26,000
at least one time, have you wondered if they mean it?

6
0:00:28.578,000 --> 0:00:3,000
If we offered them a job, would they really take it?

7
0:00:31.509,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And what would that job mean to them in their lives?

8
0:00:35.063,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well, this is a story about what happened in my city

9
0:00:37.888,000 --> 0:00:38,000
when we decided to find out,

10
0:00:40.532,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when we decided to think differently about panhandling,

11
0:00:43.943,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and lift people up through the dignity of work.

12
0:00:47.954,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We call it, "There's a Better Way."

13
0:00:50.204,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We call it There's a Better Way

14
0:00:51.721,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because I believe there's a better way to get the money you need

15
0:00:54.783,000 --> 0:00:55,000
than panhandling on the corner.

16
0:00:57.08,000 --> 0:01:,000
I believe there's a better way to help your brothers and sisters in need

17
0:01:01.002,000 --> 0:01:03,000
than handing a few dollars out the car window.

18
0:01:04.294,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We know there's dignity in work.

19
0:01:06.93,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves

20
0:01:10.35,000 --> 0:01:13,000
if they believe that their community is willing to invest in them first.

21
0:01:15.304,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate,

22
0:01:18.631,000 --> 0:01:21,000
it always feels good to hand a couple of dollars to someone

23
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that is in need.

24
0:01:24.627,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But if you talk to panhandlers, many of them will tell you

25
0:01:28.078,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body,

26
0:01:33.292,000 --> 0:01:35,000
they go towards feeding an addiction.

27
0:01:36.304,000 --> 0:01:37,000
There's a better way.

28
0:01:38.409,000 --> 0:01:39,000
My name is Richard Berry,

29
0:01:39.705,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I have one of the best jobs in the world.

30
0:01:42.096,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I get to be the mayor of a great American city,

31
0:01:44.554,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

32
0:01:47.766,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I was at lunch on July 17, 2015, in my great American city,

33
0:01:53.993,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and on my way back to city hall,

34
0:01:56.241,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I saw this gentleman standing on a corner.

35
0:01:58.896,000 --> 0:01:59,000
As you can see, he's holding a sign,

36
0:02:00.876,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and his sign says he wants a job.

37
0:02:03.493,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But if you look closer at the picture,

38
0:02:05.359,000 --> 0:02:07,000
you'll see he's standing underneath a blue sign,

39
0:02:07.622,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and that sign says, if you need help, if you need food or shelter

40
0:02:11.758,000 --> 0:02:12,000
or you'd like to donate,

41
0:02:13.039,000 --> 0:02:15,000
please call 311, our community service number.

42
0:02:17.293,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So why is this guy standing underneath my sign with his sign?

43
0:02:22.889,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Well, we wondered if anybody would call that 311 sign,

44
0:02:25.478,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and as it turns out, they did --

45
0:02:27.058,000 --> 0:02:28,000
11,000 times people called.

46
0:02:28.813,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I put those up in about 30 intersections.

47
0:02:30.901,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And we did connect them with food and shelter and services.

48
0:02:34.299,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But yet he's still standing under my sign

49
0:02:36.385,000 --> 0:02:37,000
with a sign that says he wants a job.

50
0:02:39.908,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's simple: he wants a job.

51
0:02:43.135,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So I decided to do something rare in government.

52
0:02:46.139,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I decided to make the solution simpler rather than more complicated.

53
0:02:50.446,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I went back to my office, I gathered my staff around

54
0:02:52.995,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and I said, "We're going to take this man at his word,

55
0:02:55.63,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and others like him.

56
0:02:56.839,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The man says he wants a job, we're going to give him a job,

57
0:02:59.64,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and we're going to make our city an even better place in the meantime."

58
0:03:03.919,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You see, Albuquerque is a beautiful place.

59
0:03:06.152,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We're a mile high,

60
0:03:07.447,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the Sandia Mountains on the east,

61
0:03:09.577,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the Rio Grande runs through the center of the city;

62
0:03:12.141,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we're the home of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.

63
0:03:15.229,000 --> 0:03:16,000
On a day like today,

64
0:03:16.417,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you could literally ski this morning and golf this afternoon.

65
0:03:19.851,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But there's always something to do --

66
0:03:21.766,000 --> 0:03:23,000
always weeds to pull, litter to pick up.

67
0:03:24.625,000 --> 0:03:26,000
If you're going to have an initiative like this in your city,

68
0:03:27.585,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you have to ask yourself two questions.

69
0:03:29.504,000 --> 0:03:31,000
First one is: Is there anything left to do in your city?

70
0:03:32.198,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And if the answer is no,

71
0:03:33.404,000 --> 0:03:35,000
would you please give me your mayor's phone number,

72
0:03:35.836,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because I need some advice.

73
0:03:37.183,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:38.214,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But the second question you have to ask is this:

75
0:03:40.505,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Are your solutions to panhandling working?

76
0:03:44.506,000 --> 0:03:45,000
If you're like Albuquerque,

77
0:03:45.816,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and you're taking the punitive approach like we used to,

78
0:03:48.486,000 --> 0:03:51,000
handing out tickets to panhandlers or those who give them money,

79
0:03:51.644,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'm going to suggest that your solutions aren't working,

80
0:03:54.342,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I know you're not getting to the root of your problem in your city.

81
0:03:58.605,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So if you have something to do

82
0:04:01.005,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and you need people that need something to do,

83
0:04:03.63,000 --> 0:04:04,000
there's a better way.

84
0:04:04.864,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And the good news is, it's not that complicated.

85
0:04:07.68,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This a 2006 Dodge van.

86
0:04:10.494,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It was in my motor pool not doing anything.

87
0:04:13.17,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We put some new tires on it, wrapped it with a logo.

88
0:04:16.136,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This van now goes out to street corners where our panhandlers are --

89
0:04:19.955,000 --> 0:04:2,000
we go to them.

90
0:04:21.676,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We stop the van, we get out,

91
0:04:23.146,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we ask them if they would like a day's work

92
0:04:25.202,000 --> 0:04:26,000
rather than panhandling for the day.

93
0:04:28.161,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And if you wondered if they really mean it --

94
0:04:31.755,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it takes us about an hour to fill this van up in the morning,

95
0:04:34.736,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because almost everybody we ask takes a job for the day.

96
0:04:39.193,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But you need more than just a van.

97
0:04:41.407,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You need a super-fantastic human being to drive that van.

98
0:04:45.096,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And my super-fantastic human being, his name is Will.

99
0:04:47.79,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This is him in the yellow vest.

100
0:04:49.585,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Will works at our local nonprofit partner.

101
0:04:52.143,000 --> 0:04:53,000
He works with the homeless every day.

102
0:04:53.99,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The panhandlers trust him,

103
0:04:56.516,000 --> 0:04:57,000
he believes in them,

104
0:04:58.523,000 --> 0:04:59,000
he hustles.

105
0:05:00.105,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I like to say, "Where there's a Will, there's a way."

106
0:05:03.146,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So if you're going to do the Better Way campaign in your city,

107
0:05:06.164,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you need to find yourself a Will,

108
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because he's really one of the keys to making this successful

109
0:05:12.841,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in the city of Albuquerque.

110
0:05:14.465,000 --> 0:05:16,000
You also need a great nonprofit partner.

111
0:05:16.676,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Ours is St. Martin's Hospitality Center.

112
0:05:19.223,000 --> 0:05:21,000
They've been in our community for over 30 years.

113
0:05:21.756,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They provide counseling, food, shelter,

114
0:05:24.293,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and if they don't provide it,

115
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:27,000
they know somebody in our city that does.

116
0:05:28.37,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But they do something much more for me as the mayor.

117
0:05:30.837,000 --> 0:05:31,000
They provide agility.

118
0:05:32.496,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You see, it takes me two weeks,

119
0:05:34.733,000 --> 0:05:35,000
maybe two months sometimes,

120
0:05:36.527,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to onboard an employee with the city of Albuquerque.

121
0:05:39.844,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So you could imagine --

122
0:05:41.623,000 --> 0:05:42,000
my old Dodge van,

123
0:05:42.816,000 --> 0:05:44,000
my super-fantastic human being, Will,

124
0:05:45.15,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a great local nonprofit partner --

125
0:05:47.069,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they drive to the corner, there's a panhandler,

126
0:05:49.327,000 --> 0:05:51,000
they say, "Would you like to work for the day?"

127
0:05:51.605,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The panhandler says, "Yes,"

128
0:05:52.925,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and Will says, "Great! I'll be back in six weeks to pick you up."

129
0:05:56.097,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:57.144,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It wouldn't work.

131
0:05:58.319,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's really important that we have that agility in our program.

132
0:06:02.582,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And they do the paperwork,

133
0:06:04.28,000 --> 0:06:05,000
they do the insurance,

134
0:06:05.828,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they do all of the other forms that I can't do quickly.

135
0:06:09.61,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We pay our panhandlers nine dollars an hour.

136
0:06:12.165,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We feed them once at the jobsite.

137
0:06:14.07,000 --> 0:06:15,000
At the end of the day,

138
0:06:15.247,000 --> 0:06:17,000
our old Dodge van takes them right back to St. Martin's,

139
0:06:17.923,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and they get connected with counseling services.

140
0:06:21.603,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So far,

141
0:06:22.809,000 --> 0:06:24,000
with the pilot program and a couple days a week,

142
0:06:25.315,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and a fantastic human being and a Dodge van,

143
0:06:28.002,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we've cleaned up 400 city blocks in the city of Albuquerque.

144
0:06:31.422,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We've picked up over 117,000 pounds of trash, weeds and litter.

145
0:06:35.929,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I don't know if you've ever weighed a tumbleweed,

146
0:06:38.276,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but they don't weigh much,

147
0:06:39.581,000 --> 0:06:42,000
so you can imagine the volume of material that we've picked up.

148
0:06:43.409,000 --> 0:06:45,000
My city has 6,000 employees,

149
0:06:47.161,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and none better than my solid waste department.

150
0:06:50.209,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We send our trucks out at the end of the day,

151
0:06:52.381,000 --> 0:06:54,000
they help the panhandlers put into the truck

152
0:06:54.637,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the material they've picked up during the day,

153
0:06:56.904,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and we take it to the landfill.

154
0:06:58.431,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I'm lucky that I have city employees

155
0:07:00.219,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that are willing to work side by side with our panhandlers.

156
0:07:03.184,000 --> 0:07:05,000
They're lifting up our city while lifting up their lives.

157
0:07:06.194,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And like anything else -- listen, it takes resources.

158
0:07:09.284,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But the good news is it doesn't take much.

159
0:07:13.001,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We started with an old van,

160
0:07:14.864,000 --> 0:07:15,000
a super-fantastic human being,

161
0:07:16.626,000 --> 0:07:17,000
a great local nonprofit

162
0:07:17.944,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and $50,000.

163
0:07:20.468,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But we also had to have community trust.

164
0:07:22.658,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And fortunately, we had built that up in years prior to Better Way.

165
0:07:26.778,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We have a program called "Albuquerque Heading Home,"

166
0:07:29.312,000 --> 0:07:32,000
a Housing First model where we house the chronically homeless,

167
0:07:32.38,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and when I told my community we wanted to do that differently,

168
0:07:35.489,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I said there's a smart way to do the right thing.

169
0:07:38.616,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We have now housed 650 chronically homeless, medically vulnerable --

170
0:07:42.729,000 --> 0:07:44,000
frankly, most likely to die on the streets in our city.

171
0:07:46.177,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We commissioned our university, they studied it.

172
0:07:48.57,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We could tell the taxpayers, we can save you 31.6 percent

173
0:07:52.248,000 --> 0:07:55,000
over the cost of leaving someone to struggle for survival on the streets.

174
0:07:56.25,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We've now saved over five million dollars while housing 650 people.

175
0:08:00.272,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So we had that community trust,

176
0:08:02.263,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but we had to have a little bit more of an honest conversation also

177
0:08:05.502,000 --> 0:08:06,000
as a community,

178
0:08:07.013,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because we had to get people to understand

179
0:08:09.063,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that when they hand those five dollars out the window,

180
0:08:11.63,000 --> 0:08:13,000
they might actually be minimizing their opportunity

181
0:08:14.05,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to help the person in need, and here's why:

182
0:08:16.13,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that five dollars might go to buying some fast food today --

183
0:08:19.967,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a lot of times it goes to buying drugs and alcohol.

184
0:08:22.992,000 --> 0:08:23,000
That same five dollars,

185
0:08:24.167,000 --> 0:08:26,000
if you gave it to one of our shelters,

186
0:08:26.449,000 --> 0:08:27,000
could feed seven people today.

187
0:08:28.234,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And if you gave it to one of our local food banks or food pantries,

188
0:08:32.54,000 --> 0:08:34,000
we could actually feed 20 people with that money.

189
0:08:37.711,000 --> 0:08:41,000
People ask,"Well, Albuquerque is 600,000 people -- million, metro --

190
0:08:42.583,000 --> 0:08:45,000
this wouldn't work in our city, we're too big, we're too small."

191
0:08:45.698,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I disagree; if you have one panhandler on one city block,

192
0:08:48.417,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you can do this.

193
0:08:49.597,000 --> 0:08:51,000
If you live in a city of eight-and-half million people,

194
0:08:52.239,000 --> 0:08:53,000
you can do this.

195
0:08:53.418,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It doesn't matter what you do.

196
0:08:54.919,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's not the work that you do, it's the dignity of the work.

197
0:08:57.805,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You could do anything.

198
0:08:58.987,000 --> 0:09:,000
So I think any city could do this.

199
0:09:01.111,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And people say to me,

200
0:09:02.334,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"Mayor, that's just a little too simple.

201
0:09:05.197,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It can't work that way."

202
0:09:07.305,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But I tell you what, friends:

203
0:09:08.878,000 --> 0:09:09,000
when you go to a street corner

204
0:09:10.345,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and you engage with a panhandler with dignity and respect,

205
0:09:13.297,000 --> 0:09:15,000
maybe for the first time in years, maybe in their life,

206
0:09:16.021,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and you tell them that you believe in them

207
0:09:18.1,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and that this is their city as much as it's your city,

208
0:09:20.796,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and that you actually need their help to make our place better,

209
0:09:25.587,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and you understand that this isn't the answer to all their problems,

210
0:09:28.929,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but at least it's a start,

211
0:09:30.871,000 --> 0:09:31,000
an amazing thing happens.

212
0:09:33.073,000 --> 0:09:36,000
When they get out on the jobsite and they start working together,

213
0:09:36.443,000 --> 0:09:37,000
you start seeing amazing things happen.

214
0:09:38.364,000 --> 0:09:41,000
They see teamwork; they see the fact that they can make a difference.

215
0:09:41.691,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And at the end of the day,

216
0:09:42.956,000 --> 0:09:44,000
when they get back to St. Martin's in that old Dodge van,

217
0:09:45.676,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they're much more likely to sign up for whatever services they need --

218
0:09:49.028,000 --> 0:09:51,000
substance abuse, mental health counseling, you name it.

219
0:09:51.771,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So far with our pilot program,

220
0:09:54.215,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we've offered about 1,700 days of day work.

221
0:09:57.108,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We've connected 216 people to permanent employment opportunities.

222
0:10:01.687,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Twenty people actually qualified for our Housing First model,

223
0:10:05.382,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Heading Home,

224
0:10:06.584,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and they've been housed.

225
0:10:07.767,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And over 150 people have been connected

226
0:10:09.95,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to mental health substance abuse services

227
0:10:12.792,000 --> 0:10:13,000
through There's a Better Way.

228
0:10:14.512,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This is me just two weeks ago,

229
0:10:18.758,000 --> 0:10:19,000
at St. Martin's,

230
0:10:19.95,000 --> 0:10:2,000
doing our point-in-time survey

231
0:10:21.426,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that we do every two years.

232
0:10:23.369,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I'm interviewing a gentleman who's homeless, like we do,

233
0:10:26.806,000 --> 0:10:28,000
getting his information, figuring out where he's from,

234
0:10:29.574,000 --> 0:10:3,000
how he got there,

235
0:10:31.326,000 --> 0:10:32,000
what we can do to help him.

236
0:10:32.953,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And you notice he's holding the same sign that the guy was holding in 2015,

237
0:10:36.948,000 --> 0:10:38,000
same sign I walked out with here today.

238
0:10:39.987,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So you have to ask yourself: Is it really making a difference?

239
0:10:42.983,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Absolutely it's making a difference.

240
0:10:45.016,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Albuquerque is now one of the national leaders

241
0:10:47.698,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in combating some of the most stubborn and persistent social issues

242
0:10:50.948,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that we have.

243
0:10:52.123,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Combined with Albuquerque Heading Home,

244
0:10:54.026,000 --> 0:10:55,000
the Better Way program,

245
0:10:55.241,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Albuquerque has reduced unsheltered homelessness in our city

246
0:10:58.205,000 --> 0:10:59,000
by 80 percent last year.

247
0:11:01.223,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Since I took over as mayor,

248
0:11:02.561,000 --> 0:11:05,000
we've been able to reduce the chronic homeless population in our city

249
0:11:05.849,000 --> 0:11:06,000
by 40 percent.

250
0:11:07.95,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And by HUD's definition,

251
0:11:09.289,000 --> 0:11:1,000
we've gotten to functional zero,

252
0:11:11.006,000 --> 0:11:13,000
which means we've literally ended veteran homelessness

253
0:11:13.678,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in the city of Albuquerque,

254
0:11:15.042,000 --> 0:11:16,000
by being intentional.

255
0:11:16.496,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Applause)

256
0:11:22.777,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So I'm happy to report that other cities are hearing about this,

257
0:11:26.012,000 --> 0:11:27,000
other mayors are calling us --

258
0:11:27.58,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas --

259
0:11:30.327,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and are now starting to implement programs

260
0:11:32.887,000 --> 0:11:35,000
where they bring the dignity of work to the equation.

261
0:11:35.986,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And I can't wait to learn from them.

262
0:11:37.865,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I can't wait to see what their experiment looks like,

263
0:11:40.566,000 --> 0:11:42,000
what their pilot project looks like,

264
0:11:42.625,000 --> 0:11:44,000
so we can start taking a collective approach nationally

265
0:11:45.222,000 --> 0:11:46,000
through the dignity of work.

266
0:11:46.622,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And I want to commend them --

267
0:11:48.027,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the mayors, their communities, their nonprofits --

268
0:11:50.462,000 --> 0:11:51,000
for the work that they're doing.

269
0:11:52.674,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So who's next?

270
0:11:55.313,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Are you and your city ready to step up?

271
0:11:58.59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Are you ready to think differently about these persistent social issues?

272
0:12:02.78,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Are you ready to lift people up in your community

273
0:12:05.12,000 --> 0:12:06,000
through the dignity of work,

274
0:12:07.073,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and make your city profoundly better in many ways?

275
0:12:11.031,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Well, if you are, my friends, I promise you there is a better way.

276
0:12:14.353,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Thank you.

277
0:12:15.535,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Applause)

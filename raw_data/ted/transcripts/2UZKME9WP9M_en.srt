1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to tell you a story from 200 years ago.

2
0:00:16.792,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In 1820, French astronomer Alexis Bouvard

3
0:00:20.083,000 --> 0:00:25,000
almost became the second person in human history to discover a planet.

4
0:00:25.333,000 --> 0:00:28,000
He'd been tracking the position of Uranus across the night sky

5
0:00:28.667,000 --> 0:00:29,000
using old star catalogs,

6
0:00:30.417,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and it didn't quite go around the Sun

7
0:00:32.75,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the way that his predictions said it should.

8
0:00:35.208,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Sometimes it was a little too fast,

9
0:00:37.333,000 --> 0:00:38,000
sometimes a little too slow.

10
0:00:39.042,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Bouvard knew that his predictions were perfect.

11
0:00:42.792,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So it had to be that those old star catalogs were bad.

12
0:00:46.083,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He told astronomers of the day,

13
0:00:48.167,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"Do better measurements."

14
0:00:50.625,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So they did.

15
0:00:51.917,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Astronomers spent the next two decades

16
0:00:54.083,000 --> 0:00:58,000
meticulously tracking the position of Uranus across the sky,

17
0:00:58.167,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but it still didn't fit Bouvard's predictions.

18
0:01:01.875,000 --> 0:01:03,000
By 1840, it had become obvious.

19
0:01:04.042,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The problem was not with those old star catalogs,

20
0:01:07.125,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the problem was with the predictions.

21
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And astronomers knew why.

22
0:01:11.542,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They realized that there must be a distant, giant planet

23
0:01:15.75,000 --> 0:01:16,000
just beyond the orbit of Uranus

24
0:01:17.458,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that was tugging along at that orbit,

25
0:01:19.292,000 --> 0:01:21,000
sometimes pulling it along a bit too fast,

26
0:01:21.875,000 --> 0:01:22,000
sometimes holding it back.

27
0:01:24.75,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Must have been frustrating back in 1840

28
0:01:26.792,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to see these gravitational effects of this distant, giant planet

29
0:01:30.208,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but not yet know how to actually find it.

30
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Trust me, it's really frustrating.

31
0:01:36.083,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:37.583,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But in 1846, another French astronomer,

33
0:01:39.833,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Urbain Le Verrier,

34
0:01:41.167,000 --> 0:01:42,000
worked through the math

35
0:01:42.458,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and figured out how to predict the location of the planet.

36
0:01:45.208,000 --> 0:01:47,000
He sent his prediction to the Berlin observatory,

37
0:01:48.208,000 --> 0:01:49,000
they opened up their telescope

38
0:01:49.667,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and in the very first night they found this faint point of light

39
0:01:52.75,000 --> 0:01:54,000
slowly moving across the sky

40
0:01:54.875,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and discovered Neptune.

41
0:01:56.167,000 --> 0:02:,000
It was this close on the sky to Le Verrier's predicted location.

42
0:02:01.875,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The story of prediction and discrepancy and new theory

43
0:02:06.417,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and triumphant discoveries is so classic

44
0:02:09.5,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and Le Verrier became so famous from it,

45
0:02:12.417,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that people tried to get in on the act right away.

46
0:02:15.167,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In the last 163 years,

47
0:02:17.708,000 --> 0:02:22,000
dozens of astronomers have used some sort of alleged orbital discrepancy

48
0:02:23.333,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to predict the existence of some new planet in the solar system.

49
0:02:28.292,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They have always been wrong.

50
0:02:32.125,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The most famous of these erroneous predictions

51
0:02:34.333,000 --> 0:02:35,000
came from Percival Lowell,

52
0:02:35.792,000 --> 0:02:39,000
who was convinced that there must be a planet just beyond Uranus and Neptune,

53
0:02:40.542,000 --> 0:02:41,000
messing with those orbits.

54
0:02:42.542,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And so when Pluto was discovered in 1930

55
0:02:45.125,000 --> 0:02:46,000
at the Lowell Observatory,

56
0:02:46.792,000 --> 0:02:5,000
everybody assumed that it must be the planet that Lowell had predicted.

57
0:02:51.25,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They were wrong.

58
0:02:53.667,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It turns out, Uranus and Neptune are exactly where they're supposed to be.

59
0:02:57.792,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It took 100 years,

60
0:02:59.375,000 --> 0:03:,000
but Bouvard was eventually right.

61
0:03:01.167,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Astronomers needed to do better measurements.

62
0:03:04.792,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And when they did,

63
0:03:06.583,000 --> 0:03:09,000
those better measurements had turned out that

64
0:03:09.792,000 --> 0:03:14,000
there is no planet just beyond the orbit of Uranus and Neptune

65
0:03:14.833,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and Pluto is thousands of times too small

66
0:03:17.542,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to have any effect on those orbits at all.

67
0:03:20.208,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So even though Pluto turned out not to be the planet

68
0:03:23.875,000 --> 0:03:24,000
it was originally thought to be,

69
0:03:25.5,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it was the first discovery of what is now known to be

70
0:03:28.958,000 --> 0:03:32,000
thousands of tiny, icy objects in orbit beyond the planets.

71
0:03:33.708,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Here you can see the orbits of Jupiter,

72
0:03:36.625,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,

73
0:03:39.167,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and in that little circle in the very center is the Earth

74
0:03:42.208,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and the Sun and almost everything that you know and love.

75
0:03:45.208,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And those yellow circles at the edge

76
0:03:47.042,000 --> 0:03:49,000
are these icy bodies out beyond the planets.

77
0:03:49.833,000 --> 0:03:51,000
These icy bodies are pushed and pulled

78
0:03:52.125,000 --> 0:03:54,000
by the gravitational fields of the planets

79
0:03:54.292,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in entirely predictable ways.

80
0:03:56.833,000 --> 0:04:,000
Everything goes around the Sun exactly the way it is supposed to.

81
0:04:02.958,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Almost.

82
0:04:04.25,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So in 2003,

83
0:04:06.333,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I discovered what was at the time

84
0:04:08.25,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the most distant known object in the entire solar system.

85
0:04:11.958,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's hard not to look at that lonely body out there

86
0:04:14.458,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and say, oh yeah, sure, so Lowell was wrong,

87
0:04:16.542,000 --> 0:04:17,000
there was no planet just beyond Neptune,

88
0:04:18.5,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but this, this could be a new planet.

89
0:04:21.083,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The real question we had was,

90
0:04:22.583,000 --> 0:04:24,000
what kind of orbit does it have around the Sun?

91
0:04:24.917,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Does it go in a circle around the Sun

92
0:04:26.875,000 --> 0:04:27,000
like a planet should?

93
0:04:28.458,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Or is it just a typical member of this icy belt of bodies

94
0:04:32.375,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that got a little bit tossed outward and it's now on its way back in?

95
0:04:36.458,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is precisely the question

96
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the astronomers were trying to answer about Uranus 200 years ago.

97
0:04:43.625,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They did it by using overlooked observations of Uranus

98
0:04:47.417,000 --> 0:04:49,000
from 91 years before its discovery

99
0:04:49.792,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to figure out its entire orbit.

100
0:04:51.542,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We couldn't go quite that far back,

101
0:04:53.583,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but we did find observations of our object from 13 years earlier

102
0:04:58.208,000 --> 0:05:,000
that allowed us to figure out how it went around the Sun.

103
0:05:00.917,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So the question is,

104
0:05:02.208,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is it in a circular orbit around the Sun, like a planet,

105
0:05:04.958,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or is it on its way back in,

106
0:05:06.375,000 --> 0:05:07,000
like one of these typical icy bodies?

107
0:05:08.292,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And the answer is

108
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:11,000
no.

109
0:05:11.292,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It has a massively elongated orbit

110
0:05:14.083,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that takes 10,000 years to go around the Sun.

111
0:05:18.042,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We named this object Sedna

112
0:05:20.083,000 --> 0:05:21,000
after the Inuit goddess of the sea,

113
0:05:21.958,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in honor of the cold, icy places where it spends all of its time.

114
0:05:26.042,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We now know that Sedna,

115
0:05:27.667,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it's about a third the size of Pluto

116
0:05:29.458,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and it's a relatively typical member

117
0:05:31.542,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of those icy bodies out beyond Neptune.

118
0:05:34.375,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Relatively typical, except for this bizarre orbit.

119
0:05:38.25,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You might look at this orbit and say,

120
0:05:40.042,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"Yeah, that's bizarre, 10,000 years to go around the Sun,"

121
0:05:42.792,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but that's not really the bizarre part.

122
0:05:44.75,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The bizarre part is that in those 10,000 years,

123
0:05:46.965,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Sedna never comes close to anything else in the solar system.

124
0:05:50.958,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Even at its closest approach to the Sun,

125
0:05:53.292,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Sedna is further from Neptune

126
0:05:55.625,000 --> 0:05:57,000
than Neptune is from the Earth.

127
0:05:59.042,000 --> 0:06:01,000
If Sedna had had an orbit like this,

128
0:06:01.208,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that kisses the orbit of Neptune once around the Sun,

129
0:06:03.833,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that would have actually been really easy to explain.

130
0:06:06.875,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That would have just been an object

131
0:06:08.667,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that had been in a circular orbit around the Sun

132
0:06:10.958,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in that region of icy bodies,

133
0:06:12.417,000 --> 0:06:14,000
had gotten a little bit too close to Neptune one time,

134
0:06:14.965,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and then got slingshot out and is now on its way back in.

135
0:06:19.333,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But Sedna never comes close to anything known in the solar system

136
0:06:24.083,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that could have given it that slingshot.

137
0:06:26.5,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Neptune can't be responsible,

138
0:06:28.542,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but something had to be responsible.

139
0:06:31.667,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This was the first time since 1845

140
0:06:34.625,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that we saw the gravitational effects of something in the outer solar system

141
0:06:39.583,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and didn't know what it was.

142
0:06:42.208,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I actually thought I knew what the answer was.

143
0:06:45.125,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Sure, it could have been some distant, giant planet

144
0:06:49.167,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in the outer solar system,

145
0:06:50.458,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but by this time, that idea was so ridiculous

146
0:06:52.833,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and had been so thoroughly discredited

147
0:06:54.708,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that I didn't take it very seriously.

148
0:06:56.542,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But 4.5 billion years ago,

149
0:06:57.833,000 --> 0:07:01,000
when the Sun formed in a cocoon of hundreds of other stars,

150
0:07:02.708,000 --> 0:07:03,000
any one of those stars

151
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
could have gotten just a little bit too close to Sedna

152
0:07:06.667,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and perturbed it onto the orbit that it has today.

153
0:07:10.667,000 --> 0:07:13,000
When that cluster of stars dissipated into the galaxy,

154
0:07:14.583,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the orbit of Sedna would have been left as a fossil record

155
0:07:18.375,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of this earliest history of the Sun.

156
0:07:20.875,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I was so excited by this idea,

157
0:07:22.708,000 --> 0:07:23,000
by the idea that we could look

158
0:07:24.208,000 --> 0:07:26,000
at the fossil history of the birth of the Sun,

159
0:07:26.458,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that I spent the next decade

160
0:07:28.083,000 --> 0:07:3,000
looking for more objects with orbits like Sedna.

161
0:07:30.833,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In that ten-year period, I found zero.

162
0:07:34.292,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:35.333,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But my colleagues, Chad Trujillo and Scott Sheppard, did a better job,

164
0:07:38.875,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and they have now found several objects with orbits like Sedna,

165
0:07:41.917,000 --> 0:07:42,000
which is super exciting.

166
0:07:43.708,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But what's even more interesting

167
0:07:45.256,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is that they found that all these objects

168
0:07:48.042,000 --> 0:07:51,000
are not only on these distant, elongated orbits,

169
0:07:51.958,000 --> 0:07:56,000
they also share a common value of this obscure orbital parameter

170
0:07:57.333,000 --> 0:08:,000
that in celestial mechanics we call argument of perihelion.

171
0:08:02.25,000 --> 0:08:04,000
When they realized it was clustered in argument of perihelion,

172
0:08:05.208,000 --> 0:08:06,000
they immediately jumped up and down,

173
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
saying it must be caused by a distant, giant planet out there,

174
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
which is really exciting, except it makes no sense at all.

175
0:08:13.083,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Let me try to explain it to you why with an analogy.

176
0:08:15.625,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Imagine a person walking down a plaza

177
0:08:18.958,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and looking 45 degrees to his right side.

178
0:08:23.125,000 --> 0:08:25,000
There's a lot of reasons that might happen,

179
0:08:25.208,000 --> 0:08:26,000
it's super easy to explain, no big deal.

180
0:08:27.167,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Imagine now many different people,

181
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
all walking in different directions across the plaza,

182
0:08:32.917,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but all looking 45 degrees to the direction that they're moving.

183
0:08:36.208,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Everybody's moving in different directions,

184
0:08:38.25,000 --> 0:08:4,000
everybody's looking in different directions,

185
0:08:40.417,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but they're all looking 45 degrees to the direction of motion.

186
0:08:43.75,000 --> 0:08:44,000
What could cause something like that?

187
0:08:46.917,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I have no idea.

188
0:08:48.208,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's very difficult to think of any reason that that would happen.

189
0:08:51.958,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:53.333,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And this is essentially what that clustering

191
0:08:56.208,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in argument of perihelion was telling us.

192
0:08:59.625,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Scientists were generally baffled and they assumed it must just be a fluke

193
0:09:03.208,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and some bad observations.

194
0:09:04.583,000 --> 0:09:05,000
They told the astronomers,

195
0:09:06.375,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"Do better measurements."

196
0:09:08.792,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I actually took a very careful look at those measurements, though,

197
0:09:11.917,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and they were right.

198
0:09:13.208,000 --> 0:09:14,000
These objects really did all share

199
0:09:15.125,000 --> 0:09:17,000
a common value of argument of perihelion,

200
0:09:17.625,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and they shouldn't.

201
0:09:19.042,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Something had to be causing that.

202
0:09:23.125,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The final piece of the puzzle came into place in 2016,

203
0:09:27.458,000 --> 0:09:29,000
when my colleague, Konstantin Batygin,

204
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
who works three doors down from me, and I

205
0:09:32.667,000 --> 0:09:34,000
realized that the reason that everybody was baffled

206
0:09:35.292,000 --> 0:09:39,000
was because argument of perihelion was only part of the story.

207
0:09:40.042,000 --> 0:09:42,000
If you look at these objects the right way,

208
0:09:42.125,000 --> 0:09:46,000
they are all actually lined up in space in the same direction,

209
0:09:46.208,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and they're all tilted in space in the same direction.

210
0:09:49.958,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's as if all those people on the plaza are all walking in the same direction

211
0:09:54.333,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and they're all looking 45 degrees to the right side.

212
0:09:57.792,000 --> 0:09:58,000
That's easy to explain.

213
0:09:59.083,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They're all looking at something.

214
0:10:01.583,000 --> 0:10:05,000
These objects in the outer solar system are all reacting to something.

215
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But what?

216
0:10:08.75,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Konstantin and I spent a year

217
0:10:11.75,000 --> 0:10:15,000
trying to come up with any explanation other than a distant, giant planet

218
0:10:16.583,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in the outer solar system.

219
0:10:17.875,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We did not want to be the 33rd and 34th people in history to propose this planet

220
0:10:23.333,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to yet again be told we were wrong.

221
0:10:26.792,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But after a year,

222
0:10:28.583,000 --> 0:10:29,000
there was really no choice.

223
0:10:29.917,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We could come up with no other explanation

224
0:10:32.083,000 --> 0:10:34,000
other than that there is a distant,

225
0:10:34.625,000 --> 0:10:37,000
massive planet on an elongated orbit,

226
0:10:37.917,000 --> 0:10:39,000
inclined to the rest of the solar system,

227
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that is forcing these patterns for these objects

228
0:10:42.75,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in the outer solar system.

229
0:10:44.792,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Guess what else a planet like this does.

230
0:10:46.958,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Remember that strange orbit of Sedna,

231
0:10:48.833,000 --> 0:10:5,000
how it was kind of pulled away from the Sun in one direction?

232
0:10:51.792,000 --> 0:10:54,000
A planet like this would make orbits like that all day long.

233
0:10:55.542,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We knew we were onto something.

234
0:10:57.875,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So this brings us to today.

235
0:11:00.875,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We are basically 1845, Paris.

236
0:11:05.083,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:06.292,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We see the gravitational effects of a distant, giant planet,

238
0:11:11.625,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and we are trying to work out the calculations

239
0:11:13.875,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to tell us where to look, to point our telescopes,

240
0:11:16.917,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to find this planet.

241
0:11:18.208,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We've done massive suites of computer simulations,

242
0:11:21.292,000 --> 0:11:22,000
massive months of analytic calculations

243
0:11:23.25,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and here's what I can tell you so far.

244
0:11:25.833,000 --> 0:11:28,000
First, this planet, which we call Planet Nine,

245
0:11:29.042,000 --> 0:11:31,000
because that's what it is,

246
0:11:32.75,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Planet Nine is six times the mass of the Earth.

247
0:11:36.042,000 --> 0:11:38,000
This is no slightly-smaller-than-Pluto,

248
0:11:38.292,000 --> 0:11:4,000
let's-all-argue-about- whether-it's-a-planet-or-not thing.

249
0:11:41.042,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This is the fifth largest planet in our entire solar system.

250
0:11:44.375,000 --> 0:11:47,000
For context, let me show you the sizes of the planets.

251
0:11:48.042,000 --> 0:11:52,000
In the back there, you can the massive Jupiter and Saturn.

252
0:11:52.208,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Next to them, a little bit smaller, Uranus and Neptune.

253
0:11:54.875,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Up in the corner, the terrestrial planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.

254
0:11:58.376,000 --> 0:11:59,000
You can even see that belt

255
0:11:59.75,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of icy bodies beyond Neptune, of which Pluto is a member,

256
0:12:02.917,000 --> 0:12:03,000
good luck figuring out which one it is.

257
0:12:04.799,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And here is Planet Nine.

258
0:12:08.583,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Planet Nine is big.

259
0:12:11.042,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Planet Nine is so big,

260
0:12:12.333,000 --> 0:12:14,000
you should probably wonder why haven't we found it yet.

261
0:12:14.958,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Well, Planet Nine is big,

262
0:12:16.25,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but it's also really, really far away.

263
0:12:18.375,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It's something like 15 times further away than Neptune.

264
0:12:23.083,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And that makes it about 50,000 times fainter than Neptune.

265
0:12:26.375,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And also, the sky is a really big place.

266
0:12:29.333,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We've narrowed down where we think it is

267
0:12:31.5,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to a relatively small area of the sky,

268
0:12:34.042,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but it would still take us years

269
0:12:35.958,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to systematically cover the area of the sky

270
0:12:38.333,000 --> 0:12:39,000
with the large telescopes that we need

271
0:12:40.208,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to see something that's this far away and this faint.

272
0:12:43.542,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Luckily, we might not have to.

273
0:12:46.708,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Just like Bouvard used unrecognized observations of Uranus

274
0:12:51.625,000 --> 0:12:53,000
from 91 years before its discovery,

275
0:12:54.417,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I bet that there are unrecognized images

276
0:12:58.208,000 --> 0:13:,000
that show the location of Planet Nine.

277
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It's going to be a massive computational undertaking

278
0:13:05.083,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to go through all of the old data

279
0:13:07.417,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and pick out that one faint moving planet.

280
0:13:11.292,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But we're underway.

281
0:13:12.667,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And I think we're getting close.

282
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So I would say, get ready.

283
0:13:17.542,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We are not going to match Le Verrier's

284
0:13:21.542,000 --> 0:13:22,000
"make a prediction,

285
0:13:22.833,000 --> 0:13:23,000
have the planet found in a single night

286
0:13:24.75,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that close to where you predicted it" record.

287
0:13:26.958,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But I do bet that within the next couple of years

288
0:13:30.917,000 --> 0:13:32,000
some astronomer somewhere

289
0:13:33.333,000 --> 0:13:35,000
will find a faint point of light,

290
0:13:35.583,000 --> 0:13:37,000
slowly moving across the sky

291
0:13:37.875,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and triumphantly announce the discovery of a new,

292
0:13:41.208,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and quite possibly not the last,

293
0:13:43.667,000 --> 0:13:45,000
real planet of our solar system.

294
0:13:46.167,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Thank you.

295
0:13:47.458,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Applause)
